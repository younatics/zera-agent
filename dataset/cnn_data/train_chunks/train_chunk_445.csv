"Elliot Rodger stood in the doorway, talking to sheriff's deputies who had come to check on his welfare, and worried that his plan to kill was over. Last month, officers visited Rodger, 22, who they say killed six people and himself Friday night, at his apartment in Isla Vista, California. ""I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,"" Rodger wrote toward the end of a 137-page account of his life. ""If that was the case, the police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. ""I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that."" The manifesto, titled ""My Twisted World,"" was obtained by CNN affiliate KEYT. ""It was apparent he was very mentally disturbed,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said, referring to the contents of the autobiography. So disturbed that someone from a mental health agency, after consulting with one of Rodger's relatives, requested police check on his welfare April 30, Brown said. Rodger's family contacted police after discovering social media posts about suicide and killing people, family spokesman and attorney Alan Shifman told reporters Saturday. Brown said Rodger told deputies it was a misunderstanding and that he was not going to hurt anyone or himself. Rodger said he was having troubles with his social life. ""He was articulate. He was polite. He was timid,"" Brown told CNN on Sunday. There was nothing in his behavior to suggest he was violent, and the deputies ""determined he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary hold,"" Brown said. Rodger wrote that a wave of relief came over him when the deputies left.  ""If they had demanded to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was all over."" After that, Rodger wrote, he kept one of his guns and some loaded magazines near him so if police came back to his apartment, he would try to shoot them and escape.  ""Thankfully, all suspicion of me was dropped after I took down the videos from Youtube, and the police never came back."" ""It was all because of the videos. I must have expressed too much anger in them. I immediately took most of them off of Youtube, and planned to reupload them a few days before the Day of Retribution."" Rodger uploaded a video Friday, calling it his last. Sheriff: Plan took a year . The angst leading up to Friday's evening of horror was years in the making. The plan to kill many people apparently had come together in the past year, Brown said. Rodger was frustrated by his short stature, his parents' divorce and his lack of success with women -- and chronicled his perceived misfortunes in his manifesto. He picked Friday to launch a killing rampage, outlined later by police. It started at his own home in Isla Vista, near the scenic beaches of Southern California. Rodger stabbed three men to death at his home. They are Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, and George Chen, 19, both of San Jose, and Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office confirmed Sunday. They were students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Sheriff's Office said. Hong and Chen were ""listed on the lease for the apartment as tenants, along with Rodger,"" the Sheriff's Office said. Rodger then took his handguns and went to the Alpha Phi sorority house near UC Santa Barbara campus; he hinted at the carnage he'd inflict at the sorority house in the YouTube video called ""Retribution."" ""On the day of retribution I'm going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB,"" he said in the video. ""I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you."" On Friday night, sorority members heard loud knocking on the front door for several minutes -- but nobody answered. Minutes later, Rodger sprayed bullets at the house from across the street, Brown said. Witness Kyle Sullivan saw three young women lying on the front lawn. ""There was a young girl, laying right here. And she was -- I could tell immediately she was gone,"" said Sullivan, 19. ""I saw a gunshot wound to her abdomen, also one to her side and one through her head."" She wasn't alone. ""There was a girl right here and she was really struggling. You could tell she was barely able to move her eyes and just moving her arms slightly,"" Sullivan said. ""And there was another girl right here. You could tell she was lying down crouched. She was still conscious, talking."" By the end of the night, two of the three young women had died -- Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19. Both were students at UC Santa Barbara. Delta Delta Delta said on its Twitter page Sunday that it mourned the loss of two of its sisters. ""Tri Delta is saddened by the tragic loss of two members at UCSB. Our thoughts are with their family, friends, and Gamma Theta Chapter,"" the message said. Alpha Phi posted on its Facebook page Saturday that ""all our members are safe."" Rampage continues . Rodger then zoomed around town in a black BMW, stopping at a delicatessen where he shot and killed Christopher Martinez, another UC Santa Barbara student. Exactly why, no one knows for sure. Rodger got back in his car, and the killing rampage continued. He dashed around town, reportedly driving down the wrong side of the road so he could fire out the driver's side window near the sidewalk. He shot at two people on the sidewalk, pulled a handgun on a woman and fired some more, Brown said. He encountered a sheriff's deputy who was on foot and exchanged gunfire. Witness Ian Papa said he was inches away on the street when the gunman's car sped up and struck two bicyclists. ""It happened so fast,"" he said. ""I had no time to react. I jumped on the sidewalk and I see a man on a BMW, his body inside the windshield and glass broken everywhere. ... I almost wanted to break into tears."" The nightmare finally ended after Rodger slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head, police said. By the time the melee was over, six victims were dead, 13 were injured, and a quiet beachfront community was left to wonder how this could happen -- and whether anyone could have prevented it. In the nearly seven-minute video posted Friday, Rodger rants about women who ignored or rejected him over the past eight years, ""since I hit puberty."" ""Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge,"" he says in what he calls his last video. ""You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it."" He specifically criticized sorority members. Unused ammo . It's unclear what Rodger might have done had he not wrecked his car.  Inside the wrecked BMW, Brown said, police found three handguns -- all legally purchased -- and more than 400 rounds of unused ammunition. Brown said the guns were purchased the firearms over the past year in three different cities. Martinez's father, Richard, said some politicians and the National Rifle Association are also to blame for his son's death. ""Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA,"" he said. ""They talk about gun rights -- what about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity stop?"" Rodger suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue and was under the care of a variety of health care professionals, Brown said. But there was no indication he had been committed to a mental health facility. Rodger passed the background check needed to buy the firearm used in the shooting, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. The official said nothing had been found in the gun trace to indicate Rodger should have been disqualified. Law enforcement officers were searching the separate homes of the suspect's mother and father Sunday, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The officers were from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the source said. The manifesto . In the manuscript of his life's story, Rodger often mentioned feeling slighted or inferior, such as when he was denied entry on an amusement park ride at age 6 while other boys his age got to go on. ""Being denied entry on a simple amusement park ride due to my height may seem like only a small injustice, but it was big for me at time,"" Rodger wrote. ""Little did I know, this injustice was very small indeed compared to all the things I'll be denied in the future because of my height."" He described his parents' divorce as a devastating, ""life-changing event,"" but said he gained more respect for his father after he quickly acquired a girlfriend. ""Males who can easily find female mates garner more respect from their fellow men, even children,"" Rodger wrote. ""How ironic is it that my father, one of those men who could easily find a girlfriend, has a son who would struggle all his life to find a girlfriend."" But the overarching theme of the manifesto focuses on his frustrations with women. ""My orchestration of the Day of Retribution is my attempt to do everything, in my power, to destroy everything I cannot have,"" Rodger wrote. ""All of those beautiful girls I've desired so much in my life, but can never have because they despise and loathe me, I will destroy. All of those popular people who live hedonistic lives of pleasure, I will destroy, because they never accepted me as one of them. I will kill them all and make them suffer, just as they have made me suffer. It is only fair."" Who's the man behind the rampage .","Names of three other victims released .

"(CNN)Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in April have been converted to Islam and married off. Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group. The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world. In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials. ""Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?""  Abubakar Shekau said. ""They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran."" Shekau slammed reports of their planned release. ""We married them off. They are in their marital homes,"" he said, chuckling. The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram. ""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,"" he said of the negotiator. It wasn't clear when the video was made. Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said these assertions contradict those made in the group's talks with  the Nigerian government. Omeri said the government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video. ""We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,"" Omeri said. ""Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight."" Nigeria said officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby. The ceasefire deal announced on October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad. That day passed without any signs of the girls. Boko Haram a growing challenge . In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more ""war, striking and killing with gun."" This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead. Days later,  the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria. Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said. For its part, Nigeria isn't backing down. It is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said Saturday. The military said  its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two states in the northeast that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram. Officials are ""studying"" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said. Boko Haram, whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state. The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government. As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children, and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

"The gunman who held hostages for more than 16 hours in a Sydney cafe was no stranger to police -- and was on bail for violent criminal offenses at the time of the siege. Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born refugee who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001, had ""a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters. ""It's pretty obvious that the perpetrator was a deeply disturbed individual,"" he said at a press conference Tuesday, adding that the 50-year-old was ""well known"" to federal and state police, as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. ""But I don't believe he was on a terror watch list at this time."" New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said authorities were investigating why Monis -- who was killed in the siege -- was at large, given his criminal background. ""We're all outraged that this guy was on the street,"" he told reporters. ""We need to understand why he was. We also need to understand why he wasn't picked up."" What we know, what we don't know . Accessory to murder, sex charges . The self-styled Muslim cleric, also known as Sheikh Haron, was facing dozens of charges at the time of the siege, including two counts of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, according to the Attorney General of New South Wales. Noleen Hayson Pal was found dead with multiple stab wounds in a stairwell, and her body had been set on fire, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. ""They should have put him away and thrown away the key,"" the dead woman's godfather, Ayyut Khalik, told NBC News. He said Monis used to beat Pal, forcing her to wear a hijab all the time and forbidding her from talking to ""outsiders."" Court documents show Monis was also facing 45 sex-related charges, including sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated indecent assault. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the initial charges, laid in May 2014, related to an alleged sexual assault on a woman in western Sydney in 2002, before other sex-related charges were added regarding six additional victims. Monis was using the name Mohammad Hassan Manteghi -- his birth name, according to Iran's state news agency IRNA -- and claimed to be a ""healer,"" according to the report. Monis also pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive ""poison pen"" letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died in Afghanistan, and was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. The letters were ""sadistic, wantonly cruel and deeply wounding,"" one High Court judge said at the time, according to CNN affiliate Seven News. But the criminal accusations against him began even before he came to Australia. Monis fled his homeland in 1995 while being sought for allegedly committing fraud, Iran's semi-official Fars News reported. A spokesperson at Iran's embassy in Canberra told CNN that Tehran had officially requested Monis's extradition but nothing had come of it. Monis had been granted political asylum in 2001 and had had no further contact with his birth country, the spokesperson said. Who were the victims? An extremist theology . Manny Conditsis, a lawyer who acted for Monis in relation to the accessory to murder and letter-writing charges, told CNN his former client had been a cleric in Shiite Iran, but had become critical of the Islamic Republic's government in the late 1990s, and fled to Australia ""because he was going to be killed."" He had left behind a wife and two children, who he believed Monis had not seen since. Throughout the 2000s, said Conditsis, Monis ""became sympathetic to what he perceived ... was the victimization of Muslims and Islamists around the world, and partly at least took up that cause."" His broader cause, he said, was lobbying governments around the world, particularly Australia, not to wage wars on Muslim soil. ""He was so blinded by that objective that it would seem he had lost sight of objectivity and rationality and acted in extreme ways,"" he said, describing his former client as ""intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent."" While older footage of Monis preaching shows him dressed in typical Shiite cleric's attire, in his social media posts, he appears to embrace a radical Sunni extremist theology. He used the Internet to spread extremist beliefs, garnering nearly 13,000 likes on his Facebook page. During the siege, Abbott said, the hostage-taker ""sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the (ISIS) death cult,"" Abbott said. On his website, which has now been taken down, there was a pledge of allegiance to the so-called Islamic State terror group. The site describes Monis as a Muslim cleric and activist based in Sydney who has ""continuously been under attack & false accusation by the Australian government & media since he started his political letter campaign from 2007."" There's a graphic photo of slain children at the top of the site. Under the image, it reads, ""This is an evidence for the terrorism of America and its allies including Australia. The result of their airstrikes."" A description on the site portrayed Monis as a victim of a political vendetta and compares him to Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who has claimed the sex crime allegations he faces are politically motivated. A YouTube video posted in November shows Monis standing on a street corner, chains draped over him, carrying a sign that says, ""I have been tortured in prison for my political letters."" Police have refused to comment on that accusation. His last tweet linked to his website, with a haunting message posted the day of his attack on the Sydney cafe: ""If we stay silent towards the criminals we cannot have a peaceful society. The more you fight with crime, the more peaceful you are."" Conditsis  told Australian public broadcaster ABC that Monis was an isolated figure who was probably acting alone. Crisis in a cafe . Monday's hostage situation began around 10 a.m. Hundreds of police officers, including snipers, took position around the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district. Australian media captured haunting images of hostages pressing their hands against the cafe's windows. They were reportedly taking turns holding a black flag with Arabic writing on it that said, ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God."" The man holding the hostages demanded to speak to Abbott. Police were monitoring social media because hostages appeared to be posting information about the man's demands. Hours into the crisis, at least five hostages managed to escape, running terrified toward police in riot gear. That made the hostage-taker furious, reported Chris Reason, a correspondent for CNN affiliate Seven Network. Reason said he could see the gunman become ""extremely agitated"" when he realized what had happened, and he ""started screaming orders"" at the remaining hostages. Gunfire erupted early Tuesday as police stormed the cafe where the gunman had been holding hostages. Two hostages were killed during the standoff. Police later announced that the siege was over and that the lone gunman had been killed.","Man Haron Monis had history of ""infatuation with extremism and mental instability,"" Abbott says .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down Friday and handed over power to the military, his nearly three decades of iron rule ended by a groundswell of popular protests that began January 25. In a somber, one-minute announcement on state television, Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation and said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will ""run the affairs of the country."" As Suleiman spoke, deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo. It was a moment they had sought throughout long, often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak's departure. It was a moment that many in the Arab world's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate. Chants of ""Egypt is free!"" and ""God is great!"" rose from the crowds, dizzy in the honeymoon of their success. Some waved Egyptian flags; others honked horns; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene. Two major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots, and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo. The state-run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks. ""It was a sense of liberation for me, for every Egyptian,"" said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei. ""For the first time, Egypt has a chance to be democratic, to be free, to have a sense of dignity, of freedom. So it's amazing. It's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime."" A source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak, 82, had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in 1981, when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat. The repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved Friday to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family, said Norbert Baerlocher, a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington. In a speech to the nation Thursday night, Mubarak had indicated that he was delegating authority to Suleiman but made no mention of resigning. Disappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number Friday in Cairo and in other major cities. By Friday night, the protesters got what they were seeking. But amid the euphoria, ElBaradei sounded a note of caution. ""We have challenges ahead of us,"" said the Nobel laureate, who some believe could emerge as Egypt's next leader. ""I think we need to not worry about retribution. Mubarak needs to go, and we need to look forward."" Amre Moussa, the Egyptian secretary-general of the Arab League, told CNN that the country should focus on instituting reforms and establishing democracy. Asked how long it would take for the government to lift the 30-year-old state-of-emergency laws, he said, ""The sooner the better ... six, seven months."" Asked whether he will run for office, Moussa demurred. ""That is not an issue to discuss today,"" he said. ""The time for such a question will come."" Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian activist who became a reluctant hero of the revolution but has made clear that he has no interest in becoming a political leader, predicted that history books would describe Mubarak as a dictator. Ghonim -- a Google executive on leave from his job whose Facebook page is credited with triggering the uprising -- was seized by security forces and held for 10 days. His powerful television interview after his release Monday galvanized the protesters in Tahrir Square. He said he had felt certain that Mubarak would be forced out after a revolt in Tunisia forced that country's leader to step down in January, and he said he believed the Egyptian military could be trusted to respect the demands of the protesters. Many protesters had been calling for Egypt's army, which is respected within the country, to take over as interim caretaker. Friday night, they voiced optimism that the military would pave the way for free and fair elections. Throughout the uprising, the military both responded to the protesters and defended Mubarak's regime. It showed signs Thursday that it was assuming a greater role when the supreme council met without Mubarak, who was then still the supreme commander of the armed forces. Friday, it issued a communique stating that Egypt's emergency laws, used by Mubarak throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand, would be lifted, but only when conditions allowed. After Mubarak stepped down, a military spokesman appeared on state television, expressing appreciation to the former president and saluting the ""martyrs,"" an apparent reference to those who died in the protests. Human Rights Watch has documented more than 300 deaths since the uprising began January 25. Many of the pitched battles between security forces and Mubarak's foes unfolded in the same places that were scenes of jubilation Friday night. But Friday's revelry could not push aside the looming uncertainty over what will come next in the Arab world's most populous nation and how Egypt's revolution, which succeeded on the 32nd anniversary of Iran's, might affect the region. Events in Egypt may extendfar beyond the country's borders, Moussa said. ""Winds of change are sweeping the Arab world and the Middle East,"" he said. In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said the people of this key U.S. ally have made it clear that ""nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day."" He praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition. Among other things, Egyptian authorities need to set about ""protecting the rights of Egypt's citizens, lifting the emergency law, revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible, and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free,"" Obama said. But two miles from the White House, at a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, said that the United States had invested billions of dollars over the years ""propping up that dictator"" and has little to show for it. ""Where do you think the money went? To a Swiss bank account,"" he said. ""It contributed to our debt, billions and billions of dollars, and all we get is chaos from it and instability."" A spokesman for Obama's predecessor said Friday that former President George W. Bush ""congratulates the people of Egypt for taking an important and impressive first step toward freedom."" But the U.S. government's applause for Egypt's step toward freedom and away from Mubarak differed markedly from its previous stance. At a joint news conference with Mubarak in April 2004 at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, he offered support for his Egyptian counterpart. ""Egypt is a strategic partner of the United States, and we value President Mubarak's years of effort on behalf of the peace and stability of the Middle East,"" Bush said. ""President Mubarak can be confident in my friendship and America's partnership as he moves forward to realize the hopes of his people."" Just where those hopes would lead was not clear in the heady hours after Mubarak's resignation. What was clear was that Mubarak's imposition of military rule broke with Egypt's 1971 constitution. The constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power. The first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily, the vice president steps into the top role. That is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday. The constitution states further that, if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled, the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held. Those elections, in turn, must occur within 60 days. In opting for a third way, which put all power in the hands of the military, the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable. A high-ranking Egyptian military official said the army's command was discussing whether to dismiss Mubarak's government and parliament and when the next election would be held. But some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military, which has suddenly become accountable for the nation. ""Suleiman's statement is the clearest indication thus far that the military has carried out a coup led by Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi,"" analysts with Stratfor, a global intelligence company, said in a statement. ""Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers,"" the statement said. ""The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts."" Amnesty International warned that Mubarak's departure did not mean an end to the police state. ""The repressive system that Egyptians have suffered under for three decades has not gone away and the state of emergency remains in place,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general. ""Those in power must grasp this opportunity to consign the systematic abuses of the past to history. Human rights reform must begin now."" CNN's Amir Ahmed, Nic Robertson, Kurt Muller and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","NEW: Moussa says it could take 7 months before state-of-emergency laws can be lifted .

"Another familiar Hollywood face bid farewell late Saturday -- actor Meshach Taylor. He died at age 67 at his Los Angeles area home, his agent Dede Binder said. Many may remember him from ""Designing Women,"" where he played assistant Anthony Bouvier. Taylor had fought a terminal illness and faded markedly in recent days. His wife, children, grandchildren and mother surrounded him as he passed away, Binder said. ""It is with love and gratitude that we sorrowfully announce that our darling, amazingly brilliant and dynamic, Meshach, the incredible father, husband, son and friend has begun his grand transition,"" the family said in a statement.

"(CNN)After thousands of deaths and months of futile attempts to avoid more in Ukraine's fight with pro-Russian rebels, leaders on both sides talked past each other Wednesday, with one saying direct negotiations were off the table and another suggesting that the war be settled with a duel. Igor Plotnitsky, leader of the self-declared separatist republic in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region, said he challenges Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to a one-on-one fight to end the monthslong conflict. Regardless of whether Plotnitsky's offer was sincere, it reflected a serious reality: A war that has spread misery in eastern Ukraine and heightened tensions between Russia and the West is still going on, despite a supposed ceasefire that the two sides signed two months ago. ""Let's follow the example of the ancient Slavic leaders and glorious Kazakh chiefs and clash in a fight,"" Plotnitsky said, adding that Poroshenko could pick the time and weapons, according to ITAR-Tass. ""The one who wins will dictate the terms to the opposite side."" Ukraine's government made no immediate public response. But Kiev did say that two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in clashes across eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. And Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Wednesday that Kiev would not negotiate directly with the rebels, arguing that a ceasefire deal already had been made and all that anyone needed to do was follow it. ""Fulfill the Minsk agreement if you want peace,"" Yatsenyuk said, according to state-run media outlet Ukrinfom. Minsk is the Belarus capital where the sides reached the deal. ""In order to guarantee reaching peace we need to negotiate in a format accepted by the whole world and, first of all, suitable for Ukraine,"" Yatsenyuk said. Pro-Russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern Ukraine since the spring, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. From mid-April to September 16 alone, the conflict had killed at least 3,500 people and injured at least 8,100 others, according to the United Nations. The sides reached a ceasefire agreement in September, but fighting has returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire, a British security source who has detailed knowledge of the matter told CNN earlier this month. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of supporting the rebels by sending Russian troops, weapons and supplies. Just last week, U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove, the commander of NATO forces in Europe, said that his government has seen Russian tanks, artillery, air defense systems and troops heading into Ukraine. A day earlier, Breedlove said Russia had moved ""forces that are capable of being nuclear"" into Crimea, which was Ukrainian territory until being folded into Russia on the heels of a government turnover earlier this year. Crimea borders southeastern Ukraine, where much of the current unrest is focused and into which Russian troops allegedly have moved. The United States and European countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its involvement in Ukraine. Russian officials have frequently denied claims their military has sent forces into eastern Ukraine to bolster the rebels. Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union. After months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in Kiev, Parliament ousted Yanukovych in February. Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. In April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Journalist Victoria Butenko and CNN's Brian Walker and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Leader of self-declared separatist republic in eastern Ukraine challenges Poroshenko .

"It should come as no surprise to anyone that New York's infrastructure wasn't up to Hurricane Sandy.  What happened in New York was not all that different than what's happened in other places hit by freakish weather events -- the infrastructure wasn't robust enough to withstand nature. It is not the first time it's happened here, and it won't be the last. The problems in New York stem from many factors. For a start, infrastructure investment here is no more a priority than it is in other places across the country: It's simply not something that voters want badly. When given a choice between investing in schools, health and housing or investing in sewers, tunnels or roads, the latter will always lose out. And that's not just the view of the politicians, but also of the constituents who keep them in office. Think about what happened after the bridge collapse in Minneapolis in 2007. The press was full of reports about the condition of our nation's bridges, and Washington was abuzz with new ideas for financing roadway infrastructure. More than five years later, our bridges remain in much the same poor condition they were in then, and the voices screaming for an infrastructure bank or other form of dedicated financing to upgrade them have been all but muted. Of course some of the mess we are witnessing in the metropolitan region is unique to us. For largely historical reasons, New York's power system is run by private utilities answerable to state regulators. Its subway system has also been run by the state -- in the form of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  -- ever since going bankrupt in the 1960s. So any criticism regarding the lack of investment or preparedness for a hurricane event, at least in terms of power or transit, needs to be aimed squarely at Albany, not at City Hall. News: New York divided over marathon plans . To be fair, the hard-working officials who have spent decades bringing the city subway system back to a state of good repair have done a decent job of it. Compared with the dark days of the 1970s, transit stations are cleaner, subway trains are newer, and reliability and predictability are up. But the funding allocated by the state for investment in the system is nowhere near enough to take a 100-year-old system and make it a resilient one -- resilient enough to withstand the pounding it received this week. No one should stand behind age as an excuse for vulnerability in infrastructure. Consider the case of London, a city whose infrastructure is -- in almost every respect -- even older than New York's. Yet over the last 25 years, London has grabbed one opportunity after another to bring its core infrastructure -- power, transport and water -- into the 21st century. In almost every aspect, the city's infrastructure is today more resilient than ours. What has London done in the last several decades to modernize its systems? To protect against flooding, a movable flood barrier was built in the Thames; in more than 100 closures, it has proven effective in protecting the city from major storm surge or tidal events. Electric power is now produced outside the city, rather than within its boundaries. A major new sewer line is being designed to run along the Thames, part of an ambitious plan to replace the Victorian-era sewers that carry much of the city's wastewater. Transit too has seen its share of investment, with dozens of extended and upgraded rail lines bringing life to formerly downtrodden urban neighborhoods and entirely new high-speed lines knitting together key commercial nodes across the city. The difference between the two cities is not money -- it's governance. New York City may control its streets, but it doesn't control its power system or its transit system. Unlike England, where investment decisions are made by the city in conjunction with the national government, when it comes to infrastructure we've got a bundle of intermediary state agencies and regulators deciding what's best for the city and how much investment it deserves -- and a bunch of state politicians circumscribing their ability to do so at every turn. New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities . Not all New York infrastructure is caught in the same bind. New York's acclaimed water system, devised by city engineers in the 19th century to bring water from the Catskills to the growing urban population, remains a model of how service delivery could be done. Well into its second century, it is controlled by the city in a businesslike fashion, its capital program underpinned by the ability to float bonds to secure needed investment. The result is that projects that contribute to the resilience of the city's water infrastructure, such as the Third Water Tunnel now under construction, get done purposefully and with minimal political interference. There are other reasons to be optimistic about our infrastructure future. Some 125 years ago, in March of 1888, the worst blizzard on record dumped more than 3 feet of snow on a paralyzed New York City.  Telecom and electric wires, newly strung up between all of the quickly industrializing city's buildings, collapsed and were rendered useless -- prompting a mandate to bury all cables from that point forward. The underground network that resulted from that storm is largely responsible for the extraordinarily high levels of reliability Manhattan's electric and telecom customers have enjoyed ever since. The question now is whether Sandy will stimulate similarly new ways of thinking about our infrastructure.  Will she energize what to date have been spotty efforts to prepare the city and its systems for sea level rise and storm surges? Will the money made available by Washington in disaster relief be used to sow the seeds for real change? Will the dislocation experienced by all focus sufficient attention on those state institutions that have been given the power to oversee the city's infrastructure but not the ability to finance it effectively? Let's hope Sandy brings more than shoreline devastation in her wake. With a little luck, even this terribly large storm cloud could turn out to have a silver lining.","Kate Ascher: New York's infrastructure wasn't strong enough to withstand the storm .

"Never in her worst nightmares did Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff imagine such a crushing soccer defeat, she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. ""My nightmares never got so bad, Christiane,"" she said through an interpreter. ""They never went that far. As a supporter, of course, I am deeply sorry because I share the same sorrow of all supporters. But I also know that we are a country that has one very peculiar feature. We rise to the challenge in the face of adversity. We are able to overcome."" Brazil, she said, will recover from this ""extremely painful situation.""

Tuesday's semi-final match against Germany was always going to be a tough challenge for the home side, but no one predicted the 7-1 thrashing that sent rival Germany to the finals. ""We came into this match without two of our main players, Neymar, a major attacker, and our captain, Thiago Silva."" Brazil's World Cup performance is important to Rousseff not only as a matter of national pride, but as a matter of politics. ""If we had won,"" one Brazilian told CNN's Isa Soares, ""the people would have forgotten all the money spent; at least now the realities are back in focus."" The country saw widespread anger and protests against what many viewed as excessive spending on stadiums and infrastructure for the World Cup. Rousseff, who is bidding for re-election this October, put a big emphasis on the World Cup as a chance for Brazil to prove itself on the world stage. ""One has to bear in mind that from all different aspects, the fact is that Brazil has organized and staged a World Cup, which I do believe is one of the world's best World Cups.

"At least 60 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded Sunday in a Lahore, Pakistan, suicide blast near the country's border with India, police said. A suicide bomber detonated his vest after a daily parade at the Wagah border crossing, police said. It appeared the bomber entered the parade area as people were leaving and set off an explosive vest near a checkpoint, police said. Spokesmen for two groups linked to the Pakistani Taliban -- Jundallah and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar -- separately claimed responsibility for the bombing, with the spokesman for the latter, Ehsanullah Ehsan, calling the Jundallah claim ""baseless."" Ehsan's statement promised more attacks. ""We will soon release the video of this attack,"" the statement said. ""This attack is the revenge of the killing of those innocent people who have been killed by Pakistan Army, particularly of those who have been killed in North Waziristan."" Footage from CNN affiliate GEO News showed authorities scrambling through the streets, some of them ferrying the injured on stretchers to ambulances. Many onlookers were crying as they spoke to reporters. More than 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of explosives were used in the blast, which was conducted by a male from 18 and 20 years old, Inspector General Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera of the Punjab police said. Some of the bomber's body parts were found at the scene, he said. The latest numbers of dead and wounded were reported Monday by Amin Wains, the Chief Capital Police Officer of Lahore. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his condolences to the families of the deceased, he tweeted shortly after condemning ""the dastardly act of terrorism."" Authorities were aware of threats of terrorism, and Pakistan's paramilitary security force, the Rangers, was prepared, but the crowds at the border were larger than normal so Rangers weren't able to check everyone as they departed the area, Sukhera said. Every evening for 55 years at the Wagah border crossing between Lahore and Amritsar, India, Pakistan's Rangers and India's Border Security Force take part in a lowering-of-the-flags ceremony before sunset. The ceremony, which ends with soldiers folding their countries' flags and shaking hands, draws attendees from both sides of the border, as well as international tourists. The ""beating retreat"" ceremony, as it's known, is postponed until Thursday, officials said.","The death toll rises to 60; the number of people wounded climbs to 110 .

"(CNN) -- Celebrities expressed their outrage at Sony Picture's decision to cancel plans to release ""The Interview"" on Christmas Day on Twitter. The news comes after many major theater owners canceled next week's screenings of the controversial film, which depicts the assassination of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. U.S. investigators appeared ready to blame North Korea for the crippling hack attack at Sony Pictures, which saw the leak of internal emails and personal information that escalated to a threat that people should avoid going to theaters where ""The Interview"" is playing. When the film was pulled, celebrities vented their disappointment and raised concerns about the precedent it would set for controversial films in the future. Actor Judd Apatow, a friend of one of the film's lead actors Seth Rogen, tweeted: ""I think it is disgraceful that these theaters are not showing The Interview. Will they pull any movie that gets an anonymous threat now? West Wing actor Rob Lowe, who also makes a cameo appearance in the film said: ""Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow."" Stand-up comedian Amy Schumer let it all out in expletives: ""No bulls*** though, this is seriously f***** and it's such a sad day for free speech. Frightening."" Actress Mia Farrow called Sony ""a disgrace"" and that ""the bad guys won"". Filmmmaker Michael Moore decided to use the opportunity to ask the hackers for a favor. He tweeted: ""Dear Sony Hackers: now that u run Hollywood, I'd also like less romantic comedies, fewer Michael Bay movies and no more Transformers."" He later added: ""Oh, hackers, one more thing - I lost like $180K on [my film] 'Canadian Bacon.' Can u do the opposite of what u just did & get it back IN to theaters?"" Meanwhile, Seth Rogen posted a review of the film earlier this week, but neither he nor James Franco addressed the controversy directly on social media.","Celebrities use social media to express outrage at decision to cancel plans to release controversial film .

"It would be an understatement to say that Pakistan is under attack. This week, the Pakistani Taliban bypassed all security checks at the country's largest airport in southern port city of Karachi. A few hours earlier, another affiliate of the Pakistani Taliban massacred nearly 30 members of Pakistan's minority Shiite community in Balochistan province. A few hours after the Karachi airport was reclaimed by Pakistan's security agencies, a suicide bomber rammed a truck into a military checkpoint in North Waziristan, close to the Afghanistan border, killing at least three soldiers. The attack on Karachi's international airport resulted in the deaths of 29 people, including security personnel. The bodies of another seven cargo workers were recovered Tuesday from a cold storage facility at the airport. All 10 terrorists died during the assault. Even after those attacks, for the second time in two days, Pakistan's largest and busiest airport was forced to shut down after militants launched a brazen attack on airport security forces. Tuesday's assault targeted the Airport Security Forces academy near Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, the airport's manager told CNN's Saima Mohsin in Karachi. The attackers fled, and no one was killed in the attack, officials said. The obvious question is: How did the militants manage to enter the airport premises with heavy arms and ammunition? Major security lapses . This security lapse however is not new. In 2009, militants breached an otherwise impregnable fortress -- the General Headquarters of the Army in Rawalpindi -- and continued their operation for hours. Similarly, the Pakistani Taliban also attacked Karachi's naval base in 2011, destroying expensive equipment and killing 10 soldiers. In 2012, they were also successful in carrying out suicide attacks at Peshawar's International airport, resulting in more loss of life. Despite these major lapses, Pakistan's system of intelligence gathering and sharing has been reformed. The new internal security policy, agreed in December 2013, aims to centralize the intelligence sharing process, but it is yet to be implemented. In the case of the Karachi airport attack, the military's swift response helped salvage the situation. Within five to seven hours the airport had been cleared and, given the high-value targets there, major damage was prevented. Military seizes initiative . Another key feature of the operation was the decisive role of the military, as the civilian government  apparently took a backseat. Under Pakistan's constitution, federal ministries are responsible for aviation and airport administration, but the ministers were nowhere to be seen. Even in terms of media management, the military seized the initiative as the head of inter services public relations (ISPR), a major general, was live tweeting and informing about the progress of the operations. In any other country this would not seem extraordinary. But, given Pakistan's peculiar history and the recent civil-military tensions, these developments were meaningful. There was a clear public message that the Army was at the forefront and in control of security policy and operations. Negotiations with the TTP . In the weeks before the attack, Pakistan's civil and military branches of government had been struggling to find a way out to deal with the TTP. Formal talks with the TTP commenced in February 2014 but these disintegrated a fortnight ago. Concurrently, the military had been launching airstrikes and the Karachi attack came in the midst of policy shift in Islamabad. The airstrikes resumed after the airport attack was foiled. Since Pakistan's new Army Chief Raheel Sharif assumed charge in November 2013, the military has given clear signals of its intent to tackle the TTP militarily. The TTP is believed to have killed between 5,000 and 15,000 Pakistani soldiers including generals in recent years. Pakistan's Army did not suffer such losses in three wars against India (1965, 1971 and 1999). Civilian leaders are worried about the potential backlash of such military operations. What complicates the issue further is that some of the factions of TTP are in league with the (Pakistan-friendly) Afghan Taliban, and an all-out operation would hit them as well. The Pakistani Taliban are not in a position to take over the country. However, the three terror incidents in the past 48 hours underscore their capacity to launch attacks on multiple fronts. They gained media attention and reminded everyone of their cohesion, weeks after reports that the TTP was in disarray after a major faction split from the group in May. Is the TTP in crisis or cohesive? In its official statement accepting the responsibility for this attack, TTP cited the Karachi attack as a revenge for the martyrdom of its leader Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year. Since then the TTP -- a loose umbrella of various militant groups -- has been in a crisis of sorts. Its leader Fazlullah reportedly operates from Afghanistan and, according to Pakistani official sources, gets support from the Afghan authorities. For the latter, Fazlullah's presence is a lever to get even with Pakistan for its purported support to the Afghan Taliban, who launch frequent attacks and are contenders for the power pie after NATO's drawdown in 2014. It is unclear if the recent attacks will lead to the emergence of a coherent policy and civil-military consensus in Pakistan. Civilians are afraid of the reprisal attacks; and the military is in no mood to allow TTP to continue killing its soldiers. And with the withdrawal of foreign troops, soon the neighboring Afghanistan may turn into an easier space for Pakistani Taliban and their affiliates. It is time for Pakistan to make a hard choice. In its strategic calculus, it needs to address mending relations with the Afghan government and viewing terrorism as a shared problem.","Airport attack was not Pakistan's first security lapse .

"Never fear the night of the living dead -- the Pentagon has got you covered. From responses to natural disasters to a catastrophic attack on the homeland, the U.S. military has a plan of action ready to go if either incident occurs. It has also devised an elaborate plan should a zombie apocalypse befall the country, according to a  Defense Department document obtained by CNN. In an unclassified document titled ""CONOP 8888,"" officials from U.S. Strategic Command used the specter of a planet-wide attack by the walking dead as a training template for how to plan for real-life, large-scale operations, emergencies and catastrophes. And the Pentagon says there's a reasonable explanation. ""The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario,"" Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told CNN. ""This document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan."" Nevertheless, the preparation and thoroughness exhibited by the Pentagon for how to prepare for a scenario in which Americans are about to be overrun by flesh-eating invaders is quite impressive. Read the Pentagon's Zombie apocalypse plan . A wide variety of different zombies, each brandishing their own lethal threats, are possible to confront and should be planned for, according to the document. Zombie life forms ""created via some form of occult experimentation in what might otherwise be referred to as 'evil magic,' to vegetarian zombies that pose no threat to humans due to their exclusive consumption of vegetation, to zombie life forms created after an organism is infected with a high dose of radiation are among the invaders the document outlines."" Every phase of the operation from conducting general zombie awareness training, and recalling all military personnel to their duty stations, to deploying reconnaissance teams to ascertain the general safety of the environment to restoring civil authority after the zombie threat has been neutralized are discussed. And the rules of engagement with the zombies are clearly spelled out within the document. ""The only assumed way to effectively cause causalities to the zombie ranks by tactical force is the concentration of all firepower to the head, specifically the brain,"" the plan reads. ""The only way to ensure a zombie is 'dead' is to burn the zombie corpse."" There are even contingency plans for how to deal with hospitals and other medical facilities infiltrated by zombies, and the possible deployment of remote controlled robots to man critical infrastructure points such as power stations if the zombie threat becomes too much. A chain of command from the President on down along with the roles to be played by the State Department and the intelligence community for dealing with the zombie apocalypse are clearly spelled out in the document. 'Walking Dead' finale: The biggest reveals . The training document was first reported by Foreign Policy magazine. This is also not the first time zombies have been used as the antagonist in U.S. government training operations.  Both the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Homeland Security have used the creatures as a vehicle for training their personnel in the past. Defense officials stress the report in no way signals an invasion of zombies is on the horizon. The only real purpose of the document was to practice how to execute a plan for handling something as large and serious a situation like flesh-eating beings trying to overrun the United States. And why zombies? Officials familiar with the planning of it say zombies were chosen precisely because of the outlandish nature of the attack premise. ""Training examples for plans must accommodate the political fallout that occurs if the general public mistakenly believes that a fictional training scenario is actually a real plan,"" the document says.  ""Rather than risk such an outcome by teaching our augmentees using the fictional 'Tunisia' or 'Nigeria' scenarios used at (Joint Combined Warfighting School), we elected to use a completely impossible scenario that could never be mistaken as a real plan."" So, practice for the when, where and how to plan for a more likely disaster scenario?  Yes. But zombies of all stripes would be well advised to take note of this directive to Strategic Command personnel buried within the document. ""Maintain emergency plans to employ nuclear weapons within (the continental United States) to eradicate zombie hordes.""","Pentagon planners draw up disaster plans to deal with different contingencies .

"The actions of the captain and crew of the sunken ferry Sewol ""are akin to murder,"" South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Monday. Her comments come after a radio transcript released a day earlier suggested that passengers aboard the doomed South Korean ferry couldn't reach lifeboats to escape because the ship tilted so quickly that it left many of them unable to move. ""Please notify the coast guard. Our ship is in danger. The ship is rolling right now,"" a crew member on the ship first tells authorities in a dramatic conversation that took place while the Sewol ferry was sinking last week. An unidentified crew member on the Sewol talked to two different Vessel Traffic Service centers as the ship sank Wednesday morning, the transcript revealed. Someone on the ship contacted the traffic service in Jeju -- the ferry's destination -- at 8:55 a.m. and communicated with it before the conversation switched to Jindo VTS, which was closer, about 11 minutes later. ""The ship rolled over a lot right now. Cannot move. Please come quickly,"" the crew member says a minute after initial contact. At one point Jeju advises the crew to get people into life vests. ""It is hard for people to move,"" Sewol replies. After the conversation switches to the traffic service in Jindo,  the Sewol crew member says several times that the ship is leaning too much for passengers to move. Sewol: ""Our ship is listing and may capsize."" Jindo VTS: ""How are the passengers doing? ..."" Sewol: ""It's too listed that they are not able to move."" A short time later, another exchange takes place: . Jindo VTS: ""Are the passengers able to escape?"" Sewol: ""The ship listed too much, so it is impossible."" The transcript may help answer one of the major questions about the capsizing: Why didn't more passengers escape on lifeboats? Many missing, scores killed . At least 64 people have died in the sinking, and 238 are missing, the South Korean coast guard said Monday. Search crews brought more than a dozen bodies to shore Sunday morning, a solemn process pierced by screams and cries from the passengers' families. The wrenching scene came after four police boats arrived in rapid succession. The first carried four bodies. The second boat had three more. The third and fourth also carried three bodies each. Each body was taken onto a stretcher on the dock in Jindo, draped in cloth. After an inspection, they were carried along a path guarded by police -- who were also shedding tears -- and past grieving family members. Some relatives refused to accept the outcome. ""Wake up! Wake up, please!"" one man screamed. With hundreds of people still missing, the heartbreaking scene will likely play out over and over again. Although 174 people were rescued shortly after the vessel sank Wednesday, no survivors have been found since. Nonetheless, more than 100 divers continued plunging into the frigid Yellow Sea Sunday. And 35 aircraft and 214 ships aided in the search, Joint Task Force spokesman Park Seung-gi told reporters. At around noon on Monday (11 p.m. ET Sunday), divers will try to enter the ship's cafeteria, where authorities believe most students were when the ship started to sink, he said. One diver described his experience to CNN affiliate JTBC. Teams have been focusing on the third and fourth floors of the ship, where investigators believe many of the missing might be. ""It's hard to say exactly where you are once you enter the ferry, since it is completely dark and you basically have to feel your way around based only on the blueprint of the ferry,"" diving team leader Hwang Dae Sik said. ""So it is hard to say definitively in what compartment you are searching and what your are discovering."" As they wait, relatives of the missing have been asked to submit DNA samples. Park on Sunday declared the cities of Ansan and Jindo as special disaster zones eligible for national disaster assistance programs, in order to facilitate central government help, a spokesman for the Joint Task Force Headquarters said in a news release. Ship's captain defends evacuation . According to the transcript, Jindo Vessel Traffic Service urged the captain to take charge. Jindo VTS: ""The captain should make (the) decision to make people escape. We do not know the situation so captain make final decision on passengers' escape."" The captain has defended his order to delay the evacuation of the ferry. ""It is a fairly fast current area, and the water temperature was cold,"" Capt. Lee Joon Seok said, according to CNN affiliate YTN. ""I thought that abandoning the ship without discretion would make you drift off a fairly far distance and cause a lot of trouble. At the same time, the rescue ship did not come, and there were no fishing boats or supporting ships around to help at that time."" The captain has been charged with abandoning his boat, negligence, causing bodily injury, not seeking rescue from other ships and violating ""seamen's law,"" state media reported. Prosecutor Lee Bong-chang gave more details about the accusations against the captain. ""Mr. Lee is charged with causing the Sewol ship to sink by failing to slow down while sailing the narrow route and making (a) turn excessively,"" the prosecutor told the semiofficial Yonhap news agency. ""Lee is also charged with failing to do the right thing to guide the passengers to escape and thereby leading to their death or injury."" If convicted, the captain faces from five years to life in prison. The captain wasn't at the helm of the Sewol when it started to sink, the prosecutor said. A third mate was at the helm. So where was the captain? The captain was not in the steering room when the accident took place, according to police and his own account. He said he plotted the ship's course, and then went to his cabin briefly ""to tend to something."" It was then, the captain said, that the accident happened. A crew member, described as the third mate and identified only as Park, appeared in handcuffs with Lee. The third mate said she did not make a sharp turn, but ""the steering turned much more than usual."" Park is facing charges including negligence and causing injuries leading to deaths, said Yang Joong-jin, a maritime police spokesman. A technician with the surname Cho is also facing the same charges, he said. The captain was one those rescued soon after the Sewol began to sink, violating an ""internationally recognized rule that a captain must stay on the vessel,"" maritime law attorney Jack Hickey said. ""Pretty much every law, rule, regulation and standard throughout the world says that yes, the captain must stay with the ship until all personnel are safely off of the ship, certainly passengers.""

"The first ten months of 2014 have been the hottest since record keeping began more than 130 years ago, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration. That may be hard to believe for people in places like Buffalo, New York, which saw a record early snowfall this year. But NOAA says, despite the early bitter cold across parts of the United States in recent weeks, it's been a hot year so far for the Earth. With two months left on the calendar, 2014 is shaping up to be the hottest year on record. The average global temperature between January and October has been 0.68 degrees Celsius (1.22 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the 20th century's average global temperature of 14.1 C (57.4 F). NOAA's analysis is an important ""health gauge"" indicating an ominous trend for the planet, says CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. ""It's becoming increasingly more difficult to be a skeptic of the causes of our warming planet,"" he says. Hottest October . This October was the hottest October on record globally, NOAA data showed. The mercury climbed more than one degree Fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 57.1 F. It was the fourth warmest October on record for the United States, NOAA said. ""The record high October temperature was driven by warmth across the globe over both the land and ocean surfaces and was fairly evenly distributed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres,"" the agency said. That's significant, says Van Dam. ""Most notably, this record warmth is not contained to any specific part of the world. Meaning, we are all in this together,"" he says. ""So far this year, record-breaking warmth has been observed in at least every continent and major ocean basin of our planet. This is something we cannot ignore."" Important benchmark . NOAA's analysis breaks down global temperatures into two categories -- land and ocean -- then an average that includes both. The record high temperatures in October were recorded across both land and sea. The surface temperature on land approached an important scientific benchmark. It was almost 2 degrees Celsius higher than the 20th century average for October of 9.3 C (48.7 F). Scientists have long predicted that a change in global average temperature of  just 2 to 3 degrees higher could spell disaster for the planet, contributing to catastrophic storms, sea level rise, dangerous storm surges and melting polar ice. According to the non-binding international agreement on climate change -- the Copenhagen Accord, reached in 2009 -- any temperature increase above the 2 degree Celsius mark is ""dangerous."" NOAA said the ocean temperatures were also the warmest on record in October with an increase of 1.12 F over the 20th century average of 60.6 degrees. Hot spots . ""Record warmth for the year-to-date was particularly notable across much of northern and western Europe, parts of Far East Russia, and large areas of the northeastern and western equatorial Pacific Ocean, "" NOAA said.  ""It is also notable that record warmth was observed in at least some areas of every continent and major ocean basin around the world,"" the agency added. Of particular note, several countries have already seen an average temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius in October 2014 compared to 20th century averages, including Australia, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Sweden. There was also one notable cold spot on the map. The average temperature this year in the midsection of the United States, which saw a severe winter, has been below the 20th century average.","NOAA: Global temperatures pushing record highs this year .

"(CNN)Four top environmental scientists raised the stakes Sunday in their fight to reverse climate change and save the planet. Climate and energy scientists James Hansen, Ken Caldeira, Kerry Emanuel and Tom Wigley have released an open letter calling on world leaders to support development of safer nuclear power systems. Wait -- pro-nuclear environmentalists? Isn't that an oxymoron? Apparently, not so much anymore. Embracing nuclear is the only way, the scientists believe, to reverse the looming threat of climate change which they blame on fossil fuels. Depending who you ask, they're either abandoning -- or leading -- traditional environmentalists who for a half-century have rejected clean-burning nuclear power as too expensive or too dangerous. Opponents cite disasters at Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile island. Related: Fukushima update . The fear is that time is running out. Without nuclear, the scientists believe global energy consumption will overtake the planet's ability to reverse the buildup of carbon dioxide pollution from burning oil, coal and other fossil fuels. At risk, said Hansen, are disintegrating polar ice sheets and rising sea levels which will threaten coastal regions. The letter is among the scientists' strongest public statements backing nuclear power. It also comes as CNN plans to air ""Pandora's Promise,"" a documentary about environmentalists and longtime nuclear opponents who've done complete 180s on nukes. By releasing the letter, the scientists are ""putting their reputations on the line to do something that the ultra-greens regard as treason,"" said Stanford University Nobel-winning physicist Burton Richter. Nuclear power is burgeoning in some parts of the world and shrinking in others. Asia is embracing it -- except Japan -- which is still struggling to figure out how to safely deal with the dangerously radioactive Fukushima nuclear power plant. The Japanese disaster left Germany so unnerved that they've chosen to phase out their 17 nuclear facilities by 2022. ""We've got four top guns in the environmental movement telling [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel, 'You're wrong to shut down nuclear,'"" said Richter. ""I think that's a relatively big deal."" Are we witnessing the birth of a mutiny within the environmental movement? Will typical 21st-century environmentalists eventually embrace the power of the atom? A leading environmental group opposed to nuclear power says no. ""I don't think it's very significant that a few people have changed their minds about nuclear power,"" said Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Nuclear fuel may burn cleaner, the NRDC says, but comes with too many safety issues and too high of a price tag. The letter admits ""today's nuclear plants are far from perfect."" However, ""... there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power."" Read the letter . The four scientists say they have no connection to ""Pandora's Promise,"" which blames resistance to nuclear energy on groundless fears rooted in the Cold War, Chernobyl in 1986 and 1979's Three Mile Island. Related: Chernobyl's local health problems . Map: Closest nukes to your home . In the documentary, which debuts on CNN Thursday at 9 p.m. ET/PT, climate change activist and author Mark Lynas says he knew publicly supporting nuclear energy would put his entire career at risk. ""I'd have been much better just to keep my mouth shut,"" he admits in the film. ""But I couldn't do that."" Cavanagh said the ""movie attempts to establish the proposition that mainstream environmentalists are pouring into nuclear advocacy today. They aren't. I've been in the NRDC since 1979. I have a pretty good idea of where the mainstream environmental groups are and have been. I've seen no movement."" Selling nuclear energy to environmentalists is a tough pitch. Hansen acknowledged that many of them won't easily buy into it. Parts of the community operate like ""a religion of sorts, which makes it very difficult,"" Hansen said. ""They're not all objectively looking at the pros and cons."" The NRDC hasn't rejected nuclear power out of hand, Cavanagh said. It constantly evaluates nuclear power and ""everything else,"" he said. ""I think that's our obligation."" Is it possible to be both an environmentalist and a supporter of nuclear power? ""You can be,"" Cavanagh said. Hansen has been spreading his message to the community's top influencers. He tells of a recent meeting with Al Gore where he tried to sell the former vice president on how advanced nuclear technology might stabilize climate change. Gore invited two anti-nuclear advocates to the meeting, Hansen said, and by the time it was all over, Gore was unmoved. ""I mean, Al essentially understands that we had better try to develop safer, better nuclear power,"" said Hansen, ""but he won't come out and say that."" Here's what Gore did say publicly about it during a recent Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" chat: nuclear energy ""will continue to play a limited role, and IF the ongoing [research and development] produces cheaper, safer, smaller reactors, they may yet play a more significant role."" Decarbonizing . Among nuclear energy supporters, France remains a hero nation. In the 1970s, it chose to invest heavily in nuclear power creating a system that boasts some of the cheapest energy and cleanest air on the planet. Germany puts out about 18% of its power with nuclear. But with the upcoming nuke phase-out, there are doubts about whether Germany can offset its nuclear output with wind and other clean energy sources. Michael Limburg, vice president of the European Institute for Climate and Energy, told CNN in September that the government's energy targets are ""completely unfeasible."" ""Of course, it's possible to erect tens of thousands of windmills but only at an extreme cost and waste of natural space,"" he said. ""And still it would not be able to deliver electricity when it is needed."" There are 65 commercially operating nuclear plants in the U.S., including 104 reactors. Five new reactors are currently being built, in Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. In the past year, utilities have permanently shut down four others and plan to take a fifth out of service in 2014. At least two other planned projects have been shelved. ""Nuclear power is dying a slow death in the market place, which is what matters in determining its future,"" said Cavanagh. As an alternative, the NRDC is touting efficiency. Energy-saving technology is becoming so successful, according to a new NRDC report, that efficiency has ""significant potential to dramatically reduce power plant emissions."" Total U.S. energy use peaked in 2007 and has been trending downward ever since, the NRDC says. On the other hand, scientists in ""Pandora's Promise"" claim energy consumption globally could double by 2050 -- and perhaps triple or quadruple by 2100 -- as growing nations like China, India and Brazil start to want more energy. A United Nations report released last month re-confirmed Hansen's fears. The study concluded that the planet is heating up, the oceans are rising and there's more evidence that neither development is natural. Hansen, who was among the initial wave of scientists warning about climate change in the 1980s, said Friday he fears most its ""irreversible effects."" ""Once we get to a certain point and the ice sheets start to disintegrate, then you can't stop it."" Then Hansen paused. ""And we're getting very close to that point."" If we stay on the current path, he said, ""those are the consequences we'll be leaving to our children. The best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power. It's ready now. We need to take advantage of it."" CNN's Matt Smith and Oliver Joy contributed to this report.","Top enviro-scientists call on world leaders to embrace nuclear power .

"Boko Haram insurgents kidnapped at least 185 women and children, and killed 32 people in a raid in northeastern Nigeria this week, local officials and residents said. Gunmen in pickup trucks attacked the village of Gumsuri, just north of Chibok, on Sunday, shooting down men before herding women and children together. ""They gathered the women and children and took them away in trucks after burning most of the village with petrol bombs,"" a local government official said on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. News of the attack took four days to emerge because of a lack of communication. Telecommunications towers in the region had been disabled in previous attacks. Local officials learned of the attack from residents who fled to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, where the officials had moved a year ago to escape Boko Haram attacks. The militants stormed the village from two directions, overwhelming local vigilantes who had repelled Boko Haram attacks over the course of the year, said Gumsuri resident Umar Ari, who trekked for four days to Maiduguri. ‎""They destroyed almost half the village and took away 185 women, girls and boys,"" Ari said.‎ . Resident Modu Kalli said the militants fired heavy machine guns on the village and poured canisters of gasoline on houses before setting them on fire. ""We lost everything in the attack. I escaped with nothing, save the clothes I have on me,"" Kalli said. Hundreds of residents of Gumsuri continue to arrive in Maiduguri, which has been struggling to accommodate thousands of residents fleeing towns and villages overrun by Boko Haram. Cameroon: At least 116 Boko Haram fighters killed . Meanwhile, the Cameroon military says that it killed at least 116 Boko Haram fighters during a fight in northern Cameroon on Wednesday, near the border with northeastern Nigeria. The incident began when the militant group tried to attack the Cameroonian town of Amchide, military spokesman Lt. Col. Didier Badjeck said. One Cameroonian soldier was killed, and another was missing after the attack, according to a statement released by Badjeck. Boko Haram destroyed two trucks and stole a third, Badjeck said. Badjeck said the military believes its artillery also inflicted unspecified damage to Boko Haram on the Nigerian side of the border during the fight. ""Our defense forces rigorously fought back this barbaric attack, and forced the enemy to retreat,"" Cameroonian government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. ""This terrorist group has only one objective: to spread fear and uncertainty amongst our population. But I can assure you that they will be defeated,"" Bakary said. Two months ago, the nearby area of Limani, Cameroon, was the site of a deadly clash between Boko Haram and Cameroonian forces. Eight Cameroonian soldiers and 107 Boko Haram fighters were killed during an attack by the militants that month, Cameroon state-run broadcaster CRTV reported, citing the Cameroonian defense ministry. Campaign of violence . Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. This month, at least one female Boko Haram suicide bomber killed five people in Maiduguri. Last month, suicide bombings killed nearly 180 people. More than half of the victims died in an attack on a mosque that many suspect Boko Haram was behind. The group has targeted mainstream Islam, saying that it does not represent the interests of Nigeria's 80 million Muslims and that it perverts Islam. In April, Boko Haram militants drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls, many of whom they later said they sold into slavery. At least 5,000 people have died at Boko Haram's hands, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report, making it one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations.","Boko Haram overruns a Nigerian village in pickup trucks, shooting at men .

"They were trapped at sea for 1,000 days, held on their own ship by Somali pirates off the coast of Yemen. A petition pushing for their release described hostages huddled in tight spaces aboard the MV Iceberg 1, given only rice and water to survive. Conditions were so harsh on the ship that one member of the 24-person crew reportedly committed suicide by jumping overboard. Another was killed by pirates. Over the weekend, troops from the Puntland Maritime Police Force rescued the 22 hostages remaining on the Panama-flagged vessel, ending the longest time anyone has been held hostage by pirates, according to Michael Howlett, deputy director of the International Maritime Bureau. ""We are greatly relieved to hear that they are safe after their terrible ordeal,"" said Peter Swift, chairman of the Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Programme, which has been tracking the ship's saga. Sunday's rescue was the result of a two-week operation, the International Maritime Bureau said. Mohamed Abdulrahman, director of the maritime force that led the mission, said Monday that the rescued hostages -- who hailed from Yemen, India, Pakistan, Ghana, Sudan and the Philippines -- were in good health at a military base in Puntland, a semiautonomous region of Somalia. They showed signs of physical abuse and illness after their time in captivity, the International Maritime Bureau said. ""We hope that both public and private organizations will work to ensure that the released hostages, as well as their families, receive all the necessary support and assistance they will require both immediately and longer term as they recover from the trauma and deprivation that they have suffered since being kidnapped,"" Swift said. In March 2010, pirates hijacked the ship, which had been transporting mechanical equipment and was en route to the United Arab Emirates, the European Union Naval Force Somalia reported at the time. ""Whilst this is a successful rescue operation, our thoughts are with the remaining 139 hostages still held by pirates, 28 of whom have been there for just under two years,"" the International Maritime Bureau said in a statement. On Sunday, officials from the bureau, which monitors pirate attacks, said that heavily armed pirates had kidnapped four people after attacking an Italian supply vessel off the coast of Nigeria. In October, the bureau reported that sea piracy had fallen to its lowest level worldwide since 2008 as a result of increasing policing by international naval forces.","Official: The hostages' 1,000 days in captivity was the longest anyone has been held by pirates .

"Sea piracy has fallen to its lowest level worldwide since 2008, as policing by international naval forces has deterred pirates operating in the waters off Somalia, new figures from the piracy watchdog show. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said there were 233 actual and attempted attacks on vessels globally in the first nine months of 2012, compared with 352 in the corresponding period last year. The number of attacks by Somali pirates has fallen dramatically, with 70 attacks by the end of September, down from 199 in the same time frame in 2011 and the lowest number since 2009, according to the report, which was released on Monday. How to fight piracy . Pottengal Mukundan, director of the IMB, said the decline was a reflection of the pre-emptive and disruptive counter-piracy tactics used by international navies, as well as deployment of on-board security measures like armed guards. ""It's good news that hijackings are down, but there can be no room for complacency; these waters are still extremely high-risk and the naval presence must be maintained,"" he said. The European Union, NATO and a multi-national naval force called Combined Task Force 151 have conducted anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia since 2009. ""There is no alternative to their continued presence as long as Somali pirates threaten major trade routes in this region,"" Mukundan added. Worldwide, pirates have killed six and taken 448 crew hostage in 2012, according to the report. It noted piracy had increased in West Africa, off the coasts of Nigeria, Benin and Togo. Pirates hijack Greek-operated tanker off Togo coast . Attacks there were often violent and targeted tankers carrying refined oil products that can be easily sold, it added. ""There continues to be a serious problem with under-reporting of attacks in this area,"" Mukundan said. ""This may be because of a fear of reprisals or a feeling that little will change as a result."" In Asia, the waters off Indonesia were most prone to pirate attacks, with 51 incidents, up from 30 in 2011. The report said the attacks were usually opportunistic and targeted ships at anchor.","Worldwide pirate attacks at lowest level since 2008 .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- ""Olympic Village train station!"" I say into the smartphone, which is running my voice through a translation app. I give the device back to the taxi driver. He reads the Russian display showing the app's best guess of what I've just said and then scratches his head. We left the hotel not five minutes ago but already he's lost. With only hand signals and inaccurate electronic translation, the chance of reaching my destination, just across town, looks slim. And this is no isolated incident. More lost taxi drivers . In fact, it's the second time today I've ordered a taxi with a local driver who has little notion how to get around the city he calls home. Bizarre? Turns out there's a very good reason for such confusion, and it's not solely due to my inadequate language skills. It's more to do with the complete transformation of the Adler district in Sochi, home of the Olympic Park. Such is the scale of the change it's as if a new town has opened in one day. No wonder there are a few bemused cabbies on the streets. Roads, bridges and railway lines . According to the local government, the following developments have been completed in the Sochi region in the past five years: 360 kilometers of new roads and bridges, 54 railway bridges totaling 16 kilometers in length, 200 kilometers of new railway lines, 22 tunnels, 480 kilometers of low-pressure gas pipelines, 550 kilometers of high-voltage power lines and two new thermal and one gas power plant that together produce more than 1200 megawatts. A new water and wastewater treatment facility processes 255,000 cubic meters of liquid per day; a new seaport has been built to take two passenger liners, two ferries and 300 yachts. There are 60 new educational, cultural, sports and health facilities, and four ski complexes have been created (Roza Khutor, OAO Gazprom, Gornaya Karusel, Alpika - Servis). Hotel capacity for the city has doubled to 50,000 rooms in the same period, with 56 of these hotels now rated four-star or above. Regardless of political persuasion and aside from equations on value for money against investment, the ambition of the Sochi project is so staggering it's hard to believe until you see it. 'Of course there are drawbacks' ""Krasnaya Polyana [Sochi's mountain resort] has always been visited year-round but the Olympics will help us make it popular around the world,"" Malorodnova Julia Vladimirovna, deputy chief of Sochi's Department of Resort Business and Tourism, tells CNN. Given the extent of the development you could see how media complaints about their unfinished Olympic hotel rooms, though justified, may have been a cause of frustration for anyone involved in the project. ""Of course there are drawbacks --- some of the hotels have been recently built. ""If you would like to find the negative you will,"" Vladimirovna tells CNN. ""In 2013, about four million people visited us. ""There have been fewer tourists during the preparation for the Games -- we lost 10% to 15% -- but that's natural. ""When you make a renovation in your flat, you wouldn't invite friends,"" as Vladimirovna puts it. Too many hotel rooms? Sochi estimates that hotel capacity was at 79% last year which, given all the new accommodation, raises the question: how are all those hotels going to be filled after the Games? For Vladimirovna the answer is simple: ""Chains such as Hyatt, Radisson and Marriott [are now here and] they will attract tourists. ""We're also launching a huge advertising campaign in America, Canada and Europe."" Sport will remain a key marketing tool once the Olympics are over. The Olympic site will be the staging ground for Russia's first Formula One Grand Prix, in October. Sochi will also be one of the venue cities for the 2018 World Cup, and it now has the infrastructure to stage many alpine and winter sport events. The theme park manager . Paul Beck, the avuncular Dutchman in charge of Sochi's new theme park, recognizes the challenges but remains a keen advocate for the city. ""[In Soviet times] people came here because it was the best beach in Russia, but when the borders were opened everyone could travel to Europe. ""Now we have to fight to get them back. ""We have a quality product ... although attracting people from outside Russia ... will not be easy. ""But let's give it a try!"" Previously managing director of the second biggest theme park in Europe, Beck has also been a Volkswagen board member and head of World Expos -- the five-yearly event where nations and large organizations show off their achievements. Will tourists come? Given his experience, does he think enough tourists will come to provide a decent return on the theme park's $700 million investment? ""We need to attract 1.5 million visitors annually to turn a profit. ""The great thing about Sochi is you have wonderful year-round weather,"" he says. That lets the park stay open all day and into the evening. Sochi residents say the city has just three seasons -- warm and humid summers giving way to long autumns that pass seamlessly into spring. Market research by an American company predicted higher visitor numbers to the park than those needed to break even, Beck says. Among its attractions are that it's the only theme park in Russia outside Moscow and it has one of the biggest looping roller coasters in the world. ""They'll come,"" Beck says of future visitors. ""I have a feeling about it!"" Reimagining Russia . Beck was unconvinced about moving to Russia for his new job, he tells CNN, a place he imagined as ""dark, unfriendly and with lousy food."" Seeing the ambitious plans for the theme park changed his mind. ""Russia's time is coming. Things are moving fast,"" he says. ""The culture is changing -- a new, more open generation is coming through. ""My big surprise was that you can work together with Russians. You can laugh, but they are actually a nice population!"" Therein lies the essence of the Sochi gamble. The Putin government hopes the city, as an open door to the rest of the world, will help to craft a strong and positive perception of this bear of a country. Either way, tourists will be voting with their feet.","Sochi hotel rooms doubled to 50,000 for the Olympics .

"The retirement of the pirate leader Mohamed Abdi Hassan, also known as ""Afweyne,"" has generated much media coverage, but the real significance of his announcement is the indication it gives of how Somalia's pirates currently view their business model. It appears that hijacking vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden is no longer seen as a relatively risk-free affair. Somalia's 3025-km coastline is the longest in Africa, and lies along busy shipping lanes that are crucial for the transport of goods from Asia to Europe, and of oil from the Gulf. It is estimated that between 20 and 30,000 ships pass through this area every year. For more than a decade, this environment has provided rich pickings for pirates launching small skiffs from Somalia's coast, hoping to hold up a ship with its cargo and crew until a ransom is paid by the ship's owner. In 2008, piracy began to gain international attention as the number of attacks and the amount demanded in ransoms increased dramatically. That year was also the one in which Afweyne attained notoriety as the key organizer of a pirate group that conducted two high-profile hijackings. Men under Afweyne's command captured one of the largest vessels ever hijacked -- the Sirius Star, a Saudi-owned oil tanker the size of an aircraft carrier -- which was carrying 2 million barrels of oil worth $100 million, according to some estimates. Later that year Afweyne's group also hijacked the MV Faina, a Ukrainian vessel loaded with weaponry including tanks, anti-aircraft guns and 800 tons of ammunition. At the time, it was feared that this cargo could be stolen by the hijackers and sold to criminal organizations or even terrorists but, like the Sirius Star, the vessel was eventually released after a ransom of $3 million was reportedly paid. Report: Sea piracy drops to lowest level in four years . Despite these high-profile incidents, there are reports that Afweyne has not been directly involved in piracy since 2009, and so his retirement will have little effect on the current trajectory of piracy. Afweyne's announcement is, however, indicative of a trend that has become increasingly clear over the past year -- that piracy off the coast of Somalia is no longer as lucrative as it once was. There has been growing recognition that piracy does not spontaneously happen at sea, but that it is a phenomenon rooted in the economic and political shortcomings of Somalia. In a country where the estimated GDP per capita is only $600 (compared to neighboring Kenya's $1,700), the lack of employment opportunities has meant that the chance of earning up to $6,000 from a successful hijack has made piracy a tempting option to many young Somali men. However, action taken by international governments seeking to protect their trade interests and to maintain security along Africa's east coast has led to a decline in successful pirate attacks. In 2011, there were 28 hijackings, 20% lower than the 2010 figure. In the first 11 months of 2012, Somali pirates only managed 13 successful hijackings. There has not only been a reduction in successful hijackings, but also in the number of attempts that pirates are making. While in 2011, there were 199 incidents in the high-risk area off Somalia's coast, by the end of 2012 this figure had dropped by almost two-thirds. This reduction in pirates' success can be attributed to four key factors: . • The introduction of international naval patrols in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean which increasingly collaborate to protect merchant shipping and to apprehend pirates. • The shipping industry's implementation of Best Management Practices, which are guidelines detailing methods of protecting a vessel from attack (for example, faster travel through the high-risk area, increased vigilance, and ship protection measures such as barbed wire placed around the ship). • The presence of armed guards aboard vessels. • And, perhaps, the example of pirates who have been prosecuted and imprisoned internationally and within Somalia. High-ranking Somali pirate gets multiple life sentences . Some may ask what a pirate boss does in his retirement, and Afweyne's public renunciation was clearly meant to garner public interest. Some lower-level former pirates have begun to offer their services as counter-piracy consultants, or guards aboard fishing boats that operate near Somalia's coast. It would not be unthinkable for Afweyne to position himself as a counter-piracy expert within Somalia. Somalia's former government issued him with a diplomatic passport, reportedly in a bid to dissuade him from carrying out further pirate activity, demonstrating the surprising political connections which he has enjoyed. Until there is a comprehensive solution to Somalia's troubles, piracy off the country's coast will not be ended conclusively -- but it might be contained to a manageable level. Part of this effort will involve maintaining an international naval presence in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden in order to deter those who might still take a chance in attacking a vessel, and to counter wider criminal activity, including people and weapon-smuggling. It may seem unfair that a figure like Afweyne appears to have gone unpunished for longstanding criminal activity. With more investment of time and money by Somalia, its neighbors and the wider international community in tracing the financial flows of piracy, identifying and prosecuting those who have financed and benefited hijackings, figureheads such as Afweyne may make the news for their imprisonment, rather than retirement.","Pirate Mohamed Abdi Hassan, known as ""Afweyne,"" announces retirement .

A spokesman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria in the northern province of Hasaka confirmed the death of Khalil, but said the death toll among combatants was much higher, with 20 FSA rebels and 25 Kurdish fighters killed on Monday.

Read more: New Syrian flashpoint erupts; Turkey releases Syrian plane . Until two weeks ago, Ras Al Ain was a safe haven that had largely escaped the conflict that is ripping Syria apart. Syrians sought shelter in this small, ethnically-mixed market town populated by Arabs, Kurds and Christians. The town was built along train tracks that divide the border between Syria and Turkey. On November 8, Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Ras Al Ain.  After less than 48 hours of fighting, they overwhelmed a small garrison of Syrian government forces there. Read more: Turkish town on Syrian border deals with fighting, ethnic differences . The rebel assault triggered an exodus of thousands of civilians, who fled across the border to Turkey.  The flood of refugees increased in the following days when Syrian helicopters and jets began bombing Ras Al Ain, spreading fear throughout the neighboring Turkish town of Ceylanpinar. A team of CNN journalists visited Ras Al Ain last Friday during a lull in the regime airstrikes.  By then, the town's central bazaar district was in ruins and almost deserted, except for roving bands of rebel fighters. A few shopkeepers were seen hurriedly emptying their businesses of all merchandise, clearly afraid there would be more fighting.  There were no victory scenes of jubilation among locals. Some refugees told CNN they were unhappy with the arrival of FSA rebels.  That was echoed by a Kurdish umbrella group, which issued a public statement demanding that all armed groups evacuate Ras Al Ain. ""Most of the Kurds want neither the rebels nor the regime,"" said Rashid Mohammed, a Kurdish farmer who had fled to neighboring Turkey, in an interview last week with CNN. Tensions between the predominantly Arab rebels and members of the militia affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) erupted Monday.  However, Arabs and Kurds offered contradictory accounts of how the fighting began. Spokesmen for the rebels claimed their fighters came under attack when they approached a Kurdish checkpoint unarmed. Kurdish activists said snipers opened fire on a demonstration organized to demand the withdrawal of FSA fighters. ""The reason why they organized the demonstration was to bring the refugees back to Ras Al Ain and to tell the FSA to leave the town,"" said Nurooz al Ahmad, a female Kurdish activist and Ras Al Ain resident, in a phone call with CNN. ""This was a safe area before the FSA came to Ras Al Ain."" The deadly ethnic clashes appeared to have embarrassed prominent officials in the Syrian opposition movement. ""I have been trying to organize talks between the Kurds and the FSA since yesterday,"" said Malik al Kurdi, a spokesman for the FSA based in Turkey. ""It was wrong for the FSA to enter Kurdish areas like Ras Al Ain,"" he added.  ""The Kurds don't think the way we think.  They have another culture, another ideology... this is exactly what the regime wants, to create problems between the Arabs and the Kurds so that we stop struggling to bring down the regime."" Monday's battle in Ras Al Ain marked the second time in less than a month that anti-regime rebels have clashed with Kurdish militia members.  On October 27, at least 21 people were killed and more than 100 kidnapped after Kurdish gunmen linked to the PKK fought FSA rebels in the battleground city of Aleppo, in northern Syria.  Both factions have since reportedly worked out a cease-fire agreement.","Ras Al Ain is located on Syria's border with Turkey .

"""We are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons."" So said President Barack Obama on Friday at the annual general assembly of the Union for Reform Judaism. As presidential sentences go, it's an artfully constructed one. It's not a statement about Iran. It's not a statement about nuclear weapons. It's a statement about the president's feelings. As such, the statement arrives with a built-in loophole. ""(W)e have imposed the most comprehensive, the hardest-hitting sanctions that the Iranian regime has ever faced."" That sentence, from the same speech, is likewise literally true. The president has somewhat tightened the sanctions already in place when he entered office. So yes, the sanctions now in place are the ""hardest-hitting"" the regime ""has ever faced."" On the other hand, despite the tightening, the sanctions remain pitifully inadequate to the job. Iran's most crucial import is gasoline, because this oil-producing nation cannot refine enough gasoline for its automobiles. Gasoline imports to Iran are supposedly sanctioned. Despite sanctions, Iran has increased its imports of gasoline over the past 90 days, according to news reports. As sanctions fail to bait, the options on halting Iran's nuclear program get uglier. Somebody (Israel? Iranian dissidents backed by Saudi Arabia?) is carrying out a campaign of violent sabotage against Iran's nuclear program. On November 12, a huge explosion leveled an Iranian missile base near Tehran. Iran acknowledged the explosion killed several dozen people, including the head of its missile program. By some reports, the dead included a team of visiting North Korean missile scientists. Two weeks later, another huge explosion was heard near Isfahan, site of an Iranian uranium enrichment facility. This time, however, the Iranian regime offered no statement or details on the explosion. If any Western government knows anything, that government is not sharing its information. Over the past few years, there have been numerous reports of the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, including one shot dead on a busy street by a motorcyclist in July. Some foreign policy analysts suggest a policy of ""containment"" and ""deterrence"" of Iran's nuclear weapons. That policy seems incredibly unrealistic, given the Iranian regime's long history of reckless adventurism, including terrorist operations on the soil of (among others): Argentina, France, Germany, Lebanon, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. But even if containment and deterrence were realistic options, the situation has moved far past that point. There's a covert war being waged apparently over the Iranian nuclear program. Iran is waging a brutal irregular campaign of its own: It's suspected of being behind an assassination attempt against the Saudi ambassador to the United States; it has given aid to Bashar al-Assad's Syria and to Hezbollah in Lebanon and has aided insurgents in Afghanistan.  And Iran's nuclear ambitions have unleashed a cycle that will not be stable -- that is much more likely to end in open conflict than in a standoff. Yet there is a leader pushing a plan that could end the cycle without war: U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois. For a year, the freshman senator has been urging a new approach to sanctions, an approach that truly would force an Iranian rethink. The Kirk plan, co-sponsored by Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, would impose sanctions on the Iranian central bank, in effect severing Iran from the entire global payments system. Specifically, the Menendez-Kirk amendment would forbid any U.S. financial institution to deal with the Iranian central bank -- or to deal with any financial institution that does so. Every bank would find itself confronted with a stark threat: If you do business with Iran, you will lose access to the largest financial market on earth. These sanctions would collapse the central bank of Iran and shove the Iranian economy onto a barter system for all external transactions. The Menendez-Kirk amendment passed the Senate 100-0 as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act. On Friday, it passed the House of Representatives and will now head to the president's desk for his signature. The Obama administration has opposed Mendendez-Kirk for fear of roiling world oil markets. Iran exports 2.5 million barrels per day. To put that figure in perspective, the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada (a decision on which the Obama administration has just postponed) could have added 700,000 barrels per day to world exports, alone substituting for almost one-third of Iranian exports. Libya and Iraq have capacity to increase their production quickly and substantially, and of course the U.S. government has 727 million barrels in the strategic petroleum reserve, more than ample to deal with supply shocks. Still, to respond to administration concerns, the Menendez-Kirk amendment now empowers the president to issue waivers on both national security and economic grounds. Most observers expect the president to sign the Defense Authorization legislation with the Menendez-Kirk amendment -- and then seek to evade the amendment's requirements. He will certainly have the authority to do so. This evasion will however come at a political price. The central bank sanctions in Menendez-Kirk begin to bite hard six months out --- i.e., about the time of the Republican and Democratic conventions. If the president is then granting waivers to banks that want to do business with Iran, that action will be visible and politically costly. The utmost irony here is that detractors in the administration and in the foreign policy establishment criticize Menendez-Kirk as a form of confrontation with Iran. In reality, Menendez-Kirk is the last and best chance for regional peace: the last best hope to avoid the horrible choice of either using force to stop Iran -- or acquiescing as Iran gains the power to wage nuclear terror against its neighbors and the world.","David Frum: Obama talks of commitment to Iran sanctions, but they are not strong enough .

"Nigeria's embattled leader vowed Boko Haram's abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls would be the terror group's undoing, even as authorities admitted Thursday the girls likely have been separated and taken out of the country. President Goodluck Jonathan's statements come amid mounting international outrage over the mass abduction and the government's largely ineffective effort to subdue Boko Haram. ""By God's grace, we will conquer the terrorists. I believe the kidnap of these girls will be the beginning of the end for terror in Nigeria,"" Jonathan said at the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja. He also acknowledged the offers of help from the United States, Britain, China and France, all of which have offered help in the weeks-old search for the girls who were snatched in mid-April from their beds at an all-girls school in rural northeastern Nigeria. But the task of recovering the girls appeared to grow more complicated with news that U.S. intelligence believe the 276 girls have been split up. ""We do think they have been broken up into smaller groups,"" U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said. He declined to detail how U.S. officials came to the conclusion. It is a sentiment that has been echoed by a number of others, who believe the girls already have been moved out of Nigeria and into neighboring countries. ""The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,"" former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the U.N.'s special envoy for global education, told CNN. ""It's vital to use the information to find the girls before they are dispersed across Africa, which is a very real possibility."" The girls have not been seen since Boko Haram militants abducted them on April 14 from the Government Girls Secondary School in rural Chibok, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Maiduguri and some 600 miles from the capital of Abuja. That was followed on Sunday night by another kidnapping, with villagers in Warabe accusing Boko Haram militants of taking at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15. Boko Haram leader takes a new tact . Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, took credit in a video that surfaced this week for the mass kidnappings. ""I abducted your girls,"" he taunted in the video, first obtained by Agence France Presse. ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell."" Shehu Sani, a former negotiator between Boko Haram and the government, believes the group targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of its followers from prisons. ""The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible. Shekau's video is not going to be the last word from the group on the girls,"" he said. Now, Boko Haram may be going after those trying to find the girls. On Thursday, Nigerian police said one officer was shot in the neck during a gunfight with suspected members of the group on the road between Maiduguri and Chibok. And on Monday, Boko Haram attacked Gamboru Ngala, a remote state capital near Nigeria's border with Cameroon that has been used as a staging ground for troops in the search for the girls. Some of the at least 310 victims were burned alive. The assault fits a pattern of revenge-seeking by Boko Haram against those perceived to disagree with the group or those who have provided aid to the Nigerian government. 'Time is of the essence' The Nigerian government has been under fire by those who say government officials failed to take action in the hours and then days after the girls were abducted. Jonathan, who waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter, and his security ministers have defended the response, saying efforts were under way but could not be disclosed publicly. Nigeria appeared this week to admit it needed help, accepting offers of assistance from world leaders. The United States was among a number of nations who repeatedly offered assistance to Nigeria in recent weeks, Kirby said. ""In a hostage situation, time is of the essence,"" Kirby said. ""...We lost some time."" The United States is sending a team of law enforcement experts and military advisers. France said Thursday that it would send a ""specialized team"" to help. The British government is also sending a small team, Prime Minister David Cameron's office said. Neither country said exactly what expertise their teams would bring. British satellites and advanced tracking capabilities also will be used, and China has promised to provide any intelligence gathered by its satellite network, the Nigerian government said. Seven members of the U.S. military are scheduled to arrive Friday in Nigeria to join a team of advisers supporting the Nigerian efforts to rescue the girls, Kirby said. Right now, there are no plans to send U.S. combat troops, he said. Nigeria's top security officials appealed to the public for help during a visit to the Chibok school on Thursday, according to a statement released by Nigeria's director of defense information. The chief of defense, Air Marshal Alex S. Badeh, called on members of the immediate community to provide security agencies with useful information that will lead to the rescue of the girls. Boko Haram, which translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language, has said it wants a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation. The militants have even been known to kill Muslim clerics who dare criticize them. The United States has branded Boko Haram a terror organization and has put a $7 million bounty on Shekau. Nigerian police also announced a reward of about $310,000 for information leading to the girls' rescue. Why hasn't the rescue effort produced results?

"The U.S. military conducted an airstrike in southern Somalia on Sunday against a suspected militant leader, a U.S. military official told CNN. The target was described by the official as a ""senior leader"" affiliated with al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia. The United States has not yet been able to determine whether the target was killed, the official said. Last October, the elite U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six aborted a pre-dawn raid in southern Somalia to capture Al-Shabaab leader Ikrima after an intense firefight prevented them from reliably taking him alive, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time. In a second raid that same weekend, members of the U.S. Army Delta Force captured Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda operative wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, during an operation in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The U.S. military official said Sunday's strike involved missiles. No U.S. troops were on the ground. Al-Shabaab, designated a terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. In 2012, the two groups effectively merged, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. Bergen: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . Al-Shabaab hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state but has launched attacks in other countries as well. In 2010, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, amid crowds of soccer fans watching televised screenings of the World Cup final. The bombings left 74 people dead. The group said at the time the attacks were retaliation for Ugandan participation in the African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM. One AMISOM goal is to support Somali government forces in cracking down on Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has also mounted many smaller attacks against targets in Kenya, hurling hand grenades into nightclubs, restaurants and schools. The group has also kidnapped tourists and aid workers. The group claimed responsibility for the September siege of the Westgate mall in Nairobi on September 21 that killed at least 67 people. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya's involvement in the African Union effort against the group. In recent months, Al-Shabaab's haven in south-central Somalia has been increasingly squeezed as Kenyan forces fight the group from the south and African Union forces come down from Mogadishu, the Somali capital.

"Hong Kong's teenage protest leader Joshua Wong has begun a hunger strike with two members of his youth activist group Scholarism in his latest attempt to secure talks with the government to demand democracy. ""I know it is really harmful to my body, however it is the only way to give pressure to the government to get a meeting with us,"" Wong told CNN. ""If the government can have a proper meeting with Scholarism to discuss whether political reform will be launched immediately, we will stop the hunger strike."" The 18-year-old activist wants open elections for Hong Kong's next leader, but Beijing has said Hong Kong may only hold elections if candidates are nominated by a small committee. READ MORE: Who is Joshua Wong? Wong's hunger strike is an attempt to rally a movement which has shown growing signs of fracture. Protesters have camped more than two months on an eight-lane highway in Hong Kong's Admiralty district, but the government has shown no willingness to make concessions. The movement's momentum has sputtered and leaders of different protest groups are split over what action to take. Hong Kong's chief executive C.Y. Leung responded to news of the hunger strike by telling students to ""take care of their health, especially in this cold weather."" The city's temperature has dipped to a crisp 15 degrees Celsius (59 Fahrenheit) after months of heat and humidity. Wong says he will only consume water. 'We are all tired' Reactions were mixed to Wong's announcement of the hunger strike. ""Kid, you're too young. You think (Hong Kong's leader) will give you real universal suffrage because of a hunger strike?"" said one commenter. Other democracy supporters accused Wong of staging the hunger strike as a way of achieving a ""glorious retreat"" without accomplishing anything. An online statement issued by Scholarism, acknowledged the hunger strike was a desperate measure. ""We are all tired, our hearts are weary; as we face this high wall of a government we are like a weak, frail, egg,"" it said. ""But we are not afraid of people laughing at our dreams; we are afraid of hearing the sounds of our broken dreams in the future, afraid of having no more dreams at all."" Scholarism is not new to hunger strikes: In 2012, members of the group staged a hunger strike outside Hong Kong's government headquarters to oppose a proposed pro-Communist high school curriculum. After vocal protests from thousands of supporters, officials eventually withdrew the plan. Occupy founders announce 'surrender' Not long after Wong's hunger strike began, the three middle-aged founders of the Occupy Central movement announced they would not escalate their actions, but would instead surrender to police. ""For the sake of the occupiers' safety, for the sake of our original intention of love and peace, as we prepare to surrender, we three urge the students to retreat,""  law professor Benny Tai announced at a press conference. Tai first came up with the idea to ""occupy"" downtown Hong Kong to call for universal suffrage but he has not always seen eye-to-eye with students leaders, who kicked off the current protests two months ago. Many of Hong Kong's committed protesters do not consider the Occupy founders to be their leaders, and are unlikely to be influenced by Tai's call for retreat. Wong told CNN if the Occupy founders want students to retreat, then ""(the Occupy founders) should urge the government to get a discussion with the students."" Standoff . Student leaders have grown increasingly desperate for a breakthrough. On Sunday night, student leaders called on supporters to surround Hong Kong's government headquarters Sunday night, leading to a violent nighttime standoff with police in which protesters were bloodied and ultimately beaten back. The next morning, police briefly moved on the main protest site, removing some tents, banners, and barricades before withdrawing. Student leader Alex Chow, 24, of the Hong Kong Federation of Students bowed his head in an apology to supporters Monday. ""We aimed to disrupt the operation of the government... but the plan had room to improve and in a sense it failed."" Before dawn Monday, at least 40 arrests had been made in Admiralty, according to the Hong Kong Police. A further 12 people were also arrested in Mong Kok. The Central Government Office was closed on Monday morning but later re-opened. The government said it condemned ""violent radicals,"" saying they had ""provoked and verbally abused police officers"" and encouraged others to charge police lines. Protesters: ""We do not have any plan' Wong was briefly arrested last week as police forcefully cleared Hong Kong's second-largest protest site in the working class neighborhood of Mong Kok. Now as the main protest site comes under threat, protesters have been at a loss for how to best respond. Arguments broke out Monday between student leaders and demonstrators after police made an incursion into the tent city. Winnie Ng, a demonstrator, told CNN ""We do not have any plan."" Grassroots demonstrators have argued the movement should escalate its physical confrontations with the government. But the orginators of the Occupy movement, among them Benny Tai and professor Chan Kin-man, have repeatedly called on students to withdraw and think of a new strategy, citing opinion polls that show low support for the street occupations. In a poll in November, just 13% of Hong Kongers surveyed said the occupations should continue.","Teen protest leader Joshua Wong declares hunger strike .

"Hiring a former grand slam champion as a coach is all the rage these days it would appear. Novak Djokovic is the latest to join the trend after appointing Boris Becker as the head of his coaching team just over a month before he starts the defense of his Australian Open title. Djokovic, ranked second in the world, follows in the footsteps of Andy Murray, who appointed Ivan Lendl as coach in 2011 before going on to win the 2012 U.S. Open and 2013 Wimbledon tournament. Becker will work alongside the Serbian's current coaching team, which includes Marian Vajda, Miljan Amanovic and Gebhard Phil-Gritsch. ""I am really excited to have the opportunity to work with Boris,"" Djokovic said in a statement. ""He is a true legend, someone who has great tennis knowledge and his experience will help me win new trophies from the Grand Slams and other tournaments. ""Becker is a great person, too, and I am sure he will fit in our team in the best possible way. ""Boris brings a new fresh approach, and together with Vajda he will make a winning combination. ""My goal for 2014 is to play my best tennis and to get in shape for the Grand Slams and Masters 1000. ""These tournaments have the most weight in our sport, and I want to prove my worth there. The team is now strengthened and we hope for maximum results."" While Djokovic will hope Becker can help him return to the top of the rankings, partnerships with former champions do not always go to plan. While Stanislas Wawrinka has enjoyed success working with former World No.2 Magnus Norman, others have not been so fortunate. Maria Sharapova hired eight-time grand slam winner Jimmy Connors in July before firing him after just 34 days. The pair lasted one match. Becker, 46, won six grand slams and 64 ATP titles during an illustrious career in which he became the youngest ever Wimbledon champion at the age of 17. The German led his country to victory in the 1988 and 1989 Davis Cup and also claimed a gold medal at the 1992 Olympic Games playing alongside compatriot Michael Stich. ""I am proud Novak  invited me to become his head coach. I will do my best to help him reach his goals, and I am sure we can achieve great things together,"" Becker said. Six-time grand slam winner Djokovic has worked with Vajda since 2006 but both men decided it was time for a fresh face to be added to the team. Djokovic lost his No.1 ranking to Rafael Nadal and was beaten in the 2013 U.S.Open final by the Spaniard in September. He will defend his Australian Open title in January with Becker by his side -- a move which Vajda believes will bring out the best in the Serbian. ""In a few weeks Novak and I will start the eighth year of our cooperation,"" said Vajda. ""During that period we have achieved almost all the goals we had. I realized that Novak needed a new head coach in order for him to continue improving certain parts of his game. ""At the same time I will have more time for my family. Becker's assignment will not affect much my position in the team, since I will do all I can for Novak, just like I did before. ""On the other hand, choosing Boris as the head coach is a good solution, I am sure we will get along very well, and that Novak will continue to progress."" The move comes on the same day that Djokovic was named as the International Tennis Federation Men's World Champion for the third year in succession. The 26-year-old won his third successive Australian Open title, and was a finalist at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open and a semifinalist at Roland Garros as well as winning seven ATP titles, including the ATP World Tour Finals. He said: ""It is an honor to be named ITF World Champion for the third year running. I've had a great 2013 season, and managed to end the year on a high. This will definitely serve as a good platform for 2014."" Serena Williams was named as the ITF Women's World Champion for the second year in a row following a stellar season. The 32-year-old, who moved back to No.1 in the world, won 78 of her 82 singles matches and won both the French and U.S Opens. The 17-time grand slam winner ended the season by winning the end of year WTA Championships.","Novak Djokovic appoints Boris Becker as new head coach .

"Raqqa was, a matter of months ago, one of Syria's most liberal cities. Now locals call it Tora Bora. They say it's as if the Taliban of Afghanistan have taken over. After months of bombardment by the regime and a chaotic lack of control by weak and divided moderate rebels, al Qaeda have found a broken society, made it their home, and imposed on it hardline Islamist law. Each morning, activists told us, they seem to awake to a more conservative city. The ""Bayanaat"" or rulings sometimes appear on town walls. Many limit women's rights -- to walk alone, to style or show their hair. Other edicts come by word of mouth -- no smoking, no cameras. Behind them are often foreign jihadists from the al Qaeda linked militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The fear that now grips the city can be felt in the shocking bruises on Adnan's body. Adnan, whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety, was behind some graffiti in Raqqa that told ISIS to get out. They caught him filming too, and dragged him into the burned-out ruins of a church they had torched and labeled as a new ISIS base. Adnan was then taken to a nearby basement where the torture started. ""Every 15 minutes, someone poured water on me, electrocuted me, kicked me, then walked out,"" he said. But his own pain, he said, he could handle, as his body eventually went numb. It was hearing the pain and the screams of other prisoners he knew that was the hardest. ""When a person is tortured in front of you, you feel responsible. That's the hardest. One guy still inside used to call me Dad as I taught him about democracy,"" he said. One ISIS video -- part of a high-definition, heavily produced social media channel that displays their ideals and exploits -- shows their militants driving through Raqqa at night. They pass a poster, put up by ISIS, encouraging women to wear the Islamic hijab or partial veil, to ""cover their beauty"". The militants' goal, though, is reaching a cafe where they tell patrons smoking will be banned.  Another video shows them burning not only marijuana, but also large numbers of cigarette cartons.  Another shows an ISIS teacher -- his face blurred -- with a group of schoolchildren, all wearing ISIS's distinctive black headbands. It is extraordinarily dangerous to film inside Raqqa. Activists have been beaten and jailed by ISIS for doing so. But CNN has gathered rare video from some activists and from ISIS's own websites that paint a chilling picture of the rapid lurch towards radical Islamist ideology in a city now under ISIS control. Dozens of interviews with activists and Syrians have also detailed the story of a city where women -- along with the previously liberal lifestyle of an entire town -- are being rapidly suppressed by militants bent on establishing an Islamic caliphate across northern Syria. One female activist said: ""They are closing hair salons, women can't go out at certain times. They spat on one girl for disobedience. It's like Afghanistan. Now people call Raqqa Tora Bora."" The speed of change has overwhelmed many who notice that the city is becoming quieter and more conservative each week. ISIS first came into town on May 15, and swiftly executed men they accused of working for the regime. At first, they seemed an Islamist but better-organized alternative to the rebels who had failed to bring governance or peace to the city for months. But slowly a broader agenda emerged and began to gather pace each week, activists told CNN. Rebels who opposed ISIS were at first jailed, sparking protests. Yet ISIS became increasingly uncompromising in their grip on the town. Rules for social conduct in Raqqa, some written and some not, have emerged in the past few weeks. They have yet to reach the extent of those seen in the nearby town of Jarablus -- where one poster recently warned thieves would have their hand chopped off -- but locals fear that could come soon. Anti-ISIS dissent has been silenced in Raqqa, and many activists and locals we spoke to have fled the town. Some stay and spray-paint graffiti declaring that ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are the same, or telling ISIS to get out. Locals note the irony in the fact that ISIS beats them for this graffiti, just in the same way that the Assad regime was accused of torturing young people for anti-government graffiti in the southern town of Daraa -- an incident that began the revolution in March 2011.  For many, ISIS is now something worse than the regime. Is Al Qaeda taking over northern Syria? How jihadis  are being smuggled through Turkey .

"President Barack Obama has yet to decide whether to authorize air strikes against ISIS targets in Syria, the White House insists. More and more, though, the signals and nuance from the administration and the military suggest such a campaign could be coming. Here is a look at signs the United States could be planning to expand air attacks on the Sunni jihadists rampaging through northern Iraq: . Look before you launch . A U.S. official told CNN that Obama has authorized reconnaissance flights over Syria that are seen as a forerunner of possible U.S. airstrikes there against ISIS, which calls itself Islamic State. At the same time, the U.S. military and intelligence communities are gathering information on the locations of ISIS leadership and troop concentrations in Syria, according to two U.S. officials. Obama authorizes reconnaissance flights over Syria, U.S. official says . Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby, speaking generally, told CNN on Monday that ""you certainly want to get as much of a view on the ground as you can, as much situational awareness as you can"" in order to conduct operations in Syria. Laying the groundwork . Obama's top military man, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, last week provided the fundamental reasoning for going after ISIS in Syria. ""Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no,"" Dempsey told reporters. ""That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border"" with Iraq. The U.S. military began airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq earlier this month, helping Kurdish and Iraqi forces halt the Islamic extremists' murderous advance. One reason given by the administration for the aerial campaign was to protect military advisers previously sent to Iraq to work with Iraqi and Kurdish forces. 5 key questions in the fight against ISIS . The same rationale of protecting U.S. personnel and interests can be applied to expanding airstrikes across the border easily exploited by ISIS. ""While the President has not made a decision to take additional military actions at this time, we don't restrict our options by geographic boundaries when it comes to the central mission of protecting our people,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Monday. Now the question becomes establishing that ISIS poses a direct threat and building enough international and domestic support to act. The video of ISIS beheading American journalist James Foley helps make the case, as does the estimated 2,000 or so foreigners including Europeans and Americans fighting for ISIS who could return home. Obama will host a meeting of leaders of the U.N. Security Council next month to discuss the threat of foreign fighters in ISIS. Going into Syria . Last week, his former point man on Syria, Frederic Hof, told CNN that a failed U.S. mission to rescue Foley earlier this year established a precedent of American forces entering Syrian territory without government permission. On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited the U.S. mission that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan as another example of going into a country without government permission to protect the safety or interests of Americans. In a speech Tuesday to the American Legion, Obama mentioned increased U.S. assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq fighting ISIS as well as moderate opposition forces in Syria battling both ISIS and the government of President Bashar al-Assad. By lumping together the Kurds and Syrian opposition, Obama signaled his view of the conflict as a regional one regardless of the two countries involved. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel later announced that seven countries had joined the United States in providing ""urgently needed arms and equipment"" to the Kurdish forces. Those are: Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Denmark, Croatia and Albania, he said. ""Operations have already begun and will accelerate in the coming days with more nations also expected to contribute,"" Hagel's statement said. Is Obama heading toward airstrikes in Syria? Regional support . At the American Legion national convention, Obama also touted the nation's ability to galvanize international coalitions to respond to crises. ""History teaches us of the dangers of overreaching and spreading ourselves too thin, and trying to go it alone without international support,"" he said. According to Hof, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, the President would seek such international support now to take on ISIS. Key members would be Middle East allies that have air power provided by the United States, he said. Two such countries -- Egypt and United Arab Emirates -- reportedly launched airstrikes this week on Islamist targets in the ongoing Libyan conflict. In addition, U.S. allies in the region dealing with a rise in Islamic extremism have condemned ISIS over the beheading of Foley and other atrocities. Political pressure . Hawkish Republicans such as Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have long called for Obama to get involved militarily in Syria's civil war, at least by arming the opposition trying to topple al-Assad. The lightning advance by ISIS from Syria across northern Iraq in recent months escalated criticism of Obama for his reticence in Syria, and now a broad swath of GOP voices demands a strong military response. Even Obama's former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has made clear she advocated a bigger U.S. role in the Syrian conflict when it began three years ago. With congressional elections looming in November and a presidential vote in two years, such questioning only will increase. While the critics cite a strategic argument, conservatives see an opportunity to simultaneously push for two core goals -- building up the military after cuts under Obama, and reducing resources available to the rest of what they consider to be excessive government.","No decision yet by President Obama, the White House says .

"The grand jury investigating Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, has spent months looking into the case. Brown, an unarmed black teen, was shot to death by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on August 9. A grand jury weighing whether to indict Wilson has several options from which to choose, ranging from finding no probable cause that a crime was committed to charging him with murder. With apprehension filling the air, Ferguson awaits ruling . ""The thing that's in common is that Michael Brown is dead and that his death was caused by the actions of Officer Wilson,"" Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said about the various options. ""What changes with each one is really the mental state and the circumstances."" Complete coverage on Ferguson . According to Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office, the grand jury is focused on whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Here's a look at those charges in more detail: . First-degree murder . This is the most serious of the possible charges. To prove first-degree murder, prosecutors would not only have to show that Wilson killed Brown, which is not in dispute, but they'd have to prove that he did so after deliberating on the matter. Deliberation is typically proved by showing some sort of planning, although planning can take place within a relatively short period of time. If Wilson is charged and then eventually found guilty of first-degree murder, he could face up to life in prison without parole, or death, if the death penalty is sought, according to Joy. Second-degree murder . To prove second-degree murder, prosecutors would have to show that Wilson knowingly caused Brown's death -- that he knew what he was doing was going to cause serious physical injury or death. According to Joy, if Wilson is found guilty of second-degree murder, he could face up to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Voluntary manslaughter . Voluntary manslaughter is the act of killing another person while under the influence of a sudden passion. If prosecutors can prove Wilson acted while in a fit of anger or rage when he shot Brown, they might be able to secure a conviction on voluntary manslaughter. If they do, according to Joy, Wilson's sentence could be from five to 15 years. Involuntary manslaughter . Involuntary manslaughter is when someone causes the death of another by being reckless. He might not mean to kill the other person but didn't take the necessary precautions not to do so. If prosecutors can prove Wilson didn't know what he was doing when he fired in the direction of Brown, they might be able to secure an involuntary manslaughter conviction. If found guilty, Joy said, Wilson could be sentenced to no more than seven years in prison. No charges . Of course, it's entirely possible that the grand jury will find there is no probable cause to charge Wilson with anything. In this case, it would have to decide Wilson was justified in shooting Brown -- perhaps he feared for his life or acted in self-defense. If the grand jury decided against an indictment, Wilson would continue to be a free man, at least so far as the state's criminal charges. Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations, one into Brown's killing and the other into the local police department's overall track record with minorities.

"They were part of an elite squad confronting wildfires on the front line, setting up barriers to stop the spreading destruction. But in their unpredictable world, it doesn't take much to turn a situation deadly. In this case, a wind shift and other factors caused a central Arizona fire, which now spans 8,400 acres, to become erratic, said Mike Reichling, Arizona State Forestry Division spokesman. Though the deaths are under investigation, the inferno appears to have proved too much, even for the shelters the 19 firefighters carried as a last-ditch survival tool. ""The fuels were very dry, the relative humidity was low, the wind was coming out of the south. It turned around on us because of monsoon action,"" Reichling told CNN affiliate KNXV. ""That's what caused the deaths. The firefighters -- members of the Prescott Fire Department's Granite Mountain Hotshots -- were killed Sunday while fighting the Yarnell Hill fire, northwest of Phoenix. Among the dead was Eric Marsh, the unit's 43-year-old superintendent. Honoring the fallen . Also killed, according to the city of Prescott: Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin Deford, 24; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin, 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; and Garret Zuppiger, 27. The deaths of the 19 -- representing about 20 percent of Prescott's fire department -- devastated the city.  Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo, who sent the unit at the request of regional authorities, said he was told that one of the firefighters had radioed they were about to deploy their fire shelters, a sort of aluminum blanket that protects against the flames and heat -- and a measure of last resort. All he could do was wait. Only heartbreak followed. ""We just lost 19 of some of the finest people you'll ever meet. Right now, we're in crisis,"" Fraijo told reporters. A 20th member of the unit was working on an assignment away from his team and survived, Fraijo said. ""He feels terribly, and we all feel terribly. Unfortunately, we have very few words to express that kind of sorrow, but we understood each other. When you take a person in your arms and you hug them, you don't have to say too much,"" he said. A tribute to the firefighters grew Monday outside Prescott Fire Station No. 7. Flowers, American flags and signs -- including those reading ""19 Great guys gone -- you will be missed"" and ""Prescott 19 forever in our hearts"" -- were placed on or near a fence that separated the station from a road. The tokens also included 19 bottles of water, arranged in a circle. Also left was a copy of The Firefighter's Prayer, which contains the lines, ""And if, according to my fate, I am to lose my life/Please bless with your protecting hand my children and my wife."" Gov. Jan Brewer called the loss ""unbearable"" during a Monday news conference and said she understood the pain people are dealing with. ""For now, we mourn,"" she said. The wildfire, which is considered the deadliest in state history, began Friday near Yarnell, apparently because of lightning strikes, according to Brewer's office and other authorities. The fire wasn't contained at all on Monday morning, and about 200 homes and other structures have burned in the area of Yarnell, a community of about 600 people, the state forestry division said. About 400 ground personnel and 100 incident-management staff were working to control the fire Monday. There are no other reported injuries from the blaze, Reichling said. ""As we face the day the highest priority is for the fallen comrades,"" said Roy Hall, an incident commander with the state forestry division. ""We got a lot of hotshot crews in the nation, and they are the elite of the ground firefighters. They're highly trained and highly specialized. They are a younger generation. That's the tragedy of it, that lives would be lost of such a young group."" He added of the fire, ""We know that there are values to be protected and efforts that need to be ongoing in this fire. It's a long ways from being over."" Firefighters will work on the eastern side of the fire in an effort to protect homes in evacuated areas, as air tankers drop fire retardant on the perimeter and five helicopters douse hot spots with water. Billows of thick black smoke covered the sky as the giant flames leaped from one stretch of parched land to another. With high temperatures -- it hit 98 degrees in Yarnell on Monday -- and dry fuel in the fire's path, firefighters faced tough conditions in a race to contain the blaze. Hotshot crews are elite firefighters . Sunday was the deadliest day for firefighters since the 9/11 attacks. And it is the deadliest wildland fire since 1933, when 25 firefighters died as a blaze burned in light chaparral near Griffith Park, California, according to a list from the U.S. National Wildfire Coordinating Group. Mary Rasmussen, spokeswoman for the incident command team charged with fighting the blaze, said the cause of the firefighters' deaths is being investigated, and answers might come in the next three days. Authorities have information that during the blaze, the firefighters deployed their fire shelters. The shelters must be timed well. Set it up too soon, and the heat inside the shelter can become suffocating. Deploy it too late, and the fire is already on top of you. Wearing gloves, a firefighter will lie on the ground under the shelter, the ground being the only thing keeping the firefighter cool. The shelter will block 100% of the heat from flames and hot gases and 95% of the radiant heat from the flames themselves. Wildfires: Fast facts . Drivers fleeing the area were chased by dark plumes filling the air. Some evacuees paused to look from afar, wondering if the flames had torched their homes. The blaze hadn't touched Prescott yet. But like many other fire departments across the state, the Prescott team jumped in to help. ""A hotshot crew are the elite firefighters,"" state forestry spokesman Art Morrison said. ""They're usually (a) 20-person crew, and they're the ones who actually go in and dig the fire line, cut the brush to make a fuel break. And so they would be as close to the fire as they felt they safely could."" ""In normal circumstances, when you're digging fire line, you make sure you have a good escape route, and you have a safety zone set up,"" Morrison said. ""Evidently, their safety zone wasn't big enough, and the fire just overtook them."" 'Words cant describe the loss' One of the firefighters -- Woyjeck, the son of a Los Angeles County fire captain --  joined the Prescott unit just three months ago. Woyjeck, an avid outdoorsman, always wanted to be a firefighter like his father, Joe Woyjeck told ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday evening. Joe Woyjeck said he last talked to his son by phone on Sunday morning. ""He said, 'Dad, we got a fire in Yarnell, Arizona. ... I'll give you a call later,'"" the elder Woyjeck recalled. He said it hasn't sunk in yet that he won't get that phone call. ""Words can't describe the loss that our family is feeling right now,"" Joe Woyjeck said. Kevin Woyjeck wasn't the only firefighter's son in the Granite Mountain crew. MacKenzie was the son of retired California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Mike MacKenzie, according to that department. 'They were heroes' Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano urged residents in the area to heed local authorities' instructions, while lamenting the loss of so many firefighters. ""Today, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the 19 firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty,"" she said in a written statement. ""As thousands of their colleagues continue to fight wildfires across Arizona and the West, the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA are working closely with our federal partners including the Forest Service and the Department of Interior, to support state and local efforts."" President Barack Obama also lauded the efforts of the fallen firefighters, saying their deaths are heartbreaking and ""our thoughts and prayers go out"" to their families. His administration stands ready to help in any way necessary, he said. ""They were heroes -- highly skilled professionals who, like so many across our country do every day, selflessly put themselves in harm's way to protect the lives and property of fellow citizens they would never meet,"" he said in an earlier statement. Volunteer firefighters step up despite personal tragedy, looming danger . Brewer, who was to visit Prescott on Monday, said the loss marked ""as dark a day as I can remember."" She has ordered state flags be flown at half-staff from sunrise Monday to sunset Wednesday, and issued an emergency declaration that will make $200,000 available for response and recovery, while authorizing mobilization of the National Guard, if necessary. ""It may be days or longer before an investigation reveals how this tragedy occurred, but the essence we already know in our hearts: fighting fires is dangerous work,"" she said. ""When a tragedy like this strikes, all we can do is offer our eternal gratitude to the fallen, and prayers for the families and friends left behind."" Fraijo said the firefighters who died were exceptionally dedicated to their jobs. ""These are the guys that will go out there with 40, 50 pounds of equipment and walk five miles. They'll sleep out there as they try to develop fire lines"" to protect homes, Fraijo said. Before the 19 deaths in Arizona, 43 firefighters had been killed so far in 2013, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. A total of 83 firefighters died last year while on duty. A Facebook page in memory of the Arizona firefighters garnered more than 120,000 ""likes"" in less than 10 hours. ""Such a tragic loss,"" one person wrote.

"A nurse's assistant in Spain is the first person known to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa in the current outbreak. Spanish Health Minister Ana Mato announced Monday that a test confirmed the assistant has the virus. The woman helped treat a Spanish missionary and a Spanish priest, both of whom had contracted Ebola in West Africa. Both died after returning to Spain. Health officials said she developed symptoms on September 30. She was not hospitalized until this week. Her only symptom was a fever. ""We are working in coordination to give the best care to the patient and to guarantee the safety of all citizens,"" the health minister said. An investigation is under way to find everyone the assistant may have had contact with while contagious. So far, there are no other known cases. The assistant was one of about 30 health professionals in Spain who helped to treat the Ebola patients. The news came amid growing fears in the United States that the disease could spread. ""As I've said from the start of this outbreak, I consider this a top national security priority. This is not just a matter of charity ... This is an issue about our safety,"" President Barack Obama told reporters Monday. He called for protocols to help stop the spread of the disease, while downplaying the risk of an epidemic in the United States. ""We're also going to be working on protocols to do additional passenger screening, both at the source and here in the United States,"" he said. ""Here in the United States, at least, the chances of an outbreak -- of an epidemic here -- are extraordinarily low."" Texas Gov.: Quarantines at borders . To avoid an outbreak, the federal government should start enhanced screening and quarantines at borders, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said earlier Monday. ""There's only so much that a state can do,"" said Perry, whose state is the first to have a patient diagnosed with the disease inside the United States. Thomas Eric Duncan flew into the United States last month from Liberia, the country hit hardest by the epidemic. He was coming to visit family and friends. After his Ebola diagnosis at a Dallas hospital, Duncan now lies in an isolation unit in critical condition. He is receiving brincidofovir, health officials said Monday. The experimental antiviral drug was originally developed to treat life-threatening viruses including smallpox. But antiviral drugs can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases. ""We appreciate and we applaud the assistance we've received from the Centers for Disease Control and other federal agencies we've worked with,"" he said. But, he added, ""Washington needs to take immediate steps to minimize the dangers of Ebola and other infectious diseases."" Customs and Border Protection ""should immediately be directed to conduct enhanced screening procedures, obtaining more information about people who are coming from affected areas,"" and taking ""appropriate steps"" as simple as taking a person's temperature, Perry said at a news conference. The procedures ""will also necessitate fully staffed, prepared quarantine stations wherever people are entering the country, ready to care for anyone whose screening turns up a concern, helping to prevent contagions from entering this country,"" he said. Perry also announced the signing of an executive order creating the Texas Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response. The group is charged with studying and improving the state's plans for dealing with outbreaks such as Ebola and helping Texas quickly halt the spread of diseases. It will also share expertise with other states when needed. Patient's dad: I told him not to cover the outbreak . As he spoke, another state was treating its second Ebola patient in the current outbreak. The first was Dr. Rick Sacra, who was treated and no longer has Ebola. Freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted the virus while covering the epidemic in West Africa, arrived for treatment in isolation at Nebraska Medical Center on Monday. His father, Mitchell Levy, said he had tried to dissuade his son from going to cover the outbreak. ""I told him he was crazy,"" Levy said. Mukpo was strong enough to walk off the plane, said Dr. Brad Britigan with the hospital. Doctors are evaluating his condition. U.S. troops set to deploy to West Africa: Will they be safe? 'All options on the table' for screening at U.S. entry points . To prevent more situations like Duncan's, federal officials are now considering tougher screening measures, . ""All options are on the table for further strengthening the screening process here in the U.S.,"" a federal official said. They include thermometer checks for fever, something West African authorities are already doing. But finding the right passengers to screen is not so simple. Direct flights from Ebola-affected areas are rare. Travelers typically take flights that connect through other countries. ""Then they come here, so that makes it more of a challenge,"" the official said. And even if Duncan had undergone a temperature screening, it would have turned up negative. Many people with Ebola have no symptoms at first. Who's in charge of stopping Ebola in the U.S.? So while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering enhanced screenings at major U.S. airports, according to a CDC official, there are no concrete plans. ""We're looking at all of the options. We want to do something that protects Americans, not something that either is done for show or something that won't have an impact,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" when asked about what new protocols could be put in place. Frieden spoke shortly after meeting with Obama and other senior leaders to discuss next steps. Officials want to make sure that new screenings would be worth potentially disrupting air travel and that they wouldn't unintentionally increase the risk of spreading the disease. ""The question that's being considered now and readdressed is that, should there be entry screening of some sort?"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""If you do implement it, what would it look like and what would be the resources that are necessary to implement it?""

"After days of relentlessly questioning Merrill about his role in the Korean War, the North Korean ""investigator"" suddenly switched subjects. ""They started in on why I came,"" Newman recalled. ""I said it was because I wanted to find out what was really going on in North Korea. Then they began to focus on my asking our guides to help me locate old soldiers or their relations or descendants if we got to Kuwol Mountain. ""They tried to make it into the main reason for my visit. I tried to get across that the business of me contacting people was just an aside. It was just incidental. It wasn't the main thing."" The investigator erupted. ""You're lying! You're guilty of espionage. You've got to be honest with us."" ""I apologized for trying to reconnect. I continued to maintain that the purpose was just to get a better understanding of North Korea. But that was the 'crime' in their eyes—illegally using the tour as a cover."" Wartime contacts . The North Koreans were particularly interested in an email that Newman had sent before his trip to his elderly wartime contacts in Seoul. The ""investigator"" asked about the ""Kuwol comrades."" Did they have an office? How big was it? How much time had Merrill spent with them? ""I was not completely forthcoming,"" Newman said. He sought to downplay the group and his connection to it, describing the Seoul office as small and nondescript, and lying about how much time he'd spent with the former guerrillas. He was worried that his interrogators would realize that he wasn't telling the whole truth, but they never did. The ""investigator"" also accused Merrill of ""criticizing"" the DPRK, referring specifically to his conversation with fellow tourist Bob Hamdrla in which he noted the resources North Korea's government wasted on monuments in such an impoverished country. Clearly, their guide Hyon-yi, who always seemed to be listening in to their conversations from her seat in the back of their minivan, had reported that comment to security officials. 'Major crimes' In mid-November, Merrill was told again that he committed ""major crimes"" and that he was to prepare for a meeting with a ""senior official"" where he would make a formal ""confession."" ""They said: 'This is the guy who will decide whether you stay or go home.'"" In the days before the meeting, the investigator and the interpreter made Merrill write out what he would say. ""The statement used words they dictated,"" Merrill said. ""I did not try to tidy the language. I wanted it clearly understood [by those outside North Korea] that these were not my words, though in my handwriting."" The meeting took place on November 9, 2013, in a large room on the ground floor of the Yanggakdo Hotel, where Newman was being held. Merrill was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, but the interpreter told him that was not formal enough, so he changed to a long-sleeved one. Merrill was instructed to be very respectful, to stand up when the official entered the room, and then to read the statement. The official appeared to be in his 50s, wearing a well-tailored uniform, with a serious, formal demeanor. With video cameras rolling and his hands shaking, Merrill began. Confession? ""During the Korean War, I have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes ... as I killed so many civilians and KPA [Korean People's Army] soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people. ""Although 60 years have gone by, I came to DPRK on the excuse of the tour ... Shamelessly, I had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers ... I also brought the e-book criticizing the Socialist DPRK and criticizing DPRK. ""I realize that I cannot be forgiven for any offensives but I beg for pardon on my knees ... Please forgive me."" At the end of the statement, Newman bowed to the camera. He then signed it, and stamped the paper with his thumbprint. ""You make a confession because you don't have any choice,"" he said. ""They have the key. And there isn't any duplicate."" But having now done so, he thought the North Koreans would move to release him. ""I had a calendar on the wall, and I counted those days, and I got closer and closer, I was figuring there is no way I am still going to be here for Thanksgiving."" But nothing happened. Merrill remained confined in his hotel room. In moments of depression, Merrill began to wonder if he would ever be released.","Former CNN correspondent looks at the case of Merrill Newman, arrested in North Korea in 2013 .

"(CNN)Canadian police stopped a plot in which at least two people had obtained weapons and planned to open fire in a public place on Valentine's Day before committing suicide, authorities said Friday. Three people have been arrested and a fourth suspect was found dead in a residence, Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commanding Officer Brian Brennan said at a press conference. Brennan did not reveal the suspects' alleged motives, only saying they were ""a group of individuals who had some beliefs and were willing to carry out violent acts."" Their motivation, he said, was ""not culturally based."" Authorities received a tip Thursday morning that a 19-year-old Timberlea man and a 23-year old Geneva, Illinois, woman had weapons and planned to go to a public location in Halifax on Saturday with ""a goal of opening fire to kill citizens, and then themselves,"" Brennan said. ""The possibility for a large loss of life was definitely there,"" he said, declining to say what public place they planned to use. Police went to a residence on Thursday and found the 19-year-old suspect dead, Brennan said. He would not say how the man died. The woman and a 20-year-old man were arrested at about 2 a.m. Friday at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, he said, and later in the day police arrested a 17-year-old male.

"Spice, bath salts, herbal incense. They sound like something you might find on the fragrance aisle at Target, but these are actually dangerous drugs masked as harmless fragrances, sold in convenience stores and online. Innocent names such as Mr. Smiley hide the dangers. No one really knows what's in these so-called synthetic drugs.  Manufacturers play a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with law enforcement by constantly changing the chemical compounds of the drugs to circumvent existing laws. Teen recovers after smoking synthetic pot . Last week, Colorado health authorities announced that they -- along with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- are investigating a rash of hospitalizations and three deaths believed to be the result of smoking synthetic marijuana. And real marijuana is legal in Colorado. CNN's Drew Griffin, who got exclusive access to a federal sweep of synthetic drugs earlier this year, spoke to John Scherbenske, a Drug Enforcement Administration official who oversees its Synthetic Drugs and Chemicals section. Scherbenske helped shed light on these manufactured drugs and why the DEA has stepped up its attempts to target those who sell these drugs and raise awareness about the dangers. Here's what you need to know: . What exactly are synthetic drugs? There is no exact definition, because the term is used to describe a wide range of chemical products that are ever-changing.  Synthetic marijuana and ""bath salts"" are the most common of these drugs, which are often sold as incense or plant food.  Unlike drugs such as marijuana and cocaine, these drugs do not come from plants; they are manmade.  Synthetic marijuana consists of drug chemicals that are sprayed on plant materials and sometimes marketed as potpourri. While methamphetamine and MDMA -- also known as ""ecstasy"" or ""molly"" -- are technically synthetic drugs because they are made entirely from chemicals, the term ""synthetic drugs"" usually refers to bath salts and synthetic marijuana that are often sold in stores and online as household items. When did they start appearing in the United States and who's using them? These drugs first appeared in the United States around 2009, according to Scherbenske, and they have since exploded in popularity, particularly among teenagers. ""The biggest user population of these drugs are 12- to 17-year-olds,"" Scherbenske said. He believes they are popular among younger folks ""because they are easily accessible,"" whether it's in a convenience store, a smoke shop or online. Social media-savvy teens use the Internet to spread the word about where to find these drugs to -- as Scherbenske explains -- ""discuss the effects these substances had on their body."" What's the point of making synthetic drugs? Well, synthetic drugs makers have easy access to customers by marketing these drugs as harmless household items. So they make lots of money. ""It is very profitable business,"" said Scherbenske. ""There have been multimillion dollar seizure -- cash seizure with these people that are selling these drugs."" Are these drugs legal? It's a tricky question because the laws cannot keep up with the variety of chemical compounds. The federal government and at least 38 states have taken steps to ban the substances. But, as soon as one compound is banned, the molecular structure of the synthetic product is altered and that ""changes the whole structure of the drug, so the drug becomes legal and we're at it again,"" James Capra, DEA chief of operations, said at a news conference in June, according to Time magazine. Retailers are also skirting the law by labeling the drugs as ""not for human consumption,"" according to the DEA's Scherbenske. ""It's a cat-and-mouse game that these retailers are using,"" he said.  ""There is an underground market that know exactly how to abuse that product to get high."" Everyone knows that drugs are harmful.  So what's the big deal about these? Most drug manufacturers aim to refine their drug for purity, to increase the street value and their profit margin. But with synthetic drugs, the manufacturers' main goal is to alter the chemical compound to stay one step ahead of the law. ""The U.S. has encountered over 200 new substances over the past four years,"" Scherbenske explained. ""Our chemists are finding multiple drugs, multiple compounds when we make purchases of these drugs."" And that means there's no standard when it comes to these drugs. ""When we buy these substances and send them to the lab, they could have one compound in it, or they could have five separate compounds."" The combination of those compounds and their reactions ""is very scary,"" Scherbenske said. ""We do not know the long term effect that it will have on a person's body."" Emily Bauer went from being a normal 16-year-old to nearly dying after trying a form of synthetic marijuana packaged as ""potpourri"" that she bought with her friends at a gas station.  Her family believes the drug is what caused her to have several strokes, which have limited her physical and mental abilities. Synthetic drugs also have ""unpredictable effects on human behavior,"" according to Dr. Paul Adams, who works in an emergency room in Miami. ""This is a terrible drug because it takes a combination of methamphetamine, and the paranoia and the aggressiveness, and LSD, the hallucinations, and PCP, the extreme paranoia that you get, (and) combines it into one,"" Adams explained. Police in Panama City, Florida, reported two violent incidents linked to use of bath salts in 2011. In one, a woman allegedly tried to behead her 71-year-old mother; in the second, a man on bath salts used his teeth to tear up the back seat of a patrol car. That's particularly troublesome when some retailers are marketing synthetic drugs as a safer, legal alternative. Who is making this stuff? Most of the chemicals that are used to make these synthetic drugs are coming directly from China, according to the DEA's John Scherbenske. ""They ship the bulk product here in the United States, where we have individuals that will take that product and package it for retail distribution,"" he explained. According to a recent article in Time magazine, the drugs come mostly from ""suburban laboratories around Chinese port cities ... from where they can be easily shipped to Europe or North America using regular international courier services."" They're also available in larger quantities and sold over the Internet as ""research chemicals,"" according to Time. The DEA is ""in dialogue"" with China about the problem, Scherbenske said, without offering specifics. ""We are also in dialogue and conversation with our international counterparts experiencing the same issues that we are in this designer drug problem,"" he said. ""That is one of the ways to fight this problem is through demand reduction and the education of the people who are using these products."" So who's selling it here in the U.S.? Scherbenske says people are starting their own businesses to sell these drugs once they see the profit potential. ""And they are starting to become organized,"" he added.  ""Is it organized crime? Not at this point, but they are figuring out ways to work around our laws. They are making millions of dollars figuring out how to launder that money. We don't even know if they are paying taxes on this money."" These retailers have even taken the feds to court to protect their business: four stores sued the DEA in 2011, claiming the federal agency was ""impeding their business,"" Scherbenske said. ""We don't have a problem with people selling legitimate items. But when you are selling basic rat poison to our children, we do take issue with that.""","Synthetic drugs are often sold as harmless fragrances or household items .

Likely unbeknownst to LA, her 100 or so tweets since November have each been geo-tagged, allowing Weyers to see her tweets: first, in Toronto, then ar Raqqah, Kobani, Aleppo and Mosul. What strikes Weyers is LA's access to the front lines of battles between ISIS and other militant groups in Syria. He points to a tweet she posted from just outside Kobani in December, right in the middle of a battleground between ISIS and the YPG. ""Why is a female right in the center of these two groups battling it out?"" Weyers said. ""This is something we've never seen in a female profile before. For ISIS to give her permission to be on those front lines, it would have to come from a high-up source."" Weyers tracks LA along with about 20 other Canadians in Syria who are suspected to have ties to ISIS. But to him, LA is the most fascinating because he believes she is a woman. ""The fact that she's in these forward positions suggests that ISIS is trying to change up their strategy, or that they're under stress in terms of some of their recent losses,"" Weyers said. Indeed, LA claims to be treated with respect by ISIS. While outside Kobani, LA tweeted in December: ""Quote me: They treated me as a sister and I have seen no kindness like theirs."" But, could LA's tweets cause her trouble in Canada? Janice Stein, professor of conflict management at The University of Toronto, said she believes proposed Canadian legislation would allow law enforcement in the future to not only stop people who have publicly shown support for terror groups to travel abroad to fight for them, but would also give cause to arrest someone for simply voicing support for a terror group. ""It will be -- when this legislation passes -- a criminal act to support terrorism,"" Stein said. ""So, that is criminalizing speech rather than behavior. That one, I bet, will be tested in the courts."" The question for Weyers and other researchers is: What is LA's plan in Syria? The choice between encouraging authorities to take down her Twitter feed for fear of radicalizing others is complicated by the need for her to keep tweeting so authorities and researchers can gather more intelligence on her and ISIS. Despite Weyers' best efforts to track LA unnoticed, her Twitter account no longer exists as of last week. Twitter would not comment on whether the account was taken down by the user or by Twitter.","Canadian counterterror research group tracks woman on ISIS' Syrian lines .

"(CNN) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted Wednesday that the Obama administration mischaracterizes concessions by his side in the six-month nuclear deal with Iran, telling CNN in an exclusive interview that ""we did not agree to dismantle anything."" Zarif told CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto that terminology used by the White House to describe the agreement differed from the text agreed to by Iran and the other countries in the talks -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany. ""The White House version both underplays the concessions and overplays Iranian commitments"" under the agreement that took effect Monday, Zarif said in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum. As part of the accord, Iran was required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20%, well above the 5% level needed for power generation but still below the level for developing a nuclear weapon. In addition, the deal mandated that Iran halt all enrichment above 5% and ""dismantle the technical connections required to enrich above 5%,"" according to a White House fact sheet issued in November after the initial agreement was reached. Zarif accused the Obama administration of creating a false impression with such language. ""The White House tries to portray it as basically a dismantling of Iran's nuclear program. That is the word they use time and again,"" he said, urging Sciutto to read the actual text of the agreement. ""If you find a single, a single word, that even closely resembles dismantling or could be defined as dismantling in the entire text, then I would take back my comment."" He repeated that ""we are not dismantling any centrifuges, we're not dismantling any equipment, we're simply not producing, not enriching over 5%."" ""You don't need to over-emphasize it,"" Zarif said of the White House language. A separate summary sent out by the White House last week did not use the word dismantle. In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani echoed Zarif's statement, saying the government will not destroy existing centrifuges. However, he added: ""We are ready to provide confidence that there should be no concern about Iran's program."" Responding to Zarif's comments to CNN, a senior administration official said ""we expected that the Iranians would need to spin this for their domestic political purposes, and are not surprised they are doing just that."" Iranian and U.S. officials have tried to sell the nuclear agreement to domestic opponents in their respective countries who could scuttle it. Iranian officials have called the interim pact a victory and said it failed to halt the nation's nuclear development program, while U.S. officials say the agreement essentially froze Iran's nuclear program and rolled back some capabilities. Zarif noted the political pressure facing both sides, which includes a push in Congress for more sanctions against Iran that Tehran warns would destroy any chance for success in talks on a long-range nuclear agreement intended to prevent development of an Iranian nuclear weapon. ""All of us are facing difficulties and oppositions and concerns and misgivings,"" he said, noting he had been summoned Wednesday to Iran's parliament to answer questions. Asked about his relationship with Secretary of State John Kerry, Zarif called it ""very difficult because we're both going into these negotiations with a lot of baggage."" Progress has been made, he said, but ""it's yet too early to talk about trust."" Zarif and Rouhani traveled to Switzerland for annual gathering of world political and business leaders in Davos as a new round of Syrian talks started in Montreux before moving to Geneva. Iran, a major backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was invited to the Syrian talks by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, then disinvited under pressure from the United States because Tehran refused to endorse conditions in a previous agreement setting up the talks. ""We do not like the way Iran was treated,"" he said, adding ""it did not enhance the credibility of the United Nations or the office of the Secretary General."" Zarif expressed hope that the Syrian talks could succeed, but he criticized Syrian opposition groups and their supporters that opposed Iran's participation in the talks for what he called spreading extremism and trying to impose their will on the Syrian people. He explained Iran's support for the Syrian government, a longtime ally, by saying ""Iran finds itself in a situation where we see the very prominent and serious danger of terrorism, extremism, sectarian tension being fed from outside and creating a very dangerous environment in Syria."" To Zarif, an agreement among Syrians that brings a democratically elected government is the only solution, and he dismissed concerns that a free and fair vote would be impossible with al-Assad in power and running as a candidate. Kerry said earlier Wednesday in Montreux that there was ""no way"" al-Assad will be part of a transitional government sought by the Geneva talks. ""Why don't we talk about it?"" Zarif asked. ""And why don't we allow the Syrians to talk about how they can conduct a free and fair election? Why do people need to set an agenda and impose their agenda on the Syrian people?"" Sciutto also asked Zarif about his visit last week to lay a wreath at the grave of Hezbollah leader Imad Mugniyah in Lebanon. The United States condemned the gesture, saying Mugniyah was ""responsible for heinous acts of terrorism that killed hundreds of innocent people, including Americans,"" said a statement by National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden. Zarif responded that his visit should be seen in the same context as the U.S. delegation that attended the recent funeral of Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli leader who was defense minister when mass killings occurred at refugee camps under his command in 1982. ""It's a decision based on national perceptions and national beliefs,"" he said, describing Mugniyah as a revered figure for resisting Israeli occupation while calling Sharon responsible for the massacre of Palestinians and Lebanese in the Sabra and Shatila camps. ""I believe Sabra and Shatila were crimes against humanity,"" Zarif said. Democracy: Egypt's beautiful dream in the wrong hands . Opinion: Will global elite listen to Pope of poor?

The suspect was detained in Newham, East London, by counterterrorism officers and is being held at a south London police station. He was arrested on suspicion of collecting information which may be useful to somebody who commits or prepares acts of terrorism, of being a member or supporter of ISIS, and of encouraging terrorism. The arrest is the latest in a series by UK police investigating suspected terror-related activities. Two women, age 23 and 33, were arrested near Birmingham on Wednesday on suspicion of of Syria-linked terrorism offenses.

"Washington (CNN)Jeb Bush got a public blessing from his mom Friday night, who said she changed her mind about having had too many Bushes, a reference to a statement she had once made when asked if son Jeb should run for President. ""Our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America. If America needs you for as long as you can help,"" former first lady Barbara Bush said. Her remarks seemed to flirt with being an endorsement for Jeb Bush to run for the highest office. Yet, they were made in the context of her son's involvement in charity work. Jeb Bush was speaking at a benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy in Bonita Springs, Florida. His mother's comments deliberately and publicly poked fun at the flap over her previous remarks. While talking about the number of family members involved in the cause, Jeb Bush said, ""My mother not long ago said, 'There have been enough Bushes' (in the White House). And it got me thinking, if we've had enough Bushes in one forum, do we have too many Bushes in the family literacy forum today?"" In a surprise for the audience, Barbara Bush appeared on the auditorium's big-screen monitors. She said, ""Just listening in.  Anyway ... what do you mean too many Bushes?  Are you talking about the legacy?  That's not what I'm talking about, but I've changed my mind."" ""Our problems are still so big in illiteracy that it doesn't matter what your last name is."" Jeb Bush said, ""Hey Mom, can I get that in writing, by the way, just for the record?"" His mother responded, ""I said our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America, if America needs you for as long as you can help.  And yes, you can get it in writing and in public."" Jeb responded, ""Mother, I love you. You're the greatest mom in the world and we're so inspired by everything that you (do)"".

"Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN)Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko declared a ceasefire went into effect at midnight Saturday local time (5 p.m. ET) between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian militants in the nation's east. The separatist Donetsk People's Republic also announced the ceasefire. But an apparent violation was reported less than 90 minutes after the ceasefire began when Ukraine's Anti-Terrorist Operation Command reported that a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region has been shelled by mortars. As a positive sign, CNN reporters in Ukraine reported the shelling quieted shortly after midnight. The peace agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus, several days ago comes with many questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick. Mistrust is high on both sides, adding to the doubts. The town of Debaltseve, a strategically located railroad hub in the east, is shaping up as a crucial piece of the ceasefire. In his speech announcing the ceasefire, Poroshenko said Ukrainian troops control the town and warned militants to stay away. ""I think the fact of using the tense situation on the outskirts of Debaltseve by militants-terrorists-mercenaries poses a great threat, which can violate the ceasefire regime,"" Poroshenko said. ""I am warning all participants of the Minsk negotiations, including the Russian Federation, which identifies itself as the guarantor of the reached agreements."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, reporting from the eastern town of Donetsk, said separatists claim to have encircled Debaltseve. ""Debaltseve will be a vital flashpoint for the hours ahead,"" he said. Poroshenko has warned that if the separatists do not abide by the ceasefire, he will impose martial law throughout Ukraine's territory, his spokesman Andrey Zhigulin told CNN. Poroshenko's office said he spoke on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and U.S. President Barack Obama in the hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect. ""The Ukrainian President has emphasized the need for monitoring by [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] to confirm the ceasefire,"" a statement from Poroshenko's office said. ""Petro Poroshenko and Barack Obama have agreed on further coordination of efforts in case of escalation of the conflict."" The White House said in a statement, ""The President spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko today to express his sympathy for the mounting toll of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and his deep concern about the ongoing violence, particularly in and around Debaltseve."" Separatist militants who spoke to CNN voiced their anger against government forces, whom they blame for the deaths and devastation in their communities. Shelling rocked two eastern Ukrainian cities Saturday ahead of the ceasefire, raising fears that the deal to end a bitter 10-month conflict may be in jeopardy. Both incoming and outgoing artillery could be seen in the vicinity of the coastal city of Mariupol, and there was significant shelling in Donetsk city, CNN teams reported. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council reported seven soldiers killed and 23 wounded in 24 hours. The council said additional forces were crossing the border from Russia into Ukraine in the area of Novoazovsk. Igor Martinov, separatist-appointed mayor of Donetsk, said two people were killed and four injured by shelling in the city center Saturday afternoon. Photographs of the scene appeared to show one of the dead in camouflage gear and the other in civilian clothing. Poroshenko said that after the agreement reached Thursday by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the offensive by the separatists had intensified. The separatists may be trying to take control of strategic locations, such as the railroad hub of Debaltseve to the north, before the ceasefire lines are drawn. Pro-Kiev militia have also been pushing forward around government-controlled Mariupol. As the shells rain down, the toll on eastern Ukraine's residents only grows. The Ukrainian military operation against the separatists said Friday that 14 civilians had been killed by rebel shelling, six in the village of Shchastya, five in the village of Hornyak and three in Artemivsk, according to the official Ukrinform news agency. Each side has accused the other of shelling civilian areas in the course of a conflict that has killed more than 5,000 people. Both sides are expected to start pulling back their heavy weapons from the front lines Monday, creating a buffer zone at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which already has a monitoring mission in Ukraine, has been given the challenging task of overseeing the process. ""We need to have an effective ceasefire,"" OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier said Friday. ""So I'm already concerned that we are seeing this morning a continuation of hostilities."" The OSCE hopes to see a reduction in hostilities between now and Saturday night, he said. ""I would expect the ceasefire to stop (armed) operations and to stop people where they are,"" he said. While Ukrainian forces have to pull back their heavy weapons from the front line as they stood Saturday night, separatist forces must pull back theirs from the front line as it was on September 19, when a previous peace agreement was signed in Minsk. That swiftly disintegrated amid continued violence. It also envisions prisoner swaps, new local elections in the conflict-affected regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, and a law granting amnesty to those involved in the the fighting. However, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said that those responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine last summer will not be given an amnesty under the Minsk agreement. This could be a potential hurdle to keeping the separatists on board. Western governments believe rebels used a Russian-supplied missile system to shoot down the jet, having mistaken it for a military aircraft, while Kiev says it was a Russian officer who pressed the button. The separatists and Russia have denied any responsibility. The Kremlin has said it hopes to see the latest peace plan succeed. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti on Friday that while Russia had helped to bring about the Minsk agreement, it wasn't in its power to fulfill it ""because Russia is not a participant in the conflict."" Russia has steadfastly denied accusations by Kiev and the West that it is sending forces and heavy weapons into Ukraine. But Kiev has accused it of continuing to do so even since the peace plan was signed in Minsk. Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, tweeted  that the separatists ""now have larger fighting force with more tanks armored vehicles, heavy artillery & rocket systems than some NATO and European countries."" He also posted satellite images which he claimed show ""Russian military, not separatist, systems"" deployed in eastern Ukraine. The United States has not ruled out providing ""lethal defensive aid"" to the Ukrainian military to help it defend against advances by the Russian-backed separatists. Ukrainian forces have just received a delivery of lightly armored military vehicles from Britain, but that country's Ministry of Defence said the vehicles were delivered as part of a commercial contract signed by a private company in 2013, before the conflict started. A defense spokeswoman said Britain was not providing lethal aid to Ukraine. The trucks in question can offer protection to military personnel on the move but are not close combat vehicles, she added. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Mariupol and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and Nick Paton Walsh in Donetsk, Brian Walker, Alla Eshchenko and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report, as did journalists Victoria Butenko and Azad Safarov.","Ukraine military reports first violation of the ceasefire, saying motar fire hit a post near Zolote .

"The family behind  A&E's ""Duck Dynasty"" rallied around its patriarch Thursday, one day after the network suspended Phil Robertson over controversial remarks he made about gays and blacks in a magazine interview. ""While some of Phil's unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse, his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible. Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart' and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' Phil would never incite or encourage hate,"" the Robertsons said in a statement. The family called into question the future of the show. ""We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right. We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm.  We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty,"" it said. In the January issue of GQ, Robertson said homosexuality is a sin and puts it in the same category as bestiality and promiscuity. ""It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus. That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical,"" he's quoted as saying. When asked what he thought was sinful, Robertson replied: ""Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."" But homosexuals aren't alone, Robertson said. ""Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers -- they won't inherit the kingdom of God. Don't deceive yourself. It's not right."" Opinion: 'Duck Dynasty' suspension doesn't violate First Amendment . A&E said it was troubled by Robertson's statements. ""We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty,"" the network said in a statement Wednesday. ""His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely."" In addition to his comments about homosexuality, Robertson also spoke about race and growing up in Louisiana before the civil rights era. ""I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once,"" he told GQ. ""Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field. ... They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people' -- not a word! ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues,"" GQ quoted Robertson as saying. Did A&E make the right decision? Share your view . Outrage and support . The NAACP and the Human Rights Campaign wrote a joint letter to the president of A&E expressing ""outrage and deep concern about the recent racist, homophobic, and ill-informed remarks made by Phil Robertson."" ""Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow. What he didn't see were lynching and beatings of black men and women for attempting to vote or simply walking down the street,"" the letter states. ""And his offensive claims about gay people fly in the face of science. In fact, it's important to note that every single leading medical organization in the country has said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being LGBT -- it's not a choice, and to suggest otherwise is dangerous."" But by early Thursday night, more than 70,000 people had signed a change.org petition calling for A&E to bring Robertson back. ""Homosexuals have their convictions and Christians respect them,"" the organizer of the petition wrote. ""There is a difference between respecting someone rights to exercise free will and imposing on others what we believe. Phil has done nothing more than state what he believes in. Just because homosexuals do not agree, does not mean Mr. Robertson needs to be suspended."" Similarly, the Facebook page ""Bring Back Phil Robertson"" had more than 190,000 ""likes"" by Thursday night. Robertson responded to the brouhaha in a statement late Wednesday. ""I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me,"" he said. ""We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity."" ""Duck Dynasty"" follows a Louisiana bayou family that has ""made a fortune on duck calls,"" as A&E puts it. Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, ""which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck,"" the GQ article states. Videos of his family's duck hunts led to a show on the Outdoor Channel and eventually A&E, the article says. Season 5 of is set to premiere on January 15. According to A&E, its fourth season premiere in August drew nearly 12 million viewers to become the No. 1 nonfiction series telecast in cable history.

"(CNN)As another snowstorm barrels toward the already-buried Northeast this weekend, some folks have had just about all they can take. Dr. Steve Schlozman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, wrote this week that he has ""developed a new sympathy for my daughter's hamster,"" on WBUR's Common Health blog. ""She's seen the same cage, the same scene, the same everything, day in and day out,"" Schlozman wrote. ""But alas, my kid's hamster cannot work scissors, or a remote control for the television, or engage in any sort of higher order thinking."" But too much time for thinking in the winter can lead to trouble. Millions of Americans experience a serious mood change during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. The condition is called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, it's a type of depression, with symptoms such as: . • Sad, anxious or ""empty"" feelings . • Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism . • Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness . • Irritability, restlessness . • Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy . • Fatigue and decreased energy . • Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions . • Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping . • Changes in weight . • Thoughts of death or suicide . While the specific cause of SAD remains unknown, researchers have narrowed down a few factors that may come into play. ""Our inner clock, whose timing cycle does not necessarily match day and night outdoors, needs to stay in sync with rest-activity cycles dictated by family and work life,"" says Michael Terman, a professor of clinical psychology in psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. ""This is both very disorienting and a trigger for mood slumps and depression."" ""Since the inner clock relies on sunlight to stay in sync, winter sunrise is later and winter nights are longer, melatonin can overshoot into the day, causing grogginess or 'brain fog,' for several hours,"" Terman says. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep and wake cycles. Serotonin, one of many brain chemicals that affect mood, also varies seasonally, with lower levels in winter. According to the Mayo Clinic, SAD is diagnosed more often in women than in men, but men typically experience more severe symptoms. Younger people have a higher risk of SAD, and those affected are more likely to have blood relatives with SAD or another form of depression. So, how can you beat the winter blues? You've got a few options: . Light therapy is typically the treatment most people try first. You sit a few feet from a specially designed bright light, which mimics natural outdoor light. Solid scientific data is lacking, but light therapy appears to cause a change in brain chemicals linked to mood and seems to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms. You don't need a prescription from your doctor. There are options on websites such as Amazon for under $100. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate light-therapy products and, as you might expect, some of the manufacturers' claims are confusing and overreaching. The general consensus is to look for a light box that provides white light -- as opposed to blue or ""full spectrum"" -- with 10,000 lux of illumination and a broad diffuser screen that filters out UV rays. Most patients report phototherapy generally starts working in just a few days and results in few side effects; at worst: headaches, mild nausea, feelings of restlessness and trouble sleeping. If light therapy doesn't work, you might ask your doctor about a prescription for an antidepressant, especially if your symptoms are severe. Keep in mind that it might take a few weeks for the medication to fully kick in. Additionally, you may have to try a few different medications before you find one that works well for you and has the fewest side effects. If you want to go the natural route, psychotherapy is another option to treat SAD. Psychotherapy can help you identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that may be making you feel worse, learn healthy ways to cope with SAD and learn how to better manage stress. Of course, the best solutions to any problem are sometimes the simplest. • Get outside. Bundle up and take a walk, even a short one. Even on a cold or cloudy day, outdoor light can help -- especially if you soak it in within the first few hours or waking up in the morning. • Make time to work out. Exercise helps decrease stress and anxiety, both of which can increase symptoms of SAD. As we all know, being more in shape can make you feel better about yourself, too, which can lift your mood. • Last but not least: socialize. When you're feeling down, it can be hard to be social, but that's when it's most important to connect with those around you. So grab your spouse, your kids, a neighbor and let us see what you're up to by posting on social media using the hashtag #CNNsnow.","Yet more snow heading to Northeast United States this weekend .

"(CNN)To paraphrase the ESPN ""30 for 30"" sports documentary opening: ""What if I told you that a sport based on lying, cheating and rule bending worked perfectly fine as long as brown kids and fans paid the price?"" That title would never get past the editing room, and yet, stripping the Jackie Robinson West All-Stars team of its Little League World Series title for cheating can't be described any other way. The team's loss of a championship and vacated wins is not only another horrible reminder of the racial politics of American sports but a blatantly obvious lesson to kids that cheating is OK as long as you have the right money and branding on your side. America, or the remaining part of America that still cares about baseball, fell in love with the Jackie Robinson West team last year when out of nowhere it won the Little League U.S. Championship and gave American sports news two desperately needed narratives. First, that despite the gloom and doom and declining numbers, there was still a place for African-Americans in baseball; and second, that there was something going on with young black men out of Chicago that didn't involve guns, death or crime. And that story continued, until this week. The Evergreen Park League team, which Jackie Robinson trounced 43-2 on its way to a U.S. championship, made a couple of calls to Little League International accusing the All-Stars of violating residency boundaries for players. In other words, the Jackie Robinson West players were a ""superteam,"" which had an unfair advantage. Little League International, acting with a swiftness and severity that should embarrass the NBA, NFL and NCAA  managed to conduct an investigation, determine who was at fault and strip a bunch of kids of their championship because grown-ups cheated. This never should have happened.  Minor children should not have to suffer a crushing loss of their title because grown-ups cheated, and there are other ways the cheating parents and coaches could be punished without causing the kids to suffer. The sports myth in America is that whether you're Jesse Owens, Rudy or even the Average Joes, whatever your social class, race or background, when you get onto that field or court or arena it's a meritocracy. The cream will rise to the top, the best players succeed and cheaters get weeded out before the clock hits double zero. Has this ever been totally true in American sports? No. But if the Chicago team's namesake proved anything 50 years ago it's that no matter what shenanigans are pulled in the game, the good guys should win out. The racial context of this punishment is jarring enough. The Jackie Robinson West team is the first all African-American team to win the U.S. championship and suddenly the league decides to flip through the rulebooks? Unfortunately, increased scrutiny on all-black teams seems to be the norm for Little League International. Just ask the Ugandan Little League Team that has been blocked from competing in the United States and Europe twice in the last few years on technicalities that other teams have openly flouted for years. When the Jackie Robinson West players look back on this debacle, all they'll have learned is that cheating is fine as long as there's money to be made, you don't get caught, and if you do, the least powerful people end up suffering for it. Is Little League USA going to investigate every team that played in this year's tournament? Is it going to vacate wins from the ""whistleblowing"" Evergreen Park League that may have broken the same boundary rules three years ago? Better yet, will it return sponsorships, money and ticket sales to fans who attended these games with a ""cheating"" team they failed to identify? Of course they won't, just like cheaters in in big money high-school, college and professional sports seldom get their comeuppance. Didn't we just watch two weeks of ""Deflategate"" coverage where the New England Patriots were accused of breaking the rules again? But Tom Brady is the golden boy of a multi-billion dollar league, so even if NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell found a box of pressure gauges, a can of stick-um and a receipt for 30 Nerf Footballs from Dick's Sporting Goods in Brady's locker he wouldn't dare take back that Lombardi Trophy. You never want to give kids the impression that cheating is OK. But you know what's worse than kids thinking cheating is OK? When they learn that only certain cheaters get in trouble, but if you have the right money or fame or skin color you get a free pass. If Americans really cared about cheating and keeping sports as a real example to kids of hard work paying off, the solution is right in front of us. Everyone from the National Little League to the NFL to the NCAA would crack down on all cheating equally, no matter the color, the money involved or the prestige gained. And punishments would be levied against those responsible, instead of just those who are the most visible and vulnerable.","Jackie Robinson team is stripped of its title for violating residency rules .

"(CNN)The family of a Mexican national fatally shot by police in Pasco, Washington, has filed a $25 million claim against the city alleging that three officers killed the unarmed man ""execution style."" Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was shot by police Tuesday after he allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and Pasco officers. The city and the police department weren't commenting on the claim, Pasco City Manager Dave Zabell said Saturday. The case is attracting attention because a video posted on YouTube shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. The shooting has sparked local protests and anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force against an unarmed man who is a minority. Zambrano-Montes' widow, Teresa De Jesus Meraz Ruiz, 32, and the couple's two minor daughters accused three Pasco officers in ""the murder"" of Zambrano-Montes, according to the claim filed Friday. One officer, Ryan Flanagan, ""has a prior history of official misconduct in civil rights matters,"" the claim alleges. The other two officers are Adam Wright and Adrian Alaniz, the claim said. The three officers are on paid administrative leave;  Zabell said the city wouldn't comment on the accusations against them. Flanagan is a nine-year veteran; Wright, a firearms instructor with eight years' experience; and Alaniz, an officer with two years on the job, officials said. Meanwhile, the Mexican consul in Seattle, Eduardo Baca, wrote a letter Thursday to Police Chief Robert Metzger expressing ""deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed Mexican national by police officers."" Baca asked for a thorough investigation ""in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Affairs provision, to which both Mexico and the United States are parties."" Read consul's letter . On Friday, Metzger wrote a letter to Baca stating that the Pasco department and other law agencies are investigating ""the circumstances surrounding the incident."" When a Tri-City Special Investigations Unit completes its inquiry, the report will be forwarded to the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, Metzger wrote. Police have alleged that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers. Officers attempted ""voice commands and low level force,"" and used a Taser, police said, but those efforts were unsuccessful. Read chief's reply . After two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force. Zambrano-Montes's family have told reporters he wouldn't have been able to understand the commands. ""He didn't understand English and they were talking to him in English,"" one cousin said. ""Why not get a Hispanic officer?"" The incident began, according to the claim, on Tuesday about 5 p.m. when Zambrano-Montes was suspected of throwing rocks. A very brief encounter occurred between Zambrano-Montes and police, ""during which the officers may have tried to taser"" him, the claim said. Zambrano-Montes separated from the officer and walked away from them in the crosswalk, the claim said. ""He had his back to the officers,"" the claim said. ""At this point, the officers started shooting at Mr. Zambrano-Montes. ""After Mr. Zambrano-Montes reached the other side of the street and got on the sidewalk, he continued to walk away from the officers with his hands out where they could be seen, again showing that he had no knife, no gun or nothing else in his hands that would cause a threat to the three officers who were then lined up on the sidewalk behind ... Antonio Zambrano-Montes,"" the claim alleges. ""As Mr. Zambrano-Montes turned toward the officers, all three officers fired multiple rounds, killing Antonio Zambrano-Montes on the sidewalk in front of numerous businesses,"" the claim alleges. ""At the time that he was shot and killed, execution style, by the three officers named herein, in broad daylight, and with no knife or firearm in his hands, and for the conduct of throwing rocks at an earlier time, Mr. Zambrano-Montes posed no danger to the three officers, such that they were justified in the use of deadly force..."" the claim said. The claim accuses the police of assault, battery, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death and civil rights violations. The claim said the incident was the third fatal shooting by a Pasco officer ""in a very short period of time,"" and accused the city of ""retaining officers who had a proven history of violation of civil rights against the Latino/Hispanic community"" and ""allowing and fostering overt racial (animus) towards the Hispanic/Latino community within the Pasco Police Department."" Zambrano-Montes's shooting death was the fourth fatal officer-involved shooting in Pasco in the past seven months, said city spokesman Jon Funfar. One of those shootings, however, involved a deputy from Benton County, although Pasco is in Franklin County, Funfar said. According to the Tri-City Herald, officers were cleared in the other three shootings. The coroner said his office would conduct a separate inquest in the Zambrano-Montes case with six community members, once the law enforcement investigation is complete. The family's attorney, George Trejo, said supporters were scheduled to march Saturday from a park to City Hall and the police department. On Wednesday, about 100 protesters marched outside Pasco City Hall, with some chanting ""It was only a rock,"" CNN affiliate KEPR reported. The shooting comes in a period of strained police-community relations following the police-involved deaths last summer of Eric Garner, 43, on Staten Island in New York and Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri. The medical examiner ruled Garner's July 17 death a homicide due to compression of his neck and chest when he was taken down by an officer using a chokehold. His death sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the case. A few weeks later, Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown after an altercation in the street. The death of Brown, who was unarmed, thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Wilson, a decision that led to national demonstrations.","Widow, two daughters of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, accuse three officers of ""murder""

"(CNN)Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf halted all executions in his state Friday, citing the state's ""error prone"" justice system and ""inherent biases"" among his reasons for the moratorium. ""I take this action only after significant consideration and reflection,"" Wolf said Friday. ""There is perhaps no more weighty a responsibility assigned to the governor than his or her role as the final check in the capital punishment process."" Wolf, a Democrat who ran his family's cabinet manufacturing business before becoming governor in January, said the moratorium would be in place until a task force examining capital punishment in Pennsylvania issues its final report. ""If the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being, its capital sentencing system must be infallible,"" he said. ""Pennsylvania's system is riddled with flaws, making it error prone, expensive and anything but infallible."" It is a flawed system steeped in bigotry, according to Wolf. ""Numerous recent studies have called into question the accuracy and fundamental fairness of Pennsylvania's capital sentencing system,"" he said. ""These studies suggest that inherent biases affect the makeup of death row. While data is incomplete, there are strong indications that a person is more likely to be charged with a capital offense and sentenced to death if he is poor or of a minority racial group, and particularly where the victim of the crime was Caucasian."" The governor stressed that the impetus was to re-examine a flawed system of justice, and in no way a sentence commutation for the 186 individuals on Pennsylvania's death row. ""This moratorium is in no way an expression of sympathy for the guilty on death row, all of whom have been convicted of committing heinous crimes,"" Wolf said. ""This decision is based on a flawed system that has been proven to be an endless cycle of court proceedings as well as ineffective, unjust and expensive."" According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Pennsylvania has executed three inmates since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, the last being in 1999.  All were white males. Wolf's action Friday has the most immediate effect on Terrance Williams, a convicted killer who was scheduled to die March 4. A district attorney who is prosecuting a man charged with killing a state trooper decried Wolf's move as ""unilateral and potentially unlawful."" Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin's office last month said it would seek the death penalty in the case of Eric Frein, accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring Trooper Alex T. Douglass in a September ambush outside a state police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. Tonkin said Wolf's move ""does not serve as any legal impediment to my office's pursuit of justice"" in the case against Frein, charged with first-degree murder, terrorism and other counts. ""In announcing his action, the governor has usurped the authority of the legislature and courts in setting the lawful punishment for convicted killers. This unilateral action will only cause more pain and confusion to families who have suffered the actions of the worst criminals,"" Tonkin said. Frein, who was arrested in October after a nearly seven-week manhunt, pleaded not guilty last month. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Pennsylvania Gov.

"Dozens of children are among the latest victims of the Syrian civil war after barrel bombs fell on an elementary school Wednesday, dissidents said. Syrian forces dropped the bombs on an opposition-held area of Aleppo, the country's largest city, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC  said 25 children died. Barrel bombs typically consist of barrels stuffed with explosives and objects such as nails to maximize carnage. A video posted by opposition activists showed what appeared to be a pool of blood and a side of a building reduced to rubble. Another concrete wall featuring a drawing of a child was peppered with holes. A pile of chairs and debris was covered in red. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency made no mention of such an attack on its website Wednesday. Instead, it featured a story about President Bashar al-Assad and his wife hosting a reception for parents of sons who died while defending the ""homeland."" ""The citizens' willingness to offer the most precious issue they own to defend Syria and not allowing to sabotage it was one of the most important reasons behind steadfastness of the country in the face of most powerful powers,"" al-Assad said, according to SANA. Al-Nusra claims responsibility for attack . The jihadist group al-Nusra Front claimed responsibility Wednesday for twin car bombings the day before that killed at least 79 civilians in the al-Zahra neighborhood of Homs, dissidents said. Another 21 fighters from the government-funded, Alawite-manned National Defense Force were killed, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The dual blasts Tuesday were among the deadliest attacks in an Alawite-dominated area. Al-Assad is a member of the Alawite religious sect, which is an offshoot of Shia Islam. Al-Nusra detailed the attack in a statement Wednesday. ""The first car was detonated on time in order to kill the maximum number of Shabiha (al-Assad's militiamen) in addition to the huge material damage,"" the statement read. As rescuers rushed to the scene, ""the second car bomb detonated, blasting their hideouts to be the knockout punch that finished off whoever survived the first explosion since the two cars were parked in a manner aimed to cause the highest casualty number possible in their ranks so they can live the pain and suffering our people have been living."" Al-Nusra ended its statement with an ominous threat: ""We promise the Alawites and all of those who support them that there will be MORE to come."" Presidential election looming . Al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 43 years, recently registered his candidacy for another term. The president succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007, unopposed. Syria's presidential election is scheduled for June 3. As of Wednesday, 17 candidates have registered, SANA said. But the United Nations is asking the government to reconsider the election as the carnage continues to mount every day. Well over 100,000 people, including many civilians, have died in Syria's three-year civil war, the United Nations said. On Wednesday alone, at least 29 people were killed, the LCC said. So far, all attempts to stop the fighting between government forces and rebels seeking al-Assad's ouster have failed.","Activists: The barrel bombs fell on a school in an opposition-held part of Aleppo .

"Talakovka, Ukraine (CNN)Artillery and rocket fire can be heard almost constantly in the village Talakovka, about 10 kilometers from the strategic port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army has dug in here, fearing a possible last-minute assault by pro-Russian separatists ahead of a planned ceasefire late Saturday. Armored vehicles with cannons mounted on top fired from a front line position with tanks standing nearby. The unit commander, who only identified himself as ""Pavel,"" said he did not believe the ceasefire would hold. ""We know about this so-called ceasefire. We have had agreements before. The separatists have broken them frequently. But we will stick to the agreements and stop the violence coming from their side,"" he said as artillery barrages could be heard firing off in the distance. Over his walkie-talkie a voice could be heard saying: ""Our artillery is in action."" Pavel says pro-Russian separatists have tried several times to overrun his positions, but were repelled each time. Ukrainian government officials including the prime minister have expressed doubts that the Minsk truce will succeed, and those doubts are also on display in Mariupol. We witnessed columns of tanks and armored vehicles making their way to the front line. But the Ukrainian military also has another problem -- a lack of modern equipment. One soldier appeared to need medical attention after a tank's radiator seemed to blow up close to his head, leaving the vehicle and its crew engulfed in a cloud of white smoke. The constant shelling is taking its toll on the civilian population in the areas around Mariupol. In the village of Sartana, 58-year-old Anna Blagovjestova said she was in her house when a rocket hit the neighbor's backyard, spraying shrapnel onto the building. The man living next door was killed. Police officers were busy trying to dig the remnants of the rocket out of a hole the projectile had pierced in the ground when our crew arrived at the scene. ""I have two grandchildren here,"" she said, shaking. ""They are one and three years old. Of course we are very scared."" Blagovjestova blamed Ukrainian forces for firing the rocket, saying she was all but certain that it came from the area where the army is stationed. ""We don't need the Ukrainian army here,"" she said ""We don't need army. Everyone who came here with weapons started wars. Please make them go away from here."" But for now it appears as though both sides are digging in, with very little trust that this time a ceasefire might lead to a lasting peace.","Ukrainian army in Mariupol fears last-minute assault by separatists ahead of ceasefire .

"(CNN)A Canadian man and an American woman have been arrested in what authorities said Saturday was a foiled plot to carry out a mass murder-suicide at a Nova Scotia mall on Valentine's Day. The alleged plot, to spray a busy Halifax mall with gunfire, appeared to be motivated not by culture or ideology but by a small group's desire to carry out a heinous crime, according to Canadian investigators. Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, 23, of Geneva, Illinois, and Randall Steven Shepherd, a 20-year-old from Halifax, were arrested early Friday, authorities said. They have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder. ""This group has been stopped and Halifax is a safe place,"" said Brian Brennan, Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police commanding officer. Police in Illinois executed a search warrant at Souvannarath's Geneva home and multiple unspecified items were taken, authorities in the United States said Saturday. Authorities received a tip Thursday morning that Souvannarath and a 19-year-old Timberlea, Nova Scotia, man planned to go to a public location in Halifax with ""a goal of opening fire to kill citizens, and then themselves,"" Brennan said. The 19-year-old suspect was found dead in a home, where three rifles were recovered, Brennan said. The dead man was not identified. Another person -- a 17-year-old described as a person of interest -- was released because of a lack of evidence, Brennan said. ""All indications that we're getting from police is that this was not motivated ... by anything related to terrorism,"" Canadian Justice Minister Peter MacKay told reporters. Souvannarath and Shepherd were arrested at about 2 a.m. Friday at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, Brennan said.

"(CNN)On Valentine's Day, Mother Nature promises more heartbreak for New England. Forecasters predict that yet another blizzard will arrive Saturday evening and depart Sunday night. In a record-setting month, it won't be the worst storm that Boston has ever seen, but it will just compound the exasperation caused by three -- now four -- weather systems that have dumped piles of snow on the city. Cape Cod and the islands off the Massachusetts coast could see hurricane-force winds, with snow accumulations of 12 inches for Boston and up to 18 inches in coastal Maine. From New York's Long Island to Maine, millions of people will find themselves under blizzard warnings. How to beat the winter blues . Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has declared the next seven days as ''Valentine's Week'' in an attempt to help restaurants, flower shops and other small businesses hurting from the record setting snowfall. Could a baby boom be in the works? Birth rates have been known to jump nine months after natural and man-made disasters, according to Dr. Robi Ludwig, a psychotherapist. She gave the example of New York following 9/11, when births soared as many people faced calamity by turning to each other for support. The bad weather can mean cozy nights for cooking, sipping wine and watching movies -- activities that can shift to ""romance and sexuality, "" Ludwig said. Track the storm . -- Light snow, relatively speaking: Compared with other storms, this won't be as big a snow event for Boston. About 10 to 14 inches are forecast. Coastal Massachusetts might see 6 to 10 inches, forecasters say. -- Wicked wind: Some gusts could reach hurricane strength, 74 mph or greater. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph will cause the snow to blow around and hamper visibility. Power outages can be expected in many areas, the National Weather Service said. -- Another blizzard: Eastern Massachusetts and coastal areas of the Bay State are under blizzard warnings. So are parts of eastern Maine, where gusts of 60 mph are possible and up to 26 inches of snow. -- Storm surge: With high winds the surf along the Massachusetts coast will be harsh. The storm surge in northeastern parts of the state and in Maine could be 2 to 2½ feet. This could lead to flooding. -- No mass transit Sunday: MBTA, better known to many as the T, won't run Sunday, when the worst of the weather will be hitting. There will be no subway, bus, commuter rail, trolley or ferry service. It's the third time the subway has shuttered service because of a serious storm. Officials will decide on Sunday whether to cancel service for Monday. Amtrak canceled two trains on Saturday and six on Sunday. -- Whiteout conditions: There is no ban on driving but it seems now like it would be a pretty bad idea. ""Travel will become nearly impossible,"" the National Weather Service is saying. The snow will be a light snow, so it will fly around easily in the strong winds. Visibility will be a quarter-mile or less during the storm. -- Flight trouble: Dozens of flights that had been scheduled to land at Boston's Logan International Airport on Saturday have been called off already. According to the flight tracking website FlightAware, 31 flights have been canceled at Logan. Already, more than 350 flights have been canceled for Sunday. -- Staying home? All this snow has caused small business in Boston to hurt. So much so that Gov. Baker on Friday declared next week as Valentine's week. Can't get to your romantic restaurant on Saturday, or you forgot to make reservations? The governor is giving you an extension. -- Frozen out: The snow emergency has led to the cancellation of Sunday's two performances of ""Disney on Ice presents Frozen"" at TD Garden. -- Widespread wind field: If you live in Asheville, North Carolina, you don't have to worry about a blizzard, but the winds will be fierce beginning Saturday evening. You could travel from there to Maine's border with Canada and face gusts of 40 mph or stronger the entire way. -- Forecast for the south: Birmingham and Atlanta, two cities that had a difficult go of it last year during one memorable snowy/icy storm, might find residents flooding grocery stores on Sunday night. ""Wintry precipitation possible early next week,"" the National Weather Service in Atlanta said. ""Are you ready for a shot at winter?"" the agency's Birmingham office said. -- Record month: With 42.3 inches of snow recorded this month, Boston has already had the snowiest February on record and with the first inch of Saturday's snow, this month will become the snowiest of any month in Boston history, at least since records have been kept since 1872. -- Almost 8 feet: Boston has received more snow this season-to-date than ever: 79.5 inches so far. -- Double trouble: Boston has never had more than one official blizzard in the same year. This should be the second; another hit the city in late January.

"(CNN)Here in London, you can tell that the U.S. presidential election is only about 600 days away because every restaurant here seems to contain a senator or a governor. Why do they come to Britain? Whatever their motivation, nine times out of 10 they wish they hadn't. Most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker visited Chatham House -- a gorgeous foreign policy study center in Westminster. There he was asked if he believed in evolution or not. Why, I cannot fathom. Either way, Walker refused to answer, which probably seemed like a clever thing to do in the heat of the moment. But while an equivocation that might simply sound awkward in America, it sounded off-the-wall crazy in London. Why? Because for us it is like being casually asked ""Does two plus two equal four?"" and replying, ""I'd rather not answer a hypothetical question."" One doesn't dodge an invitation to assert fact in the UK. Scott dodged, and because the audience laughed gently at him in English accents, it made him look all the more like a country bumpkin. American politicians have to stop doing this. Go to Israel instead: there the applause lines are well scripted and all the audience expects to see you do is pray with moist eyes. In contrast, England is somewhere that American political careers go to end. We're too judgmental, too passive aggressive, too weird. Even we don't like ourselves -- so I've no idea why Americans fly here seeking a warm welcome. Consider how horrible we were to Mitt Romney. Of course, from our point of view he wasn't very nice to us either. In July 2012, he showed up in London and began by casting doubt on our ability to host the Olympics (something we very much doubted, too, but weren't going to take criticisms from a foreigner). Then he appeared to forget the name of the leader of the opposition and called him ""Mr. Leader"" instead (we'd all like to forget his name, but sadly, it is etched on our memories thanks to his ineptitude). Finally, Romney said that it was curious to look out of the ""backside of Number 10 Downing Street"" (""backside"" is English for ""ass""). For all of this, London Mayor Boris Johnson taunted Mitt in front of a large British crowd -- and Boris is the closest you get to a politician we actually like. So Mitt's humiliation was a big deal. It's all part of a pattern. Politician comes to Britain, opens his mouth, says something foolish. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's remarks about vaccinations were probably a little too parochial to cause a stir in in the UK media, but Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's about Muslims certainly did. Speaking to the Henry Jackson Society -- a neoconservative British group who are fans of the late senator -- he revived the claim that there are ""no-go"" areas in the UK as a result of Islamic immigration. But while there certainly are no-go areas here, it's because they're just horrible and no one (Muslim, Jewish, Christian or anyone else) would want to go there. Every nation has its Detroits, but the idea that my country has become a patchwork of little caliphates is sheer fantasy. Is there a political bias in all of this? Do Republicans make particularly bad travelers? Not necessarily. Partly what's going on here is that there are far more GOP contenders than Democratic ones, so it's the conservative mistakes that get noticed the most. But there might also be some truth in the assertion that the British enjoy tripping Republicans up more. Why, otherwise, would someone ask Scott Walker whether or not he believes in evolution when he's in the UK on a trade mission? Hillary or Bill Clinton would never be asked such a question. Make no mistake, our largely left-wing media sees the GOP as a Hollywood cliché of the old Wild West -- so it's no surprise that its candidates get all the strangest questions. But that, I would argue, is one more reason for Republicans to cross Britain off their places to visit. Another is our decline in importance. You see, we're not nearly as superior as we like to make ourselves out to be. We've cut our defense spending and chosen not to take part in half of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. We contributed nothing towards the recent Ukrainian ceasefire negotiations because we are, in the opinion of some, irrelevant. Meanwhile, the decline of religion in this country is fast, but while we like to imagine it has brought enlightenment, the reality is probably that it has brought social dislocation and despair. Our poor are so poor that they rely upon free food handouts. And our politics can be as frustrating and fractured as America's -- we have a buoyant far right to prove it. So my advice for any other presidential candidates considering a visit to London is to take a second look at the map. China matters rather more. Australia is a better vision of conservative government. Germany runs Europe these days. And, of course, there's a lot happening in Russia right now, too...","Timothy Stanley: U.S. politicians becoming regular feature in London .

"(CNN)Up to 100 people are feared missing after two boats collided on the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the World Health Organization said Saturday. The collision happened Thursday morning but news of the disaster is only just emerging. Eugene Kabambi, a WHO spokesman in the country's capital, Kinshasa, told CNN that the wreck occurred at a resort downstream of the town of Kwamouth, when an overloaded barge en route to Inongo collided with a boat carrying 150 people. ""We are searching for as many as 100 people in the Congo River as well as assisting these people with body bags, medical kit,"" said Kabambi. ""One of the boats was totally destroyed and that is the one we believe was carrying the missing."" Kabambi said his team had been told Friday by the provincial minister of transportation and infrastructure that there were 100 passengers in total and that 42 people had been rescued. However, WHO believes the number of passengers to be close to 150, based on survivors' accounts. A WHO statement released Friday said three bodies had been recovered from the river so far. No passenger manifest was available so it's difficult to establish the total number of people on board the privately owned vessel, it said. No one is thought to have been injured on the barge. The accident is believed to have been caused by powerful currents near the Ngobila rapids. According to WHO, which was awaiting a delivery of medical supplies and body bags to the area Saturday, overloaded barges and passenger boats frequently sink in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the Congo River and on the country's lakes. This is usually owing to the age of the vessels and failure to follow rules of navigation.","WHO says an overloaded barge and a passenger boat collided near rapids .

"(CNN)There is no precedent in contemporary weather records for the kinds of droughts the country's West will face, if greenhouse gas emissions stay on course, a NASA study said. No precedent even in the past 1,000 years. The feared droughts would cover most of the western half of the United States -- the Central Plains and the Southwest. Those regions have suffered severe drought in recent years. But it doesn't compare in the slightest to the 'megadroughts' likely to hit them before the century is over due to global warming. These will be epochal, worthy of a chapter in Earth's natural history. Even if emissions drop moderately, droughts in those regions will get much worse than they are now, NASA said. The space agency's study conjures visions of the sun scorching cracked earth that is baked dry of moisture for feet below the surface, across vast landscapes, for decades. Great lake reservoirs could dwindle to ponds, leaving cities to ration water to residents who haven't fled east. ""Our projections for what we are seeing is that, with climate change, many of these types of droughts will likely last for 20, 30, even 40 years,"" said NASA climate scientist Ben Cook. That's worse and  longer than the historic Dust Bowl of the 1930s, when ""black blizzards"" -- towering, blustery dust walls -- buried Southern Plains homes, buggies and barns in dirt dunes. It lasted about 10 years. Though long, it  was within the framework of a contemporary natural drought. To find something almost as extreme as what looms, one must go back to Medieval times. Nestled in the shade of Southwestern mountain rock, earthen Ancestral Pueblo housing offers a foreshadowing. The tight, lively villages emptied out in the 13th century's Great Drought that lasted more than 30 years. No water. No crops. Starvation drove populations out to the east and south. If NASA's worst case scenario plays out, what's to come could be worse. Its computations are based on greenhouse gas emissions continuing on their current course. And they produce an 80% chance of at least one drought that could last for decades. One ""even exceeding the duration of the long term intense 'megadroughts' that characterized the really arid time period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly,"" Cook said. That was a period of heightened global temperatures that lasted from about 1100 to 1300 -- when those Ancestral Pueblos dispersed. Global average temperatures are already higher now than they were then, the study said. The NASA team's study was very data heavy. It examined past wet and dry periods using tree rings going back 1,000 years and compared them with soil moisture from 17 climate models, NASA said in the study published in Science Advances. Scientists used super computers to calculate the models forward along the lines of human induced global warming scenarios. The models all showed a much drier planet. Some Southwestern areas that are currently drought-stricken are filling up with more people, creating more demand for water while reservoirs are already strained. The predicted megadroughts will wrack water supplies much harder, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center said.

"(CNN)He may have worked with world leaders, but now Nigerian billionaire investor Tony Elumelu is focusing on those yet to turn their business dream into reality. The chairman of pan-African investment company Heirs Holdings Limited has pledged $100 million to find and support 10,000 entrepreneurs throughout Africa. Launched earlier this week, the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program (TEEP) wants to help find and grow businesses who will contribute $10 billion in revenue across Africa over the next 10 years. ""I have always sought ways to help inspire a generation across our continent,"" said Elumelu. ""[It is] my fundamental belief that entrepreneurs -- women and men across Africa -- will lead Africa's development and transform our futures."" Driving entrepreneurship . It is this belief that led Elumelu to coin the term ""Africapitalism"" -- an economic philosophy ""that the African private sector has the power to transform the continent through long-term investments, creating both economic prosperity and social wealth."" Entries are open to entrepreneurs from all 54 African countries and applications will be accepted in English, French and Portuguese. These will be reviewed by a panel of judges, tasked with selecting the 1,000 most promising startups each year. The chosen entrepreneurs will be given seed funding and 12 weeks of business skills training. They will also be put through their paces at an entrepreneurship ""boot camp."" Among the judges are Ayodeji Adewunmi, the co-founder of the popular Nigerian job search site Jobberman, Opunimi Akinkugbe, CEO of African board game company Bestman Games, and Monica Musonda, chief executive Zambia-based Java Food. As well as these business names, the initiative is also collaborating with big hitters from other sectors, like Vera Songwe,  the World Bank country director for Senegal, Cape Verde, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania. ""We must strive for entrepreneurial innovation in Africa,"" says Songwe, ""and my participation in this program further promotes the World Bank Group's push for entrepreneur-led global development."" Africa brimming with entrepreneurs . The initiative's goal to nurture 1,000 entrepreneurs every year for a decade may sound ambitious, but research reveals Africa is a hotbed of entrepreneurial spirit. According to research conducted in 2012 by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, over 80% of people in Nigeria and Uganda see opportunities for starting businesses. And across the continent, 53% of people intend to pursue a business in the next three years. In Angola, Botswana, Malawi and Uganda that figure is 70%. Crucially, however, the continent is also experiencing high discontinuation rates as many entrepreneurs abandon their efforts after failing to make profits. ""African entrepreneurs have ideas, they have products but they don't have support,"" says technologist Marieme Jamme, a Davos Young Global leader and CEO of SpotOne Global Solutions. ""Mentorship for entrepreneurs in Africa is the key,"" she continues, calling for governments to improve educational efforts work with the private sector to create new markets for entrepreneurs. ""There is not enough funding available despite that we have lots of money in Africa and billionaires,"" adds Jamme. ""Some people are ready to fund amazing and bright ideas, like Tony Elumelu, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here -- we have great challenges on quality control. We need good products, locally designed by Africans for Africans and global markets."" Read this: 12 brilliant entrepreneurs under 22 . Read this: Africa is buzzing with entrepreneurial spirit .

"(CNN)A trio of disasters that battered American journalism -- the suspension of NBC anchor Brian Williams, followed by the unrelated deaths of CBS correspondent Bob Simon and New York Times media critic David Carr -- could not come at a worse time for the news business. To see three nationally well-respected leaders in the field vanish in a week's time has left many in the news business shaken. Williams deserves the least sympathy; he caused his own unpaid suspension by repeatedly distorting and exaggerating key facts about a story he helped report over a decade ago, a breach that calls into question the level of quality control at a network that made him the face of news to 9 million nightly viewers. By contrast, the loss of Simon and Carr is an unmitigated tragedy. Simon, killed in a car accident, won dozens of Emmy awards and famously put his life on the line in 1991, when the forces of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein held him and his news crew captive for 40 days, during which they were blindfolded, beaten and threatened with death. Carr was a fearless critic of media and was unafraid of exposing the inner workings of even the most powerful companies -- including his own beloved New York Times, which he took to task for firing ex-executive editor Jill Abramson in an essay that my friend and journalist John Avlon and I included in a list of the best newspaper columns of 2014. Simon and Carr were professionals who graced their chosen field and showed how much good you can do with skill, grit and integrity. As one media critic put it, ""Both were classic, fearless, old-school journalists who stayed at the top of their craft for decades, winning plenty of awards for their work ... but more importantly, the respect of both their readers and those in the industry."" The loss of two stalwart truth-tellers leaves journalism weaker when it needs to be stronger on behalf of the public. Media organizations, already reeling from shrinking audiences, have recently been forced to weather an unprecedented level of government stonewalling of basic information. ""This trend has been especially pronounced in the federal government,"" read a blistering letter from the Society of Professional Journalists to the Obama administration. ""We consider these restrictions a form of censorship -- an attempt to control what the public is allowed to see and hear."" Equally disturbing is the fact the Obama administration has conducted more criminal prosecutions of whistleblowers under the Espionage Act compared with any of the previous administrations. Seven, to be precise. Add a dose of direct violence -- notably, the recent kidnapping and beheading of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff by ISIS -- and the challenges confronting an already troubled news industry start to look like the stuff of nightmares. That's the bad news. The good news is that a rising generation of journalists, journeymen who have been perfecting their craft for years, are preparing to take the reins of leadership in the nation's major newsrooms. Here are three of the best, whose success is a reason to cheer. Full disclosure: I have worked with all of them, and consider each of them dear friends. Maggie Haberman, a longtime political reporter for Politico, graduates this week to a prominent post at The New York Times, where she will anchor the paper's politics web section and help drive coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign. Ben Smith, editor in chief of Buzzfeed, recently scored a one-on-one interview with President Obama that is notable, in part, because Buzzfeed, which started less than a decade ago, is considered a leader among the new digital organizations that attract and cater to young millennials. And John Avlon, editor in chief of the Daily Beast and a CNN contributor, took the reins after the departure of Tina Brown and is growing the organization by leaps and bounds, deepening its national security coverage alongside a lively coverage of the mechanics of Hollywood and Washington. A cadre of opinion journalists -- notably, Chris Hayes and Joy-Ann Reid on the left, S.E. Cupp and Will Cain on the right -- are diligently building reputations for wit, insight and creativity at a time when Americans are looking for new faces and voices. We have, indeed, lost some great, brave journalists lately. May the new generation live up to the legacy we've inherited.","A trio of disasters that battered American journalism could not come at a worse time for the news business .

"(CNN)This weekend, Pope Francis appoints 20 new cardinals in Rome (five of them are nonvoting cardinals). As one commentator notes, it is not a question of right versus left, but of north versus south: Most of these new cardinals hail from far-flung locations including Tonga, Cape Verde, Panama, Uruguay and Myanmar. They are a far cry from the usual array of European and American cardinals. This will, indeed, ""change Catholicism forever."" Catholicism is a global religion, of course, and it's changing fast under the leadership of this very bold pontiff.  The right-versus-left argument has also been in play, dramatically, as this pope has moved quickly to change the way Christians think about gays, famously saying ""Who am I to judge?"" when asked about gays in the church.  This was one of the first bombshells of his papacy, when he suggested that gays should be ""accepted with respect, dignity and compassion,"" adding that ""every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided."" Last year, his Synod of Bishops on the Family -- a conference of leaders brought together to consider family matters and sexuality -- leaned too far left for many among the bishops, especially in the first draft of their joint statement.  The Pope didn't give up, however, and will try again this coming year, with many fresh voices among his bishops. And the chances are that fresh teachings will emerge, as Francis clearly wants the church to be more open to gays and friendlier to couples who have been divorced. The Pope has also addressed the complicated issue of women in the church.  Last year, he declared that women ""must have a greater role in the decision-making areas of the church.""  He has also been sympathetic to the idea of giving women a greater role in the liturgical work of the church, arguing recently for a ""more widespread and incisive female presence"" in the church. Indeed, there is good theological ground for this, as the early church had female deacons, and St. Paul put great trust in female leaders, such as Lydia and Phoebe (a deacon with whom he entrusted his famous Letter to the Romans). It was not until quite late in the Christian movement that women were relegated to the sidelines, told to sit down and be quiet, and Paul's teachings on women in the church remain highly contradictory (a good summary can be found here, by Craig S. Keener). As with all scriptures, Paul's letters need to be read in context.  One must also take into consideration that not all of Paul's letters were by him:  Most scholars now believe that only seven of his letters were authentic, while the rest were by disciples of Paul -- ""school of Paul,"" so to speak.  And many of these offered comments on women that were incompatible with the original seven letters, as John Dominic Crossan (one of the finest of biblical scholars) and others have persuasively argued. To be frank:  It seems to me unlikely that Pope Francis will ever allow women into the priesthood, let alone into the College of Cardinals.  But it also seems inevitable that these things will happen in due course. Still, the Francis revolution is real.  He has laid the groundwork for profound change, and it matters that he has now appointed a cadre of cardinals from parts of the world where poverty remains an abysmal problem.  This pope wants the church to be, above all else, a ""church for the poor."" In the first year of his papacy he wrote a strong Apostolic Exhortation in which he condemned ""the invisible hand of the market"" and pushed for economic reforms. This eloquent document was so radical, in fact, that even Rush Limbaugh stepped into the fray, calling it ""pure Marxism."" But this pope isn't a Marxist.  He's a deeply humble man who believes in social justice.  He regards Jesus as someone who identified with those on the margins of society, who declared: ""Blessed are the poor.""  This pope has consistently sided with those who have no power, and he has been unafraid to state his case, repeatedly, in unequivocal terms. The appointment of 20 new cardinals from the margins of the world will only add to his case, reforming the church structurally, from within.  While not every one of these cardinals shares the pontiff's views on gays and women in the church, there is no doubt that fresh voices will open the debate on any number of issues. This is a revolutionary pope, and his first two years in office have been breathtaking to watch.","Pope Francis will appoint 20 new cardinals in Rome on Saturday .

"Copenhagen (CNN)[Breaking news update at 1:17 a.m. ET] . Danish police shot and killed a man early Sunday after he fired at them in the capital of Copenhagen, a journalist for TV2 reported Sunday. Police said the man's address was under observation and are investigating whether he was linked to earlier attacks, according to journalist Astrid Sondberg. No officers were injured in the shootout. [Previous story, published at 10:51 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- Police in the Danish capital of Copenhagen were stopping cars and cordoning off sections of the city Sunday morning after two shootings within hours of each other left two people dead and five wounded. It was unclear whether the shootings were connected, police said. No one has been arrested and police are working as if there might be more than one gunman. Officers were searching taxis and private cars, having the drivers open their vehicle trunks as the city was on high alert, Astrid Sondberg, a reporter for TV2 in Denmark, reported. A police spokesman said there is no ban on civilians moving around, but they should respect police roadblocks. The second incident took place about 10 hours after a deadly terror attack. In the latest incident, shots were fired near a synagogue when a person approached two police officers and began shooting. Another person was shot and later died, and the police officers were wounded -- one in an arm, the other in a leg, police said. Their injuries weren't life-threatening. Police earlier said the gunman ran from the scene. The shooter was a man dressed in a light gray jacket, black pants and black shoes. The jacket was different from the one believed to have worn by a possible suspect in the first shooting. Earlier, a gunman stormed a cafe where controversial cartoonist Lars Vilks and his supporters had gathered for a free speech forum, killing a man and wounding three police officers before fleeing, police said. Helle Merete Brix -- founder of the Lars Vilks Committee, created two years ago in support of the Swedish cartoonist whose portrayals of the Prophet Mohammed angered many in the Muslim world -- told CNN that security personnel on site moved her and others to safe areas after shots rang out. She and Vilks ended up in a storage room together, holding hands, until police told them it was OK to come out. ""We have never taken any chances,"" Brix said, referring to the heavy security from police, Danish intelligence services and Vilks' own security guards at this and other committee events. ""What we have so much been frightened would happen happened."" Why Islam forbids images of Mohammed . After the attack, what appeared to be the man, dressed in dark clothes, carjacked a civilian's dark Volkswagen Polo and drove away, Danish police said. That vehicle was found between two train stations. The gunman remained at large Saturday night. Police initially had said there were two shooters in the first incident. The discrepancy was caused by chaos in the aftermath of the incident, Copenhagen police spokesman Steen Hansen said. The 55-year-old man who was killed hasn't been identified. Nor have authorities identified the three wounded law enforcement officers -- two with Danish intelligence and one police officer -- though investigator Joergen Skov did say none of them suffered serious injuries. Given Islamist extremists' documented threats against Vilks and their willingness to act on similar threats -- as proven last month in France -- Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, ""Everything points to ... the shooting in Oesterbro (being) a political assassination and therefore a terror attack."" Thorning-Schmidt  vowed that ""all resources will be used to find (those responsible) and bring them before a judge"" for an attack she said filled her ""with deep anger."" ""We have some difficult days ahead,"" the Prime Minister said. ""... But in Denmark, we will never bow to violence."" About 30 people -- including Vilks and French Ambassador to Denmark Francois Zimeray, who tweeted later that he is ""still alive in the room"" -- went through airport-level security to get into Saturday's event at the building located in what Brix described as a ""very peaceful area"" of the Danish capital. But it didn't last long, with noise erupting just a few minutes in. Dennis Meyhoff Brink, a satire researcher and Danish university professor, said he heard about 30 shots at about 3:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. ET), as well as someone yelling in a foreign language. ""Everybody, of course, panicked in the room and tried to run,"" Brink told CNN. ""... We were just hiding ... and hoping for the best."" The attacker made it just inside the building but apparently got no farther, said Brix, a journalist and literary critic. She recalled how one man there ""acted very quickly and courageously"" by pushing a woman down to the ground, then putting himself on top of her so she wouldn't get shot. Bodyguards returned fire, the Copenhagen police official said. At one point, two people came running into the meeting room -- one of them bleeding from the leg, after having apparently been shot -- to ""tell us to calm down,"" Brink said. Sirens could be heard 10 to 15 minutes after the shots, at which point Brink said ""we started to feel more safe."" The discussion on free speech even resumed, though eventually all those at the event were bused to a local police station. Copenhagen police later tweeted a picture of the suspect, covered up and dressed in dark clothes, wanted in connection with the attack. ""We are investigating this as a terror attack,"" said Skov, the police official, noting that authorities are taking into account that both the French ambassador and Vilks attended Saturday's event. ""There is an extremely large presence of police in Copenhagen right now."" Danes in Copenhagen and beyond quickly got support from around the world, including from the mayor of Paris -- who just more than a month ago lived this same nightmare during the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in her city. ""In the name of Parisians,"" Mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted, ""I express my full support."" Like Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane ""Charb"" Charbonnier, Vilks was one of nine faces on a ""Most Wanted"" graphic published by al Qaeda's Inspire magazine for ""crimes against Islam."" Others include a pair of Danish journalists who published 12 cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper; Florida pastor Terry Jones, who burned a Quran; and ""Satanic Verses"" author Salman Rushdie. Because of that, Brix said, ""there's no doubt"" the Copenhagen event was targeted because of Vilks, who has ""not been able to live a normal life"" for years, according to the committee. ""This is ... why we set up the committee: to support Mr. Vilks and support his right to freedom of speech,"" Brix said. Vilks became a target after his 2007 cartoon depicting Mohammed with the body of a dog -- an animal that conservative Muslims consider unclean. In a CNN interview later that year from his home in rural Sweden, Vilks said the drawing was calculated to elicit a reaction. ""It should be possible to insult all religions in a democratic way,"" he said then. ""If you insult one (religion), then you should insult the other ones."" CNN's Susanne Gargiulo reported from Copenhagen. CNN's Greg Botelho and Steve Almasy wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Kim Norgaard, Margot Haddad, Pierre Meilhan, Paul P. Murphy and Lucy Pawle contributed to this report.","Cartoonist on al Qaeda's ""Most Wanted"" list was at Copenhagen event that was site of first shooting .

"(CNN)An image of 48-year-old Cindy Crawford in lingerie is stirring discussion about what ""real"" women look like -- but not for reasons you might expect. The practice of photo retouching in fashion publications renders most models completely free of blemishes or imperfections to the point of being unrealistic. But this photo of Crawford baring her sun-kissed torso is drawing praise for showing her in a realistic light. The image comes from a cover shoot for the December 2013 issue of Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, representatives for the Mexico-based publication said. The photo in question was not published, and spokespeople did not provide an explanation for how it surfaced last week. Sex, lies and media . ""During the session that we did at that time for our edition, we proved that Cindy is an ambassador of beauty who has made history. It was a total privilege to have this fashion icon on the cover,"" Ariadne Grant, editor in chief of Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, said in a news release. ""The most important thing about this news is to note the beauty that Crawford has always been, and how happy we are that she has been part of a production for Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America -- a title that shows the strength and power of real women, always respecting (their) beauty, individuality and femininity."" Opinion: Is Cindy Crawford's photo empowering? The image spread through social media on Friday after British ITV News anchor Charlene White shared it on Twitter, attributing it to Marie Claire magazine. White said she first spotted the image on a friend's private Instagram feed and sought it out on Twitter. She said she found it on a fashion blog whose name she couldn't recall, and she shared the image from there. Regardless of the photo's origins, White said, she took comfort in the image as a celebrity whose looks are constantly scrutinized. ""Women come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes,"" White said. ""I think it's important to see all sorts of body shapes on our screens and in our magazines so that people have a true reflection of what people look like."" Fat is the new ugly on the playground . The American version of Marie Claire, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines and French-based Marie Claire Album, called the image real, honest and gorgeous but denied any connection to the photo. ""It appears that this unretouched version is a leak,""  the magazine said in an online post Friday. ""No matter where the photo came from, it's an enlightenment -- we've always known Crawford was beautiful, but seeing her like this only makes us love her more."" Report: Kids as young as 5 concerned about body image . The image is still resonating days later. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis was one of many to applaud the image on Twitter by sharing an image of herself in skivvies. ""Bravo Cindy Crawford,"" she said. ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all Ye need to know on earth, and all Ye need to know."" Others, however, questioned the reflex to applaud realistic depictions of women in fashion. The response has not been entirely positive. But White said it matters not what detractors say. ""I want people to feel like magazines aren't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images,"" she said. Bottom line? ""No one has the right to tell other people how to feel about their body."" Age before beauty?

"(CNN)Her body was left on a riverbed next to a cemetery, burned and abandoned, found just days after her family reported her missing. Now, a nation is protesting -- viewing her murder, according to one petition, as a symbol of the growing trend of violence against women in Turkey. The government is promising to punish her attackers and do more to protect others like her. Three suspects have been arrested in the murder of Ozgecan Aslan, 20, whose body was found Friday in Mersin's Tarsus district in southern Turkey, according to the country's semiofficial news agency Anadolu. She was reported missing Wednesday. Aslan allegedly fought a sexual assault before being killed by the driver of a bus she'd taken to go home, Anadolu reported. She was a first-year university student. Her body was covered in gasoline, burned and then dumped in a riverbed, police in Mersin said in a statement. Her funeral was held Saturday in her hometown, the same day protesters marched in Istanbul and Ankara. ""You will never walk alone,"" Anadolu reported they shouted. ""We will put an end to female homicides."" The demonstrators carried banners, and images of the glasses-clad, long-haired Aslan, chanting: ""We are here today. We revolt and we will continue to revolt until this stops."" Protesters have also taken to the Internet, and their cries have been heard at the highest levels of government. The hashtag #OzgecanAslan renders thousands of tweets, updating hundreds every hour. On Monday, the country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used Twitter to tell the country: ""To make sure the perpetrators who brutally slayed our daughter, Ozgecan, get the heaviest punishment that they deserve, I will personally pursue this lawsuit."" An online petition calling for institutions to step up and take responsibility for attacks like the one on Aslan has so far gathered more than 600,000 signatures. According to Anadolu, the daughters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- Sumeyye Erdogan and Esra Albayrak -- visited Aslan's family on Sunday. ""It is a very terrible situation,"" Sumeyye Erdogan reportedly said after the visit. ""We've come here in order to be able to share their sorrow. Our actual aim is for those murderers to be punished in an effective way."" CNN's Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report.","Ozgecan Aslan, 20, allegedly fought a sexual assault before being killed .

"Erbil, Iraq (CNN)Jana was a 19-year-old in her final year of high school, with dreams of becoming a doctor. Then, ISIS came to her village last August, and her world collapsed. She described to me in chilling detail, how the jihadis first demanded that members of her Yazidi religious minority convert to Islam. Then they stripped villagers of their jewelry, money and cellphones. They separated the men from the women. A United Nations report explained what happened next. ISIS ""gathered all the males older than 10 years of age at the local school, took them outside the village by pick-up trucks, and shot them."" Among those believed dead were Jana's father and eldest brother. A different fate lay in store for the women. Jana described how girls like herself were separated from older women, then bussed to the city of Mosul. There they were put in a big three-story house with hundreds of other young women. The men of ISIS came periodically, and chose up to three and four girls at a time to take home with them. ""These women have been treated like cattle,"" explained Nazand Begikhani, an adviser to the Kurdistan Regional Government on gender issues. ""They have been subjected to physical and sexual violence, including systematic rape and sex slavery. They've been exposed in markets in Mosul and in Raqqa, Syria, carrying price tags."" Perhaps more importantly, Begikhani is also a researcher at the UK-based University of Bristol's Gender and Violence Research Center. According to the field research and testimonials of Begikhani's team, ISIS kidnapped more than 2,500 Yazidi women. Meanwhile Narin Shiekh Shamo, a Yazidi activist based in Iraqi Kurdistan has compiled the names of at least 4,601 Yazidi women currently missing. In the first month after the mass abductions, Shamo says she was receiving calls and messages from up to 70 different hostages a day. Now, she can't reach a single hostage. After more than a decade reporting on conflict in the Middle East, I was still ill-prepared to hear about the scale of this kidnapping and modern day enslavement. Suddenly, the words of a 19-year-old ISIS imprisoned fighter whom I interviewed last weekend in a Kurdish prison in northern Syria made sense. The young man, horribly disfigured from bullet wounds to his abdomen and arm received during his year of fighting on the frontlines, described how ISIS attracted fresh recruits with the offer of cash and ""wives."" ISIS actually justified its enslavement of Yazidis in its own online magazine. ""One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah, or Islamic law,"" the group announced in the ISIS publication ""Dabiq."" The Kurdish authorities say they have rescued around 100 Yazidi women, in part through the payment of ransoms to Arab tribesmen who acted as intermediaries. Thousands of women remain hostage. And with ISIS successfully defending its territory from a loose coalition of Iraqi military, Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga, Syrian Kurdish militants and US-led airstrikes, it doesn't look like a white knight will charge in to rescue these poor women any time soon. Begikhani said all of the 100 Yazidi women rescued from ISIS appeared to have been systematically raped, likely by more than one man. The 19-year-old girl I spoke with here in Iraqi Kurdistan was deeply traumatized, and incapable of showing any joy or humor. Her mother and two brothers are still being held hostage by ISIS. Asked what she would say if she met the 70-year-old Arab man who took her home and ordered her to convert to Islam at gunpoint, she says: ""I wouldn't want to tell him anything.  I just want to kill him."" Jana says she has given up her dream of becoming a doctor. CNN's Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report.","Young Yazidi woman says ISIS jihadis kidnapped her and other women, and raped them .

"You've heard of CNN, but unless you pay close attention to photo and video credits on news sites, you've probably never heard of the Syrian group SNN. The Shaam News Network is one of several groups that aggregates photos and videos taken by citizen journalists in Syria and tries to show them to the world. Most recently, the group came into the news on Friday after it played a role in distributing images from a U.N.-condemned massacre in the village of Houla, which left 108 people dead, including some children who reportedly were axed to death. YouTube, meanwhile, put a collection of 10 videos from Houla on its homepage on Saturday in an effort to raise awareness about the bloodshed there. Of all the content, one particular photo -- of a tile room lined with bodies wrapped in white cloth -- became the de facto symbol of the violence in Houla. It has been run by numerous news websites, including this one, with credit attributed to Shaam News. Photos: Images paint horrific scene in Houla . The photo and the group highlight a crucial trend as the government of Bashar al-Assad continues to crack down on protestors and rebels: Activists and everyday people have taken it upon themselves to record violence against themselves and their neighbors and to distribute it online. And they do so at great risk to themselves. ""Perhaps the single most important way that people are telling their stories is through clips uploaded through YouTube,"" Ausama Monajed, a member of Syria's opposition group, said during a recent talk at the Oslo Freedom Forum, according to a live blog of the event that was posted online. ""And activist have learned that for this information to be credible, it must be properly dated and documented. And they are hoping that one day, these videos may be used to bring the regime to justice. ""If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth a thousand times more."" Should the U.S. 'airdrop' millions of phones into Syria? Networks like SNN have become aggregators and, in a sense, gatekeepers to the videos uploaded by citizen journalists. Syrians often will upload controversial videos to YouTube anonymously and without any information about the content, said David Clinch, editorial director at Storyful, a company that verifies and distributes videos from citizen journalists to news organizations. The videographers then text information to aggregators like SNN, which adds details and distributes the videos more widely. The division of labor is intended to make the process of uploading information safer for all those involved, he said. And in a place where it's difficult or sometimes impossible for journalists to report on the news, these images have become all the more important, said Clinch, who is a former CNN employee. ""It's hugely significant,"" he said. ""As far as I can tell there were no international journalists anywhere near Houla when this happened and so the only original video from when the immediate aftermath -- not just of the bodies but of the shelling and everything else -- was provided by what you could call citizen journalists."" He added: ""By the time the U.N. got there the next day and shot video themselves, any number of things could have been changed or moved and manipulated."" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of all photos and video submitted by citizen journalists in Syria, in part because the government restricts the movement of journalists in the country. Clinch said aggregators like Shaam are somewhat helpful at attempting to verify the authenticity of this kind of media, but they don't always get it right. As The Atlantic's Max Fisher wrote on Monday, at least one fake image from the massacre in Syria made it onto a major news website. The mistake, made by the BBC, ""seems like an innocent one, and is in some ways an inevitable result of the changing ways in which international media cover conflict zones,"" he wrote. Shaam was founded in 2011, after the conflict began, by a man named Abulhassan Abazeed, according to an e-mail from a man who identified himself as Jafar Alkheer, and who is acting as a spokesman for the organization. Even he does not know how many people contribute to Shaam News. ""There's no specific number of activities as some of them have been arrested, killed, or wounded the remaining volunteers are not dedicated to reporting to the network,"" he said. The group's goal is to counteract misinformation from the Syrian regime. He added: ""We don't have any kind of protection from any organization, we are always in danger."" According to its website and Facebook page, Shaam is headquartered in Damascus, the Syrian capital. Anas Qtiesh, a Syrian activist based in San Francisco, said SNN has been a ""prime source"" for videos and grassroots information coming out of Syria. The group has become so closely watched that fake SNN accounts have popped up on Facebook and YouTube, Qtiesh said, with similar logs but wildly different information. ""They are really valuable,"" he said. ""It's just very tricky to verify it sometimes because the regime often fakes activist videos just to discredit them."" He added: ""Videos spread like wildfire once they're out so it's very important that they be verified before they're uploaded."" Qtiesh pointed to a Facebook page for ""Shaaam News,"" with too many A's in its name, and three YouTube channels -- shaamnews2, shaamnews6 and shaamnews10 -- as fakes that are likely operated by people loyal to the al-Assad regime in Syria. YouTube, the Google-owned video site, is working with Storyful to try to verify activist videos from Syria and distribute them via its website. The company has created a Human Rights channel and a CitizenTube channel to highlight the verified videos. YouTube appears to be making efforts to keep content that has high news value on its platform, even if the content could be deemed objectionable or graphic. The video channel occasionally marks clips as graphic or requires users to sign in to prove that they are older than 18 before watching videos that are violent or gruesome. Jillian York, director of international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in an e-mail that YouTube and Facebook generally are doing a good job of making sure videos from Syrian activists surface on their platforms. ""YouTube has been great about keeping content up, even recently creating a human rights channel with the organization Witness,"" she said. ""Their policy is, explicitly, to keep up violent content if it is educational or documentarian in nature."" A YouTube spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this story. Getting the videos from Syria to the Internet is, of course, a major challenge. Clinch, from Storyful, said many Syrian activists upload videos via proxy servers, which are located in other countries, so that it's more difficult for the government to track them. They also may scramble their communications or run small hard drives or camera cards across the border to neighboring countries so that they can be uploaded, he said. The Syrian government, meanwhile, has been tracking their efforts with some success. According to a report from CNN's Ben Brumfield: ""Supporters of dictator Bashar al-Assad first steal the identities of opposition activists, then impersonate them in online chats, said software engineer Dlshad Othman. They gain the trust of other users, pass out Trojan horse viruses and encourage people to open them."" Clinch said dozens of YouTube videos still are uploaded from Syria every day. Watching these clips, from SNN and many others, is perhaps the best and fastest way, he said, to get a sense of what's really going on inside the country right now. Four journalists have been killed in Syria since the conflict began, according to the activist group Reporters Without Borders. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people have died in the conflict, which began in March 2011. Opposition groups put the number at more than 11,000.","Shaam News Network or SNN helps distribute amateur videos from Syria .

"This western Canadian city, now a boom town once again because of its accelerating oil business, is reeling with the news that more of its sons have joined to fight with the radical Islamic group called ISIS. A government report issued in late August says 130 Canadian citizens have gone abroad to join terrorist groups, including 30 believed to be fighting in Syria. In Calgary, five of those young men are linked to one downtown apartment building, which has a mosque on its ground floor. That mosque is where a recent convert to Islam, Damian Clairmont, began worshipping in 2012. Not long after, he slipped away. His mother told CNN that her son said he was going to Cairo to study Arabic. Instead, she says, he flew to Istanbul and later across the Turkish border into Syria. Clairmont's boyhood friend, Justin Thibeau, says he spoke to Clairmont briefly last December 23. Thibeau says his friend sounded ""normal,"" just as if he wasn't in Syria. Less than a month later, the 22-year-old would be killed on an ISIS battlefield near Aleppo, Syria, fighting against Syrian rebels of the Free Syrian Army. ""I'd be lying to you if I told you I didn't see this coming,"" Thibeau told CNN. ""If he was there for reasons he thought true, there was nothing that could have stopped him."" And only a few weeks ago, one of two Calgary brothers who disappeared in 2012 emerged on Twitter, praising the ISIS terrorists who executed freelance American journalist James Foley. Collin Gordon tweeted under his new Twitter name, Abu Ibrahim Canadi. ""The video of James Foley losing his neck is the perfection of Terrorism,"" he wrote. Collin Gordon and his brother Gregory both said that they had joined ISIS after leaving Canada. Another Calgary Muslim, Farah Shirdon, showed up on YouTube, burning his Canadian passport and vowing to bring his fight home. ""This is a message to Canada and all the Americans,"" he says on the video. ""We are coming and we will destroy you."" Shirdon was also killed. All of this has made Muslim leaders in Calgary say they are deeply concerned about what one of them called ""criminal radicalization."" A conference discussing this will take place in Calgary on Thursday, the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the United States. ""We plan to go beyond primary prevention and focus on how to interrupt criminal acts of violence and even find worst-case scenarios of violent radicals returning from foreign theaters,"" said Madhi Qasas, one of the conference organizers.

"New Delhi (CNN)When I was just a child in London, India surprised the world by winning the Cricket World Cup at Lord's. It was 1983. At the time, India was a desperately poor country. Cricket was a unifying force. You could be Bengali or Punjabi, Goan or Kashmiri, but if you were Indian you were proud of a rare big win on the world stage. A few years later my family moved from London to Calcutta. We had migrated from the birthplace of cricket to the game's burgeoning new Mecca. India's 1983 win turned out to be a catalyst for a new enthusiasm for one-day cricket, the version of the sport in which the World Cup is contested. (The longer version, Test cricket, takes five days per game; a Test World Cup has never been feasible.) My most vivid memories of my childhood in India are of cricket. India was crazy about it. A public holiday meant putting up makeshift stumps on the main road and starting a game. At school we would squeeze in a quick match in our 20 minute tiffin break. No ball? No problem. Our ball was a stone with a handkerchief wrapped around it. No bat? We played ""hand cricket."" No stumps? Well, that's what tree trunks were for. An Indian child could conjure up cricket paraphernalia from anywhere. I was no good at cricket. And yet I couldn't help but get swept up in the national frenzy. When India played another country it was a monumental event. We would feign fevers on the big games to skip school; then we'd try and sneak into the stadiums. Calcutta's Eden Gardens, its stands heaving with 100,000 cricket fanatics, was a sight to see. It was our Mecca. As we grew more middle class and more homes acquired color TVs, we would huddle together to watch games at home. How far we've come. Today, a billion viewers are expected to tune in to watch India play. And it's not just any game: It's India versus Pakistan. India versus Pakistan. Those are three words that conjure up all kinds of images. The two countries have fought three wars. Our childhoods were filled with propaganda videos and movies of the evil enemy. But India versus Pakistan has also been a moment to bring the two countries together. I remember 2004 when India toured Pakistan after a fifteen year break. Thousands of Indian fans got their first glimpse of Pakistani soil when they got special visas to attend games. In 2007, when I visited Pakistan for the first time, the instant ice breaker was always cricket: imagine picking a fantasy team with the best players from either country! After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, I remember the hostility so many Indians felt towards Pakistan; all diplomatic contact was broken off. And then in 2011, cricket provided the opening. Pakistan's Prime Minister visited India to watch a World Cup semi final game. India won. Peace and common sense were bigger winners. The Indian historian Ramachandra Guha describes a great anecdote about the evolution of the India-Pakistan game. In 1996, when Pakistan visited his hometown of Bangalore, Guha made sure he was in attendance. The legendary Pakistani batsman Javed Miandad was playing his final match. Guha dared to stand up and applaud. No one else in his stand did. Many years later, in 2005, things had changed. Pakistan won an epic game of many twists and turns at Bangalore's Chinnaswamy stadium. This time many Indians applauded. Guha describes the change as a larger evolution in the Indian psyche. As India has become more successful, more middle class, and less worried about imminent war with the Pakistanis, it has found within itself a confidence to be sportsmanlike. I couldn't agree more. There is a maturity to the India Pakistan game now that I don't remember in my childhood. Back then it felt like war. If Pakistan won, it was because their Muslim players were meat eaters, they were much stronger, Indians would lament. Now, of course, India is one of the world's largest consumers of fish and meat. Back then, India's place in the world felt forever linked with Pakistan's. No longer. Back then, there was a phrase to describe India's lackluster economic progress: ""the Hindu rate of growth."" No longer. Now cricket is a game -- still the most important one -- but just a game. No doubt, my views are colored by my own journey, my growing up. But when you consider that 65% of all Indians were born in the 1980s or later, well after the two big wars of the 1970s, perhaps young Indians have a different relationship with 'India versus Pakistan.' So let the games begin, and may the best team win. By a strange quirk, while Pakistan has a better record against India in both Test and One Day cricket, India has won all five of its World Cup games against Pakistan. If the odds finally catch up with India and the nation doesn't engulf itself in a period of collective mourning, it will be one more small step forward for a new, confident nation. Go India, and go Pakistan!","Arch-rivals India and Pakistan face off at the Cricket World Cup in Adelaide today .

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)A former deputy testified last week that he overheard the defendant in the ""American Sniper"" murder trial explain why he killed two men. Gene Cole, who worked for the Erath County Sheriff's Office at the time, testified Friday that on June 22, 2013, he ""heard Mr. [Eddie Ray] Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the back seat of the truck and nobody would talk to me. They were just taking me to the range so I shot them. I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me.'"" Testimony resumes Monday in Routh's trial. He is charged with murder in the February 2, 2013, shooting deaths of Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was the subject of ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range. Routh's lawyer admits his client killed the men but contends he was insane at the time. In other testimony, Texas Ranger David Armstrong said investigators searched Routh's residence and found drug paraphernalia, including a pipe commonly used for methamphetamine as well as ""a ceramic pipe, what's believed to be a bong, a grinder used to grind different substances and a loose leafy green substance"" which lab tests confirmed was marijuana. Armstrong also noticed a nearly empty bottle of whiskey in Routh's kitchen. Routh's uncle, James Watson, testified that on the day of the slayings he was rousted out of bed by a call from Routh's girlfriend, asking him to come over because she and Routh had been arguing. He said he showed up and smoked marijuana with Routh, offered fatherly advice about women and played a hymn from his phone. They smoked marijuana together occasionally, Watson said, and Routh smoked ""not everyday, but pretty regular."" When asked what they usually did after smoking marijuana, Watson said, ""We just sit around and enjoy it."" Routh left the house abruptly, apparently because Kyle had arrived to take him to the firing range, Watson said. Hours later, Routh showed up at Watson's home and allegedly said, ""I'm driving a dead man's truck"" -- apparently a reference to Kyle's truck, which he allegedly stole after the killings. Watson said this did not alarm him because Routh sometimes made bizarre statements after returning from military service, such as saying the government was after him. The prosecutor asked Watson whom he thought Routh was referring to, and Watson said, ""I thought he was referring to himself."" After being arrested, Routh told a detective he was worried about his own mental state, according to an officer's body camera video. In the video played in court Thursday, Routh was sitting in Kyle's stolen truck when he told a detective: ""I don't know if I'm going insane."" Routh also spoke of voodoo, hell and the apocalypse in the video. Dr. Jeffrey Barnard, a medical examiner with the Southwest Institute of Forensic Sciences, testified that two of the six bullets that hit Kyle would have been ""rapidly fatal."" A prosecutor asked Barnard several times whether the other victim had wounds consistent with someone lying on the ground or in a kneeling position, but the doctor couldn't say. The prosecution appeared to be attempting to establish that Littlefield and Kyle were defenseless when shot. Both men were shot multiple times at a Texas firing range in February 2013. Kyle and Littlefield were wearing loaded handguns in their waistbands when they were found, an investigator testified Thursday. Michael Adcock with the Texas Department of Public Safety said he also found shell casings, ammunition and several firearms on the ground when he arrived at the Rough Creek Lodge firing range outside Dallas. The guns on Kyle and Littlefield's bodies were loaded, but two ""old-style Western"" revolvers were lying on the ground with all the bullets fired, Adcock testified. The slain men had fired these pistols at targets, the prosecutor has said. The two men took Routh, a veteran with mental problems, to the firing range as a kind of therapy, lawyers have said. After the killings, Adcock said, Routh drove Kyle's pickup to a Taco Bell off Interstate 35 and purchased two bean burritos, leaving a restaurant receipt in the driver's side door of the truck. The trial began Wednesday with a lawyer using Kyle's own words to bolster an insanity defense. But Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash told the jury that Routh told investigators he used drugs and drank whiskey that morning. He admitted that he killed the two men and said he ""knew what he was doing was wrong,"" the prosecutor said. Kyle had already risen to fame through his book when he died. He'd been doing charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated, authorities said. Frank Alvarez, resident manager of Rough Creek Lodge, testified Kyle had ""exclusive access to the range when he came out."" Kyle had said he was going to use the range for about 45 minutes, Alvarez testified, but ""about 5 p.m. I got a radio call that said I had to go to the shooting range. Something had happened."" A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Chris Lett reported from Stephenville, Texas, and Ralph Ellis wrote from Atlanta.","Deputy said he heard Eddie Ray Routh say he killed the men because they wouldn't talk to him .

"(CNN)The New York Times' media columnist David Carr died from complications from lung cancer and heart disease, an autopsy revealed. ""The manner of death is natural,"" Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner, said Saturday. Carr, 58, died Thursday after he collapsed at The Times office in Manhattan. Shortly before his death, he had moderated a discussion about the film ""Citizenfour."" Carr was ""one of the most gifted journalists"" to ever work at the newspaper, said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times. The veteran journalist wrote the weekly ""Media Equation"" column for the newspaper. His writing style was conversational, analytic and peppered with humor. A reporter's reporter, Carr didn't just write about journalism -- he practiced it, taking on media heavyweights with in-depth pieces that exposed wrongdoing. Before joining The Times, he worked for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. But he made his name in the punchy world of alt weeklies -- first as editor of the The Twin Cities Reader, and later the Washington City Paper. He specialized in culture coverage, writing about music, television and film with ease. In 2008, Carr published ""The Night of the Gun,"" a memoir chronicling his struggle with addiction and subsequent recovery. The account was brutally honest, tracing his journey from troubled drug user to loving family man and successful professional. In one passage, he describes a night spent at a Minneapolis home of his then-girlfriend and dope dealer. Trapped in a ""drug-induced paranoia,"" he narrowly escapes arrest when police officers arrive in the neighborhood. Years later, Carr returned to the house. ""Sitting there in a suit with a nice job in a city far away and those twins on their way to college, I almost would have thought I'd made it up,"" he wrote. ""But I don't think I did."" Carr won plaudits for the book, which he reported over the course of two years. ""David was one of the most generous men I've ever known,"" CNN's Brian Stelter said. Carr and Stelter worked together at The Times for six years and appeared together in the 2011 documentary ""Page One: Inside The New York Times."" ""David mentored and nurtured countless journalists, and I was so lucky to be one of them,"" Stelter said. ""I loved him like a father, and he treated me like a son.""

"Can you take non-Muslim women and children captive? Yes, says ISIS. Can you have sex with them, even prepubescent girls? Yes, according to the Islamist extremist group. Can you sell them or give them as gifts to others? The answer is yes, once again. People in Mosul -- the Iraqi city now under control of the group calling itself the Islamic State -- got these and other messages loud and clear after sunset prayers Friday, when armed men handed out a color-printed pamphlet ""Question and Answers on Female Slaves and their Freedom,"" three residents told CNN. ""People started gathering in small groups chattering about this (document),"" said one of the men, whom CNN didn't name for security reasons. ""Most are shocked, but (we) cannot do much about it."" The document was first printed in October or November, then later posted on an ISIS website. It has gotten more publicity recently because of the Middle East Media Research Institute, an independent Washington-based nonprofit whose advisory board includes former National Security Agency Director Michael V. Hayden, onetime CIA Director James Woolsey and ex-U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The idea that ISIS is kidnapping, selling and raping women and children is hardly surprising. Many such accounts have surfaced since the group began its often brutal run through Syria and Iraq, including chilling stories from members of the Yazidi religious minority. And these are on top of other horrific allegations, such as the killings and mistreatment of innocent civilians simply because they didn't subscribe to ISIS' extreme take on Sharia law. Yazidi women 'treated like cattle' And that's the thing about ISIS: Its militants have justified their actions -- like the beheadings of journalists and aid workers -- in God's name. Even then, it is rare to see its rationale laid out as plainly as in ""Question and Answers on Female Slaves and their Freedom."" In the document, for instance, it is explained that capturing women is permissible if they are ""nonbelievers."" It adds, ""Female slaves are the women that Muslims took from their enemies."" Much of the pamphlet talks about ISIS' policy on having sexual intercourse with a female slave, something that the group cites the Quran to justify. ""If she was a virgin, he (the owner) can have intercourse with her immediately after the ownership is fulfilled,"" ISIS explains. ""If she was not a virgin, her uterus must be purified (wait for her period to be sure she is not pregnant.)"" There are other rules as well, like that two men who co-own a captive can't both have sex with her and that a man can't have intercourse with his wife's slave. As to girls: ""It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse,"" the document reads. ""However, if she is not fit for intercourse, he (the owner ) can only enjoy her without intercourse."" The Q&A is clear that, young and old, the captors have full control of their captives. As such, the ISIS document claims, ""It is permissible to buy, sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property."" In response to the question of whether a female slave can buy her freedom, the answer is, ""Yes she can."" The document also says that freeing a slave is something a sinner who has committed an act like unintentional murder or perjury can do for his sin to be forgiven. Alternative actions are fasting for two consecutive months or feeding hungry people. The pamphlet sets a few other guidelines, such as that a captive mother can't be separated from her young children and that an impregnated captive cannot be sold. Beating a female slave for discipline is OK, but beating her for pleasure or as a form of torture is not. There are fewer rules for the captives themselves, though the ISIS pamphlet does identify one thing as ""the gravest of sins"" -- running away from one's master. This document marks the most detailed, albeit not first, justification for enslaving nonbelievers, as defined by ISIS. Time and again, the group cites the Quran and its view of Sharia law. ""ISIS is drawing these rulings from ancient Middle Eastern and Mediterranean codes of conduct for war and prisoners,"" said Abbas Barzegar, professor of religious studies at Georgia State University. ""Muslim leaders and lay practitioners the world over continue to condemn ISIS and find its alien interpretation of Islam grotesque and abhorrent. Unfortunately, in the context of failed states and civil wars most sane voices are often the most drowned out."" None of ISIS' rationalizations hold up, Seton Hall University law school Professor Bernard Freamon wrote on CNN.com last month. ""This argument is plainly wrong, hypocritical and astonishingly ahistorical, relying on male fantasies inspired by stories from the days of imperial Islam,"" said Freamon. ""It is also an affront to right-thinking Muslims everywhere and a criminal perversion of Islamic law, particularly its primary source, the glorious Quran.""","ISIS produces a document, ""Question and Answers on Female Slaves and their Freedom""
It has been posted online, and armed men distributed it to residents of Mosul .

"Islamist militants have told Christians in a northern Syrian city that they will guarantee their safety. But there's a catch. Make that a lot of catches. Christian residents of Raqqa, once one of the nation's most liberal cities, will have to pay as much as 17 grams of gold per adult male in an annual payment, the extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) said in a statement posted online this week. The group is also forbidding the city's Christians from repairing or refurbishing their churches and monasteries, said the statement, which has been circulated in the city, according to Syrian activists. The list of constraints imposed by the militants also limits Christian worship, business activities and alcohol consumption. The heavy restrictions are perhaps unsurprising coming from ISIS, which has broken away from al Qaeda and is fighting with other rebel groups in Syria. Activists told CNN in November that Raqqa was becoming increasingly conservative after ISIS began imposing hardline Islamist law there and meting out harsh punishment to those who don't follow orders. Locals started calling the city Tora Bora and saying it felt as if the Taliban of Afghanistan had taken over. ISIS's new set of restrictions on Christians has drawn criticism from the Syrian opposition and even a radical Muslim cleric. Louay Safi, a spokesman for the Syrian Coalition, said ISIS's treatment of non-Muslims was un-Islamic. And the radical cleric, Abu Qatada, who is on trial in Jordan over terrorism charges, told CNN Arabic on Thursday that the militants didn't have the right to offer protection and demand payment from Christians because they weren't yet empowered to govern Syria. It's unclear how many Christians remain in Raqqa after years of bloody civil war in Syria. Since ISIS began cracking down on dissent in Raqqa, many activists and residents have fled the city. Other things the extremist group have forbidden Christians in Raqqa from doing include: . --  Exposing crosses or their books to Muslims; . --  Making any recitations or ringing any church bells that can be heard by Muslims; . --  Trading pigs or alcohol to Muslims or in their markets; . --  Drinking alcohol in public.","Raqqa was once one of the nation's most liberal cities .

"Washington  (CNN)The Federal Aviation Administration will announce long awaited rules Sunday governing how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, often called drones, will be legally allowed to fly in the United States for business purposes. Currently, all commercial remote controlled aircraft are banned, unless a specific, rare exception is obtained from the FAA and operators follow a lengthy list of rules. Only a handful of those exemptions have been granted since the first was awarded to energy giant BP and UAV manufacturer AeroVironment in June for aerial surveys in Alaska. ""These surveys on Alaska's North Slope are another important step toward broader commercial use of unmanned aircraft,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a news release at the time. ""The technology is quickly changing, and the opportunities are growing."" Foxx and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta will announce the new rules during a conference call for reporters. One of the most significant challenges facing regulators is how to keep the small drones away from larger aircraft with people on board. There have been several close calls where pilots of commercial planes came within feet of UAVs. ""We saw a drone, a drone aircraft,"" an Alitalia pilot radioed in March as he came in for a landing at JFK airport in New York. The UAV came within 200 feet of the jetliner as it was flying at 1,750 feet, three miles from the runway, according to the FBI. It's unclear how complicated the new requirements for commercial drone use will be. The FAA would not provide details Saturday evening. An apparently prematurely-posted FAA document led some drone advocates to believe they will be less burdensome than what is now required of the few operators who received exemptions. On January 5, Douglas Trudeau became the first realtor to obtain an FAA exception to fly a drone to shoot video of houses for sale, but he was required to follow 33 detailed restrictions laid out in a 26 page letter. To legally fly his UAV ,Trudeau must have a regular pilots license, pass an aviation medical check, be assisted by a spotter, request permission two days in advance, and limit flights to less than 35 mph and below 300 feet.","One major challenges is how to keep the small drones away from larger aircraft .

"(CNN)Wintry weather is a relative thing. The Northeast is on alert -- urging drivers to stay off roads -- as the fourth storm in three weeks drops snow that in Boston has exceeded 45 inches in February alone. It takes a fraction of that to get residents in the South into emergency mode. Sometimes, it doesn't even have to snow -- just the possibility of wintry weather is enough for a partial shutdown. ""Wintry precipitation possible"" early this week, the National Weather Service in Atlanta said. The Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for northern Georgia, warning of potential snow and ice accumulation on the roads. This is likely all it will take to send shoppers to grocery stores, with memories of snow events a year ago in Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama, that caused major headaches for residents. Temperatures dropped in the Atlanta area on Sunday, and even though the forecast suggests the snow/ice mix will likely fall farther north, some school districts closed out of an abundance of caution. Also out of an abundance of caution, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 15 northern Georgia counties and asked state workers in those areas not involved in emergency response to work from home. NY tourism site: Don't come here, go to Florida . Last year, it took less than 3 inches of snow to paralyze Atlanta, with motorists stranded for more than 20 hours in some cases. CNN meteorologist Michael Guy explained the weather: ""An area of low pressure will pick up Gulf moisture and collide with the cold air for a major winter event over the next couple of days for areas from Arkansas through Kentucky and Tennessee,"" he said. While last year's debacle has Atlanta's preparations in the spotlight, other parts of the South are bracing for worse weather in the next day or two. ""We have a difficult task ahead of us over the next 24 hours. Our crews will be out in force, and our primary focus initially will be on the interstate system. We will begin clearing secondary routes as quickly as we can. We will work until the job is done, but this will likely be a sustained effort through Monday into Tuesday. We ask motorists to please limit travel during this period,"" said Heather Jensen, a spokeswoman with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. In New Orleans, authorities announced Mardi Gras parades scheduled for Monday would begin earlier in anticipation of the bad weather. Some areas in Kentucky could receive upwards of 10 to 12 inches of snow, Guy said. The North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro closed because of ""heavy wind damage to trees throughout the park."" The wind knocked down two trees at the zoo, spokesman Gavin Johnson told CNN. ""No animals were injured and no buildings or exhibits were damaged,"" he said. Boone, North Carolina, resident Lee Davis reported 2 to 3 inches of snow in his town, via Twitter. The self-described ""weather freak"" warned followers to heed warnings. Residents in other Southern states made preparations, too, from raiding the bread aisles at supermarkets to buying ice melt.

"ISIS fighters stood Saturday on the verge of taking not just a key Syrian town along the Turkish border, but also an entire province on Baghdad's doorstep -- spurring leaders of that province to urgently plead for U.S. ground troops to halt the Islamist extremist group's rapid, relentless assault. The situation in Anbar, just to the west of Baghdad, is ""very bad,"" said Sabah Al-Karhout, the president of Anbar Provincial Council. ISIS, the self-proclaimed ""Islamic State"" which also is referred to as ISIL, controls about 80% of the province. Reports Saturday suggest they have encircled Haditha, the last large town in Anbar province not yet in the militants' hands. Should all of Anbar fall, the Sunni extremists would rule from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria (at least), according to the provincial council's deputy head,  Falleh al-Issawi. To stave off Anbar's collapse, provincial leaders have asked Iraq's central government to intervene immediately and for U.S. ground forces to be deployed there, said al-Issawi. Iraqi army forces and Anbar tribesmen fighting alongside them have threatened to abandon their weapons if the U.S. military does not intervene to help them, he said, because they are faltering before the ISIS onslaught. The army soldiers are not capable of defending themselves against ISIS because of a lack of training and equipment, he said. Already, some 1,800 tribesmen in the province have been killed or injured in the struggle. The Iraqi government has been adamant that it does not want U.S. forces on the ground, and President Barack Obama has not shown any intent to deploy any. The Iraqi government said it has not received any official request from Anbar province for U.S. military intervention and ground forces to help in the fight against ISIS, Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi's media office said Saturday. ""If we receive any request, we will look into it and we will give our recommendation, but thus far we have not received any request,"" the office said. A U.S. defense official said Saturday that Iraq's government hasn't asked for any more American troops beyond those already in Iraq. And if they did, the official added, ""The U.S. will not deploy combat ground forces to Iraq. And we remain focused on enabling the (Iraqi military) in the fight against ISIL through our advise/assist efforts and the air campaign."" U.S. defense secretary:  Iraqi forces in 'full control' of Baghdad . The air campaign this official referred to resumed Saturday. A coalition airstrike killed more than 30 suspected ISIS militants who were part of an armed convoy heading toward the Ein al-Assad military base west of Ramadi, said town police Capt. Bahjat al-Hamdani. Such airstrikes have been going on since August, a stretch in which ISIS has expanded its reach. In Iraq, the group appears to be targeting cities along the Euphrates River.  Al-Karhout said his provincial council has intelligence that ISIS has dispatched as many as 10,000 fighters to Anbar from Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel acknowledged the dire situation Friday, telling reporters, ""Anbar province is in trouble. We know that."" A senior U.S. defense official also told CNN that Iraqi forces are ""up against the wall"" in Anbar. Some units are in danger of being cut off by the advancing militants, who say they are members of ISIS. The Iraqis' ultimate goal is to take back some of the vast areas, in both Iraq and Syria, that ISIS controls. But right now, Iraqi forces appear to be mostly trying to survive, taking defensive positions and using Apache helicopters again, even after two were shot down in the area this week, according to the U.S. official. But officals said Baghdad is not likely to be the next domino to fall. A U.S. Central Command official said Saturday there are ""pockets"" of the militant group's fighters around the capital, but ""no imminent threat of an effective ISIL offensive."" Hagel said Saturday, while addressing reporters in Chile: ""Iraqi security forces are in full control of Baghdad."" Still, the equation could change if ISIS threatens Baghdad airport, from which U.S. Apache helicopters operate. Retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst, said: ""I think at some point, there's going to be the need for an additional ground force in western Iraq."" Those troops could be American or could be provided by other coalition nations, he said, but the Iraqi army, even after coalition airstrikes, has not been able to blunt the momentum of ISIS. ""The Iraqi army has virtually evaporated. The command structure doesn't exist. Although they have some good soldiers, they have no leadership. So, additional ground forces are going to be necessary."" Warning of massacre in Syrian border city of Kobani . In addition to its threats in Iraq, ISIS is a major and still advancing force in Syria, where it emerged during the years-long civil war there. Its current focus there is Kobani, a Kurdish enclave a stone's throw from Turkey. Its fighters controlled about half that city on Friday, significantly more than even a day earlier, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. The Kurdish forces battling them early Saturday repelled an attack on Freedom Square in downtown, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. The London-based monitoring group said Kurdish fighters killed 16 ISIS fighters after targeting the bus they were riding in, which was packed with explosives and ammunition. The Kurds killed another seven militants in another bus southwest of Kobani, the group said. Also Saturday, U.S. and allied warplanes hit a command and control facility, a staging building, a fighting position and two small units north of Kobani as well as three ISIS trucks south of it, according to U.S. Central Command. ""We are doing what we can do through our airstrikes to help drive back ISIL,"" Hagel said. ""In fact, there has been some progress in that area. But it is a very difficult problem."" An anti-ISIS fighter told CNN by phone Saturday that he and others defending the besieged city, also known as Ayn al-Arab, are in desperate straits. Kurdish fighters from the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and Free Syrian Army troops are vastly outnumbered and lack firepower, he said. The fighter estimated ISIS forces are between 700 meters and 1 kilometer from the Mursitpinar border crossing; should they take it, the militants would control three official border crossings between Turkey and Syria and a 100-kilometer border stretch. ""We cannot stop the ISIS advance from the east because they have artillery, many fighters and a good supply of ammunition,"" he said, adding that YPG and FSA fighters are worried because they are close to being encircled by ISIS forces. Inside Kobani, a civilian told CNN that things are worse than ever; the people are forced to endure mortar fire and fears of being beheaded should ISIS take over. The U.N. Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said such brutality may become a reality, warning that ""the 12,000 civilians ... will be most likely massacred."" He added: ""We know -- we have seen it -- what ISIS is capable of doing when they take over a city ... with women, children, minorities and hostages.""

"Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN)After days of ferocious attacks, a ceasefire went into effect after midnight Sunday in Ukraine, followed by brief accusations of  violence. President Petro Poroshenko ordered the Ukrainian military to hold its fire against pro-Russian militants in the nation's East. The separatist Donetsk People's Republic also announced a truce. The ceasefire aims to end 10 months of violence in eastern Ukraine. But less than 90 minutes after it started, Ukrainian officials reported  mortar shelling at a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region. CNN teams in Ukraine said the shelling quieted shortly after midnight. The ""ceasefire is holding,"" according to chief monitor Ertugrul Apakan of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Referring to the first 12 hours of the ceasefire, Apakan said the ceasefire was being respected overall, with some exceptions. Apakan noted violations in the town of Debaltseve, where an exchange of artillery fire began after the ceasefire was implemented. Ceasefire monitors said they were blocked from traveling into the town. Deathly silence in the area was broken Sunday by the sound of shelling and at times civilians still fleeing for their lives, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported. In the area around the city of Donetsk, there were reports of a mortar round, three uses of a multiple-launch rocket system and small-arms fire in the first hour of the ceasefire, but the ""situation was calm,"" the chief monitor said. There were also violations reported before dawn in the city of Luhansk, he said. The OSCE mission ""calls on all parties to fully adhere to the ceasefire in all locations,"" Apakan said. Ukraine's Defense Ministry concurred that combat activity by ""illegal armed groups"" fell after the ceasefire went into effect, but said the situation in Donetsk and Luhansk regions remain ""extremely difficult."" In a statement, defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that since the beginning of the ceasefire, ""enemy forces"" initiated fire from artillery, grenade launchers, mortars and small arms against Ukrainian military positions in the area near the towns of Debaltseve and Shyrokine. Ukrainian forces had suffered no casualties since the announcement of the ceasefire, said Lysenko. The peace agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus, comes with questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick. Mistrust is high on both sides, adding to the doubts. Debaltseve, a strategically located railroad hub in the East, is a crucial piece of the ceasefire. In his speech announcing the ceasefire, Poroshenko said Ukrainian troops control the town and warned militants to stay away. ""I think the fact of using the tense situation on the outskirts of Debaltseve by militants-terrorists-mercenaries poses a great threat, which can violate the ceasefire regime,"" Poroshenko said. Separatists claimed to have encircled Debaltseve. Poroshenko has warned that if the separatists do not abide by the ceasefire, he will impose martial law throughout Ukraine's territory. Shelling rocked two eastern Ukrainian cities Saturday ahead of the ceasefire, raising fears that the deal to end the bitter conflict might be in jeopardy. Both incoming and outgoing artillery could be seen in the vicinity of the coastal city of Mariupol, and there was significant shelling in the city of Donetsk. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council reported seven soldiers killed and 23 wounded in 24 hours. The council said additional forces were crossing the border from Russia into Ukraine in the area of Novoazovsk. Igor Martinov, separatist-appointed mayor of Donetsk, said two people were killed and four injured by shelling in the city center Saturday afternoon. Under the deal, both sides were expected to start pulling back their heavy weapons from the front lines Monday, creating a buffer zone at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide. The OSCE has the challenging task of overseeing the process. It also envisions prisoner swaps, new local elections in the conflict-affected regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, and a law granting amnesty to those involved in the fighting. However, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said that those responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine last summer will not be given amnesty under the Minsk agreement. This could be a potential obstacle to keeping the separatists on board. Western governments believe rebels used a Russian-supplied missile system to shoot down the jet after mistaking it for a military aircraft, while Kiev says it was a Russian officer who pressed the button. The separatists and Russia have denied any responsibility. The Kremlin has said it hopes to see the latest peace plan succeed, but reiterated Russia ""is not a participant"" in the conflict. Russia has steadfastly denied accusations by Kiev and the West that it is sending forces and heavy weapons into Ukraine. But Kiev has accused it of continuing to do so even after the peace plan was signed in Minsk. A previous peace agreement in September swiftly disintegrated. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Mariupol, Ukraine, and Faith Karimi wrote from Atlanta.

"Washington (CNN)A ticking clock and a Carolinas calendar conundrum, turmoil in Camp Clinton and a GOP establishment revenge plot filled our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. Mike Lee was proof  in 2010 that the tea party movement was growing from protest movement to political force. Lee stunned the GOP establishment by wresting the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in Utah from longtime incumbent Sen. Robert Bennett, and from that moment on has been a national tea party star. Now, the establishment is looking to return the favor. So far, no credible 2016 primary challenger has emerged despite frequent complaints about Lee from Utah business and GOP establishment figures. But CNN is told there is now an aggressive push to lure a onetime Utah GOP star back into the game. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, you might recall, went nowhere as a 2012 Republican presidential candidate. Since then, Huntsman is more often seen in Washington, where he is a radio host for a program affiliated with the No Labels political organization. It's no secret that Hunstman's deep-pocketed father is not a fan of Lee's. Word now is that Utah business leaders are looking to talk Huntsman into returning home full time to challenge Lee. And some of the national GOP establishment forces who were successful in opposing tea party candidates in 2014 have told their Utah allies they will join a pitch to Huntsman. There are myriad reasons to be skeptical such a heavyweight matchup will materialize, but it's worth watching. John Podesta wrapped up his work as a top Obama White House lieutenant on Friday, yet the West Wing will be just as much on his mind as he shifts to his new job. Podesta is taking a top position in the nascent Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. After a week-plus of headlines about infighting in the Democratic ranks, the AP's Julie Pace reports there is a feeling among many party loyalists that Podesta is getting started not a moment too soon. ""I'm told that even though he's going to be the campaign chairman, he's going to have a very hands-on, day-to-day role,"" said Pace. ""He's not going to be somebody who's just doing 30,000-foot strategic thinking. And that's very important to a lot of the Clinton camp."" Watch now for reports of ""Skippy"" moments; Podesta is a disciplined, driven but normally soft-spoken guy but is known for having a more feisty alter ego when he feels it necessary to bang heads. The wrangling getting the most attention in Camp Clinton of late is among players in the super PAC community who are gearing up to support her campaign. Accounts vary widely depending on who you talk to -- and their loyalties -- but suffice it to say there are turf and title wars going on, as well as some ego clashes. At the center of much of this is David Brock, once a Clinton nemesis, now turned Clinton convert. He was on the board of super PAC Priorities USA, and also runs a pro-Clinton (anti-Republican) research group. Brock resigned from the Priorities board in a dustup with longtime Obama operatives who are now gravitating to Camp Clinton. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports on efforts to make peace -- or at least detente. ""One Democrat told me that the Priorities folks are groveling to David Brock,"" said Martin. ""I am told that he is on course to come back to the board -- likely to happen early this week."" Both parties have rules about their presidential nominating calendars, and the Republican National Committee is especially eager to assert more control over the schedule, debates and more heading into 2016. But CNN's Peter Hamby says North Carolina wants more impact on presidential politics -- even if it means sanctions. Remember, as a table setter, Iowa votes first, followed by New Hampshire and then South Carolina. ""North Carolina passed a statute last year that said they are going to go the week after South Carolina, one of the first four states in the Republican nominating process,"" said Hamby. ""So three days after these first four states, you could have a state with a lot of big media markets and a lot of voters right square in the middle of this nominating fight. And the people I've talked to in North Carolina, in the Republican Party there, say they do not care at all if the Republican National Committee penalizes them with delegates or whatever; they want the attention, they want to be square out front."" Ohio Gov. John Kasich is off to South Carolina soon. Which means -- you know what. Officially, it's part of his recent travels pushing a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. But Kasich won a big re-election in 2014 and is among a handful of GOP potential 2016 contenders who need to soon make tough choices. Or, as The Atlantic's Molly Ball reports, there is a clock ticking because a crowded Republican field means activists and fund-raisers are feeling pressure to pick sides. ""Time is running out for him to decide,"" said Ball. ""I spoke to him recently and he says he hasn't made up his mind. People close to him think he really hasn't decided what he's going to do.""","An end to the feuding in the Hillary Clinton super PAC world .

"(CNN)Rescuers on Saturday refloated 66 pilot whales stranded on a remote beach in New Zealand as a race to save their lives continued. Nearly 200 whales were beached Friday in Farewell Spit on New Zealand's South Island. Scores got back in the water, only to return to land -- leaving more than 100 dead. When the incident started, 140 conservationists and experts rushed to water down the giant mammals, cover them and try to refloat them back into the water. ""Refloating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job,"" said Andrew Lamason, the department's services manager for Golden Bay. The stranding of large sea mammals is nothing new to New Zealand, where the Department of Conservation responds to an average 85 such incidents a year. But most of the time, it's just one or two whales or dolphins. Mass strandings are rare, especially on the scale of what's happening around Golden Bay.

The new death toll figure, reported Friday, represents a sharp increase from the approximately 4,000 deaths confirmed by the government just three weeks ago. More than 27,000 people have been reported injured, the county's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported Friday. The storm forced 3.9 million people from their homes, the agency said. The typhoon -- considered by some to be among the strongest such storms to make landfall -- struck the Philippines on November 8. Its powerful winds and enormous storm surge smashed buildings, destroyed roads and caused widespread power and water outages.

"(CNN)A U.S Coast Guard cutter has freed an Australian fishing boat trapped in ice 900 miles northeast of Antarctica. The heavy icebreaker Polar Star arrived Friday night to help the Antarctic Chieftain and its 27 crew members, according to the Coast Guard. The Chieftain, a 207-foot vessel,  had lost the ability to maneuver following damage to three of its four propellers on Tuesday. ""The situation was dire,"" said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Allyson Conroy.  ""Had the Polar Star not reached the Chieftain, it would have had to winter in the ice."" After approaching the Chieftain, the Polar Star took it in tow. Both vessels were surrounded by 12 to 15 feet of ice that was covered with two feet of snow, the Coast Guard said in a news release. Towing in ice is much more hazardous than towing in open water and is a slow process, Conroy said. ""The seas of Antarctica are treacherous and unforgiving,"" Vice Adm. Charles Ray, commander of U.S. Coast Guard operations in the Pacific, said in a press release as the Polar Star was on its way to the trapped fishing vessel. ""This incident is a sobering reminder of the importance of the U.S. icebreaker fleet as we see increased human activity in the Polar Regions."" According to the Coast Guard, the Polar Star was diverted to aid the Antarctic Chieftain following the completion of a mission at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, where the 150-member crew provided military logistical support to a program managed by the National Science Foundation. The 399-foot Polar Star is the only heavy icebreaker in the Coast Guard fleet capable of operating in the deep ice of Antarctica to free ice-bound ships like the Antarctic Chieftain or clear the route to resupply McMurdo Station. The Polar Star's home port is Seattle. This is not the first time the Polar Star has helped a distressed vessel in the waters of Antarctica. In January 2014, the cutter was deployed to help break through ice that had trapped the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy and China's Xue Long and left them temporarily stranded.","The Polar Star is a 399-foot U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker .

"(CNN)Lars Vilks is no stranger to threats. The Swedish artist is on an al Qaeda hit list and travels everywhere with bodyguards at his side. He's survived previous attempts on his life. But Vilks said the shooting at a free speech forum at a Copenhagen cafe was the worst. At the Saturday event, France's ambassador to Denmark had just spoken about the recent attack at the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. A woman from a feminist organization had taken the floor and started to speak. Vilks realized that something was wrong. ""We suddenly heard a lot of noise. There was a bang, bang, bang, and very quickly we could understand that something was going on,"" he told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday. Vilks' bodyguards sprung into action. ""They took me and threw me into a storage room together with the chairman,"" he said, ""and we were put under a table there, and we were guarded by policemen with drawn guns."" Outside the storage room, Vilks said, a far more frightening scene was unfolding. A heavily armed gunman was trying to get through the doors of the cafe. And the police were trying to stop him. But it wasn't a fair fight. ""He was very well-equipped, and the policemen were not. So he had an advantage. ... Several of the policemen (were) wounded, but still they tried to fire back,"" Vilks said. Inside the cafe, terrified audience members scrambled for cover. ""They were hiding in corners and under tables and everything,"" Vilks said. ""They were just waiting (to see) who is going to open the door there and who will come in."" Luckily, Vilks said, it was a wounded policeman who finally entered the cafe -- not the gunman, who police later said they'd killed. The artist wasn't hurt, but the gunman did kill a 55-year-old man and wounded three officers before fleeing, police said. It's impossible to know for sure what the gunman's aims were, Vilks said. But Vilks said it's likely that he was the target. Controversial sketches Vilks made depicting the Prophet Mohammed in 2007 landed him on an al Qaeda hit list with a $100,000 bounty on his head and have sparked a number of threats and attacks against him. For many Muslims, any image of Mohammed is seen as blasphemous. Depictions that deliberately insult the Prophet are even worse. Vilks receives regular death threats and regularly sweeps his car for explosives. While speaking at a 2010 free speech forum, Vilks was punched at the podium amid cries of ""Alahu akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is great."" The event quickly descended into a brawl. ""I'm now such a well-known target, and that adds to value, because these guys, they work very much concerned with the media interest, so if they want to kill someone, it should be someone who is well-known. ... And that means that when I go somewhere, I always have bodyguards,"" he said. ""I can't go anywhere on my own."" Does the Denmark attack mean he'll pull back from public appearances? Vilks said he plans to keep speaking out, but he told CNN on Monday that he'd gone into hiding. He declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid. Organizers of future events will take security very seriously, he said. Islam and other religions, he said, should be open to criticism because their ideology is deeply tied to social and political issues. ""If you go into the political business, you have to play the game,"" he said. ""And as long as that goes on, criticism of Islam is to be continued, and rightly so."" Vilks said his work and those who are discussing it are ""part of a political conversation."" ""And if you have people who want to go out with guns and start murdering people, the thing you should do is put these people in prison, because we cannot accept people murdering and trying in that way to stop the discussion you have,"" he said. Such conversations, he said, are a key part of free speech and living in a democracy. The one responsible for the violence ""is of course not the one who is following the rules and keeping a reasonable discussion going,"" he said.

"(CNN)We devote one day of every year to celebrating our presidents and the other 364 to complaining about them. But what if this year, on Presidents Day, we realize something else: . We have an unhealthy obsession with presidents as the sole movers of American politics. For too long, Americans have understood history primarily through the lens of the presidency. School textbooks and media accounts all suggest that everything that is good and bad can be understood as the result of a president's skill, personal foibles and decision-making ability. If only President Bill Clinton, who critics called ""Slick Willie,"" wasn't so willing to sell out traditional Democratic principles! If only President George W. Bush had a better understanding of the complexity of foreign affairs! If only President Barack Obama would be more willing to wheel and deal on Capitol Hill! Lyndon Johnson is the prime example of a president who has received both kinds of treatment, the person whose legendary political skill is held responsible for the Great Society and the villain who single-handedly dragged the nation into the quagmire of Vietnam. It is understandable why we focus so much attention on the president. After all, the president is powerful. Just as important, there is a simplicity to the presidency -- he is a single person, elected every four to eight years, and through his story, we can tell a clear narrative about the complicated processes of politics. There is a dramatic arc that can be used to describe the career of a president that serves as a crutch for many journalists and historians, lending itself to more exciting accounts of what happens in Washington than someone who digs deeper into the trenches of the messy political process. But presidents don't act in a vacuum. On Presidents Day, we should spend some time thinking the huge range of factors that affect the success or failure of the commander in chief. Congress is among the most important. As anyone who has served in the White House knows, the House and Senate have immense influence over what a president can do and how they go about doing it. The moments when there have been the greatest legislative breakthroughs, such as the New Deal or the Great Society, have come at times when the presidents were fortunate to find legislative majorities that were willing and able to push through big policy agendas. Without congressional support, that has been hard to do. When the forces of obstruction are strong, even the savviest president -- such as Franklin Roosevelt after the 1938 elections or LBJ after the 1966 midterms -- can't do much to make Washington work. The electorate plays a huge role in giving presidents the kind of Congress that they need or taking that kind of Congress away. Although Americans are often cynical about the differences that elections can make, the truth is that big landslide elections, when voters make a statement at the ballot box, have been able to create sizable majorities favoring a president's agenda. Other elections, usually midterms, can strengthen the president's opponents. President Obama thrived after the 2008 election, when strong and impassioned Democratic majorities, feeling the momentum of the historic election, moved as series of landmark bills that included health care, financial regulation and an economic stimulus. Grassroots activists also have a big influence on the outcome of a presidency.  The moments when there have been significant shifts in public opinion about certain political issues have often revolved around the hard work of grassroots activists, upon whom a president can rely. During the 1930s, the vibrant and growing union movement offered the foundation for FDR when he pushed for many of his programs, including the Wagner Act of 1935 that created the National Labor Relations Board and legitimated unions. Public opinion in the 1960s shifted to the side of civil rights because of the intense mobilization of movement activists. During the 1980s, Ronald Reagan's message resonated with the electorate in large part as a result of how the conservative movement had helped shift public opinion over the decade. At other times, grassroots movements can create great problems for a president. This was the case when the anti-war movement gradually strengthened public opposition to Vietnam, causing huge problems for Presidents Johnson and Richard Nixon. Even the national security policies of a given period are not all the result of what a president does or does not do. The reality is that presidents operate within a thick institutional environment inhabited by military officials, defense contractors and bureaucrats who play a big role in creating boundaries for the   options that a president can employ. Presidents are also profoundly affected on foreign policy by what they inherit. President Johnson had to deal with Vietnam, an area where Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy had already staked out a role for the United States. Most recently, President Obama has found it difficult to shift course on of the majority of President Bush's counterterrorism programs and on his expansive vision of the president's wartime authority. Once policies are in place, presidents often have to respond to them rather than shape new directions. Political interests and sentiment also grow around existing policies that make it hard for presidents to fundamentally change them. Finally, there is the political process. If we don't look at the rules of the game, our stories about given political periods are thin. For the 1930s to the 1960s, it is impossible to understand American politics if one does not deal with the immense power of committee chairmen within Congress, upon whose authority legislative power depended. Today, the influence of private money, donors and lobbyists helps explain as much as anything President Obama does in the outcome of many policies, such as the decision to pass financial regulation legislation at the height of the economic crisis that was written in a way that provided multiple opportunities for Wall Street firms to circumvent the laws. None of this is to say that presidents are not extraordinarily powerful and important. But we need to do a better job putting presidents into context, celebrating them and criticizing them with a full understanding of the constraints that they face and the factors upon which they depend. If we don't, we'll continue to have unrealistic expectations about what the next president will do, and will surely be disillusioned, as we miss what exactly it has taken for the great presidents to succeed.","Julian Zelizer: America tends to exaggerate the impact of its presidents .
On Presidents Day, remember that there are many other people who can make a president succeed or fail, he says ."
"(CNN)Five teenagers are in custody after the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union, France, Saverne prosecutor Philippe Vanier said Monday. The minors, all between the ages of 15 and 17, grew up in the Alsace region of France and have no criminal records. Police took the teens into custody after a 15-year-old turned himself in, saying he had damaged the cemetery with four other teenagers, the prosecutor said. One of the teens denied the attack was anti-Semitic, Vanier said. The teens thought the graveyard was abandoned and didn't notice the graves were Jewish until after they had begun to vandalize them, the prosecutor said, recounting what one of the teens told police. They are charged with desecration of graves and with organized damage on property for the public benefit, Vanier said. They each face a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. Though it wasn't noticed until the weekend, it appears the damage occurred late Thursday afternoon. About 250 graves were damaged, with most of the damage consisting of headstones being overturned and columns uprooted. Photos from the cemetery showed gray stone and glossy marble headstones lying on the ground as if they'd toppled over. ""We express the strongest condemnation of the desecration of hundreds of graves in a Jewish cemetery,"" Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a news release. ""Everything will be put in place to identify, arrest and send to justice the perpetrators of these ignominious acts,"" he said. ""The French Republic won't allow another act against our values."" Calling the site ""an image of desolation,"" Philippe Richert, president of the Alsace region, told Agence France-Presse why he felt the damage was the certain work of vandals: ""One doesn't knock over heavy steles like that dating from the 19th century very easily. It was a deliberate act of destruction."" Prime Minister Manuel Valls sent out a tweet calling the destruction ""a vile, anti-Semitic act, an insult to the memory"" and promised ""everything will be done to find those responsible."" This is not the first time the Sarre-Union cemetery, located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the German border, has been targeted. In 1988, about 60 Jewish headstones were knocked over, and 54 grave markers were damaged in 2001, AFP reported. The vandalism comes within weeks of other Jewish cemeteries being targeted around the world. In Warsaw, Poland, on January 31, someone wrote ""Jews for slaughter"" on the fence outside one of the continent's largest Jewish burial grounds, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. And in Dunedin, New Zealand, on Saturday, a vandal spray-painted a swastika on a headstone and knocked over two others, breaking them, in the Jewish section of the Southern Cemetery, the New Zealand Herald reported. The cemetery attack in France comes after two high-profile acts of violence against Jews in Europe. Following last month's attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine, a gunman killed four Jews in a kosher supermarket in Paris. Over the weekend, a gunman attacked a free speech forum in Copenhagen before shooting several people outside a synagogue. CNN's Laura Akhoun and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.","5 teens in custody; one says attack not anti-Semitic, prosecutor says .

"(CNN)Who says you need a printer to churn out digital-quality images? The Human Printer, a project from graphic design duo Stinsensqueeze, is recreating this modern effect with decidedly old-school techniques. Louise Naunton Morgan and Stina Gromark use fine tip markers and endless patience to mimic the layered tonality of CMYK color printing, which uses cyan, magenta, yellow and black to create the full spectrum. (You may recognize these colors from your old printer cartridges.) However, the handmade component gives each print its own look and feel. ""With something handmade, you create unique experiences or unique art works, whereas digitally, you can produce it over and over again, and it's exactly the same,"" says Gromark. How it's made . Recreating an image seems both incredibly simple and frustratingly specific. Using a half-tone version of a digital image as their guide (imagine a picture broken down into tiny grayscale circles), the designers create four layers of tiny pen dots that correspond with the CMYK process colors. If done correctly, the dots should create the illusion of seamlessly blended colors and defined shapes. ""It's like what you see on a billboard: if you were to look really closely, you would see all of the individual dots,"" Naunton Morgan explains. ""The process is really very simple, just take care not to make lots of errors ... Anyone could do it."" The amount of time needed to complete an image largely depends on the subject's complexity and the size of the dots (smaller dots create a more convincing optical illusion and take more time), but on average, it takes one person eight to 10 hours to fill a letter size sheet. Fusing the human and the digital . Naunton Morgan and Gromark first started the Human Printer in 2009 while studying at Central Saint Martins in London. As graphic design students, they often discussed human interaction with technology, and how the handmade relates to the digitally produced. ""You print an image for a digital print and it always has the same finish to it. Something that's handmade is much more unique, it's much more individual,""  Naunton Morgan says. ""These ideas married themselves together and we were like 'Hey! What would happen if you were to do (digital printing) by hand?'"" Their peers' enthusiasm compelled them to extend the project beyond graduation, and Naunton Morgan and Gromark eventually absorbed it into their current design practice. (They currently operate out of London and Paris.) The future of prints . While they do accept commissions like a traditional printing service and have recently started selling prints online, Naunton Morgan and Gromark try to reposition their work in more creative ways. In September, they were invited to create their largest and most ambitious work yet at Unseen photo fair in Amsterdam. For four days, visitors watched Naunton Morgan, Gromark and a rotating team of five volunteers work in a glass cabin, dotting out a landscape on one of its 140 square foot walls. They've also released two books exploring human intervention in digital processes. Though they haven't confirmed what they'll try next, Gromark is happy to muse on the possibilities. ""Could we print in on another material? Could we explore the same process in a 3-D printer?"" she says. ""We're just trying to expand the way we see it."" Replacing traditional printing, however, will never be the goal. The hours required to make a print by hand are wildly impractical in the face of today's instant printers, and no matter how much effort is made, it's impossible to get a true duplicate with markers. In fact, the Human Printer put this to the test last year by hand-printing the same image 20 times in a row. The prints were not identical, but they were inimitable. ""That's the nature of why it's called the Human Printer,"" says Naunton Morgan. ""It's about celebrating things that are handmade and do have errors, compared to those that are digitally produced.""

"(CNN) -- From the political unrest in Egypt to why House Majority Leader John Boehner cries, here are some of the best sound bites from the Sunday morning talk shows: . On Egypt and President Hosni Mubarak's future: . ""This is going to be up to the Egyptian people. But let's look at what we have. We have a calendar that already has elections for the next president scheduled, so there is an action-enforcing event that is already on the calendar."" -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CNN's ""State of the Union"" ""I think it is loud and clear from everybody in Egypt that Mubarak has to leave today, and it is nonnegotiable for every Egyptian. People have been saying or demonstrating for him to leave. Today, the demonstrations say that he should be put to trial. If he wants to save his skin, if he has an iota of patriotism, I would advise him to leave today and save the country."" -- Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" ""I firmly believe it. I think if you listen to the street, they are not asking for democracy, they are not asking for anything except the removal of Mubarak. He's become a symbol for everything that they find objectionable. It doesn't mean it can't be a transition as orderly and I certainly hope it is. But he is a symbol now and you've got to change the symbol."" -- Edward Walker, former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, ""State of the Union"" ""So I think what we need to do now is to lay out a plan for Mubarak to lift the state of emergency, announce that elections -- free and fair -- will be held in September, which were already planned, allow an open and free democratic process, which I think we could have some confidence if it was an open process that you would see a free and fair election and that we make sure that the aspirations of the Egyptian people are realized finally."" -- Republican Sen. John McCain, ""State of the Union"" ""Not every country can become a democracy at the snap of a finger, but Egypt might well be ready for it. And that would be the best outcome, as I say, of a lot of bad choices. Mubarak cannot continue in the long term with the oppressive regime he's had now. The demonstrators have shown that."" -- Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, ""State of the Union"" ""People in Egypt have shown during this time a great deal of solidarity, a great deal of desire to see their country develop and prosper. And I believe that every loyal Egyptian will continue to undertake his responsibilities and contribute towards the improvement of his homeland."" -- Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian ambassador to the U.S., ABC's ""This Week"" ""What could be realistic is that Mubarak himself becomes convinced, with outside advice, that it is in his interest, as well as in Egypt's interests, that he goes, and that he sets in motion a process which facilitates that. I think the alternatives otherwise are much tougher."" -- Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter, ""This Week"" ""I'm not speculating about who goes or who stays. And I'm not prepared to comment on what kind of democratic process the Egyptian people can construct for themselves. But we obviously want to see people who are truly committed to democracy, not to imposing any ideology on Egyptians, and therefore we would like to encourage that people who have been the voice of protests and been the voice of civil society be the ones at the table trying to design what would be an orderly transition to meet the democratic and economic needs of the people."" -- Clinton, CBS's ""Face the Nation"" ""It's not up to us to give the Egyptians advice about this. You know, hopefully this transition will occur relatively peacefully. And at the end of it all, I hope we still have an important ally in the Middle East."" -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, NBC's ""Meet the Press"" On where the U.S. stands: . ""We are on the side -- as we have been for more than 30 years -- of a democratic Egypt that provides both political and economic rights to its people, that respects the universal human rights of all Egyptians. And that is the message that every ambassador, whether Republican or Democratic president, everyone has conveyed for over 30 years."" -- Clinton, ""State of the Union"" ""What's important to us is Egypt, it's not Mubarak. And Mubarak is not Egypt."" -- Walker, ""State of the Union"" ""I think that President Mubarak, he knows what's going on in his own country. It's up to the United States to be a helpful, assisting but insisting partner. And by the way, we cannot afford a Tiananmen Square in Cairo. "" -- McCain, ""State of the Union"" On U.S. aid to Egypt: . ""We have sent a very clear message that we want to see restraint, we do not want to see violence by any security forces, and we continue to convey that message. There is no discussion as of this time about cutting off any aid. We always are looking and reviewing our aid."" -- Clinton, ""This Week"" On whether Americans in Egypt should leave: . ""We are following the conditions for American citizens extremely closely. This is one of my highest responsibilities. And we have authorized voluntary departure, which means that we will assist American citizens to leave Egypt. We have warned that there should not be any nonessential travel to Egypt."" -- Clinton, ""Fox News Sunday"" On addressing the debt ceiling: . ""We can come to a reasonable agreement that curbs spending. ... But to just stay in your corner and say, 'It's my way or I'm shutting down the government,' that could lead to terrible, terrible problems. And I would plead with my new Republican colleagues in the House who seem to want to do this, that that is playing with fire. Please don't do it."" -- Schumer, ""State of the Union"" ""The president of the United States is asking us to increase the debt limit. But on Tuesday night, he didn't even address it. And I don't think the American people will tolerate increasing the debt limit without serious reductions in spending and changes to the budget process, so that we can make sure that this never happens again. The other night, all he did was call for more stimulus spending. I think our team has been listening to the American people. They want to us reduce spending, and there is no limit to the amount of spending we're willing to cut."" -- House Majority Leader John Boehner, ""Fox News Sunday"" ""We have two opportunities to do something important for the country on spending and debt. We ought not to miss this opportunity. The president ought to step up to the plate with us and tackle it together."" -- McConnell, ""Meet the Press"" On changing the health care legislation: . ""The president has said he's open to changes to this. He is not open to refighting the entire fight of health care. People have suggestions on how to make it better. But he's not in favor of refighting this fight."" -- White House chief of staff Bill Daley, ""Face the Nation"" On why he cries so much: . ""I feel pretty strongly about what I do. I didn't come to Washington to be a congressman. I came here to do something. And I don't need to be speaker of the House because I need some fancy title. I came here to do something on behalf of the American people."" -- Boehner, ""Fox News Sunday"" On why he smokes: . ""Oh, why do we bring this up again? You know, smoking. It's a bad habit but I have it. And it's a legal product. I choose to smoke.

"Hundreds of dolphins that washed up on Peruvian shores died of natural causes, a government official said in a radio interview Tuesday. ""One of the things that we can confirm is that ... the deaths of the dolphins were not caused by any human activity, and this is a very important subject,"" Peruvian Production Minister Gladys Triveno told RPP Radio. Government investigators have also ruled out theories that bacteria or a virus could be behind the deaths, she said, adding that further details would be revealed in a report from the Sea Institute of Peru released Tuesday. ""It is natural causes. It is a natural death, and also the report explains the process of natural selection. Let's say that the species that are more prepared, the dolphins that are more prepared, are those that are going to survive,"" Triveno said. ""And this happens periodically. This is not the first time it has happened. And it is not only happening in Peru, but also has happened in New Zealand, in Australia, in other countries where these phenomena happen."" According to the report, authorities sent specimens to no fewer than four laboratories for a battery of tests. The results ruled out a number of theories of the cause of death. Hunger, interaction with fishermen, pesticides, bacterial infections, viral infections and heavy metals contamination were all ruled out. The appearance of nearly 900 dead dolphins in a 220-kilometer (137-mile) area in northern Peru so far this year, and the deaths of thousands of pelicans there and in neighboring Chile, have sparked concern among local residents and environmentalists. At least one Peruvian environmental group has said loud sounds from nearby oil exploration could be to blame for the dolphins' deaths. ""We see that in their bodies there are air bubbles caused by heavy pressure. These animals are underwater holding their breath, facing a sudden and violent noise. These animals release nitrogen, and this forms the bubbles that end up destroying living cells,"" Carlos Yaipen-Llanos of the Scientific Organization for the Conservation of  Aquatic Animals told CNN en Español this month. Government officials have dismissed that assessment, arguing that it is not supported by evidence. The report explained that the dead dolphins began washing up on the shore before the seismic activity started and that similar activity in the past has not been linked to marine deaths. This month, Peruvian authorities said warm waters off that country's coast were to blame for the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds. The Peruvian Ministry of Environment said seafood is still safe to eat and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen, according to the state-run Andina news agency. The report suggested some courses of action, including the creation of a task force among multiple agencies to implement programs for caring for the marine ecosystem. It also called for an awareness campaign about Peruvian ocean life and its conservation, aimed at the general public. The dolphin deaths in Peru mark the third set of high-profile strandings in the past several months. In February, 179 dolphins --108 of which were dead -- washed ashore in Cape Cod, in the eastern United States, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Marine biologists are still trying to determine the cause of those deaths. In early March, amateur video taken from a beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showed more than 30 dolphins on shore. In that instance, all the dolphins were safely returned to the sea.","Tests rule out pesticides, heavy metals, hunger, fishing, viruses, bacteria as causes .

"Eski Mosul, Northern Iraq (CNN)The mortar was dropped into the launch tube, but nothing happened. A prod, a kick and a shake failed to stir it. Eventually one of the Kurdish fighters at this position near Mosul unceremoniously tipped the tube upside down, picked up the offending shell and lobbed it over the sandbags, where mercifully it failed to explode. About 100 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were at this frontline position in Eski Mosul late last week, perhaps the most contested piece of real estate in northern Iraq. It sits at a junction that leads from Mosul to Tal Afar and beyond to the Syrian border -- a critical supply line for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Supported by coalition air strikes, the Kurds swept down to seize the area late last month. Now they are engaged in daily battles with ISIS fighters, many of whom are local, according to Kurdish commanders who listen in on ISIS radio communications. Between the sandbags and through the haze, a white building 800 yards away protected an ISIS position. After one mortar was (this time successfully) fired at the building, a sniper's bullet shot over the Kurds' position with a faint hiss -- as if to say ""You missed."" The Peshmerga are now well dug in at Eski Mosul with mortar batteries, at least one MILAN anti-tank missile and heavy machine guns. The MILAN is especially useful for taking out vehicles rigged up as suicide bombs. The wreckage of one sits just 100 yards from the Kurds' defensive positions. In two days, the Peshmerga say, ISIS sent 20 vehicle bombs up the road, a sign of how badly the terrorists want to retake this position. One had 8.5 tons of TNT primed to explode, according to Kurdish commanders, but its driver was shot and killed before he could detonate the device. The importance of the crossroads was evident from the presence of a small detachment of British military personnel who covered their faces and quickly drove off at the first sign of a television crew. ""No photos please,"" pleaded their Kurdish minder. On the way to Eski Mosul, the villages around Zumar show the scars of ISIS occupation. Some buildings occupied by the group had been razed by air strikes. But many more were blown up by ISIS fighters as they retreated. Others were booby-trapped with cleverly-hidden explosive devices to await families coming home. One elegant villa on a hill had been reduced to a jagged mix of concrete and steel wire. Crushed between cement slabs was a flat screen TV; a staircase lay at a crazy angle. The owner -- a Kurd -- stood outside, curling amber beads between his fingers. His nephew had come to the house with three others, he said. They opened the front door and there was a massive explosion. The commander of this area and head of the Kurdistan Region Security Council is Masrour Barzani, one of Kurdish President Massoud Barzani's sons. At his well-guarded hilltop base, he waved his hand across a map of the region. The Peshmerga have retaken some 5,000 square miles of territory since the high-water mark of ISIS' expansion in this region, and now guard a front of some 700 miles -- an area stretching from Sinjar in the north to Kirkuk in the center of Iraq. ""The myth of ISIS being undefeated has been broken,"" Barzani said. But he also described ISIS as ""pretty much intact"" as a fighting force. He estimated it has some 40,000 members in Syria and Iraq, aided by many more collaborators and sympathizers among Sunni Arab tribes alienated by Iraq's previous government. But now the Iraqi army had to step up, he said. The Kurds could not -- and should not -- take mainly Arab towns like Tal Afar, which ISIS has held since June. ""We don't want to create any political sensitivities with the Arabs,"" said Barzani. Barzani -- like many in the region and beyond -- is trying to work out ISIS' strategy in Iraq. Its center of gravity appears to be shifting south and west, with most offensive operations taking place in Anbar and Salah ad Din provinces. Its raid on the town of al-Baghdadi in Anbar, using sleeper cells within and coordinated attacks from outside, shows that ISIS is still capable of complex operations, even after months of airstrikes. Some of these territorial gains are fleeting and tactical and may be intended to pull Iraqi forces in different directions. For example, ISIS last week launched an attack on villages south of the city of Tikrit, which it still holds, drawing in a mixture of Iraqi military, police and Shia militia units. At the same time, ISIS is making a major effort to resupply and reinforce its presence in Mosul. From a ridge overlooking the town of Sinjar, we witnessed a constant stream of trucks and tankers traveling between the Syrian border and the Mosul area at high speed, as coalition drones and F-16s flew overhead. Barzani believes ISIS is redeploying fighters from Syria to this part of Iraq. The Kurds' progress means militants have had to take a circuitous route, but there is no sign that ISIS is ready to abandon Mosul -- a symbolic and strategic prize. ISIS draws on the victories of Nur al-Din al-Zanki against the Crusaders 900 years ago and his slaughter of Christians throughout what is now Syria. Al-Zanki united Aleppo and Mosul under his rule, and built a mosque in his name in Mosul. It was at that same mosque, on the first Friday of Ramadan last year, when Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took to the pulpit to declare his caliphate. Inside the city, however, the situation is dire, according to accounts of the few residents who have been able to leave, messages from inside the city, and Kurdish officials. Water and electricity are in short supply, the price of basics has rocketed, and ISIS' rule has become more draconian. Suspected ""collaborators"" are being summarily executed, among them former police and military officers. ISIS has been building up its defenses around the city with trenches and berms, and has destroyed at least one main bridge. Barzani told CNN that in areas the Kurds had taken, people were ""literally starving ... in extremely bad condition."" ""People are afraid to send their girls out because they are afraid they might be taken as concubines for the emirs or fighters; they are afraid to send young boys out to run errands because they're afraid they might be taken as fighters for ISIS,"" he said. But across Iraq, ISIS continues to benefit both from Baghdad's weakness and sectarian tensions. Iraqi security forces are being retrained and reorganized with U.S. help, but they're not yet fit for purpose and still reliant on Shia militias, known as Popular Mobilization Units, in some areas. Nor are they familiar with the close urban combat that will be required to retake a city like Mosul. The murder in the capital of a prominent Sunni tribal leader, Sheikh Qassim al-Janabi, on Friday has again inflamed sectarian tensions, with Sunni blocs suspending their participation in the parliament and government. Al-Janabi had campaigned for investigations into the disappearance of Sunnis. A leading Sunni figure in the government, Deputy Prime Minister Saleh Mutlaq, said after the attack: ""We must get rid of militias and weapons must be put in the hands of the state."" Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has promised to do just that, but must also be aware of the need for effective fighting forces against ISIS. The result, says Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch, is that ""Iraqi civilians are being hammered by ISIS and then by pro-government militias in areas they seize from ISIS."" Human Rights Watch is investigating the deaths of more than 70 people after a Shia militia captured a Sunni village in Diyala province last month. ""With the government responding to those they deem terrorists with arbitrary arrests and executions, residents have nowhere to turn for protection,"" Stork said. And that's just what ISIS wants.","The frontline position in Eski Mosul is perhaps the most contested piece of real estate in northern Iraq .

"(CNN)An Iraqi tribal leader said Saturday that ISIS militants are gaining ground in Anbar province, predicting a ""collapse within hours"" of Iraqi army forces there if tribal forces withdraw. Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, a Sunni Muslim leader of the Albu Nimr tribe, called for more U.S. intervention -- including ground troops, arming tribes directly or at least pressuring the Iraqi government to give the tribes more firepower. While U.S. officials have said that ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is on the defensive in Iraq and Syria, al-Gaoud says that's definitely not the case where he is. ""In Anbar, we are losing ground, not gaining,"" he said. Thousands of families had been under siege in the town of Jubbat al-Shamiya until getting help Friday from U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and Iraqi forces, according to al-Gaoud. But he said Iraqi troops had pulled out of Jubbat al-Shamiya on Saturday, at which time ISIS was shelling the town. If the Islamist extremist group's fighters go in, al-Gaoud predicted a massacre. Anbar province is just west of Baghdad, meaning a decisive ISIS victory would put militants on the footsteps of the Iraqi capital. It's home to the strategic Ayn al-Assad Air Base, which came under attack Friday. Talking about that battle, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said 20 to 25 people -- most, if not all, of whom were wearing Iraqi military uniforms and were led by suicide bombers -- attacked the nearly 25-square-mile base. ""It looks like (ISIS militants) at least got to the outer base limits,"" Kirby said. At least 13 Iraqi soldiers died in the assault, said al-Gaoud, which ended with Iraqi ground forces killing all the attackers. U.S. troops were on the base at the time, but ""several kilometers"" from where the fighting happened, Kirby said. The U.S. military did deploy attack helicopters in that ISIS assault, but the Apaches returning safely without firing a shot, military sources said. American helicopter gunships were also involved in a fight supporting Iraqi ground forces about 15 kilometers (9 miles) north in the Anbar town of al-Baghdadi, according to sources. Al-Gaoud, the Albu Mimr tribal leader, said militants killed at least 25 Iraqi police officers during their assault on that town Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, the U.S. military said al-Baghdadi was ""contested,"" as Iraqi forces fought back. Anbar is important not just for its location, for the al-Assad base or for the Haditha dam, Iraq's second largest. It's significant for its sectarian breakdown -- as a mostly Sunni province in a Shiite-led country. Sectarian divisions have hurt Iraq before, with ISIS' rampage through much of Iraq (as well as neighboring Syria) blamed in part to the country's lack of unity. It's one reason for then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's exit last year, replaced by current leader Haider al-Abadi. The U.S. government has gotten involved to address such tensions as part of its anti-terrorism fight, such as President Barack Obama's warning last June -- a few months before al-Maliki stepped down -- that ""there won't be a military solution"" unless Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds all play significant parts in Iraq's command structure. Years before, in the mid-2000s, the United States recruited and paid Sunnis like members of al-Gaoud's Albu Mimr tribe to join its fight against al Qaeda. Those efforts helped turn the tide in the war. But now, al-Gaoud says, ISIS -- which consists of Sunni extremists -- is making his tribe pay the price. ""There are people who will be killed in cold blood, and there will be more massacres,"" al-Gaoud told CNN in November. ""We are getting killed because of our friendship with the Americans. Does a friend abandon his friend like this?"" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Tribal leader warns of a massacre if ISIS moves into Anbar province town .

"(CNN)Boston's brutal winter has made its way into the record books. After yet another blizzard last week, the city marked its snowiest month since record-keeping started in 1872, forecasters said Sunday. ""It's official, Boston has reached its snowiest month on record with 45.5 total inches,"" the National Weather Service tweeted early Sunday. ""The old record was 43.3 in January 2005."" And as the inches piled on, the city marked another milestone: third snowiest winter on record, with 89.2 inches so far. Forecasters predict that a blizzard will linger until Sunday night. Cape Cod and the islands off the Massachusetts coast could see hurricane-force winds. Track the storm . Meanwhile, wind chill warnings were in effect for Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut and parts of Maine and Pennsylvania. ""A wind chill warning means the combination of very cold air and strong winds will create dangerously low wind chill values. This will result in frost bite and lead to hypothermia or death if precautions are not taken,"" the weather service said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has declared the next seven days ''Valentine's Week'' in an attempt to help restaurants, flower shops and other small businesses hurting from the record-setting snowfall. Speaking to reporters about storm preparations for the fourth time in three weeks, the governor quipped, ""There's a little bit of deja vu all over again."" Your images of winter weather . The blizzard will bring drifting snow in many parts of eastern Massachusetts, Baker said. Already, the snowfall is expected to be more than what was forecast as recently as Saturday night, Baker said Sunday morning. He urged drivers to stay off the roads. On Sunday, officers responded to reports of a wreck that may have involved upward of 20 vehicles on I-95 in Waltham, state police in Massachusetts said in a statement. There were no immediate reports of major injuries. A snow squall was cited as a possible contributing factor to the crash. ""Tomorrow is a holiday (Presidents Day), and it's probably a really good time for everybody to come up with neat things to do indoors and right around your house,"" Baker said. How to beat the winter blues . Sunday's storm will compound the exasperation caused by four weather systems that have dumped piles of snow on the city. Eastern Massachusetts is under blizzard warnings, as are parts of eastern Maine. The snowfall is lighter, relatively speaking, in the western part of the state and heavier in the east. It's expected to let up on Sunday afternoon. Some gusts have been reported at more than 50 mph. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph will cause the snow to blow around and hamper visibility. Power outages can be expected in many areas, the National Weather Service said. The collecting snow caused damage to an apartment complex in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, police there said. A partial roof collapse at the apartment complex displaced 30 people, Portsmouth police Capt. Ken Smith said. ""There were no injuries, but it did damage to two units on the upper floor,"" Smith said. ""This was most likely caused by snow load."" About 20 miles to the south, in Seabrook, New Hampshire, a portion of a strip mall also collapsed because of snow, according to Mark Bibau of the local fire department. No one was in the affected businesses at the time of the collapse, he said. ""A lot of these commercial buildings are flat (roofed),"" he said.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, better known to many as The T, won't run Sunday, when the worst of the weather will hit. There will be no subway, bus, commuter rail, trolley or ferry service. It's the third time the subway has shuttered service because of a serious storm.

"(CNN)Houthi rebels in Yemen should stop taking over democratic institutions and start negotiations, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted in an emergency meeting on Sunday. All parties in Yemen should cease armed hostilities, and the Houthis should withdraw their forces from government institutions, the council said. Sunday's 15-0 vote came several days after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that Yemen was ""collapsing before our eyes."" The rebels -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- surrounded the presidential palace last month. Yemen's President and his Cabinet resigned days later. Last week, the United States, the United Kingdom and France suspended operations at their embassies in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa amid the growing unrest. The Houthi takeover hasn't been smooth. There has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa. Sunday's resolution says the Security Council deplores ""the unilateral actions taken by the Houthis to dissolve parliament and take over Yemen's government institutions, which have seriously escalated the situation, expressing alarm at the acts of violence committed by the Homhis and their supporters, which have undermined the political transition process in Yemen, and jeopardized the security, stability, sovereignty and unity of Yemen."" The resolution also noted ""grave concern that the Houthis are holding Yemeni government officials,"" including the President, under house arrest.

"A suicide attack north of Mosul, Iraq, on Saturday killed at least 36 people and wounded 48 others, authorities said. The bomber, wearing an explosive vest, blew himself up at a funeral of a member of the Shabak, an ethnic minority group, in the outskirts of Mosul in northern Iraq. The Shabak people are Muslims, and 65% of them are Shiite, with the remaining 35% Sunni. The attack took place in Baashiqa, whose majority is Shiite Shabak. The Shabak people number about 250,000 in Nineveh province and have their own language, Shabaki, as well as style of dress. The attack was the latest violence in a country torn by sectarian conflict. On Friday, a bomb hidden in an air-conditioning duct killed 30 Sunni worshipers and wounded 52 others in a mosque near Baquba, Iraq, which is about 37 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Baghdad.","At least 36 are killed and 48 injured .

"The Obama administration has confirmed what we have been hearing for months, that chemical weapons have been used in Syria by the regime of embattled President Bashar al-Assad. The news, revealed in a White House letter to Congress, presents President Obama with a stark question. Will the United States become directly involved in the two-year-old Syrian civil war? Last August, Obama issued a stern warning to Assad. If he used chemical weapons, Obama said, even if he moved them in preparation for use, he would cross a ""red line"" that would have ""enormous consequences."" Before that, Obama had already declared  that the regime would be ""held accountable"" if it made the ""tragic mistake of using those weapons,"" a warning he repeated last month during a trip to the Middle East. Obama has now come up against his own words and the stakes are enormous. The United States has a range of options, including several that do not include sending American forces into Syria. One path is to provide more muscular support to certain rebel units. The administration has been reluctant to arm the rebels because Islamist radicals, including some closely affiliated with al Qaeda, have become an important part of the anti-Assad forces. This is problematic, since Washington has called for an end to the Assad regime, a regime that, incidentally, is closely allied with Iran and Hezbollah. But it is possible to discern the members whose ideology is relatively consistent with U.S. values and policies. Those fighters should receive carefully selected weaponry to raise their effectiveness against Assad and increase their appeal within the opposition. In addition to helping arm them, the United States should look into the possibility of creating safe havens, no-fly zones, where the opposition and civilians might be protected by NATO from Syrian air attacks. There is also the option of destroying Assad's most dangerous weapons stocks through aerial bombardment. Although, depending on the target, bombing could carry the risk of spreading the contents, and in the end, the United States may need to remove the stockpiles by designating allies to enter the facilities that hold them. Any action should be taken, to the extent possible, under the NATO umbrella. The one course of action Washington cannot afford is to ignore its own warnings and the U.S. intelligence community's conclusions. Doing so would legitimize the use of chemical weapons, letting regimes that hold power by force know that they can use the world's most reviled weaponry to preserve their rule from internal challenges. Failure to act could hasten a grave escalation in a war that has put the entire Middle East on a knife's edge. It would threaten to spread its destructiveness beyond Syrian borders and raise the incentive for other militias to start using chemical agents, potentially fueling a market among terrorist groups everywhere. And it would make the dire warnings of an American president ring hollow, with damaging consequences for global stability, not to mention for American security.  Among those watching, Iran would certainly draw its own conclusions if the United States ignores its own red line. Until now, the Obama administration has resisted pressure to take a tougher stance against Assad if only to stem the killing. More than 70,000 Syrians have already died and millions have fled the fighting. Refugee pressures are building in neighboring states, and the conflict has already drawn fighters from other countries; among others, Hezbollah militias from Lebanon, which have joined the war on Assad's side. For almost two years the president opted to limit U.S. involvement, reportedly rejecting proposals from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former CIA chief David Petraeus to arm carefully selected segments of the opposition. At the same time, America has provided generous help for refugee care, along with nonlethal aid to the rebels. The use of chemical weapons, however, is a game changer. The beleaguered Assad has admitted possessing an enormous chemical arsenal. Syria holds stockpiles that experts say include Sarin, VX and mustard gas. Production facilities and warehouses for them are spread throughout the country. Regional analysts believe that Assad has thousands of rockets filled with nerve agents ready for use with the Syrian army's vast missile systems. U.S. officials say there's much they don't know yet about how the weapons have been used. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said on Thursday that within the last 24 hours U.S. intelligence officials concluded the Syrian government forces used a small amount of an agent, probably Sarin. The use of those ""uncontrollable, deadly weapons,"" Hagel said, ""violates every convention of warfare."" Charges that Assad's forces used chemical weapons surfaced months ago, but it was a March 19 attack in Aleppo that drew global attention. In the face of mounting evidence of people with respiratory distress, burns and other signs of unconventional weapons use in a battle zone, the rebels accused Assad and Assad accused the rebels of using chemical agents. The Syrian government called for a U.N. probe, but then refused to allow the investigation. More recently, France, the United Kingdom and Israel have said they have found evidence of chemical weapons use. On Wednesday, Israel's head of military intelligence said Israel has gathered evidence, including photographs of areas with people with mouths foaming following an attack. He said he believes Assad has used the weapons several times, including on March 19. It is likely that Assad is testing international reaction by using limited amounts of banned weapons. If reaction does not follow, he will probably use them more extensively. The United States has deployed a few hundred troops to Jordan, just south of Syria, with the purpose of aiding refugee care and, according to a Los Angeles Times report, as ""the vanguard of a potential military force of 20,000 or more"" in case the United States decides to move to secure Syria's chemical weapons. The United States and the world have many options on the table, none of them risk free. But the riskiest of all would be delaying a meaningful and forceful response.","Frida Ghitis: Obama administration confirmed Syria regime used chemical weapons .

"One person dies every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose in the United States. On Thursday, the Drug Enforcement Administration tried to combat this epidemic by saying it will tighten controls on hydrocodone products, some of the most commonly misused narcotic painkillers on the market. The DEA action moves hydrocodone combination pills, also known as opioids, from a Schedule III to a Schedule II drug. The final ruling goes into effect in 45 days. Drugs are categorized into one of five ""schedules"" by the DEA based on ""whether they have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, their relative abuse potential and their likelihood of causing dependence when abused."" Other drugs, such as Adderall and morphine, are also labeled as Schedule II. Hydrocodone combination pills put hydrocodone with less potent painkillers such as acetaminophen. One example is the drug Vicodin. Now, in order to use these drugs, patients will have to get a written prescription from a doctor -- instead of one submitted orally by phone. And refills are prohibited; patients would have to check in with their doctors to get another prescription. A Schedule II classification also puts manufacturing quotas in place for these hydrocodone products. Pure hydrocodone is already a Schedule II substance. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said the ruling is a victory for those trying to find answers in the opioid overdose epidemic. ""If you think about bringing the epidemic under control, you have to get treatment. But we also have to stop creating new cases of addiction.

"São Paulo, Brazil (CNN)A Miss Bum-Bum runner-up, Andressa Urach, now admits her obsession with beauty -- and cosmetic surgery -- almost killed her. Urach, 27, launched her career as a model and reality TV star with a face and body sculpted in the operating room. ""I've had more than 10 surgeries,"" she told CNN. ""My nose, my cheekbones, my jaw. I injected my lips numerous times, changed my breasts twice and did liposuction two times."" In 2012, she got second place in the uniquely Brazilian contest known as Miss Bum-Bum, or Miss Backside. Modeling contracts followed. ""I idolized my body, so it had to be perfect,"" she said during the interview in the São Paulo apartment she shares with her 9-year-old son. Her agent brought out the before-and-after pictures. First, snapshots of a thin teenage mom nicknamed ""Beanpole,"" smiling and hugging her baby. In the more recent pictures, her body fills out: pouty lips, enormous breasts and her now-famous derriere as well as voluptuous thighs. ""I had plastic surgery like going to the supermarket,"" she said. ""I wanted to take out ribs to have a slimmer waist. I wanted to cut off my toes to wear smaller shoes."" Eventually, the medical procedures took their toll. Last November, Urach was rushed to the hospital in septic shock. She spent weeks in intensive care, then in a wheelchair. Hoping for more curvaceous thighs, Urach had taken large quantities of anabolic steroids. Then, she injected her thighs with hydrogel and a plastic known as PMMA. By November, the tissue in her legs was rotting. Pictures taken at the hospital show huge, gaping ulcers. More than two months later, she is still getting her legs drained. We accompanied her on a doctor's visit. ""Back when Andressa injected the hydrogel, she put in 10 times the amount allowed,"" said plastic surgeon Felipe Tozaki. ""It's injected into the muscle and fat and skin, and it's difficult to remove."" After the bad publicity, authorities said they wouldn't renew the license for hydrogel to be used in Brazil. Now Urach is warning against excessive vanity. ""I hope those injuries, those holes can be an example to warn women that there is a huge risk. You have to respect the limits of your body,"" she said. Brazil, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, surpassed the United States in 2013 as the country with the most cosmetic surgical procedures -- 1.45 million. While American women received more breast implants than their Brazilian counterparts, Brazilians got 64,000 buttock augmentations, almost six times more than Americans. Unfortunately, many women take shortcuts or seek doctors who aren't qualified but are willing to try more risky procedures. ""If my doctor hadn't been willing to put the 500 milliliters of hydrogel in each leg, I would have gone to four or five doctors, getting a little bit from each one,"" Urach said. According to the Federal Council of Medicine, there are 5,500 recognized plastic surgeons in Brazil, but nearly 12,000 doctors perform cosmetic procedures without proper training. The demand for cosmetic procedures spikes in the summer months and especially ahead of Carnival, when many women seek a nip and tuck before they strip down to their glittery bikinis in Carnival parades. Doctor Tozaki said the problem is cultural, but it is also medical, noting that 10% to 15% of patients ""have psychiatric issues,"" more specifically body dysmorphic disorder. ""They look in the mirror and they'll always find something wrong,"" Tozaki said. ""Like me,"" Urach said. After her nightmarish surgeries to remove hydrogel from her thighs, Urach said, she'll never go under the knife again. But she also would never go back to the way she looked before. ""I like the way I look now,"" Urach said. ""It's good to take measures to improve your looks, just not excessive measures.""

"(CNN)A few days ago, when British journalist Charlene White posted on Twitter an apparently unretouched photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford, she launched a firestorm of debate over what women's bodies should look like as they get older. The image showed the 48-year-old Crawford looking sultry, but imperfect, in black lingerie, her bared stomach and thighs characterized by what appears to be some cellulite, wrinkles and sun damage. ""Take a bow, Mrs. C,"" White tweeted. To many, this was a welcome change from photos of the latest celebrity who'd gone the cosmetic surgery route. Over the last year, when Hollywood stars like Renee Zellweger and Uma Thurman appeared in public with new faces, there was speculation that they got plastic surgery and the public reacted with harsh judgment. So it's no surprise that when photo of Crawford was shared all over social media, many people commended White for making it public and Crawford for having ""the guts"" to open herself up to such scrutiny. White told CNN, ""Women come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. I think it's important to see all sorts of body shapes on our screens and in our magazines so that people have a true reflection of what people look like."" But the photo was not, it turns out, from Marie Claire, as White acknowledged. It's an unpublished outtake from a 2013 photo shoot from Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, which is owned by a different publisher. The image was shared by White without Crawford's knowledge or permission. The irony here, of course, is that White took ownership of an objectified version of Crawford's body in exactly the same way she set out to criticize others of doing. White said to CNN, ""I want people to feel like magazines aren't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies, but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images. ... No one has the right to tell other people how to feel about their body."" And yet, isn't that exactly what White did? Crawford lingerie image stirs debate over what 'real women' look like . If White had done her journalistic due diligence, shouldn't she have made sure the woman in the photo actually felt comfortable having such an intimate photo of herself broadcast to the world? White doesn't know how Crawford feels about that image, and we still don't know. (The supermodel has not yet commented on the photo.) In releasing the image, White made an example of one woman's body to satisfy a personal agenda -- that magazines should show more ""realistic"" images of women. On ""Good Morning America,"" White said, ""I thought I would tweet the picture because I found it incredibly empowering to see someone as beautiful and iconic as Cindy Crawford in her natural form."" To be sure, there is some comfort to be found in that photo. One of the world's most famous models has cellulite! One of the most recognizable female icons grows old and ages just like the rest of us! But in praising this photo, are we implicitly saying that we respect the aging process only when it mirrors our own or when it shows some imperfections? After all, what we like here is that Cindy, in fact, doesn't look all that amazing, and to say she does resonates as more than a little condescending. She is beautiful, to be sure, but what we're celebrating as ""real"" are her flaws. The release of the photo and the response it has generated is quite the opposite of inspiring. The message it seems to convey is that the only way we celebrate a woman's aging body is when we bear witness to its flaws. After all, we call women like 32-year-old Australian model Erin McNaught, who released photos of her toned body four weeks after giving birth, ""vain,"" ""insecure,"" and ""attention-seeking"" because we don't find any comfort in seeing those photos. So let's call a spade a spade. We don't like Crawford's image because it's ""real."" We like it because it's a little startling and a little unattractive, and therefore makes us feel better about ourselves. But that isn't what empowerment is -- using others' faults to downplay or justify our own. We're also not cheering Crawford's bravery in showing the world what even the most genetically blessed 50-year-old women look like, since the photo was very likely shared without her permission. We're using her to make ourselves feel better. Which, of course, could not be more unattractive.","An unretouched photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford was posted on Twitter by journalist Charlene White .

"New York (CNN)New York City's longest recorded homicide-free streak ended late Friday night, when a 28-year-old man was shot multiple times just before midnight. Eric Roman was transported to a nearby hospital in critical condition with gunshot wounds to his head, hand and leg and died Saturday, according to the New York Police Department. New York City had gone 12 days without a homicide, its longest stretch on modern record, police said Monday. The last reported homicide was February 1, Super Bowl Sunday, in Upper Manhattan, police said. That day, police responded to a 911 call about multiple shots being fired and found five individuals with gunshot wounds, the NYPD said. One of those five, Graham Shadale, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police have not yet made arrests in either case and both investigations are ongoing, officials said. The streak has been the longest since the New York Police Department began recording statistics with a computerized program called Compstat in 1994, a police representative said. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hushed talk of the streak Friday on ""CBS This Morning."" ""Shh ... we don't want to jinx it,"" Bratton told host Charlie Rose. ""We're into our 12th day now, Charlie. Eleven is a record and let's keep it going."" Despite the record-breaking streak, there has been an uptick in shooting incidents compared with the same time period last year. The week between February 1 and February 8 experienced 110 shooting incidents in 2015 versus 91 in 2014, according to Detective Cheryl Crispin of the NYPD public information office. New York City's last record for a streak of days without a homicide was 10 days. In 2014, there were no recorded homicides between February 13 and February 22.

"(CNN)Peter Schipper presses a key on the enormous Wurlitzer organ console in front of him and a police siren wails across the cinema stage. A second key brings the sound of tweeting birds, and another the clopping sound of horse hooves, as if someone is standing off-stage with a pair of coconut shells. Then he flexes his fingers, leans in to the array of keyboards and launches into a cheery rendition of ""I'm Getting Sentimental Over You."" The organ's pipes throb, sing and trill with the power of a full orchestra. Were if not for for the fact Schipper is wearing jeans and a plaid shirt, we could be transported back to the early 1940s, when the Wurlitzer-Strunk organ was in its heyday at the Tuschinski Theater -- an immaculately preserved art deco cinema in the heart of Amsterdam. The Tuschinski was an opulent masterpiece when it opened in the 1920s -- its owner, Abraham Icek Tuschinski, took pains to equip it with the best organ his money could buy. A Jewish immigrant originally from Poland, Tuschinski was killed along with his family in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War and his cinema renamed the Tivoli. After the war it reverted to its original name and in the 1980s benefited from an expensive restoration project that returned much of its original grandeur. Fascination with insects . Today it's a fully functioning three-screen film theater operated by French cinema chain Pathe. The Pathe Tuschinski Cinema regularly rolls out the red carpet for movie stars as the location for most major premieres in the Netherlands. The lushly decorated lobby and grand hall -- with elaborate fixtures and decorations said to be inspired by Tuschinski's fascination with insects -- are impressive enough, but the cinema's star attraction is its Wurlitzer organ. It's still capable of producing rich sounds, largely thanks to the efforts of a team of volunteers from the Dutch Organ Federation, who use mechanical ingenuity to keep the instrument going. ""When we first took her apart, she was in a very bad condition,"" said Dick Cuiper, a 55-year-old computer programmer who worked on a project to restore the organ with Schipper, a 67-year-old piano tuner, bookkeeper Pieter Kroon, 76, and other volunteers and technicians. ""It's taken us many, many years to fix her up and get her working properly again. We're not professionals, but we've learned by doing it every day."" As Schipper continues playing, Cuiper and Kroon take great pride in crossing the main stage (once graced by visiting stars Marlene Dietrich and Judy Garland) and leading the way down to a series of cramped rooms where the organ's innards vibrate to its mighty sounds. A mechanical wooden bellows wheezes to fill the musical pipes with rushing air. Automated percussion instruments boom and clash. Old boots springs and air tubes . The organ is in immaculate order but, says Kroon, some of the machinery has been cobbled together from odds and ends. ""You cannot go to any store to buy the things the organ needs, they're not made any more,"" he says. ""Instead, we have to produce them ourselves out of old boots, springs and air tubes."" Cuiper points to a series of glass-windowed wooden cabinets that house the organ's main circuitry. It would've been simpler to tear them out and replace them with a modern computer processor, he explains, but the team preferred to recreate the original electrics. ""It was a challenge for us,"" he says. ""But in 100 years someone will easily be able to fix this, and they won't be able to find the microchips they need to mend the computers."" Wanted: Young helpers . The volunteers still spend hours every week maintaining the organ, but time is limited because the cinema hosts a full program of movie screenings. They face another problem. Although the enthusiasm of Kroon and Schipper is as strong as ever, their advancing age means they need to find and train a new generation volunteers to keep the organ sounding its best. The Wurlitzer still pulls in admirers. Schipper gives regular performances to parties of schoolchildren and groups on the twice-daily guided tours of the Tuschinski, as well as special cinema events including screenings of the silent films it was originally installed to accompany. The organ and theater also occasionally attract members of a dwindling group of Wurlitzer maestros -- including Americans R. Jelani Eddington and Lyn Larsen and Britain's Len Rawle. ""There's always applause. It's a great privilege for all of us to play,"" says Kroon. ""She's an old lady. You have to be careful with her, but you also have to play her because if you don't, she will start to fail.""

"A 20-year-old California man who told authorities he wanted to travel to Syria to join the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been arrested, according to federal documents. The detention order said Adam Dandach of Orange County told federal agents he planned to travel to Syria to join ISIS, ""a known terrorist organization, that he would assist ISIS with anything the ISIS asked him to do, and that he believed the killings of U.S. soldiers are justified killings."" ISIS is waging war against the Iraqi government and has taken over several major cities in Iraq. It is seeking to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses portions of Iraq and Syria and has begun imposing Sharia law in the towns it controls. Dandach was charged with  two felony counts of making a false statement on a passport application. The criminal complaint said Dandach was arrested July 2 at the Orange County Airport, where he planned to board a flight for Istanbul. He was traveling with a replacement passport that he obtained by saying he'd accidentally thrown away his original passport, the complaint said. But federal agents discovered Dandach's mother, Sawsan Ghannoum, had actually taken away his original passport and hidden it to prevent him from taking an overseas trip in December, the complaint said. The detention order said Dandach admitted to his brother that he perjured himself on the passport application. ""Dandach stated that he was more disappointed that he did not get to go to Syria than in getting in trouble with law enforcement,"" the detention order said. Dandach is being held in custody until his next court appearance, scheduled for Monday in Santa Ana. CNN made calls to Dandach's mother, who hung up, and left a voice mail with his brother, Ghassan Ghannoum. A voice mail was also left with his public defender. The voice mails were not returned. In April, a Colorado woman was arrested at the Denver airport and charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, according to court documents. Shannon Maureen Conley, 19, allegedly told FBI agents before her arrest that she was going to be with a member of ISIS whom she had met through the Internet.","Adam Dandach of Orange County told agents he wanted to join ISIS .

"(CNN) -- An alleged terrorist leader suspected of plotting the bombing of a Philippine superferry more than four years ago, killing at least 116 people, has arrived in Manila after his arrest in Bahrain, a Philippine justice official said Saturday. Authorities suspect Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. was behind the 2004 superferry bombing. Authorities in Bahrain arrested Ruben Pestano Lavilla Jr. last month, said Ricardo Blancaflor, undersecretary at the Department of Justice. Lavilla was deported Saturday to Manila, where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters, Blancaflor said. Lavilla is one of the top ideologues in the Rajah Solaiman Movement, a group of former Christians who converted to Islam and claim affiliation with the al Qaeda-linked regional terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, Blancaflor said. Blancaflor said authorities suspect Lavilla helped plot the bombing of a superferry near Manila on February 27, 2004, in which at least 116 people died. They believe Lavilla also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila on February 14, 2005, an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the Valentine's Day Bombing. The bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day. The two other blasts, both fatal, happened in the southern cities of General Santos and Davao. Blancaflor said he suspects Lavilla was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Manila, all of which were thwarted by Philippine police. In describing Lavilla's arrest in Bahrain, Blancaflor said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1276, which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the Taliban. Jemaah Islamiyah aims to create a Muslim ""superstate"" across much of Southeast Asia. Authorities blame the group for the Bali, Indonesia nightclub bombings of 2002, which killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists. The group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The Abu Sayyaf group is one of several Islamic militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.

"The truck was loaded with munitions, then driven up a hillside in northern Syria. Moments later, there was a massive blast followed by cries of ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great"" in Arabic, and the rattling of gunfire. What made this suicide bombing stand out was not that it happened -- as such attacks have become fairly commonplace in war-torn Syria -- but the identity of one of the men who carried out. He was American. In an online video and social media, radical Islamists claiming responsibility for the blast touted one of the attackers as Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki, an American. Late Thursday, two U.S. officials confirmed their boast. The man was a U.S. citizen who grew up in Florida and went to school there. Investigators are interviewing family members. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday evening the American is believed to be Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha. Whichever name one uses -- Abu-Salha or Al-Amriki -- he was among a group of Americans whom intelligence agents have been trying to keep tabs on since they went to Syria some months ago to join extremists in the fight against the Syrian government. Smiling, holding a cat . Abu Farouk al Shamy, a spokesman for the rebel Suqour al-Sham battalion, told CNN that the Sunday attack was executed in coordination with the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization. One video on YouTube, with the title ""the American martyrdom from al-Nusra Front,"" identifies the suicide bomber as Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki. This video and several other social media posts feature a picture of a bearded man with that name, smiling and holding a cat. Al-Amriki in Arabic means ""the American."" The name Abu Hurayra, which is popular among Sunni Muslims, offers little clue as to the man's identity. Abu Hurayra was a companion of the Islamic prophet Mohammed and the narrator of Hadith. Syrian activists say the video is from Sunday and shows militants' preparations and ultimate attack on Syrian military checkpoints in Jabal Al-Arba'een, near the city of Ariha in Idlib province and believed to be along a key rebel supply route. According to Syrian activists and social media postings, four vehicles laden with explosives were part of the attack. One YouTube video says the American detonated the biggest one, which contained 17 tons of explosives, including artillery shells. It is not clear what exactly this man's involvement was, including whether he was driving an armored truck, a tanker or some other vehicle. Islamists praise the American . Even if he clearly did not act alone, it is the man identified as Abu Hurayra who has gotten a lot of attention on websites and social media venues tied to radical Islamists. That includes a tweet by a man with the handle Abu Suleiman al-Muhajer, whose bio identifies him as belonging to al Qaeda in the Levant, the umbrella organization for the al-Nusra Front. His tweet, which was published on the radical Islamist website Hanein, features the alleged American's picture and the words, ""Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki performed a martyrdom operation in Idlib, Jabal Al-Arba'een. May Allah accept him."" On the heels of this suicide attack, counterterrorism officials are focusing on young Americans who head off to wage war in the embattled Middle Eastern nation, U.S. officials told CNN. U.S. authorities are investigating a network of recruiters who officials believe are funneling money and young fighters to Syria, the officials said. Their aim is to stop the flow of money and recruits to Syria. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials have expressed concerns about Americans joining the fight in Syria, including with groups like the jihadist al-Nusra Front. The worry is that they and other Westerners might pose a threat when they return a home, or perhaps end up targeting Europe or Western interests in the Middle East. ""There's going to be a diaspora out of Syria,"" FBI Director James Comey said last week. ""And we are determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a future 9/11.""

"(CNN)Conan O'Brien and his late-night show are no stranger to road trips, but this time it looks like he's pulled off a major one: filming in Cuba. O'Brien spent the past weekend with his crew filming the March 4 episode of his TBS show in Havana, Cuba. It marks the first time a U.S. late-night show has filmed in the country since the  embargo began in 1962. A news release from the show says the host spent ""multiple days taking in the sights, sounds and culture of the country. The trip gives the 'Conan' audience a rare glimpse into the daily life of a country not often seen by American viewers."" In December, President Obama announced that the U.S. would be moving to re-establish diplomatic relations with the island nation, including reopening an embassy in Havana and loosening travel restrictions. According to Deadline, O'Brien picked the weekend before Presidents Day because his show does not tape on the holiday and would be available to travel. In the past, he has taken the show to locations including Ireland, Atlanta, Toronto, Chicago and Dallas. Now that the door has been opened, there may be a flood of American productions headed to Cuba's shores. In January, it was announced that a production of ""Rent"" done in cooperation with the Cuban National Council of Performing Arts would be the first full Broadway musical held in the country in 50 years. In February 1959, Jack Paar traveled to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro for ""The Tonight Show."" Paar was roundly criticized for the move, despite the fact that Ed Sullivan had interviewed the Cuban leader in January.

"Al Qaeda appears to have had enough of one of its affiliates fighting in Syria: the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. The group has been locked in conflict with other Islamist factions and gained a grim reputation for abuses in parts of Syria it controls, including summary executions and mass killings. A statement posted on jihadist forums Sunday and purportedly issued by al Qaeda's General Command said ""it has no connection with the group"" and blamed it for ""the enormity of the disaster that afflicted the Jihad in Syria."" The al Qaeda statement, translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, follows more than a month of intense factional fighting between the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant with other Islamist groups in northern and eastern Syria. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights says it has documented 1,747 people killed in the past four weeks alone but suspects that the real number is substantially higher. In recent days, the Islamic State has targeted senior figures in other groups. On Sunday, two senior rebel leaders were killed near Aleppo -- along with 14 others -- when an Islamic State member who was supposedly conducting truce negotiations with them blew himself up, according to the Observatory. The previous day, Islamic State fighters assassinated Abu Hussein al Dik, a senior commander in the powerful Suqour al Sham brigade, near the city of Hama. Observers say the internecine fighting has played into the Bashar al-Assad regime's hands, distracting other Islamist factions from their campaign against the Syrian military. It seems that al Qaeda's political leadership has signed off on the latest statement disowning the Islamic State. Its publication by As-Sahab, the organization's official media wing, gives it considerable weight. Laith Alkhouri, senior analyst at Flashpoint Partners, a U.S.-based group that analyzes jihadi pronouncements, says the statement is ""straight to the point and one that leaves no room for doubt: 'ISIL does not represent us!' ""The statement indicated that al Qaeda was never consulted or informed about the establishment of such a group and plainly said there is no organizational connection or link"" between them, Alkhouri said. From the U.S. point of view, al Qaeda's move to cut ties to the group is ""unprecedented"" in recent history, according to a U.S. official directly familiar with the latest intelligence analysis. He notes that this year, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered the Islamic State to defer to another affiliate, the al-Nusra Front, as the main al Qaeda organization inside Syria. ""We haven't seen this kind of disobedience before. It's a strategic affront"" to Zawahiri and al Qaeda, the official says. The official notes that Zawahiri has consistently been trying to prove his own importance and relevance to the organization, but this latest statement appears to go beyond that effort to control a rising affiliate. Zawahiri's exasperation with the Islamic State is well-known. The bad blood between the groups goes back nearly a year. In April, the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, suddenly announced its expansion from Iraq into Syria and declared that it was absorbing the al-Nusra Front, which had by then become one of the most effective fighting forces against the Syrian regime. Both al-Nusra and Zawahiri rejected the Islamic State's takeover attempt. Al-Nusra's leader said simply that ""the Front's banner will remain as it is, without changing anything."" In a letter in June, Zawahiri declared that al-Nusra was ""an independent branch of al Qaeda that follows al Qaeda's General Command"" and instructed the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant to disband and return to Iraq. The Islamic State rejected Zawahiri's instruction, in a rare act of open defiance toward the global leadership of al Qaeda.  An audio message attributed to Baghdadi said, ""We will not compromise, and we will not give up."" Al-Nusra and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant continued to cooperate on a local level, but tensions between the two groups over objectives and methods continued. Other Islamist factions complained that the Islamic State was more interested in setting up its own emirate in northern Syria than in fighting the al-Assad regime. The Islamic State has begun imposing sharia law in towns it controls like Raqa and Azaz, forcing women to wear the full veil, or niqab, in public and banning music. That complaint is echoed in the statement from the General Command, which says, ""We do not rush to announce emirates and states over which the scholars of the mujahedeen and their command and the rest of the mujahedeen and the Muslims did not consult."" Pressure on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has mounted in the past two months, especially with the formation of an umbrella group of Islamist fighting groups called the Islamic Front. Observers say the Front can probably marshal between 40,000 and 50,000 fighters. While cooperating quietly with al-Nusra, it has been involved in clashes with fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. An influential cleric among Syrian jihadists, Sheikh Adnan Al-Arour, has even suggested that some Islamic State members are working for the Syrian mukhabarat or secret police. Al-Arour said in December, ""We are not accusing everyone in ISIS to be agents, but the majority of your commanders are indeed."" There also appears to have been internal dissent in the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. A video appeared on Islamist websites in December announcing a ""corrective movement within the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria."" Last month, Zawahiri renewed his appeal for unity among jihadist groups in Syria, saying in an audio message, ""Our hearts are bleeding, the heart of our Islamic nation is bleeding when we see the internal strife among the mujahedeen in Syria."" Islamic State leader Baghdadi responded in less than contrite terms, saying his ""fighters will defend themselves from attacks, and asking elements from opposition groups in Iraq and Syria to repent or suffer consequences."" His appeal was taken up by a prominent figure in jihadist circles, Muhammad al Mohaisany. A Saudi said to be a key financier of radical Syrian factions, Mohaisany announced that he would try to mediate between the rival groups. But in an audio statement released Sunday, he turned on the Islamic State, saying it had ""rejected the initiative that was accepted by all the other factions to stop the bloodshed of Muslims in Syria."" Mohaisany's views are echoed in another statement issued by As-Sahab and attributed to a senior al Qaeda ideologue, Muhammad Mahmoud al-Bahtitit. He stresses that ""there is no way to manage this definitive battle in the history of the Ummah except by unifying with the good people under a pure banner that everyone agrees with and is not enforced upon them."" Flashpoint's Alkhouri sees that as directed at the Islamic State. Despite being ostracized by fellow jihadists, the Islamic State seems confident of its destiny. According to Brian Fishman of the New America Foundation, ""The ISIL is also bringing in much larger numbers of foreign fighters, including approximately 900 Europeans, many of whom are learning to use sophisticated weapons and small unit tactics."" Chechens, Turks and many fighters from other Arab countries have also joined the group. Fishman said in December that the tensions between the Islamic State and other groups represent a deepening rift in al Qaeda. ""ISIL is the most direct descendant of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (who led al Qaeda in Iraq until his death in 2006) and the violence-first, absolutist strain of al Qaeda. The conflict between these groups is indicative of larger tensions in the al Qaeda enterprise."" Alkhouri sees the next stage of this conflict as bringing al-Nusra and groups within the Islamic Front closer, an ""emerging sign of powerhouse jihad. Combining two of the most effective jihadi forces in Syria will tip the balance of power"" against the Islamic State, he says. 90 killed in punishing air raids in Syria's Aleppo .

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)The man suspected of killing two people in Copenhagen swore fidelity to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a posting made on what's apparently his Facebook page just before the weekend shooting spree. The post pledges ""allegiance to Abu Bakr in full obedience in the good and bad things. And I won't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief."" The suspect in Saturday's attack has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, a senior member of the Danish government said. The gunman opened fire at a free speech forum in Copenhagen on Saturday before shooting several people outside a synagogue and then firing at police. Police killed him in the shootout. The nation began the healing process Monday night with a candlelight vigil at which Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt appealed for national unity. Authorities estimated more than 40,000 attended the event. ""An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone,"" she said. ""The Jewish community is an important part of Denmark. We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know. We stand together as Danes."" Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who attended Saturday's forum, believes he was likely the target of the attack. He escaped unharmed and told CNN on Monday he has gone into hiding. Vilks, known for his controversial depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, is on an al Qaeda hit list. He declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid. Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday. Lawyer Michael Eriksen said the men, 19 and 22, were charged with two counts of accessory to murder and five counts of accessory to attempted murder. Eriksen told CNN that the two, who pleaded not guilty, have not been charged under Denmark's anti-terrorism laws. At a news conference earlier Monday, Thorning-Schmidt said that the suspect was linked to a criminal group but at this stage, there are no known ties to a terror cell. However, investigators do not rule out that the attacks might have been inspired by last month's terror attacks in Paris. Some security experts say the nexus between criminal gangs and violent extremists in Denmark is closer than in other nations. Jihadist activity has a history in Denmark, and more than 100 Danes are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight with militants. The carnage started Saturday afternoon when the gunman stormed a Copenhagen cafe where Vilks was attending a free speech forum. Once the attack started, Vilks noticed the gunman had more firepower with his rifle than the nearby officers with handguns. ""He was very well-equipped, and the policemen were not. So he had an advantage,"" Vilks told CNN. ""Several of the policemen (were) wounded but still they tried to fire back."" Vilks said his bodyguards hustled him into a safe room. By the end of the melee, the gunman had wounded three officers and killed a 55-year-old man. Police have not identified the deceased, but the Danish Film Institute said he was director Finn Noergaard. Vilks, who has survived two previous attempts on his life, became a target after his 2007 cartoon depicting the prophet with the body of a dog, an animal that conservative Muslims consider unclean. ""It should be possible to insult all religions in a democratic way,"" Vilks said after that cartoon published. ""If you insult one (religion), then you should insult the other ones."" Like Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane ""Charb"" Charbonnier, who was killed in the Paris attack, Vilks was one of nine faces on a ""Most Wanted"" graphic published by al Qaeda's Inspire magazine for ""crimes against Islam."" Others include a pair of Danish journalists who published 12 cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Jyllands-Posten newspaper; Florida pastor Terry Jones, who burned a Quran; and ""The Satanic Verses"" author Salman Rushdie. Vilks told CNN he saw the threat against himself and others as greater now than before. Once you've been targeted, he said, there's no going back. ""There is no forgiveness. You are pointed out, and you are bound to die in these peoples' eyes, and there's no way out,"" Vilks said. Hours after the cafe attack, police said, the gunman made his way to a Copenhagen synagogue and once again opened fire. Two officers were wounded, and a man providing security for a bat mitzvah party behind the synagogue died. The Jewish Society of Denmark identified the deceased as 37-year-old Dan Uzan. He was a member of the Horsholm 79ers basketball club in Copenhagen, club board member Peter Damm said. ""The Jewish Society is in shock about the attack, but everyone's thoughts are first and foremost with Dan's family and friends, and with the wounded police officers and their families,"" the group said. Mette Bentow and her husband, Claus, were holding the bat mitzvah party for their daughter. She told CNN she feels angry at what happened, but also tremendous gratitude toward Uzan. ""We will remember that we owe our lives to him, and we will try and do our very best to be deserving of that,"" she said. Police said they are investigating both shootings as possible terror attacks. Police identified the suspect from surveillance footage that shows him getting into a taxi after one of the attacks, Copenhagen police investigator Jorgen Skov said. ""By interviewing the taxi driver, we got the address where he dropped off the person,"" Skov said. ""We have been keeping that address under observation."" He said when officers tried to contact the suspect at the Copenhagen apartment Sunday, the suspect opened fire. Police fired back, killing the gunman. No officers were injured. While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he is a 22-year-old man born in Denmark. Authorities said he was ""well-known by the police for several criminal incidents,"" including weapons violations and violence. Police also said he was ""known in connection to gangs."" Carsten Ellegaard Christensen, a national security reporter at the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, provided additional clues, citing sources with detailed knowledge of the investigation. Christensen was told the dead gunman was Danish-Arab, living in Copenhagen, and was on the radar of authorities for gang activity, not for suspected Islamist extremism. As far as police know, he had not traveled to Syria or Iraq. The gunman was recently in jail after being convicted of stabbing another young man with a knife several times on a commuter train, Christensen said. The man survived. Authorities are ""operating under a theory"" that the gunman may have been inspired by the January terror attacks in France, said Jens Madsen, chief of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service. Seventeen people died in the Paris attacks, which began with an assault on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The magazine had published controversial images of the Prophet Mohammed. Why Islam forbids images of Mohammed . The Charlie Hebdo attack renewed attention on networks of extremists operating in Europe. Shortly after the events in Paris, police in Belgium conducted a raid where two suspected extremists were killed in a shootout. The ringleader of that group, who is believed to have operated from Greece, remains at large and may have fled to Syria. CNN's Susanne Gargiulo reported from Copenhagen.

"(CNN)The North Korean prison camp survivor who is the focus of a best-selling biography, ""Escape from Camp 14"" said he changed parts of his life story, shaping them to hide from his trauma and shame. Shortly after escaping from North Korea, Shin Dong-hyuk formulated what he called a ""sanitized"" version of the his life, which he repeated for almost 10 years and subsequently became a book, which was published in 2012. That book describing his time in a North Korean prison camp became a best-seller, made him a key witness before the United Nations and grabbed headlines around the world. But last month, Shin revealed that parts of his story were not true and that he spent most of his life in North Korea at a different prison camp, Camp 18, rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography. While Shin stands by his allegations of torture and abuses by North Koreans, his admission stirred controversy about truth and trauma among defectors. The text of the book, ""Escape from Camp 14"" won't be corrected, according to the Washington Post, which was the newspaper where its author, Blaine Harden worked when he initially interviewed Shin. However, a new foreword will be added to the ebook and future prints, wrote Harden on his website. ""Shin told me he is now determined to tell the truth. Regrettably, he has told me this before. It seems prudent to expect more revisions,"" Harden wrote. But the author also acknowledged the role of psychological trauma for Shin, who is missing part of his right middle finger and bears scars of torture. ""Trauma victims like him tend to struggle with the truth, especially in the linear narrative form that journalists, judges, and policy makers are best able to understand. The memories of trauma victims are often fragmented and out of sequence, and the stories they tell can be shields behind which they try to hide,"" he wrote. Shin said he would've covered up the inaccuracies in his life story ""forever if my father hadn't appeared in the video."" In October 2014, North Korea uploaded videos on YouTube featuring Shin's father who disputed his son's widely publicized life story. The video raised suspicions among other survivors of Camp 18 who questioned Shin's story. And some of those questions still persist including how he escaped and found his way to China. Those questions may never be answered with any certainty. ""Raised in a dysfunctional family in a secret prison, badly educated, and tortured, he is a flawed eyewitness to the savagery of the world's last totalitarian state,"" wrote Harden.","Shin Dong-hyuk made a ""sanitized"" version of his life story after escaping .

"The University of Virginia is suspending all fraternities and associated parties until January 9 following a Rolling Stone magazine article that described a student's account of being gang raped and her frustration at trying to bring her alleged attackers to accountability. ""The wrongs described in Rolling Stone are appalling and have caused all of us to re-examine our responsibility to this community,"" school President Teresa A. Sullivan wrote in a statement to the university community. ""Rape is an abhorrent crime that has no place in the world, let alone on the campuses and grounds of our nation's colleges and universities."" Student leaders will hold a news conference at 10 a.m. Monday on the campus to ""give voice to the student perspective,"" according to a Student Council news release. Participants include the Student Council president, the leader of the Inter-Fraternity Council and the presidents of One in Four and One Less, support groups for victims of campus sexual abuse. Rape is a longstanding issue on college campuses, but in recent years student activists, survivors and faculty have portrayed sexual violence as a cultural problem on campuses nationwide -- not just a series of isolated incidents. In September, President Barack Obama launched ""It's On Us,"" a campaign aimed at tackling the problem of campus sexual assaults. Several days ago, Sullivan asked the Charlottesville Police Department to investigate the alleged rape. ""There are individuals in our community who know what happened that night, and I am calling on them to come forward to the police to report the facts,"" Sullivan wrote. ""Only you can shed light on the truth, and it is your responsibility to do so."" In ""A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Struggle for Justice at UVA,"" the student told Rolling Stone an upperclassman invited her to a party at the the Phi Kappa Psi house in fall 2012 and seven men raped her over a three-hour period in a bedroom . She didn't want to go to law enforcement but told the school's Sexual Misconduct Board what happened, Rolling Stone reported. She said she became discouraged because she had difficulty obtaining statistics about campus sexual assaults and learned other students said they were raped at fraternities but with little or no discipline handed out, the magazine said. The article said, ""At UVA, rapes are kept quiet, both by students -- who brush off sexual assaults as regrettable but inevitable casualties of their cherished party culture -- and by an administration that critics say is less concerned with protecting students than it is with protecting its own reputation from scandal."" Rolling Stone said the school didn't decide to investigate the fraternity until administrators learned the magazine planned to write an article. The journalist who wrote the story, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, said Sunday on CNN that the student she interviewed, identified in the article as Jackie, was still traumatized but that the national response ""has been really gratifying for her."" After the first story ran, other students contacted Rolling Stone to say they'd also been sexually assaulted at the University of Virginia. Those responses ran in a story with the headline ""Rape at UVA: Readers Say Jackie Wasn't Alone."" Students will be on their Thanksgiving and winter holiday break during much of the fraternal organization suspension. Classes for the spring semester start January 12. Sullivan said she was ""suspending all fraternal organizations and associated social activities."" Before the suspension is lifted, the school will assemble students, faculty, alumni and others to talk about ""our next steps in preventing sexual assault and sexual violence,"" Sullivan said. She also said the university's board of visitors will meet Tuesday to discuss the situation. University spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn told CNN in an email Saturday that Sullivan's order affected about 3,500 students in 31 fraternities, 16 sororities, seven multicultural Greek Council fraternities and sororities and eight Pan-Hellenic Council fraternities and sororities. The school has 21,238 students total, about 15,000 of them undergraduates, according to the school website. The fraternities and sororities are on private property, so the members living in the houses will not have to seek new living arrangements during the suspension, de Bruyn said. The university is also hiring an attorney to review the school's policies on handling sexual assault complaints. The national office of Phi Kappa Psi issued a statement decrying all forms of violence but noting that, ""to our knowledge there have been no criminal investigations or charges of sexual assault brought against any member of the chapter."" It said the UVA chapter will respond to authorities. ""Phi Kappa Psi will fully cooperate with the administration of the University of Virginia in identifying and immediately eradicating any alleged or proven misconduct,"" the statement said.","University of Virginia students to hold news conference Monday morning .

"(CNN)Egypt's military carried out a series of airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya on Monday in retaliation for the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Christians by the jihadist group. The bombing raids pulled Egypt deeper into the widening international fight against ISIS and highlighted the extremists' growing presence in North Africa. The warplanes hit 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told CNN. ""Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,"" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. There were conflicting claims about what the bombs had struck. ""These were surgical strikes based on very accurate intelligence and related to degrading the capabilities of ISIS within the city of Derna,"" Shoukry told CNN's Erin Burnett. But an umbrella group of Islamist militias in Derna issued a statement saying that the city ""woke up to a disaster today as Egyptian military jets targeted civilians in residential areas in the city."" The statement reported that the bombings had killed women and children, and it warned the Egyptian government of a ""harsh and painful"" response to come. CNN couldn't independently verify what damage and casualties the airstrikes had caused. Egypt's aerial assault came after ISIS released a gruesome video Sunday that appeared to show militants beheading at least a dozen Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach. The footage, bearing many of the hallmarks of previous ISIS videos of the killing of hostages, has intensified international concerns about ISIS' deepening reach into countries far beyond its strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The slickly produced video shows the apparent mass killing, with jihadists in black standing behind each of the victims, who are all dressed in orange jumpsuits with their hands cuffed behind them. Twenty-one Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte in two separate incidents in December and January. They were reportedly from impoverished villages and went to Libya looking for work. Although the ISIS video showed around a dozen men being beheaded, Egyptian officials said that all 21 Christians were believed to have been killed. Some of the hostages cry out ""Oh God"" and ""Oh Jesus"" as they are pushed to their knees. The five-minute video, released by ISIS' propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, includes a masked English-speaking jihadi who says, ""The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood."" The video threatens Egypt, which shares a long border with Libya, and also Europe, whose shores lie across the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had warned Sunday that his country ""reserves the right of retaliation and with the methods and timing it sees fit for retribution for those murderers and criminals who are without the slightest humanity."" He also declared a week of mourning in the Muslim majority nation for the slain Christians. In a statement, Egypt's Foreign Ministry called for other nations battling ISIS to support Egypt's efforts and to target terrorists in Libya, as well. The U.S. government condemned the killings, saying ISIS' ""barbarity knows no bounds."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday to offer condolences, the State Department said. Egypt is already fighting against ISIS-allied militants on its own territory in the Sinai Peninsula, where dozens of people were killed in a series of attacks in January. Concern has increased over ISIS' rising influence in Libya amid the power and security vacuum prevalent in the country since the 2011 uprising that overthrew former dictator Moammar Gadhafi. CNN reported in November that fighters loyal to ISIS had complete control of the city of Derna, which has a population of about 100,000 and is situated not far from the Egyptian border. Jihadists with allegiance to ISIS had also expanded their presence westward along the Libyan coast, forming chapters in cities including Benghazi, Sirte and even Tripoli, the capital, according to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism for the Quilliam Foundation. In an example of the group's spreading reach, a Libyan branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli that killed 10 people, including one American. ""There's been a real radical Islamist presence in Libya for some time,"" said Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a retired U.S. Air Force intelligence officer. ""What's worrying is now they are self-identifying with ISIS."" Questions remain over how much direct command and control the ISIS leadership in Syria and Iraq has over its North African affiliates. The killings of the Egyptian Christians has filled in some of the detail. Before the grisly video was released, ISIS had released photos in its English-language magazine Dabiq, claiming they had been killed. ""There's certainly communication between the Libyan affiliate and the affiliate in Syria about matters of importance to both of them,"" said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. He said the ties between Libyan jihadists and ISIS' precursor, al Qaeda in Iraq, ""go back a very long time."" The links between the different branches present ""a real challenge"" for Western leaders, Francona said, as U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to formally authorize the use of military force in the war against ISIS. ""While we can come up with a military solution or a military operation in a restricted area like Syria and Iraq, what do we do when it expands to North Africa?"" Francona asked. CNN's Ian Lee, Jomana Karadsheh, Ryan Buckley and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Airstrikes hit 10 targets in an ISIS stronghold in Libya, Egypt's foreign minister says .

"President Barack Obama flatly stated Tuesday the United States won't forget the gruesome killing of American journalist James Foley and promised ""justice will be done."" And now, apparently, he has some options to pursue such justice -- going after ISIS not just for beheading Foley, but for its campaign of terror around the region. The U.S. Defense Department has given Obama ""a range of planning options"" to go after the Islamist terror group, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. That includes continuing to strike the group, as U.S. forces have done for weeks, inside Iraq as well as taking the fight into Syria. ""We're having a constant conversation inside the administration about what options could be necessary to go after ISIS whether it's in Syria, Iraq or wherever they train or operate,"" the spokeswoman said. Harf added that the President -- who has authorized reconnaissance flights over Syria, according to a U.S. official -- hasn't made any decisions on what to do next. But, even if he hasn't offered specifics, he hasn't backed down in his rhetoric. Speaking at an American Legion event Tuesday about Foley's killing -- which ISIS videotaped then put online as it threatened more such killings targeting Americans -- Obama said that, while his government will be patient, it also won't hesitate to use its vast reach to bring ""justice"" by going ""after those who harm Americans"" and others. ""We'll continue to take direct action where needed to protect our people and to defend our homeland,"" the President said in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""And rooting out a cancer like (ISIS) won't be easy, and it won't be quick. But tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being."" Officials: American fighting for ISIS killed in Syria . Official: U.S. won't coordinate with al-Assad . U.S. officials take pains to point out that they are going after ISIS already. Militarily, that means increasing its presence in the Persian Gulf, boosting intelligence gathering and cooperation in Iraq, doing more for Iraqi security forces and conducting airstrikes in Iraq, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday. Still, if the United States is serious about going after ISIS -- wherever it is -- it can't count on the group to stay on the Iraqi side of the porous Syrian border. That's why striking in Syria is a possibility. If that's what happens, it would mean Obama would be on the same side as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- the same man who U.S. officials have been railing at for years, going so far as to work closely with the ""moderate opposition"" forces trying to unseat him the past three years. Yet these ""moderate"" forces aren't alone in trying to topple al-Assad. They've been joined by -- and sometimes fight against -- ISIS and other groups such as al-Nusra Front, that Washington calls terrorist organizations. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said al-Assad's regime was ready to accept support from the United States and others working under the U.N. umbrella to fight ""terrorists"" -- a reference to ISIS. But Moallem warned against any unilateral action or strikes in Syrian territory without permission. Harf said Tuesday, though, that U.S. officials won't be suddenly befriending or working with their counterparts in Syria. Quite the contrary, she said, stressing ""we are not going to be coordinating with the Assad regime, period."" ""The answer to ISIS is not the Assad regime,"" the State Department spokeswoman said. ""They have allowed them to grow.... And we are not going to be working with them to root out this threat."" In fact, Harf said Obama is asking Congress to fund a ""training and equip mission"" for the ""moderate opposition in Syria."" This could be significant, as up until now the U.S. government has resisted giving arms or military equipment directly to anyone in the war-torn country who wants to defeat al-Assad -- in part due to fears such weaponry could end up in the wrong hands, including that of ISIS. ""It is always a challenge that we're dealing with,"" Harf said. ""We believe here, though, that we need to keep supporting the moderate opposition in Syria."" Officials: Non-military ways to defeat ISIS . The key to defeating ISIS isn't necessarily as simple as military might, U.S. officials say. Yes, airstrikes could block the Islamist terror group's offensive, though they wouldn't necessarily eliminate them entirely if fighters move underground. ""It doesn't take too many people around you getting blown up to make you not want to get out into the open,"" said retired Col. Peter Mansoor, an ex-aide to former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus. From a funding and manpower standpoint, Harf said it's important to cut off funding for ISIS and its supply of foreign fighters like Douglas McCain, the American killed in fighting in Syria over the weekend. There is also a gut decision of what to do when faced with a terror threat: After beheading Foley, for instance, ISIS promised to kill more Americans so long as they were targeted. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that ""you can't let yourself be intimidated by a group like this."" You can't count on convincing them either, though it is important the local people understand that they are better off without ISIS than with them, he added. ""They will respond to force,"" Kirby said of what military action can do. ""But ultimately what's going to defeat them is a rejection of their ideology. And that can only be done through good governance -- in Iraq and Syria.""","State Department official: Cutting off funding, foreign fighters for ISIS is key .
Pentagon official: Military power is effective, but so is local ""good governance""

"(CNN) -- I'm standing in the secret Amsterdam apartment where Anne Frank and her family spent two years hiding from Nazis during the Second World War. The place is a mess -- crumpled sheets cover the bed in the corner, pots and pans clutter the dinner table and stubbed-out cigarettes fill the ashtray. This isn't surprising given that the Frank family and four others hiding alongside them were dragged away by German security police just the night before. It's an arrest I saw happen -- along with more than a thousand other people watching a spectacular new stage show that brings Frank's time in hiding to life so vividly that some were moved to tears. The play, simply titled ""Anne,"" is a major new production staged in a purpose-built theater on the outskirts of Amsterdam. It's hoped the production -- which features lavishly designed sets that revolve and glide across a giant panoramic stage -- will bring the story of the young Jewish diarist to a new generation. No expense has been spared. Intensely realistic stage sets . Two of Holland's best known playwrights were commissioned to pen the new drama and a multimillion dollar budget spent on intensely realistic stage sets. ""The level of detail is crazy,"" says Robin De Levita, the show's Tony Ã…ward-winning producer, as he takes me behind the scenes, where a life-sized Amsterdam apartment block is parked, ready to roll on stage. De Levita's sets include the Franks' original home, and a rotating replica of the annex where they hid from Nazi persecution between June 1942 and August 1944. ""It's really the only way you can experience exactly what went on in all those rooms and what the relationship was between all those rooms,"" he says. There's also a breathtaking and beautiful final scene in the snowy desolation of Bergen-Belsen, the concentration camp where Frank died at the age of 15 -- her childhood dreams snuffed out by the Holocaust. Standing ovations followed the play's premiere in May, as did largely glowing reviews. It's acted in Dutch, but subtitled and dubbed audio translations will be introduced in July, opening it up to international audiences. Its creators hope it will become a permanent fixture, attracting some of the visitors who line up for hours to see the original annex inside Amsterdam's canal-side Anne Frank Museum. The new dramatization aims to present a more faithful image of the ambitious teenager -- whose rebellious nature and adolescent desires were originally edited out of her published diary. 'Glimpses of a life she never had' Husband and wife co-authors Leon de Winter and Jessica Durlacher used Frank's original writings to conjure scenes of a postwar dream life in Paris -- another stunning stage set. There Frank discusses her unpublished book with a handsome young publisher, who falls in love with her and joins us as we flashback to her time in hiding. ""It's all inspired by Anne's own writing,"" says De Winter. ""It's her dream to have this grand student bohemian life in Paris and London -- and to become famous and we used these remarks to see glimpses of a life she never had."" Despite its tough subject matter, there are a moments of levity, such as when Frank clashes with Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist who shared a room in the secret annex with Anne and her sister. The writers say they tried to strike a careful balance in showing respect for the memory of those involved while still producing an entertaining play. ""It's almost like a tragic-comedy -- a very cruel sitcom,"" says De Winter. ""But if the diary was not entertaining, we would not be talking about it right now."" 'Dreams and hopes' Among those enjoying the show during one recent performance was Amber Nijmcen, a 21-year-old student from Amsterdam. ""It's just such a big part of Dutch history,"" she says. ""It happened just around the corner, and it's important for us to know about it. ""For tourists something like this is good. They should be aware of what happened here -- and not just come to Amsterdam for the drugs."" In the play's current cast, the role of Frank is taken by Rosa da Silva, a formidable 27-year-old actress who flits effortlessly between portrayals of childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. Not Jewish herself, she joined the rest of the cast on fact-finding trips to Auschwitz concentration camp and spoke with Jewish people who went into hiding like Anne. ""She was such a small girl and she had so many dreams and hopes,"" she says. ""But because she was Jewish, those dreams weren't possible."" Da Silva says she recognized some of Frank's determination in herself and a similar childhood ambition to succeed. ""And that's the really big thing with Anne, a lot of people identify themselves with her,"" she says. The Anne Frank Foundation, an educational charity that holds soon-to-expire copyright to the diary, commissioned the play in the hope of reaching out to a new generation almost 70 years after Frank died. De Levita says judging by the experience of showing the play to his own teenage son and his friends, it hits the mark. ""They're watching themselves and they're completely relating to all of this because they're going through it right now: annoying parents, being trapped in the house, falling in love, sexuality. ""I promise you, any 14-, 15- or 16-year-old will go crazy over this. It will be a meaningful experience. And that's what we have to achieve -- to find that audience."" ""Anne"" is performed at the Theater Amsterdam, Danzigerkade 5/Westpoortnummer; +31 88 123 2411; tickets from $48 . Barry Neild is a freelance journalist based in London. He is a longtime contributor to CNN and other major international news organizations.","A new play about Anne Frank features stunningly realistic sets .

"President Barack Obama on Tuesday recognized the leading Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the country's people, marking a ""big step"" in U.S. engagement with the nearly two-year-old crisis. ""We've made a decision that the Syrian Opposition Coalition is now inclusive enough, is reflective and representative enough of the Syrian population that we consider them the legitimate representative of the Syrian people in opposition to the Assad regime,"" Obama told ABC's Barbara Walters. ""So we will provide them recognition and obviously with that recognition comes responsibilities on the part of that coalition,"" he said. ""It is a big step."" Read more: What will recognizing the opposition accomplish? The United States joins Britain, France, Turkey and the Gulf Cooperation Council in recognizing the opposition. The move will be a major psychological boost for the rebels, but it doesn't mean Washington will be arming them anytime soon. The U.S. announcement had been anticipated to occur at some point this week with a major meeting of governments supporting a transition away from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad scheduled. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was supposed to attend the Friends of Syria meeting in Morocco along with more than 100 delegations from the United States, the European Union, Arab nations and representatives of the Syrian opposition, canceled her trip due to a stomach flu that hit her and a number of her staff. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns will attend in Clinton's place. ""I think what you'll see is a political decision to morally boost them (the Syrian opposition) and provide more political and moral support for their efforts. And look at how we can financially assist the opposition moving forward,"" according to an official who spoke to CNN before Obama's announcement, but declined to be identified because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. ""But again, I think you're going to see a political recognition, not a legal recognition."" Legally recognizing the Syrian Opposition Coalition would carry more weight because the United States would treat the opposition like an alternative government, said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria and a senior fellow at The Washington Institute. In order to do that, the United States would have to determine that the opposition controls a majority of Syrian territory and has taken over the country's treaty obligations from al-Assad's government, neither of which has happened. Read more: An afternoon with a Syrian bombmaker . Even as it agrees to recognize Syria's opposition politically, Washington will still continue to deal with the Assad government in certain capacities. ""It's more of a political shot in the arm for the Syrian opposition,"" Tabler said. ""And it's hoped that by doing that, it will straighten their backs and strengthen them and encourage them to come together and work together more effectively."" Speaking before Obama's annoucement, Frederic Wehrey, senior associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called the expected upgrade in relations with the opposition ""overwhelmingly political,"" a step that is ""an attempt to encourage this positive trend, while at the same time isolating more radical actors in the opposition."" As part of Washington's effort to isolate extremist groups in Syria while boosting the new political coalition, the U.S. Treasury on Tuesday imposed sanctions on leaders of the jihadist al-Nusra Front in Syria, after the State Department moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. Burns plans to meet with the Syrian opposition during his trip to Marrakech. The intent is to ""hear from them ... about how they see things going forward both in terms of their own internal organization about their connectivity with Syrians inside Syria, about their transitional planning, about the needs that they see for external support, how they would have us best direct the non lethal support and humanitarian support that we are providing,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on Monday. The United States has been looking for the opposition to establish a leadership structure, Nuland has previously told reporters. Officials said they have seen progress and that Clinton ""has been clear that we'd like to offer them more support,"" Nuland said. That support, which already totals more than $200 million in funding and humanitarian aid, could be increased even more with this announcement. But would ""support"" include lifting the arms embargo on Syria, an idea that France supports? Nuland stuck this week with what the United States has been saying for months: ""We are maintaining our current posture of providing non-lethal support and not going beyond that."" The United States is not ready to arm the rebels due to continued concern about extremist elements within their ranks. Other countries, like Qatar, are providing some weapons. Any recognition of the opposition, however, raises issues with Russia, a crucial player in the Syrian equation. The Russians were invited to participate at the Marrakech meeting but declined, according to the State Department. Moscow has been highly critical of actions by the Syrian armed opposition, even while expressing support for a political solution. The listing of al-Nusra Front as a foreign terror organization is a step that Moscow could welcome. U.S. recognition of the opposition could anger Moscow but it also could have a positive effect. Russia has warned that chaos could ensue if al-Assad is deposed. The United States could use this recognition as a signal to Russia that the opposition council is moving toward becoming a viable government should al-Assad leave. The next steps in dealing with the Syrian opposition leadership depend to a large extent on how that opposition continues to develop. Nuland pointed to the process of recognizing the opposition in Libya as a template. Recognition is just part of the process of trying to create a political solution for the Syrian conflict. At the same time, the United States is trying to urge Russia to use its influence with Damascus to help bring about a political solution. That was the focus of recent meetings between the two countries facilitated by the joint special representative of the United Nations and Arab League for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi. In a statement, Brahimi said the diplomats ""explored avenues to move forward a peaceful process and mobilize greater international action in favor of a political solution."" Nuland said on Monday the question now is whether there are figures in the opposition who could come together. ""Perhaps there are folks who are currently in the government without blood on their hands who could support those kinds of democratic principles and form the basis of a transitional structure going forward,"" Nuland said. ""Mr. Brahimi thinks it is worth a try,"" she added. ""We want to support his efforts and we'll have to see where that goes.""","""With that recognition comes responsibilities,"" says President Barack Obama .

"As a second round of peace talks ended Saturday with little progress in ending Syria's civil war, U.S. President Barack Obama and Jordan's King Abdullah spoke about Syria's distressing humanitarian crisis during an earlier meeting in California. Jordan is a refuge for war-battered Syrians, and both leaders urged an end to the warfare that has caused such a mass exodus. They also discussed a possible United Nations sanction to pressure the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, in Geneva, U.N. mediator Lakhdar Brahimi apologized to the Syrian people, saying he was ""very, very sorry"" that, despite two rounds of talks, ""we haven't done very much."" In minimal progress, the two warring sides have agreed to an agenda for a third round of talks, but they have not agreed on how to tackle it, Brahimi said. In Britain, U.K. Foreign Minister William Hague described the latest developments as ""a serious setback in the search for peace in Syria."" Hague blamed the Syrian regime because it refused to discuss a transitional government. Brahimi said the key sticking point is that the Syrian government wants to talk about tackling terrorism, while the opposition wants to discuss forming a transitional governing body. Brahimi said he had suggested starting the next round of talks with one day of discussion on each issue, but the government would not agree. ""Unfortunately the government has refused, which raises the suspicion of the opposition that, in fact, the government doesn't want to discuss the (transitional governing body) at all,"" he said. Brahimi said such intransigence was ""not good for the process,"" nor was it good for Syria. Negotiators should go back to their leaders and reflect on a way forward, he said. ""Do they want this process to take place or not?"" Louay Safi, of the opposition umbrella group Syrian National Coalition, said: ""We want to progress on the two sides. We want to be assured that the regime is really wanting a political solution, not delay tactics, and we didn't get that, for reasons that were described by Mr. Brahimi. ""Our heart is in pain, our delegation is in pain, that as we speak here searching for a political solution the regime has chosen to bombard towns and cities killing civilians."" Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari, in turn, accused the opposition of trying to mislead observers and undermine the process. ""We are committed to serving the interests of our own people, in stopping the bloodshed,"" he told reporters in Geneva. ""We don't have an impasse. We are still in negotiations; we didn't say that we have failed."" Jordan and the United States . In California, Obama and King Abdullah held a meeting Friday that lasted until almost midnight in the desert community of Indian Wells, near Palm Springs. Obama said the United States would seek ways to bring peace. ""We're going to continue to strategize on how we can effectively change the calculus inside the country so that we can have a Syria that is intact, that is respectful of all groups, that ends the killing, and that allows for a representative government that can provide peace and prosperity for everybody there,"" Obama said. ""There will be some intermediate steps that we can take to apply more pressure to the Assad regime, and we're going to be continuing to work with all the parties concerned to try to move forward on a diplomatic solution."" Obama noted that Jordan has just taken a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council. In a background briefing with pool reporters after the meeting, a senior administration official said Obama and King Abdallah discussed a possible U.N. resolution that could pressure the Syrian regime and ""create a legal precedent for cross-border operations."" The White House added that a strong resolution on Syria didn't necessarily need to include threats of force but could be ""strong in terms of the obligations and expectations that it would impose on the regime to improve the humanitarian access."" Jordan, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, is hosting almost 600,000 refugees from Syria, and on Saturday, the President announced new loan guarantees for Jordan totaling $1 billion. The senior official targeted Russia in his remarks, urging the Russians to play a ""more constructive role"" in finding a solution. ""As long as they remain wedded to the status quo, this is going to be a difficult problem to resolve,"" the official said, speaking of Russia's continued support for the Syrian regime. Russia ""can't have it both ways,"" the official said. ""They can't say they're in favor of negotiations in Geneva and a transitional government guided by full executive authority and humanitarian access and have a happy Olympics, and then be part and parcel of supporting this regime as it kills people in the most brutal way."" The Olympics remark referred to the Winter Games now being held in Sochi, Russia. ""I don't think any of us have any expectation that they are going to turn on a dime,"" the official conceded. He said the administration would not exclude the possibility of reaching ""a humanitarian resolution"" despite Russia's ""sorry record"" of vetoing U.N. sanction resolutions. King Abdullah said one of his main concerns, ""is the rise of extremism in Syria, the sectarian violence, and if we don't find a solution, the spillover in the region and the effect that will have."" The two leaders considered ways their countries could support what they described as the ""moderate opposition"" movement, the senior official said. Elsewhere in the United States, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said ""failure is looming"" in the U.N.-mediated peace talks. McCain also criticized Russia. ""The entire strategy for success at Geneva now relies on Russia putting pressure on the Syrian government to engage in a serious and constructive way,"" McCain said. ""Yet, Russia has recently prevented the passage of a much-needed U.N. resolution on bringing aid to desperate Syrian civilians and continues to provide the means by which President Bashar al-Assad carries out his assault on the Syrian people. ""Such actions indicate that the Russian government is simply not a partner for peace in Syria and cannot be relied on to help secure a successful outcome,"" McCain said. More violence . In Syria, rebels posted a video on social media purporting to show small group of fighters planting explosives in a tunnel underneath what they claim is the Carlton Hotel in Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the hotel serves as an anti-insurgency headquarters for government security forces. CNN could not independently confirm the video's authenticity. ""We are putting our last touches and doing some measuring so we can make sure that we are under the Carlton Hotel,"" a rebel says in Arabic. ""We are going to add the explosives after we finish everything, and you are going to hear good news, Aleppo people."" The video then cuts to an outdoor scene where billowing smoke rises over buildings, an apparent indication that the hotel was blown up Saturday. The Syrian government didn't immediately respond to the rebels' claims in the video. Peace talks . The snail-paced peace talks, which started last month with Brahimi serving as an intermediary between the two delegations sitting in the same room, have failed to produce an agreement on a first step for resolving the conflict, which has dragged on for nearly three years. More than 140,000 Syrians have died since March 2011, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. About half of them were civilians, and more than 7,000 were children and more than 5,000 were women, it said. It put Syrian military losses at more than 30,000 and pro-regime elements at more than 20,000. Those figures do not include the 18,000 Syrians who were jailed and are missing, it said. Relief for besieged city . Brahimi said he would consult next with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and called upon him to hold discussions with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov. Brahimi said he would also likely brief the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, known as the P5 -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- and the full Security Council. The talks' only sign of progress has been a cease-fire to allow some evacuations from and aid relief to the besieged city of Homs. U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos said Friday that 1,400 people were evacuated from the Old City of Homs and 2,500 still there got relief supplies, but she lamented the bleak humanitarian situation that prevails throughout the country. ""The little that has been achieved in Homs,"" Brahimi said, has given the Syrian people hope that they might finally be ""coming out of this horrible crisis they are in."" But the warring sides are still far apart. Opposition: We want progress, not delaying tactics . Brahimi said he hoped that, after a period of reflection, the two sides would return to the table ""ready to engage seriously"" over how to implement the so-called Geneva communique that led to the talks. It calls for ending the conflict and establishing a transitional government. The opposition has proposed a transitional government that would oversee a halt in the fighting, releasing prisoners of conscience, maintaining law and order, bringing to justice those responsible for violence and protecting human rights. Its plan excludes al-Assad from continued leadership, an outcome unacceptable to the longtime Syrian leader. But Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Makdad said Friday that the opposition has ""an unrealistic agenda,"" and he insisted the first step must be ""stopping the violence and ending terrorism."" The government refers to the rebels as foreign-backed terrorists, so Makdad's stance in essence calls for the opposition to unilaterally lay down its arms. ""We confirm we are willing to discuss the issue of the transitional government after we reach an agreement regarding ending terrorism,"" he said. French diplomat slams regime, praises opposition . Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, blamed the Syrian government for the lack of advancement. ""I condemn the attitude of the Syrian regime that has blocked any progress on the establishment of a transitional government and increased violence and acts of terror against the civilian population,"" he said. ""I salute the courage and sense of responsibility of the Syrian National Coalition that has adopted a constructive position throughout the negotiations."" He urged those people and entities that have influence with the al-Assad government to ""bring it to more quickly respect the demands of the international community.""","U.K. foreign minister says talks face ""a serious setback"" and blames regime .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- The two men who claimed to have found the carcass of Bigfoot have surfaced to say: Hey, it was just a joke. Matt Whitton has been fired from his job as a police officer because of his role in the hoax. Not everyone is laughing. In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WSB, the two hoaxers -- car salesman Rick Dyer and now-fired police officer Matt Whitton -- said the whole situation began as a joke and then got out of hand. ""It's just a big hoax, a big joke,"" Dyer said. ""It's Bigfoot,"" Dyer explained. ""Bigfoot doesn't exist."" Whitton chimed in: ""All this was a big joke. It got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be.""  Watch the two men explain their ""joke"" » . At a news conference in California last week, the two men had stood by their claims that they had discovered Bigfoot's corpse and had it on ice. Scientific analysis would prove it, they said. Not quite. Now the two Georgia men admit that the hairy, icy blob was an Internet-purchased Sasquatch costume stuffed with possum roadkill and slaughterhouse leftovers. Whitton and Dyer say that when they came up with the hoax, they had no idea it would become a media circus. ""It got legs and ran. It's crazy now,"" Dyer told WSB. Co-hoaxer Whitton agrees: ""It started off as some YouTube videos and a Web site. We're all about having fun."" ""Fun"" isn't exactly how Clayton County Police Chief Jeff Turner sees it. He has kicked Whitton off the police force. ""He lied on national TV,"" Turner says of Whitton, ""so a defense attorney now could say, 'How do we know you're not lying now?' "" Whitton and Dyer had announced that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They also said they had spotted about three similar living creatures. Still unclear is how much money Whitton and Dyer got out of the hoax. Steve Kulls, who maintains the SquatchDetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program, first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program. On August 12, Kulls said, Dyer and Whitton ""requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance, expected from the marketing and promotion."" Two days later, after signing a receipt and counting the money, Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the carcass: ""Something appearing large, hairy and frozen in ice,"" Kulls wrote on the Web site. It was, as many had suspected, an ape-like costume stuffed with entrails. After the news conference last week, Dyer and Whitton disappeared from view. The truth came out over the weekend.

"(CNN)Lesley Gore, whose No. 1 hit ""It's My Party"" kicked off a successful singing career while she was still in high school, has died. She was 68. Her death was confirmed by family friend Blake Morgan, who produced her 2005 album, ""Ever Since."" ""We loved her and we are very sad. She was an incredibly powerful, incredibly beautiful talent,"" he said. According to People magazine, the cause of death was cancer. Gore, born Lesley Sue Goldstein, had just turned 17 when ""It's My Party,"" produced by Quincy Jones, topped the charts in June 1963. The song, about a girl whose party is ruined when she catches her boyfriend, Johnny, with a rival, became a pop classic, its catchy chorus often imitated. She was an overnight success, with fans suddenly converging on her family's house in Tenafly, New Jersey. ""When the disc jockey ... would say, 'That was Lesley Gore, the sweetie pie from Tenafly,' well, people just came to Tenafly. You know, I'd wake up and there were people camped out on the grass,"" she said in an interview, according to Biography.com. The follow-ups, ""Judy's Turn to Cry"" and ""She's a Fool,"" were in a similar teen-love vein, but Gore's next hit, ""You Don't Own Me,"" was something else entirely. ""You Don't Own Me,"" also produced by Jones, was a dramatic assertion of independence and pride. Released in late 1963, it peaked at No. 2, kept out of the top spot by the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" Over the years the song, written by John Madara and Dave White, became a feminist anthem, recorded by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Joan Jett. During the 2012 presidential campaign, a number of celebrities -- including Lena Dunham, Tavi Gevinson and Carrie Brownstein -- appeared in a commercial lip-synching the song in an effort to urge women to vote. ""It's hard for me to believe but we're still fighting for the same things we were then,"" Gore wrote on her Facebook page in 2012. ""Yes, ladies, we've got to come together and get out there and vote and protect our bodies. They're ours. Please vote."" The political activism suited Gore. After her singing career started winding down in the late '60s, she volunteered for Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. She later worked for New York politician Bella Abzug and such projects as a Bronx community health organization, healthpeople.org. ""I worked for people like Robert Kennedy and I thought: 'Wow, that's what it's about. That's how you change the world,' "" she told The New York Times in 2005. She also did some acting, playing Pussycat, a Catwoman sidekick, on the TV series ""Batman."" As an adult Gore came out publicly as a lesbian, though she told the website AfterEllen.com she never tried to hide her sexuality. ""I just never found it was necessary because I really never kept my life private. Those who knew me, those who worked with me, were well aware,"" she said in 2005. ""Times were very different then, so, you know, I just tried to live as normally as humanly possible. But as truthfully as humanly possible."" She had some songwriting success with a tune she co-wrote with her brother Michael, ""Out Here on My Own,"" a song from the 1980 film ""Fame"" that was nominated for an Oscar, but she went almost 30 years before releasing an album of new material in 2005. ""Ever Since,"" a low-key collection of songs, was ""very sparse, very organic,"" Gore told The New York Times. She had continued to perform, however, always ready to trot out ""It's My Party"" and her other hits. ""If I've learned anything in this business, how stupid would it be not to do 'It's My Party' when people come to hear it?"" she said. Gore is survived by her partner of more than 30 years, jewelry designer Lois Sasson. People we lost in 2015 .

"Like thousands of others, the graduate student from China crowded with friends around the finish line at the Boston Marathon to cheer on the runners. She had moved to the city in time for the fall semester, making friends and soaking up new experiences. The marathon was a chance to be a part of an annual ritual so cherished by Bostonians. And so she went Monday to Copley Square with two friends in tow. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Two bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other near the finish line, killing three. The graduate student was one of them. Who she was . Boston University identified her on Wednesday as Lingzi Lu, a graduate student in mathematics and statistics. The second student was in stable condition at Boston Medical Center and the third student was not hurt, BU Today said. Her photos on Facebook show her enjoying a simple student life of home-cooked meals in modest surrounding, smiles over warm cups of coffee, laughs with friends. The day she died, she posted a picture of her breakfast to the Chinese social media website Weibo -- bread and a bowl of fruit. ""My wonderful breakfast,"" she commented in English with a smiley face emoticon. Then an explosion . After the two bombs ended the road race, Lu's roommate posted a message on Facebook. ""God bless the Boston community,""  wrote Li Jing, also from China. The blasts wounded 183 others. Profiles of the victims . Li learned of that injury -- but didn't yet know her friend had died. ""I have been unable to reach her,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. ""Everyone is very worried. I have reported this to BU Police. If anyone knows anything, please let me know. Thanks for everyone's help."" Friends offered suggestions on how to find her. ""Li Jing, I am so sad for your roommate...I will pray for her and pray for your soul,"" one posted on Facebook. Death confirmed . Boston University's president announced the graduate student's death in an open letter published Tuesday on the school's website and confirmed that her friend was wounded. ""Our hearts and thoughts go out to the family and friends of both victims,"" wrote college President Robert Brown. At first, the university declined to release Lu's name at her family's request, but the school later received permission from a family representative, BU spokesman Colin Riley said. The university established the Lu Lingzi Scholarship Fund in her honor, it announced Thursday. The Chinese consulate in New York issued a statement of condolence. In China, news of the death set off a wave of sympathy on social media sites. By Wednesday, netizens there had added more than 17,000 comments to the victim's last Weibo post about her breakfast. ""Wish there's no pain in heaven! May the girl rest in peace!"" WenyiqingnianHarryChen posted. Tuesday evening, two university chaplains held a campus vigil for her and the other victims.  It was followed by a town hall-style meeting for those in search of comfort and counseling. The graduate student died alongside Krystle Campbell, 29, and Martin Richard, 8. Her friend, Zhou Danling, is on her way to recovery at a Boston hospital. A love of math and chance . Lu had worked hard to achieve. She won an academic scholarship to the Beijing Institute of Technology, where she received accolades for her math skills. She went on to Boston University to pursue that passion and was working on a master's degree in statistics. She would have known how slim the chances were that something like this could happen in a crowd of thousands cheering the runners on a sunny day.","Lingzi Lu was a graduate student in math and statistics .

"(CNN)It started as a police chase after a teenager allegedly ignored a traffic stop by a Maryland state trooper. By the time it ended,  the 16-year-old suspect was dead in a shootout with officers. During an investigation into the teen's background, police found three bodies at a Kentucky address linked to him. Authorities in both states are trying to put together a timeline of events that ended with the shootout Saturday. How did the teen, identified as Jason C. Hendrix of Corbin, Kentucky, get from his hometown to Baltimore County? Did he kill his mother, father and sister? If he did so, why? And when? Could a dispute over computer use have something to do with it, as a newspaper reported? And why did the teen head to Maryland? It was a mundane traffic stop on Valentine's Day. Hendrix, who was driving a Honda Pilot,  failed to stop when a state trooper tried to pull him over on Interstate 95, according to the Baltimore County Police Department. A car chase ensued, and police cornered him after he struck another vehicle at an intersection in Woodlawn, forcing him to stop. ""As officers approached the Honda Pilot, gunfire came from the vehicle, striking an officer,"" authorities said. ""Officers then returned fire on the vehicle."" Hendrix, who was alone in the car, was shot to death. The officer injured in the shootout was treated at a local hospital and released. ""His ballistic vest stopped the round that struck him,"" police said. Authorities found a ""handgun and other weapons"" during a search of the suspect's car. About 500 miles away from the shootout, a grisly scene awaited. Baltimore County detectives traced the suspect's car registration to an address in Corbin. They reached out to their counterparts there, who went to the address and found the bodies of Kevin and Sarah Hendrix, and their daughter. Police are looking at Jason Hendrix as the main suspect in the deaths of his parents and sister, according to the Times Tribune newspaper. All signs point to him as the suspect, Maj. Rob Jones told CNN affiliate WLEX. ""We still have to finish our investigation to definitely say if this is the guy,"" he added. Corbin Police Chief David Campbell told the Lexington Herald-Leader the teen ""was mad at his parents over the usage of his computer. They had taken his computer rights away."" The Corbin Police Department declined to comment when reached by CNN on Monday, saying it only had limited information. Campbell told the Lexington newspaper that all three victims had been shot in the head at least twice. ""A pillow was used to try to muffle the gunshot used on all three individuals,"" he said. ""The pillows were still on their faces."" The coroner's office is still trying to determine when the killings happened. Based on their investigation at the crime scene, Jones said, ""officers are thinking it was sometime around Wednesday,"" several days before the suspect was killed in the Baltimore County shootout. At Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky, where Sarah Hendrix was an associate professor of social work, officials said the community was heartbroken. ""We have lost a member of our family, "" they said in a Facebook post. ""A wonderful educator, colleague and friend."" CNN's Camille Cava, Justin Lear and Catherine E.

"A suspected Islamic militant returning to Europe from the war in Syria was arrested on Sunday at Malaga airport in southern Spain as a potential ""threat to national security,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The suspect, Abdeluahid Sadik Mohamed, belongs to an al Qaeda-linked group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the statement said. A spokesman for the Ministry confirmed Sadik Mohamed is a Spanish national born in Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on Morocco's north coast. He had spent months alongside Islamic militants fighting in Syria and in Iraq since last May, arriving to the region from Casablanca, Morocco. He was arrested at Malaga airport on a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, the statement said. Spanish terrorism experts have repeatedly said that authorities are closely tracking the movements of Islamic militants who have fought in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan when they come to Europe for the threat they pose as potential ""lone wolves"" or in group terrorist actions. Sadik Mohamed was allegedly involved in terrorist training camps in Syria and Iraq, the statement said. The Interior Ministry did not immediately reveal his age. He was a suspect in a partially dismantled Spanish and Moroccan network of Islamic militants that recruited, indoctrinated, trained and financed militants to be sent to the battlefronts in Syria. The network was based in Ceuta and and in the nearby Moroccan city of Fnideq. Ten militants allegedly linked to this network have been jailed on pretrial charges of terrorism, including the alleged leader who was arrested September 17 after escaping detention in June. Eight other suspected colleagues were rounded up at that time. In a court order issued in June, Judge Ismael Moreno of Spain's National Court wrote that the suspected cell in Ceuta was ""a structure based in Spain, with connections in Morocco, Belgium, Turkey and Syria, dedicated to radicalizing, recruiting and sending mujahedeen (fighters) to Syria with the aim of conducting jihad and achieving martyrdom."" The group has connections to the Jabhat al-Nusra front, described as an active al Qaeda group in and around Syria, and to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , but ""there are increasing references to carrying out jihad at home,"" the judge warned at the time, referring to potential attacks in Spain. The group had sent at least 12 Spanish or Moroccan males, from both Ceuta and Morocco, to fight in Syria, the judge wrote. At least five died in suicide attacks in Syria that caused numerous casualties. One of the males was a minor; it was not immediately clear if he was among those who had died. Sadik Mohamed will be arraigned at the National Court in Madrid, the Interior Ministry statement said.","Suspect is a Spanish national .

"Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) -- Al Qaeda has swept to power with the aim of imposing a strict Islamist ideology on Syrians across large swathes of Syria's rebel-held north, according to a CNN survey of towns, activists and analysts that reveals an alarming increase in al Qaeda-linked control in just the past month. Al Qaeda-backed militants known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are the predominant military force in northern Syria, according to activists and seasoned observers, and have a powerful influence over the majority of population centers in the rebel-held north. Rami Abdul Rahman, from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said: ""ISIS is the strongest group in Northern Syria -- 100% -- and anyone who tells you anything else is lying."" CNN conducted dozens of interviews with activists, local and international observers and residents of the towns affected by ISIS in preparing this study. Many of the Syrians CNN spoke to talked anonymously for fear of angering ISIS, saying ISIS has in some areas made it a crime punishable by flogging to even say their name. The swift al Qaeda expansion poses a severe policy dilemma for the United States and its European allies who have long delayed their promised armed assistance to rebel groups as they struggled with fears that the weapons could end up in the hands of al Qaeda-backed extremists. Observers say the delay has provided a vacuum in the often chaotic rebel ranks that the organized and fearless Islamists have moved to fill. Many observers explain that the extent of ISIS's discipline and resources -- they are said to have considerable cash at their disposal -- means that the other rebel groups operating in the north do not seek to confront them. Read more: Al Qaeda-linked group gains strength on NATO border . Charles Lister, analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, said: ""Although not a numerically dominant force, ISIS is playing an increasingly pre-eminent role in the northern Syrian insurgency. ""Much of this is a result of its capability to exploit superior levels of financing and resources -- essentially, to spread itself thinly enough to exert influence and/or control, but not too thin as to be overpowered by rivals."" Most activists point to a clear strategy by ISIS -- which aims to dominate a large swathe of the north from the north-western town of Idlib to the north-eastern city of Raqqa and beyond -- of focusing on population centers on the edges of rebel-held territory and slowly choking off central areas. Some ISIS figures have described a broader aim of trying to link the Sunni province of Anbar in Iraq to the Mediterranean coast, near the Syrian town of Latakia. There are a number of smaller towns in northern Syria which -- activists and residents have told us -- are controlled entirely by ISIS: Keftin, Tal Rifat, Azaz, Ad Dana, Dar Ta Izzah, Binnish, Raqqa, Ma'arrat Misrin, Jarablus and Al-Bab. The survey has established that ISIS also has a presence -- which is often hard for other rebel groups to challenge -- in the following towns: Sarmin, Salqin, Hraytan, Tabqa Dam, Hayyan, Al Eyramoon, Karm Al Meeyasir, Karm Al Qatarji, Al Atarib, Sarmada, Tal Halef, Menbij, Athimah, Maarat an-Numan, Saraqib and Ariha. Watch video: Secret jihadi smuggling route through Turkey . While the main city of Aleppo remains in the control of a series of different rebel groups, ISIS has begun exerting control on key entry points into the city, and has recently gained control of the al-Sakhour neighborhood. The group is also gaining ground in controlling the northern access points to the city and territory in the rebel-held east. ISIS' control around Idlib, another key city, is complicated by the regime's continued presence there, but the group has established a foothold to the north east in Sarmin, is present in the town of Saraqib, and is in full control of Binnish, a key town to Idlib's north. Their grip over the rebel town of Raqqa is considerably tighter than elsewhere, despite the continued presence of rival and even aligned rebel groups who do not seek to challenge them. The Washington Institute think-tank says ISIS' grip on Raqqa makes it ""the largest city al Qaeda has ever controlled in the Islamic world."" CNN al Qaeda expert Peter Bergen said the Washington Institute assessment could be correct, given the nature of ISIS's dominance in Raqqa, but pointed out that the U.S. Marine Corps admitted al Qaeda was in control of the Iraqi province of Anbar in 2006, which contained, at the time, around a couple of million people, and so could technically be considered larger. In these ISIS-held areas, signs of the kind of Islamist society that the al Qaeda-backed militants seek to create have been swift to emerge; one woman activist drew comparisons with the Taliban's rule over Afghanistan. Rulings have been posted in some towns forbidding women to travel without a male relative and at certain times of the day, ordering them to cover up their hair with the traditional Islamic headscarf and not to wear trousers in public, and banning them from wearing make-up and seeking treatment from male doctors. Smoking and cameras have also been banned. Watch video: Al Qaeda's growing influence in Syria . On Sunday one northern town, Jarablus, saw a poster erected by ISIS threatening thieves with having their hand cut off -- an extreme form of punishment mandated by radical readings of Islamist, or Sharia, law. While many Syrians have described the initial approach of ISIS towards towns they seek to control as friendly and peaceful, often offering generous cash incentives to cooperate, they are increasingly brutal in dealing with their critics. One activist described how he was taken by ISIS militants from the town of Azaz and held in a blanket factory in Aleppo's northern suburb of Hyratan. ""I was tortured, beaten. They hung me from the ceiling and used electricity on me. They kept trying to make me confess being a British spy,"" he said, adding that the factory held 20 other prisoners, mostly from rival rebel brigades, and that the site was also used by ISIS to make bombs. ISIS have released a series of slickly-produced videos about their growing control, and some skeptics say they are promoting stories of their dominance to increase their power over local populations. Yet in recent weeks, many activists accept that ISIS' genuine hold on the rebel north has escalated to the point where rival groups are unable to challenge them.","Al Qaeda-backed militants have taken control of towns in northern Syria .

"U.S. airstrikes ""are not going to save"" the key Syrian city of Kobani from being overtaken by ISIS, said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. ""I think we all should be steeling ourselves for that eventuality,"" he told reporters in a daily briefing Wednesday. ""We are doing everything we can to halt"" ISIS' progress against the town, but airstrikes alone cannot stop the Islamist militants, Kirby added. ""We've been very honest about the limits of air power here. The ground forces that matter the most are indigenous ground forces, and we don't have a willing, capable, effective partner on the ground inside Syria right now -- it's just a fact,"" he said. The greater U.S. strategy, Kirby said, is to degrade ISIS' ability to sustain itself. Several senior U.S. administration officials said Kobani will soon fall to ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. They downplayed the importance of it, saying the city is not a major U.S. concern. But a look at the city shows why it would mark an important strategic victory for the militants.  ISIS would control a complete swath of land between its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, and Turkey -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers (62 miles). As Time.com put it, ""If the ISIS militants take control of Kobani, they will have a huge strategic corridor along the Turkish border, linking with the terrorist group's positions in Aleppo to the west and Raqqa to the east."" Staffan de Mistura, U.N. special envoy for Syria, warned of the horrors ISIS could carry out against the people of Kobani -- horrors it has carried out elsewhere.  ""The international community needs to defend them,"" he said.  ""The international community cannot sustain another city falling under ISIS."" The terrorist group claimed it had downed at Iraqi army helicopter in Baiji. Photographs posted to an ISIS website show smoke and fire around an aircraft, which is then seen completely charred on the ground. A truck bomb driven by ISIS exploded near the center of Kobani. Two civilians and a fighter inside the city described it as huge. The target was a security forces building, they said. However, Kurdish official Idriss Nassan told CNN, the truck did not reach its intended target and detonated early. Coalition batters ISIS positions with airstrikes . A U.S.-led coalition has been pounding ISIS positions in the region with airstrikes for a few weeks, conducting nine airstrikes in Syria and three in Iraq on Wednesday. In Syria, eight strikes near Kobani destroyed five ISIS armed vehicles, a supply depot, a command and control compound, a logistics compound, and eight occupied barracks, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command. ""U.S. Central Command continues to monitor the situation in Kobani closely. Indications are that Kurdish militia there continue to control most of the city and are holding out against ISIL,"" it read. Overnight into Thursday, the Australian Air Task Group in the Middle East attacked its first target in Iraq: an ISIS facility. A former head of the British Armed Forces doubted the wisdom of coalition airstrikes -- alone. ""The rules of war are well-written on this, and well-established. I've been saying it, others have been said it,"" retired Gen. David Richards told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""Wars aren't ever going to be won from the air alone. They're a vital part of success, but don't expect a guy in an airplane to be able to seize and hold terrain,"" he said. At least 45 ISIS fighters have been killed in the strikes, though the number may be much higher, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gets information from sources on the ground. The most recent strikes, late Tuesday into Wednesday, included nine in Syria, the U.S. military said.  Six were in the Kobani area and destroyed an ISIS armored personnel carrier, four armed vehicles and two artillery pieces, U.S. Central Command said. U.S. and coalition forces also conducted five airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, the military said. The primary goal of the aerial campaign is not to save Syrian cities and towns, the U.S. officials said.  Rather, the aim is to go after ISIS' senior leadership, oil refineries and other infrastructure that would curb the terror group's ability to operate -- particularly in Iraq. Saving Iraq is a more strategic goal for several reasons, the officials said. First, the United States has a relationship with the Iraqi government. By contrast, the Obama administration wants Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Another reason: The United States has partners on the ground in Iraq, including Iraqi forces and Kurdish fighters known as Peshmerga. According to a senior military official, U.S. military advisers are now working with Iraqi troops at the brigade level, not just in the joint command centers in Irbil and Baghdad. The advisers are not in combat situations, but the move means they are less removed than before, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""Our strikes continue alongside our partners. It remains a difficult mission. As I've indicated from the start, this is not something that is going to be solved overnight,"" President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday. ""We're confident that we will be able to continue to make progress in partnership with the Iraqi government, because ultimately it's going to be important for them to be able to, with our help, secure their own country, and to find the kind of political accommodations that are necessary for long-term prosperity,"" he said. Local fighters apparently made some headway Wednesday morning, when some ISIS militants in Kobani were pushed back to the city's perimeter, Kurdish official Idriss Nassan said. The battles have been bloody. More than 400 people have been killed in the fight for Kobani since mid-September, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The opposition group said it has documented the deaths of 219 ISIS jihadists, 163 members of the Kurdish militia and 20 civilians. U.S. plan against ISIS: Iraq first, then Syria . The United States' goal is to first beat back ISIS in Iraq, then eliminate some of its leadership and resources in Syria, the U.S. administration officials said. If all goes as planned, by the time officials turn their attention to Syria, some of the Syrian opposition will be trained well enough to tackle ISIS in earnest. Washington has been making efforts to arm and train moderate Syrian opposition forces who are locked in a fight against both ISIS and the al-Assad regime. Training Syrian rebels could take quite a long time. ""It could take years, actually,"" retired Gen. John Allen said last week. ""Expectations need to be managed."" The United States also wants Turkey to do more, the officials said. The administration is urging Turkey to at least fire artillery at ISIS targets across the border. But the Turkish reluctance, the officials say, is wrapped up in the complex relationship with their own Kurds and the idea that they don't want to help any of the Kurds in any way. CNN iReporter Chelsea Smith sent photos, taken Tuesday night in Istanbul, showing clashes between police and protesters in the predominately Kurdish neighborhood of Tarlabasi. While outside the Parliament building in London on Wednesday, Kurdish activists protested for stronger action. ""We want more airstrikes. We want a clear message. There is a humanity that's threatened and the massacre is about to happen, and we have to act very immediately and prompt, and intensify our attacks on them,"" said Rebar Hajo, a protester, and member of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria. Hundreds of strikes, millions of dollars . The United States and its allies have made at least 271 airstrikes in Iraq and 116 in Syria. The cost? More than $62 million for just the munitions alone. The effect? Negligible, some say, particularly in Iraq. One by one, the cities have fallen to ISIS like dominoes: Hit, Albu Aytha, Kubaisya, Saqlawia and Sejal. And standing on the western outskirts of Baghdad, ISIS is now within sight. ""That's DAIISH right over there,"" said Iraqi Brig. Gen. Ali Abdel Hussain Kazim, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. The militants' proximity to the capital is cause for concern. If the terror group manages to infiltrate and launch attacks in Baghdad or its green zone, the results could be disastrous. Kazim said ISIS has not been able to move from eastern Anbar province to Baghdad. But another brigadier general said that's not even the biggest threat. The real danger to the Iraqi capital, Brig. Gen. Mohamed al-Askari said, is from ISIS sympathizers in the city. ""They are a gang,"" he said. ""They deploy among civilians. They disappear into the civilian population and camouflage themselves.""","A U.S.-led coalition conducts nine airstrikes in Syria; three in Iraq .

"Almost a year ago, 8-year-old Martin Richard wrote four simple words on a sign at school. ""No more hurting people,"" it said. For the camera, he held up the bright blue sign decorated with hearts framing the word ""Peace."" It's a photograph that many find difficult to look at Tuesday as they struggle to comprehend the violence that took Martin's life. On Monday, the boy and his family were watching the Boston Marathon near the finish line when two bombs exploded just off Copley Square in the heart of the city. The grade-schooler was killed, authorities said. Martin's mother, Denise, and his sister were grievously injured, The Boston Globe reported. Denise Richard underwent surgery for an injury to her brain, and Martin's 6-year-old sister lost her leg, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. As of 1 p.m. ET Tuesday, both were still hospitalized, according to WHDH. The boy's father, William Richard, is a community leader in the Ashmont section of Dorchester, according to the Globe. ""My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston,"" Richard said in a statement Tuesday. ""My wife and daughter are both recovering from serious injuries. We thank our family and friends, those we know and those we have never met, for their thoughts and prayers. I ask that you continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin. We also ask for your patience and for privacy as we work to simultaneously grieve and recover. Thank you."" After early reports conflicted about whether William Richard ran the marathon, a family spokesperson told CNN Tuesday afternoon that he was a spectator. At a loss: Comforting grieving parents . Tuesday morning, people arrived at the Richards' home in the working-class neighborhood dotted with large New England-style homes. On the stone steps of the Richards' blue-gray house, visitors gingerly laid down flowers. Someone had written ""peace"" at the end of the driveway, according to the Globe. More than a 1,000 people, many holding candles and each other, attended a vigil in Dorchester for Martin and the other two victims Tuesday night. Neighbor Jane Sherman told CNN that William Richard came home Monday night about 10:30. He seemed extremely upset and didn't appear to want to talk, she said. On Tuesday at the Richard home, a 10-year-old girl who went to school with Martin came by with her mother. ""We came here to pay our respects,"" the mother told CNN. ""My daughter was very sad. He was a very nice boy."" Martin attended the Neighborhood House Charter School, according to a school official. The boy ""was a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high hopes for his future, the school said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken by this loss."" ""We are also praying for his mother Denise, our school librarian and sister Jane, another Neighborhood House Charter student, who were seriously injured yesterday,"" the statement said. The family represent ""the very best this city has to offer,"" it said. Also killed in Monday's attack was Krystle Campbell, who graduated from Medford High School in Massachusetts in 2001. There were no immediate details about the third victim killed in the bombings. Of the more than 170 people who were treated at hospitals, at least 17 were in critical condition and 41 in serious condition, according to hospital officials. Martin made his ""peace"" sign in May when his school organized a ""Peace Walk."" Holding their homemade signs, kids walked around the city making a big statement with a simple act. In bubble letters, one of his classmates wrote, ""No more violence!"" Mom posts viral photo of boy killed in blast . In another photo of Martin -- this one apparently marking what was perhaps his first communion -- he is smiling, missing a few teeth, handsome and proud in his white suit. He holds a colorful communion banner. On it is a dove that symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The Richard family was very active in the neighborhood. ""They are beloved by this community,"" City Councilor at Large Ayanna Pressley told the Globe. Pressley and other devastated residents gathered at Tavolo Restaurant in Dorchester to mourn. The family contributes ""in many ways,"" she said. ""That's why you see this outpouring. It's surreal; it's tragic."" Sherman said that the Richard family is a ""typical all-American family"" and that Martin and his little brother always loved to play in their yard, no matter the weather. Neighbor Dan Aguilar told The Boston Globe the same and said he was having a hard time wrapping his mind around the child's death. ""That little boy will never come home again,'' he told the paper. ""It's still unreal. I have no words. I have no words.'' While so much grieving continues, more details are emerging about Monday's bombings. No suspects have been identified in the case, which federal authorities are classifying as an act of terrorism.

"The Dutch man suspected in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway has sued the Chilean government for more than $13 million, alleging his human rights were violated when Chile extradited him last year to Peru to face charges in the death of a Peruvian woman. ""The lawsuit is against the Chilean government, for having violated Joran van der Sloot's basic human rights,"" his Peruvian lawyer Aldo Cotrina told In Session. The suit was filed September 4 with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington. ""Maybe they won't accept my analysis in Peru, because they feel this is the way things have always been done,"" said Cotrina, who is based in New York. ""But I believe there are universal human rights and we have to respect those rights. We can't say that because someone is accused of killing a person, you can violate all their rights."" Cotrina said van der Sloot's former attorney, Maximo Altez, contacted him in July 2010 about the complaint, and the two men met the following month to begin researching grounds for the lawsuit on the basis of their claim that van der Sloot's human rights had been violated in June 2010, when Chile expelled him to Peru. Cotrina said he expects to complete next week a similar document, to be filed against the government of Peru. Van der Sloot, 24, faces a trial on murder and robbery charges that is set to begin January 6 in Peru. He is accused of killing 21-year-old Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room last year. Police say he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. The 13-page lawsuit says an international arrest warrant had not been filed against van der Sloot, but he was arrested by Chilean authorities anyway. But documents from Peru's Ministry of Interior indicate that the Peruvian police had requested his arrest; Interpol authorities in Chile and Peru were contacted, as was Chile's Ministry of Interior. The lawsuit further alleges that van der Sloot was not given enough time to appeal his expulsion from Chile, and that that failure was a violation of his basic human rights. But correspondence between Chile's Ministry of Interior and Peru's Ministry of Interior indicates that officials from both ministries considered that van der Sloot's expulsion was legal under the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) treaty, which allows for international cooperation in matters of criminal activity. The documents were obtained by In Session on TruTV, which is a sister network to CNN. The resolution to expel van der Sloot from Chile, which was approved by the Chilean government, cites a police report as having been filed on May 13, 2010. Van der Sloot's lawyer points out that his client did not even enter Chile until May 31. The lawsuit refers to the apparent typo as evidence that Chilean and Peruvian officials were violating the Dutch man's rights. The lawsuit adds that Chilean police did not give van der Sloot the opportunity to call or use a computer to contact relatives, did not give him legal representation and did not give him a translator -- all putative violations of his rights. Interpol documents obtained by In Session indicate that van der Sloot voluntarily gave a statement in English to Chilean police in which he said that he and Flores had been attacked in Lima and that he fled fearing for his life. Van der Sloot was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Holloway, the Alabama teenager who vanished in May 2005 while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba. He was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which remains unsolved. He also faces extradition charges to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted van der Sloot on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother. He was given $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores.","Lawyer alleges violations of Joran van der Sloot's civil rights .

"Tattooed and pale, with an Arabic vocabulary of a few dozen words at best, 24-year-old American Peter Kassig is not who you would expect to see striding up and down the corridors of a hospital in Tripoli, Lebanon, clutching a wad of bloodied bandages. ""This is one of the worst wounds we have on the floor; this one is pretty bad,"" he says as he works to help clean out the raw lower leg wound of a patient. ""They were going to have to amputate the leg, but they were able to reconnect the artery, right,"" he asks Marwan, a 27-year-old nurse from Homs, Syria, who, like most of those Kassig works alongside, fled his homeland to treat his countrymen in Lebanon. Despite the language barrier, the two have bonded, as Kassig has managed to with all those he's been interacting with, the type of unique bond born of shared intense experience whether it's with the patients, some who don't survive or the doctors and nurses who have suffered horrors Kassig is only beginning to comprehend. ""There is this impression, this belief that there is no hope,"" he explains. ""That's when it's more important than ever that we come in against all odds and we do something."" How did an American end up in a Lebanon hospital treating wounded Syrians from months of escalating violence? Kassig's journey began when he joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2006 and deployed to Iraq in 2007. He was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour  and returned to the United States to study political science and train for 1500-meter runs.  But something wasn't right. ""I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,"" he says.  ""I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose."" Portraits of conflict: Can an image stop the bloodshed? In 2010, Kassig took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician. In the two years that followed he fell in love, got married and quickly divorced. Devastated and heartbroken, he went back to school, but he couldn't shake his depression. ""I needed to make a drastic decision. It was a huge identity thing; it was time to re-evaluate,"" he says. ""I needed a game changer."" He decided he would head to Beirut, follow the situation in Syria and try to help. So on his spring break this year he packed his medical kit and flew into the Lebanese capital. ""I took a chance,"" he says. ""There wasn't a single person when I told them I was coming to Lebanon who said, 'Yeah, that's a great idea. You should do that.'"" The next two weeks were filled with eye-opening misadventures as Kassig began to scratch at the surface of the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the Middle East as a whole. ""I had learned enough to know that I didn't know anything,"" he says. After finishing the semester back in the United States, he returned to Lebanon, only this time with a plan. ""We each get one life and that's it. We get one shot at this and we don't get any do-overs, and for me, it was time to put up or shut up,"" he says. ""The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do. I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes."" Kassig is now working to start a number of projects to help those in need and putting his EMT skills to use whenever he can. ""I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse. But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better,""  he says. ""This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose."" Some of those Kassig helps to treat are rebel fighters, all who vow they will return to the battlefield as soon as they can. Others are the innocent victims of a spiraling conflict. Lying in one of the hospital beds is 24-year-old Louliya.  She says she and her three children were run over by a military jeep as they were trying to escape the Syrian military siege of their village.  Her spinal cord was crushed, leaving her unable to move from the neck down.  She was smuggled across the border to Lebanon for surgery. She's only just started to be able to regain feeling. She smiles bravely but is unable to stop the tears from rolling down her face. ""All I want is to be able to hold my children in my arms again,"" she says softly, trying but failing to imitate the cradling of a child. Despite dangers, doctors honor oath in a secret Syrian field hospital . In a room across the hall, Yaseen smiles devilishly as she tells us she's 7, laughing as her older sisters correct her.  She's actually 5. Both her little legs are bandaged, a result of gunshot wounds she sustained as her family was fleeing the violence and their vehicle came under fire. ""It just itches,"" she says, giggling and insisting she was never afraid. Other wounds are more gruesome: Dr. Ahmed Obeid, also a refugee from Homs, shows pictures on his cell phone of a raw wound, crawling with maggots. There's another photo of a young man with all of the flesh on his back removed -- a patient they were unable to save. It was a case that caused Kassig to begin to appreciate just what it was they were up against. ""The tissue had turned necrotic, which basically means it was dead,"" Kassig explains. ""We had to cut out a huge piece of skin, the whole upper side of his back."" It's what happens when the wounded can't be evacuated in time. A bitter lesson Syrians know too well. Kassig says his direct exposure to what was something of an alien conflict and culture before has now transformed his perspective. ""There is this mentality from where I come from back home that I have a little bit of a problem with,"" he says. ""I don't want to get on a political soap box, but at the same time we have to think about why as a country we choose to help certain people and not others. ""We have to think about why we just chalk up the Middle East [as] this complex enigma that we will never understand because they are so different from us.  But at the end of the day, they are really not. It's just about whether or not you're willing to go out on a limb and understand something,"" he says. ""Peter can tell the American people who we are,"" says Marwan, the Syrian nurse. ""We are not what the regime says we are -- terrorists and al Qaeda. Peter knows we are good people, who love joking and laughter. We just want to live."" Kassig has been struck by the resilience of the Syrians he has met, by their ability to smile and somehow joke even in the darkest of circumstances. ""This kid has his leg blown off,"" he says, ""and he still had the ability to crack jokes and smile, and he had the doctor cracking up. He had the whole room laughing. That's just the way they are, the people that I have met and worked with in the hospital. It's been absolutely humbling."" Sitting in the room where the hospital workers also sleep, Kassig stares up at the TV screen, always following with everyone else the news in Syria, image after image of death and destruction. He says he believes that America has lost its humanity, that the nation needs to take a firm political stance, although he's not advocating military intervention. ""This is real, and it's scary stuff, and it's sad what is happening to people here,"" he says. ""People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere."" When outrage isn't enough | Your take: Intervene or not?","American, 24, helps treat wounded Syrians in Lebanon .

"(CNN)Amsterdam should be a cyclist's dream. It's pancake flat, it's riddled with cycle tracks and almost everyone gets around on two wheels. There are so many bikes it looks like -- hard though this may be to imagine -- the Tour de France for normal riders. In reality, it's a nightmare, or at least it is until you grasp the rules of the road -- and then it's a blast. Within seven minutes of taking possession of my Dutch rental bike, a motor scooter nearly rams me into a canal. By the time my first hour is up, I've been verbally abused for halting abruptly in a cycle lane, and been loudly tooted at by a tram after getting my tires stuck in its tracks. I'm not the only one. All around Amsterdam hapless bike-borne visitors can be seen wobbling into the paths of furious Dutch cyclists. ""Tourists think they're in Disneyworld,"" says Geert Gelissen, who runs FietsConsult, a side-street cycle hire and repair shop in the Dutch capital. ""And Dutch people think they're God on a bicycle. ""It's a problem. As soon as summer starts, I sell more of these things than anything else,"" he adds, brandishing an enormous brass bike bell the size of a clenched fist. ""Customers come into my shop and scream 'arrrrgghh!'"" With more rental bike shops opening every year, the problem could get worse -- unless, of course, tourists grasp the essentials of riding in Amsterdam. It's not hard though. Here's what I picked up. Ride it like you stole it . Pedal slowly while gawping at tulips, or stop to check your map, and pretty soon all of Amsterdam will hate you. ""When we're on bikes, Dutch people are always in a hurry, even when they're not in a hurry,"" says Guy Collot d'Esury, another Amsterdam bike mechanic. ""You don't have to ride like us, but if you can't, just stay out of our way and you'll be fine."" But make sure someone else doesn't steal it . ""If it isn't locked to Earth, then expect it to go,"" says Samantha Shaffer, an economics major from Washington, D.C., whose year-long studies in Amsterdam have literally and figuratively included a crash course in Dutch cycling. An estimated 55,000 bikes go missing annually in the city, fueling rumors of gangs targeting them to smuggle to Eastern Europe. ""People are afraid to buy brand new bikes, so they get some old thing for 100 euros ($136),"" says Gelissen. ""But if you lock it to something secure the chances are better."" Be careful where you lock it though. Amsterdam authorities have begun removing bikes locked outside of extensive designated cycle parks on canals and at the central station. It's a long walk to the pound on the outskirts of town to get it back. Try not to look like a tourist . Using one of the major rental companies gives the advantage of a citywide support network, but it also saddles customers with a brightly colored bike. Less cycle-related abuse is attracted from locals if the ride doesn't shout ""I'm a tourist."" I rented mine from Black Bikes, which offers ""classic"" Dutch machines that blend in seamlessly with the crowds riding indestructible, gearless step-through bikes. There are plenty of other low key rental shops, and while the quality may not match that offered by the big chains, that's not necessarily a problem. ""Having a bike that makes noises is a good thing,"" says Shaffer. ""People can hear you coming and get out of your way."" Expect the worst . More advice from Shaffer: ""If you go with the expectation that you're probably going to die on your bike -- anything less than that, you should be happy."" She's joking, but after my run-in with the scooter and tram, it's advice that rings truer than one of Gelissen's giant bells. Some Dutch cyclists seem to invite the worst. I saw one man riding along a canal-side road while using both hands to operate his iPad. I saw another man riding undeterred by the fact he was carrying crutches and had one foot in plaster -- perhaps from an earlier cycle accident. The good news is, according to Dutch cycling organization Fietersbond, Amsterdam and the Netherlands have one of the lowest rates of serious cycling accidents in the world. Cycle sober . After a day dodging tram rails or being railed at by impatient locals, it's tempting to park the wheels outside a canal-side pub to sink a few foam-topped Dutch beers before setting off again. That's probably the fastest route to the bottom of the Prinsengracht Canal. Amsterdam might have a liberal outlook on most things, but cycling under the influence of alcohol or whatever else is on offer isn't legal -- unless you're on the beer bike, a pedal-powered mobile bar. That's not to say it doesn't happen. ""If you're out after dark, assume everyone on a bike is drunk,"" jokes Shaffer. Stick to the cycle paths . Amsterdam might resemble a cyclists' free-for-all, with bikes zipping into every available space, but there are rules and cycling isn't permitted everywhere. Sticking to the city's 4,000 or so kilometers (2,480 miles) of designated cycle path will ensure safety -- as long as other cyclists remain patient -- and get you there far faster. When no way is marked by a cycle symbol, then it's possible to mingle with traffic. The city does have pedestrian zones, though, so sometimes it's best to get off and walk. Give your bike a name . This is somewhat random parting advice from Shaffer, particularly as her gold-sprayed bone-rattler doesn't have a name, until we both agree it should probably be called Melvin. ""If you name your bike, you become one with the bike,"" she adds, sagely. And then if you wind up in a canal, at least you're not alone. Got any more good tips for cycling in Amsterdam? Let us know in the comments. Barry Neild is a freelance journalist based in London. He's a longtime contributor to CNN and other major international news organizations.","Amsterdam is pancake flat and crisscrossed with 4,000 kilometers of bike paths .

"(CNN) -- U.S. officials are claiming that the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, is ""now a credible alternative to al Qaeda."" But what does that really mean in terms of ISIS' potential threat to the United States? After all, al Qaeda hasn't pulled off a successful attack in the States since 9/11, or indeed anywhere in the West since the London transportation bombings in 2005. This month, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, criticized the airstrikes in Iraq ordered by President Barack Obama directed at ISIS as too limited, telling CNN's Candy Crowley, ""That is simply a very narrow and focused approach to a problem which is metastasizing as we speak. Candy, there was a guy a month ago that was in Syria, went back to the United States, came back and blew himself up. We're tracking 100 Americans who are over there now fighting for ISIS. ISIS is attracting extreme elements from all over the world, much less the Arab world. And what have we done?"" The case McCain alluded to was that of Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who grew up in Vero Beach, Florida, and who conducted a suicide bombing in Syria in May on behalf of the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. According to The New York Times, Abu-Salha had returned to the United States after being trained by Nusra and then went back to Syria to conduct the suicide operation in which he died. McCain asserted on CNN that 100 Americans were fighting with ISIS. In fact, according to U.S. officials, 100 is the total number of Americans believed to have fought or attempted to have fought with any of the many Syrian insurgent groups, some of which are more militant than others, and some of which are even aligned with the United States. According to a count by the New America Foundation, eight people from the United States have been indicted with crimes related to trying to join ISIS or the Nusra Front. (By contrast, some 240 U.S. citizens and residents have been indicted or charged with some kind of jihadist terrorist crime since 9/11.) Some of the Nusra Front cases are far from threatening. On April 19, 2013, Abdella Tounisi, an 18-year-old American citizen from Aurora, Illinois, was arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to Nusra. However, he was caught in a sting operation and described his fighting skills thusly: ""Concerning my fighting skills, to be honest, I do not have any."" Tounisi pleaded not guilty and awaits trial. Other cases appear more serious. In December, Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, a U.S. citizen from Southern California, pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to provide material support to al Qaeda. Between December 2012 and April 2013, Nguyen had traveled to Syria, where, he stated, he fought alongside the Nusra Front. On his return, Nguyen discussed with an informant his intent to participate further in jihad. In August 2013, Gufran Mohammed, a naturalized American citizen living in Saudi Arabia, was charged with attempting to provide material support to the Nusra Front in Syria, by facilitating the recruitment of experienced fighters from al Qaeda's Somali affiliate to Syria. He pleaded guilty last month. Opinion: How Iraq's black market in oil funds ISIS . Yet so far no U.S. citizen involved in fighting or supporting the Nusra Front or ISIS has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the United States despite the fact the war in Syria is now in its fourth year and the war in Iraq is in its 11th year. Indeed, some Americans who have traveled to Syria have ended up dead apparently because they have no combat experience to speak of; for instance, Nicole Mansfield from Flint, Michigan, was killed in Syria last year by forces loyal to the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Further, ISIS' predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, never tried to conduct an attack on the American homeland, although it did bomb three American hotels in Jordan in 2005. And it's also worth noting that in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the States since 9/11, such as the Boston Marathon bombings last year or Maj. Nidal Hasan's massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas. Returning foreign fighters from the Syrian conflict pose a far greater threat to Europe, which has contributed a much larger number of foreign fighters to the conflict than the United States, including an estimated 700 from France, 450 from the United Kingdom and 270 from Germany. Unlike in the United States, European countries have reported specific terrorist plots tied to returning Syrian fighters. Mehdi Nemmouche, a suspect in the May 24 shootings at a Jewish museum in Brussels, Belgium, that killed four people, spent about a year with jihadist fighters in Syria, according to the Paris prosecutor in the case. But Nemmouche's case is the only instance of lethal violence by a returning Syrian fighter in the West. Still, the United States must consider European foreign fighters returning from Syria as more than a European problem because many of those returning are from countries that participate in the U.S. visa waiver program and can enter the States without a visa. Moreover, experienced al Qaeda operators are present in Syria. As one senior U.S. intelligence official put it to us, these are veteran members ""with strong resumes and full Rolodexes."" The wars in Syria and Iraq allow such longtime fighters to interact with members of other al Qaeda affiliates. For example, in July, the United States adopted enhanced security measures at airports based on intelligence that bomb-makers from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were sharing their expertise in making bombs capable of evading airport security with members of the Syrian Nusra Front. Despite these dangers, however, the threat to the United States from foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq remains only a potential threat. The administration's airstrikes in Iraq are properly focused upon the more imminent threats to U.S. government employees and American citizens in the Kurdish city of Irbil who are threatened by ISIS advances and the humanitarian catastrophe befalling the Yazidi population in areas controlled by the militant forces. The last time there was a similar exodus of American citizens and residents to an overseas holy war was to Somalia following the U.S.-backed invasion of Somalia by Ethiopian forces in 2006. More than 40 Americans subsequently went to Somalia to fight with Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-affiliated group. Opinion: ISIS beheading -- what should U.S. do? Just as is the case today in Syria, for a good number of the Americans who went to fight in Somalia it was a one-way ticket because 15 of the 40 or so American volunteers died there either as suicide attackers or on the battlefield. In 2011, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, then-chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, warned of Americans fighting in Somalia. ""With a large group of Muslim-Americans willing to die as 'martyrs' and a strong operational partnership with al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and in Yemen, al-Shabaab now has more capability than ever to strike the U.S. homeland."" As it turned out, those Americans who returned from the Somali jihad did not attempt or carry out any kind of terrorist attack in the States. Now King is back at it again, telling NBC last week, ""ISIS is a direct threat to the United States of America. ... They are more powerful now than al Qaeda was on 9/11."" ISIS is surely a major problem for Iraq, and its tactics and strategy are abhorrent, as demonstrated by the beheading of American journalist James Foley, its use of crucifixions and its genocidal attacks on the small Yazidi minority. But that doesn't mean it is a serious threat to the American homeland.","U.S. officials now see ISIS as a credible threat, on a par with al Qaeda .

"(CNN)The luck of the Irish had nothing to do with it. Ireland continued their trademark giant killing with the first shock of this cricket World Cup by defeating West Indies by four wickets. It's a mere eight years since Ireland made its tournament debut. Back in 2007, they tied with Zimbabwe and picked up victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh. Four years on, there was a famous victory over England and once more they have picked up the scalp of one of the Test-playing nations. While Ireland are on a crest of a wave, the Windies are seemingly a team in disarray. The once dominant force of global cricket -- West Indies won two World Cups in the 1970s with a mixture of fearsome pace bowling and swashbuckling batting -- the current crop of players looked disenchanted on the field throughout the match. A pay dispute between the players and the West Indies Cricket Board led to their tour of India being abandoned last October and there have reportedly been further rows over the omissions of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard from their World Cup squad. The Caribbean team's stock has fallen so far that they are now ranked a lowly eighth in the one-day international standings. Ireland captain William Porterfield was adamant in the build-up to the game that confidence was high in the camp. ""I don't think it'll be a surprise if we win,"" he said. ""I think we're preparing for every game and going out there to win that game, and I don't think it'll be a surprise to anyone if we go out there and win games."" And it was a sentiment backed in the aftermath of another major scalp, Porterfield merely adding: ""I don't see it as an upset."" But it was the manner of the victory that was impressive. Ireland were set a target of 305 to win the game, with just four successful run chances above 300 having ever been achieved in World Cup history. Now that figure is five and Ireland are responsible for three of them. Former England player Ed Joyce was the most eye-catching of the Irish batsmen with a blistering knock of the 84 runs from 67 balls, while Paul Stirling top scored 92 and Niall O'Brien finished the innings unbeaten on 79. It was left to John Mooney, as he had done famously against England four years ago, to hit the winning runs and spark the Irish celebrations in Nelson, New Zealand. Rubbing salt into the Windies wounds was this was a victory masterminded by a former West Indies international Phil Simmons, Ireland's cricket coach whose nephew Lendl top scored for the Caribbean side with a century. Simmons' Ireland side, though, are not one of the world's Test playing nations, considered to be in the second tier of global cricket at the head of the Associates. But the pre-tournament form of both sides had suggested an upset could be on the cards. West Indies had lost their last one-day international series against South Africa 4-1 and managed a meager 122 runs in their World Cup warm-up match against England. In addition, they had lost a T20 game to Ireland in Jamaica just last year. When Ireland broke the mold at the 2007 World Cup, a documentary called The Breaking Boundaries followed while their 2011 England win led the Prime Minister elect Enda Kenny to contact the team. She said: ""Their supreme effort will lift the spirits of every single Irish person, no matter where they are in the world. Ireland's performance is truly inspiring, demonstrating that, with self-belief, the apparently impossible can be made possible, and that real change can occur."" Quite what lies in store this time should they continue their giant killing remains to be seen.","Ireland pull-off a memorable four-victory against West Indies in their World Cup opener .

"(CNN)Salt trucks rumbled and traffic jammed as a massive new storm brought snow, freezing rain, ice and frigid temperatures to a large swath of the United States on Monday. ""It's dangerously cold,"" Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" warning that the nation's capital was bracing for up to 8 inches of snow. And federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday. But the snow isn't the only thing to worry about. ""We are going to see high snowfall amounts, but the ice is what is going to be the big story,"" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said, pointing at North Carolina. Raleigh, North Carolina, could see up to a half-inch of ice, which could knock out power and ""makes travel nearly impossible,"" she said. The bitter cold is coming from several fronts. This weekend, the Northeast weathered its fourth snowstorm in three weeks, and extremely low temperatures are predicted to hang around for two more weeks. A winter storm stretching across the Midwest and Southeast is bringing freezing rain and ice accumulation, especially from Arkansas to Tennessee. Late Monday, Tennessee declared a state of emergency as road conditions quickly deteriorated and power outages spiked. Temperatures across the eastern half of the United States will be below average for the entire week, and that's a big deal as winter fatigue sets in. In Boston, where 95 inches of snow have already been recorded this year, the latest storm was expected to skirt by and bring a few more inches, Gray said. This February is the city's snowiest month ever. Frank Ippolito, the owner of a snow removal business operating in Boston, said his staff was weary from lack of sleep. At this point, his snowplow drivers are putting snow ""anywhere and everywhere there's an open piece of land that won't obstruct the view safely of the driver or prevent someone from getting out of a doorway or moving a car,"" he said. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said one man died after suffering a heart attack while shoveling snow. ""Please stay close to your home today -- shovel in short stints,"" he said. Mounting ""snow rage"" is pitting drivers and neighbors against each other as the winter weather shows no sign of letting up, CNN affiliate WFXT reported. ""We've been noticing a little frustration out there on the roads,"" Massachusetts State Police trooper Kathryn Downey said. ""I think people are getting pushed to their limits."" Margo Souza of Charlestown, Massachusetts, told CNN's iReport she was trying to take the snow in stride, even though it has doubled her commute. Her golden retrievers, Logan and Copley, love to bound around in it. Still, she said she was hoping her city's baseball team might bring something with them when they head south for spring training. ""Send the snow to Florida,"" she said, ""along with the Red Sox equipment."" One New York resident, Max Guliani, posted photos on Twitter of the frozen fountain at Bryant Park in New York City. A pipe burst at the city's iconic Empire State Building, forcing one of its observatories to shut down, a spokeswoman said. In Ithaca, in upstate New York, temperatures have gotten so cold that even the city's tourism website is telling people to head to the Sunshine State. ""That's it. We surrender,"" the website says. ""Winter, you win. Key West anyone?"" Do you see mountains of snow or freezing rain outside your window, but have friends in Florida or California who don't understand the big deal with the severe winter weather? Pick a weather factoid to share with them (via CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller): . • Wind chills in the Northeast make it feel as cold as -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 Celsius). • Monday was the coldest morning in Boston since 2004, at -3 degrees Fahrenheit (-19 Celsius). • More than 55 million people live in areas that are currently under a wind chill warning or advisory. • An additional 50 million are under winter storm warnings, stretching from Oklahoma to South Carolina and up to New Jersey. As a weary Northeast remains buried in snow, the South and Midwest are gearing up for a messy mix of snow, sleet and ice. Snowfall records have been broken in the Northeast, and now, more than a dozen other states, stretching from Kansas and Oklahoma to North Carolina and Virginia, are bracing for inclement weather. ""It's been about 10 years since we've had something this significant,"" said Doug Hamilton, chief of public services in Louisville, Kentucky. In Lexington, plows are working around the clock, Mayor Jim Gray told CNN affiliate WLEX. Already, he said, parts of the city have seen between 6-11 inches of snow, which he described as ""very unusual."" Southern Indiana could see up to 10 inches of snow, while northern Kentucky faces between 8 and 14 inches, the National Weather Service said. ""Travel will be treacherous with some roads nearly impassable,"" the National Weather Service warned. ""Have an emergency kit of blankets, food, water and flashlights if you must travel."" In addition to slick roads, trees may come down because of snow accumulations, causing power outages. Forecasters warned residents in affected areas to defer travel on rural roads until Tuesday. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley ordered various agencies on alert, including the  Emergency Management Agency,  the state National Guard and law enforcement agencies. ""State agencies are on standby to coordinate resources to support the needs of Alabama counties if necessary,""  he said. In Missouri, St. Louis braced for heavy snow Monday, possibly into overnight, CNN affiliate KMOV reported. School districts in cities such as Little Rock, Arkansas, shut down in expectation of wintry weather. Nashville saw relentless freezing rain starting before dawn Monday, and snowplows were already at work. Three to 7 inches of snow are forecast there in the next 24 hours. Southwest Airlines on Monday canceled all flights to and from Nashville International Airport, airport spokeswoman Shannon Sumrall said. Southwest accounts for more than half of the commercial flights at the airport, she said. Only a handful of Delta and American Airlines flights departed Monday. Wintry weather is in the eye of the beholder. The Northeast is urging drivers to stay off roads as the fourth storm in three weeks drops snow that, for Boston, has exceeded 45 inches in February alone. It takes a fraction of that to get residents in the South into emergency mode. Sometimes, it doesn't even have to snow; just the possibility of wintry weather is enough for a partial shutdown. The Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for northern Georgia, warning of potential snow and ice accumulation on the roads. Temperatures dropped in the Atlanta area Monday, and even though the forecast suggested the snow/ice mix would fall farther north, some school districts closed out of caution. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 15 northern Georgia counties and asked state workers there to work from home if they're not involved in emergency response. ""The danger, of course, with moisture on our roadways and the temperature dropping, is the fear of black ice,"" Deal said, according to CNN affiliate WSB. ""And that is the most significant threat that we see."" Residents loaded up on food and other supplies, memories of last year's storm probably fresh in their minds. CNN's Amanda Jackson, Joe Johns, Wolf Blitzer, Camille Cava, Diane Ruggiero, Philip Cantor, Melanie Whitley, Faith Karimi, Nick Valencia, Ryan Young, Derek Van Dam and John Couwels contributed to this report.","Federal government offices in the Washington area will be closed Tuesday .

"(CNN)History has a cruel sense of humor. Just watch President Barack Obama struggle with a war in Iraq and Syria during his final years in office; watch him discuss what kind of U.S. military he will hand over to the next president, and think back to the campaign promises that put him in office, a vow to end America's ""dumb war"" in Iraq. The irony is inescapable. But it is more than that. Like it or not, Obama's struggle with conflict in the Middle East is a sign that foreign policy is set to emerge as a key issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. And, at least according to a new CNN/ORC International Poll, it's an issue that the public feels the President isn't delivering on. But the reality is that the challenges are multiplying -- and there are no easy answers. From Iraq, Syria, Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere on the globe, there are very real and very tough choices facing the next president. The most urgent ones, and by far the most complicated, come from the epicenter of instability, the smoldering Middle East. What is America to do? It's not just a rhetorical question. It is an extraordinarily important question for anyone who wants to become president of the United States. What would you do? For voters, it represents a supreme duty to demand clear, consistent and credible answers and choose the man or woman who makes sense, who is not simply playing political or rhetorical games with something that means life or death for so many people. The United States already tried ""shock and awe,"" the full-force, heavy footprint approach of President George W. Bush. And it has now tried the softer footprint approach from Barack Obama. Both essentially failed. Now what? Is anyone really going to argue for a return to mass military force? Is anyone going to support a ""stay the course"" approach? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more hawkish than Obama, called years ago for arming moderate Syrian rebels, but would that have meant U.S. weaponry would have ultimately ended in ISIS hands, as rebels have changed sides or lost to the ultra-radical Islamists backing ISIS or al Qaeda? Sen. Rand Paul has offered a confusing mix of isolationism and interventionism, blaming U.S. interventions for the crisis while saying he supports the fight against ISIS. The Middle East is unraveling and it's very difficult to argue that Washington's policies have had much of a positive impact, either for the region or for America. Just last week, the United States abandoned its embassy in Yemen. That makes for yet another country in the Middle East with no U.S. diplomatic presence, another failed state in the region, another former U.S. ally out of power, another Iran ally gaining control of an Arab capital. On Election Day, voters are usually more influenced by pocketbook issues than foreign policy questions. ""It's the economy, stupid,"" has become every campaign consultant's mantra. But the really tough, history-making choices will lie elsewhere. The next president will have to decide how America will fight ISIS, and al Qaeda, the rival terror groups who share an anti-modern, anti-Western ideology backed by brutal terrorist tactics, which have already left thousands of dead Americans, including on U.S. soil -- a reminder that simply ignoring the problem because it seems distant and intractable is not a viable option. The man or woman Americans elect will face a momentous decision on what to do about the war in Syria, where more than 200,000 people have already died and the killing continues. He or she will confront the reality that American civilians have been publicly slaughtered by ISIS, an organization whose ranks keep growing; already 20,000 foreign fighters have poured in to join ISIS despite a bombing campaign led by the United States. The group's radical ideology and vicious tactics have already started carving a scar of death across Europe and elsewhere. The suspect in last year's shootings in Brussels' Jewish Museum had reportedly traveled to Syria to join ISIS; the man who shot up the kosher deli in Paris claimed allegiance to ISIS. The decisions will be complicated by the larger reality of the Syrian conflict. Four years after Obama declared ""the time has come for [Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad] to step aside,"" al-Assad is massacring Syrian civilians with barely a whiff of condemnation from an international community now more concerned with ISIS. Al-Assad, the man whose forces Obama nearly bombed in 2013, continues dropping barrel bombs on civilians while the U.S. bombs his enemies, indirectly helping his cause. The next president will look at a map of the Middle East, talk to America's Arab allies and hear their deepest concerns turning into reality. Arab governments have accused Iran of wanting to dominate the region. Whether or not Obama reaches an agreement on Iran's nuclear program, there is no escaping the fact that Iran is making huge strategic inroads throughout the Middle East. When Shiite Houthi rebels toppled the U.S.-allied government of Yemen, on the border of Iran's traditional rival Saudi Arabia, an Iranian general reportedly declared the Houthis' success ""a historic victory for the Iranian Islamic revolution."" Iran's close partners, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, turned the tide of battle in Syria, rushing in to save Iran's close friend Assad. Just a few weeks ago, an Iranian general working in Syria was killed by an Israeli strike on a Hezbollah position just across the border from Israel. What about Vladimir Putin's Russia? Putin has brazenly seized internationally recognized territory of Ukraine, a country whose leaders want closer ties to the West. The most recent ceasefire, experience shows, is likely to be flouted by Putin. What if Putin's advance continues? Should the United States help arm Ukraine? Won't doing that inflame the situation, as some European leaders claim? Won't NOT doing that give a green light to Putin? What if he pushed all the way to the Baltic States, members of NATO. Would the United States go to war to defend Estonia? These are only a few urgent questions, but there are many others that look less pressing but are no less important. While the United States and Europe busy themselves with international responsibilities, China is making major inroads in the developing world, notably  in Latin America. Is that something the United States should worry about, something it should seek to counteract? How actively should the United States pivot to Asia and at what region's expense? How much weight should Washington give to human rights when its allies violate principles that are almost sacred to Americans? What position should the United States take regarding democracy, particularly in the Middle East? Will the United States back revolutions in the mold of the Arab Spring even if they aim to topple regimes friendly with the United States, if they might replace them with democratically elected Islamist governments? What about in Iran? And how would it deal with the pro-democracy forces in Iran as the West negotiates with the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program?  And speaking of Iran, what would the next president do if he or she sees Iran dashing for a nuclear bomb (with or without a nuclear agreement)? Would they go to war, or allow Iran to become a nuclear-armed country? These are all complicated matters, worthy of debate in front of the people who will decide who moves into the White House after the Obamas move out. The answer will -- and should -- play an important role in choosing the next president, even if experience has shown that, in the end, it is history that has the last laugh.","Frida Ghitis: Voters usually more influenced by pocketbook issues .

"(CNN)It's not easy to squeeze 40 years of show into one anniversary special, but ""Saturday Night Live"" gave it a go on Sunday night. From the Jimmy Fallon/Justin Timberlake opening to the return of Eddie Murphy and musical performances by the likes of lightning rod artists Kanye West  and Miley Cyrus (who offered a surprisingly charming version of ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover""), it was an evening of mockery and fond remembrances for the ""SNL"" 40th anniversary special. Why 'Saturday Night Live' is still awesome . Here are some highlights: . Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake get musical . Could NBC please just give these two their own show already? We already knew that Fallon and Timberlake are magical, thanks to their ""History of Rap"" skits on Fallon's ""Tonight Show."" On Sunday night, they opened the special episode with a musical number celebrating some of the show's most famous catchphrases. Three cheers for Timberlake's Schweddy balls! Betty White makes out with Bradley Cooper . ""The Californians"" skit was already pretty awesome, with Taylor Swift and Kerry Washington joining cast members past and present (Laraine Newman even showed up!), but then 93-year-old White locked lips with 40-year-old Cooper. Wow. The return of Eddie Murphy . We won't say much about this one even though it was eagerly anticipated. After a 30-year absence from ""SNL,"" Murphy returned for all of 73 seconds. Introduced by Chris Rock, the actor received a standing ovation and offered a few words including ""I will always love this show,"" and that was that. It was brief and awkward. Welcome back, ""Wayne's World"" Mike Myers and Dana Carvey returned as the beloved characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar for an ""SNL"" Top 10. In announcing No. 6 -- musical guests -- Carvey as Garth said, ""I think Beck was one of the best, even better than Beyonce."" That was the perfect segue into No. 5: ""Kanye, sit down,"" a reference to the artist's recent lament that Beck should not have beat out Beyonce for best album at the 2015 Grammys. West was in the audience, and at one point we got to see him play along as security ""restrained"" him. Way to have a sense of humor about it, Ye. Party on! Excellent! Celebrity ""Jeopardy!"" Will Ferrell as Alex Trebek is always at his best when paired with Darrell Hammond's borderline-NSFW Sean Connery, but this episode also gave us the delight that is Kate McKinnon as Justin Bieber and Alec Baldwin as Tony Bennett. When the other ""celebs"" showed up, it was hard to keep it together. Jim Carrey's Matthew McConaughey was pretty spot-on.","Sunday night's special celebrates 40 years of the sketch classic .

"(CNN)Whenever ISIS carries out a new atrocity, whether it's beheading a group of Egyptian Christians or enslaving Yazidi women in Iraq or burning its victims alive, the big question most people have is: Why on Earth is ISIS doing this? What could possibly be the point? Adding to your list of enemies is never a sound strategy, yet ISIS' ferocious campaign against the Shia, Kurds, Yazidis, Christians, and Muslims who don't precisely share its views has united every ethnic and religious group in Syria and Iraq against them. ISIS is even at war with its most natural ally, al Qaeda in Syria. The Nazis and the Khmer Rouge went to great lengths to hide their crimes against humanity. Instead, ISIS posts its many crimes on social media for global distribution with seemingly no thoughts for the consequences. ISIS' beheading of the American journalist James Foley in mid-August galvanized much of the Western world against the group and led to an intensified U.S.-led air campaign against ISIS, which, according to U.S. military officials, has killed at least 6,000 of its fighters. The burning to death by ISIS of the Jordanian pilot, Muath al-Kaseasbeh, galvanized much of the Arab world against the group and has brought Jordan into the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in a much more aggressive manner. The beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya by an ISIS affiliate led Egypt's air force on Monday to drop bombs on ISIS positions in eastern Libya. Former CIA director Robert Gates is reported to have kept a maxim on his desk that read, ""As a general rule, the way to achieve complete strategic surprise is to commit an act that makes no sense or is even self-destructive."" ISIS keeps surprising the world and its actions do indeed seem to make no sense or are self-destructive. So what is going on here? A key window into understanding ISIS is its English language ""in-flight magazine"" Dabiq. Last week the seventh issue of Dabiq was released, and a close reading of it helps explains ISIS' world view. The mistake some make when viewing ISIS is to see it as a rational actor. Instead, as the magazine documents, its ideology is that of an apocalyptic cult that believes that we are living in the end times and that ISIS' actions are hastening the moment when this will happen. The name of the Dabiq magazine itself helps us understand ISIS' worldview. The Syrian town of Dabiq is where the Prophet Mohammed is supposed to have predicted that the armies of Islam and ""Rome"" would meet for the final battle that will precede the end of time and the triumph of true Islam. In the recent issue of Dabiq it states: ""As the world progresses towards al-Malhamah al-Kubrā, ('the Great Battle' to be held at Dabiq) the option to stand on the sidelines as a mere observer is being lost."" In other words, in its logic, you are either on the side of ISIS or you are on the side of the Crusaders and infidels. When American aid worker Peter Kassig was murdered by ISIS in November, ""Jihadi John"" -- the masked British murderer who has appeared in so many ISIS videos -- said of Kassig: ""We bury the first crusader in Dabiq, eagerly waiting for the rest of your armies to arrive."" In other words, ISIS wants a Western ground force to invade Syria, as that will confirm the prophecy about Dabiq. We live in an increasingly secularized world, so it's sometimes difficult to take seriously the deeply held religious beliefs of others. For many of us the idea that the end of times will come with a battle between ""Rome"" and Islam at the obscure Syrian town of Dabiq is as absurd as the belief  that the Mayans had that their human sacrifices could influence future events. But for ISIS, the Dabiq prophecy is deadly serious. Members of ISIS believe that they are the vanguard fighting a religious war, which Allah has determined will be won by the forces of true Islam. This is the conclusion of an important forthcoming new book about ISIS by terrorism experts J.M. Berger and Jessica Stern who write that ISIS, like many other ""violent apocalyptic groups, tend to see themselves as participating in a cosmic war between good and evil, in which moral rules do not apply."" This also similar to the conclusion of an excellent new cover story about ISIS in the Atlantic magazine by Graeme Wood who writes, ""Virtually every major decision and law promulgated by the Islamic State (another name for ISIS) adheres to what it calls, in its press and pronouncements, and on its billboards, license plates, stationery, and coins, 'the Prophetic methodology,' which means following the prophecy and example of Muhammad, in punctilious detail. Muslims can reject the Islamic State; nearly all do. But pretending that it isn't actually a religious, millenarian group, with theology that must be understood to be combated, has already led the United States to underestimate it."" Amen to that. ISIS members devoutly believe that they are fighting in a cosmic war in which they are on the side of good, which allows them to kill anyone they perceive to be standing in their way with no compunction. This is, of course, a serious delusion, but serious it is.","The group's atrocities have angered Americans, Jordanians and Egyptians .
Bergen: ISIS actions only make sense if you realize that its aim is the apocalypse."
"Syria is burning -- scorched for nearly a year by tenacious political resistance, a merciless security crackdown and cries for democracy. The spark that lit the flame began about a year ago in the southern city of Daraa after the arrests of at least 15 children for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school. The community's blunt outrage over the children's arrests and mistreatment, the government's humiliating and violent reactions to their worries, and the people's refusal to be cowed by security forces emboldened and helped spread the Syrian opposition. Fate of neighborhood uncertain . Daraa soon became a rallying cry across the country for what began as a rural and provincial-driven uprising. Syrians compare the dramatic dynamics in the rural city to the moment Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi torched himself in December 2010. Bouazizi's act and death spawned demonstrations that led to the grassroots ouster of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and fueled other protests across the Arab world. Mohamed Masalmeh -- a Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Syrian activist whose family hails from Daraa -- said Daraa residents broke the people's ""wall of fear"" by defying what he and others call a police state and taking to the street. ""What people did in Daraa was unheard of,"" he said. Omar Almuqdad, a journalist from Daraa now living in Turkey, said, ""They started protesting day after day."" ""It was the flame of the revolution."" A slow burn into a firestorm . Discontent in Syria has slow-burned for decades. A clampdown on a a Muslim Brotherhood uprising by the current president's predecessor and father -- President Hafez Assad -- killed thousands in Hama in 1982. When Bashar al-Assad took the presidency after his father died in 2000, he gave lip service to reforms. But activists who emerged from the so-called Damascus Spring after the death of Hafez and those in 2005 who urged reforming what they said was an ""authoritarian, totalitarian and cliquish regime"" found themselves in trouble with the authorities. There was sectarian and ethnic unrest in the last decade, too, with a Druze uprising flaring in 2000 and a Kurdish rebellion erupting in 2004. When the Arab Spring unfolded last year, Syrians imbibed the contagious revolutionary fervor spreading across the Middle East. But the anger smoldered under the surface because of the Goliath-sized, all-seeing and all-knowing security and spying apparatus. Protests popped up in Syria as video images of public defiance in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia swept the world -- small outpourings seen by observers as tests to build a Syrian nerve to take to the streets. And then -- Daraa. Remote Daraa sits just a few miles from the Jordanian border. It has had its economic struggles, such as drought and drops in subsidies and salaries. Nevertheless, it had been a reliable bastion of support for the regime and its Baath party. Tribal and predominantly Sunni, Daraa is like many small towns. People know one another and the relationships are close in the city and in the nearby villages and towns. When the schoolchildren were arrested in late February 2011, they were accused of scrawling graffiti on a school that said ""the people want to topple the regime."" Masalmeh, the activist, said security went to a school, interrogated students and rounded up suspects. It wasn't as if this vandalism was rare. Such graffiti was becoming so common in the region that ID was needed to buy spray cans. But these arrests struck a chord. Residents found out their boys were being beaten and tortured in prison. The families of the boys approached authorities and asked for their sons' release. Activists and observers say authorities shunned and insulted the people. One official reportedly said: ""Forget your children. If you really want your children, you should make more children. If you don't know how to make more children, we'll show you how to do it."" ""At some point, the insult is so far below the belt. People do respond to it. They just don't bow down anymore,"" Amnesty International's Neil Sammonds said. Protests grow . On March 16, a female-led sit-in in Damascus demanded the release of prisoners unfairly jailed. Some of the participants were Daraans, with strong ties back to their home province, and part of the educated, urbanite youth living in Damascus. ""Police dragged protesters by the hair and beat them,"" said Mohja Kahf, a novelist, professor and activist in Arkansas with contacts across Syria. ""This built on the gathering outrage over the Daraa children who are prisoners,"" A day later, a sit-in in Daraa, with some detained. The next day, on March 18, a protest against the arrests of the children, according to The Human Rights Watch. ""Security forces opened fire, killing at least four protesters and within days, the protests grew into rallies that gathered thousands of people,"" the group said. Activists regard these as the first deaths in the Syrian uprising. People began rallying in other cities across Syria that day -- Jassem, Da'el, Sanamein and Inkhil. Kahf said the government responded with live fire only in Daraa. But the more people demonstrated in Daraa, the tougher security forces cracked down. And as the crackdown worsened, the more resolute the protesters became. The people in Daraa ""didn't want to go against the regime,"" Masalmeh said. ""People thought this guy -- Bashar -- was better than his dad. Nobody wanted to go face-to-face with him. ""It's not like they fought with arms at that moment,"" he said. ""They were just defiant. 'All that we want is our children.' "" The youths were eventually freed, but YouTube videos and demonstrations were already spreading. Al-Assad addressed the Daraa unrest in a March 30 speech before lawmakers, blaming the unrest on sedition. ""They started in the governorate (province) of Daraa,"" al-Assad said, adding ""the conspirators took their plan to other governorates."" ""That speech had a catastrophic impact,"" the International Crisis Group's Peter Harling said. ""People who wanted to support the regime at the time were shocked by the speech."" The dismissiveness of al-Assad and the lawmakers who applauded his words awakened many Syrian people, says the Human Rights Watch's Nadim Houry. Two days later, weekly anti-government protests began across Syria. Calls for reforms soon morphed into calls for the removal of the al-Assad regime. ""Courage is contagious,"" Houry said. The government launched a full-scale siege on Daraa April 25, with other towns such as Homs to follow. Mass arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country. The protest movement grew and solidified into an opposition. Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, points out ""it's conceivable that if the events didn't happen in Daraa,"" the uprising ""might not have occurred."" But the deep-seated political and economic reasons underlining Syrian discontent was an omen. Protest in Syria was ""going to happen"" at some point, Salem said. So, out of Daraa, a spark. And a year later, the uprisings blaze on. ""The impact of small events on history can be huge,"" Salem said.","The Syrian protests began in the southern city of Daraa .
School children were arrested for anti-government graffiti .
A year later, the protests have spread throughout the country ."
"(CNN)One icy Sunday afternoon in January, 17-year-old Molly Bair's father drove her to the local indoor tennis courts in suburban Philadelphia to hit a few balls with a high school friend. That night, she would be on a train to New York for a photo shoot; and a week later, on a plane to Paris for the haute couture catwalks. The unlikely itinerary sums up Bair's budding fashion career: a whirlwind trip from the mundane life of an American teenager to the rarefied heights of international style and back again -- accompanied by no small amount of adolescent bewilderment. ""I would never think that a girl who spent most of her childhood with a unibrow, glasses and a Yoda shirt would be in Vogue Italia,"" Bair told CNN from her parent's home, where she still resides when she's not working. At 6 feet 1 inch tall, Bair is hard to miss with her gangly stature alone. Add the high cheekbones, intense eyes, symmetrical face and prominent ears, and it's a design for constant queries about her lineage from passersby. ""People are always asking me, 'Where are you from?' And I'm like, 'America ... I'm American,' "" Bair said. But she said the features that earned her teasing nicknames like ""praying mantis"" and ""alien"" growing up have set her apart with a coveted allure in the fashion industry. ""I'm kind of, I guess, embracing that alien, rat, demon, goblin, gremlin sort of vibe and going with it,"" she said. Bair said before she started in fashion, people would often approach her at the mall to ask whether she was a model, but she never gave it serious thought, especially as she struggled with her looks as other girls matured. ""I still kind of resemble a 13-year-old boy,"" she joked. She equated modeling with commercial beauties like Victoria's Secret models with their long locks and tan, svelte forms. But on the editorial side of the spectrum, it's often the quirk that works -- and it has helped her forge an unusual bond with fellow models. ""I think it's because we're kind of a community of people who have always been the strange, tall, skinny people,"" Bair said. ""It's crazy how I've instantly found so many people who are so similar to me.  It's really weird.  I've never been able to make friends so quickly."" Bair was only discovered last July in a New York City flea market by an agent from The Society Management, who said they represented top talents like Victoria's Secret angel Adriana Lima and runway mainstay Lindsey Wixson. ""I had no idea who those people were. I thought it was a scam,"" Bair said. Still, she took the agent's email address and allowed her to take some quick head shots before laughing it off with friends. After realizing that the agency was not only legitimate but one of the top agencies in the country through a quick online search, she and her mother traveled back up to New York a week later -- and ""everything started to happen."" In less than a year, she's walked for major-league designers like Chanel, Alexander Wang, Proenza Schouler, Prada and Giambattista Valli, as well as appeared in Vogue Italia, W Magazine and a campaign for American brand Coach. But there's still a learning curve, especially for someone who three months ago was filling out college applications and thinking about majoring in computer science or a career in environmental lobbying. ""I wore heels one time before fashion.  And it was at my eighth grade graduation, and they were platforms ... and I actually fell down the stairs.  So I've always had a kind of very unhealthy relationship with heels,"" Bair said. But beyond the superficial, Bair said the career has given her a new look on acceptance, an odd take to hear in an industry that's often criticized for its unrealistic beauty standards. ""I think being a model and being in fashion has really opened up my eyes to beauty in general. I think that beauty really comes from uniqueness.""","Molly Bair is a model to watch during New York Fashion Week .

"(CNN)Last week, in an unusually public display of campaign discord, a clash between Hillary Clinton political operatives erupted in full view when David Brock, a liberal activist and staunch Clinton supporter, announced his resignation from the board of Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton super PAC. Brock was not going quietly. His resignation letter contained a bold claim -- that leaders at Priorities USA were feeding newsgroups devastating stories about his fundraiser, undermining his ability to raise money. By Brock's account, his colleagues within Team Hillary were orchestrating his demise. Setting aside a debate on the accuracy of Brock's assertion, there's an interesting psychological perspective to be raised about why campaign squabbles like this are already cropping up for the Clinton campaign and why we can expect more of them. Unlike her competitors on the Republican side, Clinton is the clear frontrunner for Democrats. And while intuitively we might expect that fewer primary contenders would allow Clinton to snatch up her party's most talented consultants, enabling her to form a stronger, more disciplined campaign team, research suggests that too much talent in a group can actually undermine performance. We often assume that adding more talented players to a team will lead to better outcomes. But a close look at the data reveals a different story. Last year, a research team led by Roderick Swaab, professor of organizational behavior at INSEAD, released a paper looking at the relationship between the percentage of stars on an NBA team and the team's win-loss record. The results were striking. A greater concentration of stars did predict more wins, but only up to a point. As it turned out, the teams with the most stars performed dramatically worse than those with considerably less talent. (Think 2004 Los Angeles Lakers, whose roster included likely hall-of-famers Shaquille O'Neil, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Gary Payton, being nearly swept in the finals by the Detroit Pistons -- a team whose best-known player was Ben Wallace.) And it's not just basketball. When Swaab and his colleagues turned their attention to World Cup soccer teams, they found results that were eerily comparable. Once again, too much talent predicted fewer wins. Researchers at Harvard Business School discovered a similar pattern among Wall Street analysts. When star performers are grouped together, they produce reports that clients find less impressive than teams with a more diverse pool of analysts. All of which raises an obvious question: Why are so many talent-heavy teams falling short? The reason is simple. Top performers are accustomed to status, and status is a limited resource. When stars are pooled together, they tend to compete with one another for status, and that competition is distracting. It gets in the way of effective teamwork. Hillary Clinton's unparalleled political clout has cleared the field among Democrats, giving her the opportunity to build a political all-star team. But paradoxically, having unrestricted access to top-notch operatives might be a significant weakness. There's a tipping point for talent. And Team Hillary may be on the wrong side of it. So what can you do when you have a talent-heavy team and need to ensure collaboration? Recent studies on the psychology of teamwork offer insights that can help any group collaborate more effectively. Here are a few that may help the Clinton's team establish a more cohesive unit. The first tip: Establish a very clear hierarchy. Clinton has resisted officially declaring her candidacy, which is sound strategy considering that she's the favorite. However, given the high-powered makeup of her team, a lack of formal hierarchy early on can be problematic in the long term. When structure is wanting and power is up for grabs, competition and status conflicts arise more easily. A related insight: Provide differentiated roles to team members, right at the start. We work better with others when our job is unique and doesn't overlap with others' responsibilities. Too much similarity between jobs leads to competition, which can hinder collaboration. The Washington Post recently reported that some senior staff members are signing on without salary, start date or job descriptions. Presidential campaigns are short and intense, and no one expects a formal HR orientation process. Yet bringing people on without specifying their roles neglects getting their buy-in and makes it more likely they'll reach beyond their prescribed function later on. Finally, when working with a talent-rich team, instead of simply rewarding individual performance, it's wise to establish group goals that can only be achieved when teammates band together. Group goals force people to view their success as a function of their team's performance, which is critical. As Swaab, lead author of the ""too much talent effect"" research puts it, when dealing with a team of all-stars, ""the bottom line is you have to create a more cooperative mindset."" There's little question that Clinton's campaign team will be among the most experienced and talent-rich in the history of politics.

"The Australian prime minister's hard-line plan to throw foreign fighters and ISIS supporters into maximum security prison is finally coming to fruition. The country's parliament passed the controversial Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill on Thursday, which will make it easier for police and security agencies to apprehend alleged terrorist suspects (and supporters) and detain them without explanation, potentially leading to lengthy prison sentences. The new legislation is designed to inhibit would-be fighters from traveling overseas to join conflicts. It will also subject foreign fighters and individuals who have been in conflict areas to a range of controls upon their return to Australia. The laws will also incarcerate individuals who ""advocate terrorism."" In reality, the laws lower the threshold for arresting people on alleged terrorism offenses and will potentially lead to innocent individuals being arrested and detained. New law 'counterproductive' Australia's approach is contradictory to other national governments' anti-terrorism tactics and may actually be counterproductive. Its new legislation could increase the risk of terrorism by further alienating marginalized youth who have toyed with the idea of associating with terrorists or committing violent acts in the name of ISIS. The Danish government, for example, is developing diversionary programs that see some foreign fighters handled on a case-by-case basis and potentially offered rehabilitation without prison time. In the UK, terror suspects could be placed under a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims), which will force some to engage in de-radicalization programs. Tpims are court orders that place restrictions on the movements and activities of suspects where there is insufficient evidence to bring charges. Both of these programs differentiate between the types of terrorist offenders. For example, those that have committed terrorist violence; those that are preparing for an act; those that support the idea of an Islamic state but not violence; and those that claim membership for other motives. In Australia, one might only have to brag about supporting or belonging to a terrorist group to potentially end up in prison for up to five years. Playing the Australian coalition government's usual national security trump card, the laws were rushed through parliament, with inadequate time to be properly developed and scrutinized. Muslim groups, lawyers, human rights groups and academics have all urged the government to delay passing the legislation due to human rights issues, to no avail. 'No go' zones . The new legislation targets Australians who engage in conflicts in foreign countries and seek to return home, and criminalizes travel to areas designated by Australia's Foreign Minister as ""no go"" zones on the grounds that a terrorist organization operates within it. The designation power is broad and allows the proscription of entire countries or regions spanning two or more countries. The offense carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. Given their breadth, the laws do not merely affect foreign fighters but also, potentially, people who may have traveled to designated areas for a range of other reasons -- such as visiting or caring for families, performing humanitarian aid work, or undertaking official or journalistic duties. Advocating terrorism . The new laws also make it an offense to ""advocate terrorism"" with offenders potentially facing lengthy jail terms if they ""counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act."" Prior to the new legislation, authorities ""had to 'believe' a terror crime was about to be committed"". Under the new legislation, police only ""have to 'suspect' a crime is to be committed to be able to detain and charge someone."" Police could now act the moment people start advocating terrorism, effectively implying that they are guilty well before the reality of a violent crime being committed. The Australian teenager Abdullah Elmir, who recently appeared in a YouTube video released by ISIS threatening Australian and allied nations, is one of the targets of the new legislation. But other cases may be less clear. Within the group of ISIS supporters here in Australia, it isn't hard to come across some marginalized Muslim youth who simply claim to support ISIS. However, the depth of their radicalization is shallow and they appear naive about the real conditions of conflict and Islamic State violence. Like many other defiant teenagers, being part of a gang or group of any type can provide protection and a sense of belonging. While such cases might look like instances of advocating terrorism, in reality, their relationship to terrorism is superficial. Teenagers pledging allegiance to ISIS seems merely to serve as a way to lift their social standing among their networks, at school or in their community. In their minds, such claimed allegiance makes them strong and invincible. It would be fair to say that their claims of support for ISIS comes with little consideration for its wider consequences, such as potentially ending up in the judicial system. Caution needed . Among those who have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq, many may have not liked what they have witnessed and want to return to Australia. Not all will come back as hardened terrorists. There will be some that have already disengaged from supporting ISIS because they have been disillusioned by what they have seen in Syria or Iraq. There will be others who have traveled to fight to support their Muslim brothers but who pose no threat to Australia and still consider themselves Australian. Given such wide differentiation, the Australian government must be careful in the development of its anti-terrorism legislation not to lump everyone in the same basket. Not everyone sympathetic to ISIS goes on to become a violent extremist, nor have they all committed violent acts. For supporters who stayed at home, the main objective should be to divert them from police attention, the courts and incarceration. Diversion, not jail . Returnees who have broken Australian law will, no doubt, enter the judicial system. However, they should be dealt with fairly and humanely and not simply given, as Australia's prime minister would have it, mandatory and lengthy maximum security prison terms of isolation. Like the Danish and UK governments, the Australian government should take heed and direct more focus to developing diversionary programs to keep young offenders away from the judicial system, rather that creating new laws to make it easier to incarcerate them. The Australian government should also look at developing prison-based intervention programs to deal with those who have committed acts of violence. For all its posturing and claims of strengthening the country, the Australian government's actions display a timidity its Danish and UK counterparts do not. Simply locking young people away for a long time does nothing to show a nation's strength. Unless we try to understand and address the root cause of young Australians radicalizing, the problem is unlikely to go away and Australia will continue to be under ""high"" threat.","Australian parliament passes Foreign Fighter's Bill to introduce stiff penalties .

"Among the targets of U.S. strikes across Syria early Tuesday was the Khorasan Group -- a collection of senior al Qaeda members who have moved into Syria. President Obama called them ""seasoned al Qaeda operatives."" ""Once again, it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people,"" Obama said. The strikes targeted ""training camps, an explosives and munitions production facility, a communication building and command and control facilities,"" the military said in a statement. The group was actively plotting against a U.S. homeland target and Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday. The United States hoped to surprise the group by mixing strikes against it with strikes against ISIS targets. The official said the group posed an ""imminent"" threat. Another U.S. official later said the threat was not imminent in the sense that there were no known targets or attacks expected in the next few weeks. The plots were believed to be in an advanced stage, the second U.S. official said. There were indications that the militants had obtained materials and were working on new improvised explosive devices that would be hard to detect, including common hand-held electronic devices and airplane carry-on items such as toiletries. The intelligence community discovered Khorasan plots against the United States within the past week, an intelligence source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The intelligence source did not give an intended target but said the plots potentially involved a bomb made of a nonmetallic device like a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material. A plot involving concealed bombs on airplanes ""was just one option they were looking at"" a U.S. official briefed on the matter told CNN's Pamela Brown. Social media video posted Tuesday purported to show the aftermath of strikes in the small town of Kafr Deryan, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Aleppo, in an area controlled by Jabhat al Nusra, the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. 'Yet another threat to the homeland' Khorasan's existence was publicly acknowledged only last week, when U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said it was operating in Iraq and Syria, with a focus on exporting terror to the West. ""There is potentially yet another threat to the homeland, yes,"" he told an intelligence conference in Washington. CENTCOM's statement spoke of ""action to disrupt the imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests"" by al Qaeda veterans in Khorasan, who had ""established a safe haven in Syria to develop external attacks, construct and test improvised explosive devices and recruit Westerners to conduct operations."" One of those veterans is believed to be Muhsin al Fadhli, a short and slight Kuwaiti who is 33 years old. A security source in the Middle East tells CNN that al Fadhli arrived in Syria in April 2013 and began working with Jabhat al Nusra. Nine months later, Clapper sounded the first warning about al Nusra's goals beyond Syria, saying it ""does have aspirations for attacks on the homeland."" At some point, al Fadhli appears to have parted company with al Nusra -- perhaps, according to the source, because it saw him as in league with Iran, where he had been based as al Qaeda's senior representative. The source says al Fadhli's new focus on ""external operations"" was revealed by one of his bodyguards, named as Abu Rama, who was recently arrested by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Train abroad, take the terror back home . The source says al Fadhli is trying to emulate the success of ISIS in using social media to recruit Westerners -- people who could be trained and then sent home to launch terror attacks. To this end, al Fadhli has been able to recruit a member of ISIS' media team to help with recruitment for Khorasan. Another key figure in Khorasan appears to be a Saudi national: Abd Al-Rahman Muhammad al Juhni. Soon after al Fadhli arrived in Syria, so did al Juhni -- ""accompanied by several individuals to participate in the fighting there,"" according to a U.S. Treasury Department designation. He was described as ""part of a group of senior al Qaeda members in Syria formed to conduct external operations against Western targets."" Al Juhni is also experienced at moving funds and had a senior position in al Qaeda in Pakistan, running its communications courier network. According to his U.S. designation, al Juhni later became al Qaeda's chief of security responsible for counterintelligence. Now on Saudi Arabia's list of its 47 most wanted terror suspects, al Juhni's skill set would be well-suited to Khorasan's purported goals. U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that the Khorasan cell may include operatives who have learned from Ibrahim al Asiri, the master bombmaker of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who has twice come close to bringing down Western airliners with ingeniously devised bombs. Counterterrorism sources have frequently told CNN in recent years of their fears that al Asiri has passed on his skills to apprentice bombmakers. Troubling ties on the Arabian Peninsula . U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has also described Khorasan as ""forward-deployed al Qaeda operatives who were engaging with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to develop a terror plot to bring down airplanes."" AQAP is based in Yemen, where al Fadhli has had contacts in the past. When he was scarcely 20, according to U.S. officials, he was involved in financing a suicide attack in October 2002 against on an oil tanker, the MV Limburg, in the Red Sea, an attack carried out by Yemenis from the city of Taiz. He also plotted an attack on a hotel in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, where American officials were known to stay. Before that, he had fought as a teenager with the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and was also ""reported to have been among the few trusted al Qaeda operatives who received advance notification"" of the 9/11 attacks, according to his designation by the U.S. Treasury Department. Al Fadhli was designated as a terrorist by the United States in 2005 as ""a major facilitator"" for al Qaeda and Abu Musab al Zarqawi, then terrorizing Iraq. He had access to plenty of money from private donors in Kuwait. According to court testimony, he had been involved in a group called the Peninsula Lions in Kuwait and had experimented with explosives while planning an attack on U.S. troops at the Arifjan Camp in Kuwait. Al Fadhli escaped. Wanted in Saudi Arabia and convicted in absentia in Kuwait, he vanished for a while before resurfacing in Iran as al Qaeda's most senior representative there. In 2012, the U.S. State Department said al Fadhli was moving fighters and money through Turkey to Syria, leveraging his extensive network of Kuwaiti jihadist donors. He also gained what may prove to be invaluable experience ""moving multiple operatives from Pakistan via Iran and Turkey to destinations in Europe, North Africa, and Syria,"" the State Department said. Just why he left Iran last year is unclear, but about the same time, other al Qaeda figures, including Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Suleiman Abu Ghaith, also began leaving Iran -- perhaps not entirely willingly. A good way for al Qaeda to counter ISIS . For al Qaeda, locked in a battle with ISIS for the crown of leading global jihad, the creation of Khorasan makes perfect sense. Just last week, a spokesman for al Qaeda confronted the group's critics in an audio message. ""So how then can al Qaeda have shrunken greatly and lost many of its senior leaders at a time when it is expanding horizontally and opening new fronts dependent on it?"" asked spokesman Hossam Abdul Raouf. He also quoted a U.S. terror analyst, Katherine Zimmerman: ""Al Qaeda affiliates have evolved and now threaten the United States as much as (if not more than) the core group; they can no longer be dismissed as mere local al Qaeda franchises."" Now -- with extensive contacts throughout the region and experience in raising funds and moving people -- al Fadhli and al Juhni have embarked on the next phase of their careers in terrorism, one that may be the most dangerous to the West. The U.S. Central Command's use of the phrase ""imminent attack planning"" may explain why the group was a first wave target. The Middle Eastern security source told CNN Sunday that al Fadhli was believed to be operating near the town of Binnish in Idlib province -- which would have put him in the general area of the airstrikes.   Still unknown: whether al Fadhli and al Juhni survived to continue that planning.","Official: Khorasan plot involving concealed bombs on airplanes ""was just one option""

"""This used to be a land of bandits, wolves and bears,"" says Daniele Kihlgren, surveying the countryside around ancient houses of Santo Stefano di Sessanio. High above the barren Gran Sasso hills in Italy's central Abruzzo region, this tiny hamlet, barely changed since medieval times, was in danger of reverting to its wild past until Kihlgren showed up with a vision. ""When I first got here on my motorbike, I was wandering, totally lost. This unspoilt place, with no traces of modernity, struck me like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus,"" he says. Kihlgren, an Italian-Swedish businessman, has since made it his life's mission to rescue such crumbling villages by turning them into high-end resorts that blend in with their surroundings. Sextantio (Via Principe Umberto, Santo Stefano di Sessanio; +39 0862 899112) in Santo Stefano is one of several so-called ""diffuse hotels"" that eschew the usual hotel model of grouping rooms and facilities under one roof. Instead, Sextantio's 29 rooms, spa, wine bar, restaurant and reception lie scattered in separate buildings formerly used as barns, stables, pigsties, wine cellars and farmers' or shepherds' lodgings. Wood and stone cottages have been restyled as suites, the village dungeons serve as a wedding room and a former witch's lair now hosts business meetings. The hotel even makes use of a medieval brothel. Santo Stefano di Sessanio is a maze of cobbled streets, steep stone stairs, arches, vaults, gargoyles, hidden grottoes, frescoed loggias and crumbling walls covered in ivy. There are also ruins -- the remains of the houses collapsed during the 2009 earthquake that rocked nearby L'Aquila. Slaughtered pig . Kihlgren gives me the grand tour, describing his early days trying to acquire property in the hamlet -- leading to surreal situations for both him and the villagers. ""When I knocked at people's doors offering to buy their dwellings, they thought I was crazy,"" he says. ""Once a local slaughtered a pig right in front of my eyes with Bach playing in the background."" Today the village may be marginally less rustic, but Sextantio's charm lies in its sympathetic use of historic structures. At the reception, housed in a former donkey stable at the hamlet's entrance where nativity scenes are staged at Christmas, the concierge hands me the biggest and heaviest room key I've ever encountered: 30 centimeters of pure iron. ""That way you'll never lose it,"" she says. A path leads to my room -- La Bianca -- one of the closest cottages to the reception (the farthest one lies 200 meters away). I open the squeaky bolt of a heavy wooden door and enter a snug, warm room filled with the scent of embers and orange peel -- a perfume created by the hotel to evoke a typical hearth scent. Old furniture, including a spinning wheel and museum pieces, are juxtaposed with modern sculptures and sleek, luxurious bathroom facilities. Showering in the elegant white resin tub is an experience. Rinsing involves using a pitcher to collect running water from a low tap, a throwback to the past. There's no television, phone or minibar, but it's not totally offline. There's a powerful Wi-Fi signal throughout the buildings. Bird's nest . Lying back on my wrought iron king size bed, I spot an old bird's nest among the wood ceiling beams. ""This is what I call 'authentic' Italy,"" says Kihlgren. ""I wanted to restyle the buildings as we found them and bring back to life the so-called secondary human heritage: that of poor, outcast communities who for centuries stood as Italy's shame. ""That's why I kept the cracks in the walls and the fireplace hearth soot: these are layers of history. ""Sextantio is the opposite of colonialist tourism. Clients here want to discover the village identity and mingle with locals."" Outside, in the center of the hamlet, silence rules. No cars are allowed. Just 50 residents still live here and, walking around, I come across elderly women sitting on doorsteps and art restorers at work. Occasionally a passerby looks at me shyly, but greets me with a hello. ""Even when the hotel is fully booked you'll feel on your own,"" says Annunziata Taraschi, who has an unusual job as Sextantio's anthropologist, collecting the village's oral tradition and lost customs. While that might be great for guests, locals aren't so sure. ""It's one thing coming here as a visitor, and another living here"" says Dina Rusciolelli, owner of La Bettola di Geppetto, the village tavern. ""After a while you can go nuts."" There are no complaints about the food though -- a mix of gourmet and traditional. Sitting at the scarred wooden tables of the Cantinone, a large dining room 50 meters from reception, Franco Cannioli serves me pan bagnato -- a dish of bread and vegetables -- with cured meats, lentil soup, pecorino cheese, pears and nuts. Bloodsucking witches . There's a glass of Montepulciano di Abruzzo red wine on the table. Evening meals are taken in La Locanda Sotto gli Archi, the hotel's grotto restaurant located on the other side of the hamlet where chef Simone Iezzi serves a daily changing menu that includes signature dishes like ricotta cheese ravioli, pork chops and fried breaded porcini mushrooms. After an afternoon nap, I'm greeted in the hotel's tea room and craft shop by Giovanna Fiorenzi, who sits at an old spinning frame making wool carpets, bed covers and giving weaving lessons to guests. She also spins a few old tales, telling me about spirits haunting the woods and witches who suck the blood of crying babies. She serves licorice and artichoke herbal tea alongside traditional Ferratelle waffles. She also makes Genziana, a sweet and sour alcoholic drink made from Gentian roots. There's a crystal bottle of Genziana and a crackling fire waiting for me when I get back to my room in evening. The next morning I'm woken by birdsong and light filtering through small, wooden-framed windows. Breakfast is a buffet table laden with homemade yogurt, pies, ricotta cheese and a ham leg over in the restaurant. It's fine to wander over there before getting ready for the day to savor one of the great treats of these hamlet hotels.

"Hong Kong (CNN)The captain of a Hong Kong passenger ferry has been sentenced to eight years in jail for his role in a fatal collision that left 39 people dead in 2012 - the city's worst maritime disaster in four decades. Lai Sai-ming was sentenced at the city's High Court on Monday. A jury on Saturday had found him guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter and endangering the lives of others at sea. Chow Chi-wai, the captain of the other vessel, which was owned by the Hong Kong Electric Company and had been carrying company employees and their families to watch a scheduled fireworks display, was sentenced to nine months in jail. He was found guilty of endangering lives, but not manslaughter. Survivors recount chaos, horror of ferry collision . In sentencing,  judge Brian Keith said that Lai's actions were not minor errors of judgment or momentary lapses of distraction but ""fell way below the standard of professionalism"" required in Hong Kong's busy waters. Lai failed to keep a proper lookout and take any effective steps to avoid a collision, according to court documents. The judge agreed with the prosecutor's view that Lai didn't see the other vessel before the crash. In mitigation, the judge noted that both captains had suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and were haunted by what happened that night, but said ""it cannot be compared to what was suffered by those who lost their families in the tragedy."" Thirty nine people, including eight children, were killed after the two vessels collided near Lamma Island, on October 1, 2012. Survivors described how the collision upended one of the vessels, flinging passengers into the water. Rescuers picked up 123 survivors but at least 92 passengers were injured in the incident. Passengers on board the ferries said how they had only moments to escape. The narrow sea lanes leading into Hong Kong's main deepwater harbor are some of the busiest in Asia, with giant commercial freighters, ocean liners, passenger ferries and private boats of all sizes sharing the water. Hong Kong is home to more than 200 outlying Islands, including Lamma. The collision was Hong Kong's most lethal maritime accident since 1971, when 88 people died after the ferry Fat Shan capsized between Hong Kong and Macau during a typhoon.","Hong Kong ferry captain found guilty of manslaughter .

"Bobby Smith's mother, like all parents, looked forward to the day when her baby could use words to tell her what was wrong. What hurts? Why are you sad? By the time Bobby turned 7, Cheri Smith was still wondering if that day would ever come. Her son had been diagnosed on the moderate-to-severe end of the autism spectrum as a toddler. He had ways of conveying his needs -- he'd give Smith or her husband the remote control if he wanted to watch TV, or hand his mom her purse if he wanted to go out -- but there were so many things he couldn't communicate. He ""cannot tell us if something hurts, why he is upset or happy, where he would like to go, what happened at school today, what he would like to do for his birthday, what he would like Santa to bring him for Christmas,"" Smith wrote on CNN iReport in March 2012. The older he grew, the worse Bobby's behavior was getting. He would fly into rages, which Smith believed were in part the result of his inability to effectively communicate his feelings and to understand what others were telling him. Desperate for help, in April 2012, Smith found a behavioral therapist who would change their family's life. Bobby turns 10 next month and is a totally different boy now, she said. ""She knew that Bobby had the ability to talk,"" Smith said in a recent update. ""She pushed Bobby like none of us had before."" Wherever they fall on the spectrum, people with autism often struggle with communication. They can have trouble developing language skills or fail to understand nonverbal communication through things like eye contact and facial expressions. Parents, therapists and those with autism themselves described a gamut of communication techniques that have helped. Besides working on actual talking, some have found success with picture card systems, sign language or printed words; others speak through stuffed animals or video game characters. 'Learn to speak our language' Kat Muir, 26, works as a speech-language pathologist in Indianapolis, bridging the communication gap. Most of the children she works with have Autism Spectrum Disorder -- like herself. Muir was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at age 22 when she was in graduate school and still not making friends. She was always adept at using words, but was challenged by social communication. It was particularly hard in junior high. ""Girls are expected to know instinctively how to be social, and when they don't, it is very obvious,"" she said. For years, she thought of a conversation ""as a contest to see who could say the most interesting thing."" She remembers one time when some girls were talking about Britney Spears; she jumped in with her own contribution, saying something like, ""Planes in World War I had synchronized guns so the gunmen didn't shoot their own propellers off."" No one cared. And they told her so. It got better when she moved to a big public high school, where students seemed more tolerant of differences. Now she reminds herself to talk about what other people like, not just what she finds interesting. She said it helps to find an activity ""that encourages communication but doesn't force it."" For her, that's dance class. ""It's reassuring to know that I will see familiar faces for an hour at the same time every week. I may socialize by starting a conversation about favorite dance moves, or I may exchange smiles with someone because we're doing what we love. The more structured a social interaction is, the more comfortable it is."" To those without autism, said Muir, ""Everyone with autism has something to say. Learn to speak our language, and we will learn to speak yours."" Power of a pig . California speech-language pathologist Lois Jean Brady agrees. As a certified autism specialist, she advises parents to use their child's special interests -- animals, music, technology or cars, for instance -- to build their language. ""Go into their world and slowly lead them to yours,"" she said. With students who love animals, Brady uses a potbellied pig named Buttercup to communicate. She has found many children feel comfortable talking with an animal and some have said their first words to Buttercup. She tells the story of a junior high school student who desperately wanted friends. She rehearsed a few answers to ""common pig questions"" such as ""What does he eat?"" and ""How much does he weigh?"" then sent the young man into the school hallway with Buttercup on a leash. ""It was not long before he was surrounded by other students, mostly girls, answering questions with a smile from ear to ear. A couple of the students remained friends,"" she said. Brady's own son is on the autism spectrum. He is now 20 years old, goes to college and works with other special needs children. When he was younger, he and his mother would spend hours in the living room, lining up toy cars. ""I kept the cars in a large bucket and if he wanted one he had to ask for it,"" Brady said. ""Initially it was just 'car,' then 'blue car,' then 'shiny blue car,' building language one car at a time."" More cookies? It has taken about two years for Emily Ferguson's son Sammy to learn to use cards with pictures to communicate. The 8-year-old has severe autism, and speaks about three to seven words a month. He can't tell his mother when he's in pain, and she would give anything to have a conversation with him. But she celebrates that he is able to communicate about 30 food requests and 16 nonfood requests (play, go outside, etc.) through pictures. ""I was tickled when Sammy realized he had no limit to the amount of times he could request cookies. For the first time, I felt like a 'normal' mother, because I had a child who was asking for something he wanted repeatedly, and he was getting the same answer ('No.'),"" Ferguson wrote in an e-mail. ""It has been an amazing experience to see Sammy go from just crying to using pointing to giving others picture cards on sentence strips."" Ferguson prays Sammy will find the communication tools that work best for him, ""and that he will be able to share his thoughts and emotions with those around him. Until that day, I want the world to understand that my child is worth respecting, loving and cherishing."" Talking at 9 . Cheri Smith's son, Bobby, knew about 50 words by the time he was 9, but his main form of communication was taking his parents by the hand to what he wanted. A behavioral therapist near their West Virginia home helped Smith understand that their son was physically capable of speaking more, with practice. For the first six months, therapist Sharon Holbert worked with Bobby on sitting properly in his seat, keeping his hands folded on the table (instead of hitting her) and his feet in front of him (instead of kicking her). There was a close link between behavior and talking: As he learned how to stay calm, he was able to learn more; as he became better at communicating, he grew more relaxed, Holbert said. ""If you have a student who's hitting and screaming and kicking, you can't teach them anything. Once you get them to a place where they're ready to learn, then bam, you can do something,"" said Holbert, a board-certified behavior analyst. ""His ability to learn was there. I think he figured out 'if I hit people, they probably will leave me alone.'"" As they worked on identifying colors, numbers or letters, Holbert wouldn't acknowledge his response as correct unless he said it verbally. Smith copied the model at home. ""If he wanted any food items, if he wanted a particular TV show that he liked, if he wanted to go outside, he had to ask verbally or he didn't get his want,"" Smith said. ""Quickly it was just easier for him to say the word than it was to throw a fit."" He can now verbally identify letters, colors, animals and some shapes, count up to 20 and say about 100 vocabulary words. He can answer simple questions and has gone from using single words to short sentences like, ""I want rice cakes please,"" or mostly complete sentences like, ""I want swim at the beach."" ""We went from being a family where our child was physically aggressive and having constant meltdowns to one that is enjoying experiencing the world through Bobby's eyes."" He also has his own unique language, which his parents have come to appreciate, too. Bobby loves to go for car rides. When he wants his mom to turn down a particular road, ""he will put on his own turn signal. He clicks his tongue and makes it sound exactly like a car's turn signal, and that is how I have known where he wants to go.""","Autism comes with communication struggles .

"British aid worker David Haines has been executed by ISIS militants, according to a video posted Saturday to a website associated with the group, making him the third Western captive to be killed by the Islamist extremist group in recent weeks. The ISIS video post showing Haines' beheading called his execution ""a message to the allies of America."" It is produced very similarly to the videos that showed the executions of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the last of which included Haines and the threat that he'd be killed next. The new video pictures a masked ISIS militant placing his hand on another captive, whom he identified as Alan Henning, a British citizen. In a tweet, British Prime Minister David Cameron called ""the murder of David Haines"" an ""act of pure evil."" Cameron added, ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes."" Haines offers brief scripted comments on the video, as does the man who kills him. Directing his remarks at Britain, the executioner -- who sounds like the man who killed Foley and Sotloff -- says, ""Your evil alliance with America, which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam, will only accelerate your destruction and claim the role of the obedient lap dog. ""Cameron will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war."" Retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona -- an Air Force veteran intelligence officer and CNN military analyst  -- surmised that if ISIS planned to dissuade Britain for teaming up with the United States, the group will be disappointed. ""ISIS has just guaranteed British cooperation with the Americans on all phases of what we're going to be doing,"" Francona said. ""... I think this is now a Western fight; it's not just a U.S. fight."" ISIS execution videos strikingly similar . Brother: Haines 'just another bloke' who lived to help others . News of the gruesome killing came the same day that the 44-year-old Haines' family released a brief message to his captors through the British Foreign Office. In it, the family says, ""We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us."" Haines' face became known to the world in the ISIS video, released September 2, in which he looks forward and kneels as a masked ISIS militant stands behind him. The militant says in that video, ""We take this opportunity to warn those governments who've entered this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone."" British officials said after the video's release that they had sent troops to try to rescue an unidentified British citizen ""some time ago,"" but failed. They released no other details. Mike Haines, in a statement early Sunday, through the British Foreign Office, noted that his brother leaves behind two children and his wife Dragana. He described his brother as ""just another bloke"" whose ""childhood was centered around our family"" and who was ""brought up to know right from wrong."" David Haines worked for the Royal Mail, then joined the Royal Air Force. He later worked with the United Nations in the Balkans, where ""he helped whoever needed help, regardless of race, creed or religion,"" according to his brother. ""During this time, David began to decide that humanitarian work was the field he wanted to work in,"" Mike Haines said. ""... David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles."" After working for ScotRail, David Haines went on to get a job as a logistics and security manager for the Paris-based humanitarian Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development. He was abducted in March 2013 near a refugee camp in Atmeh, Syria, where he was working to arrange for the delivery of humanitarian aid to people staying at the camp. He had previously worked on aid operations for victims of conflict in the Balkans, African and other parts of the Middle East, according to an ACTED spokesman. ""His joy and anticipation for the work he (did) in Syria is, for myself and family, the most important element of this whole sad affair,"" Mike Haines said. ""He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly."" British hostage of ISIS was helping displaced Syrians, aid group says . Obama: U.S. 'stands shoulder-to-shoulder' with Britain . Another hostage has been publicly killed by ISIS. Another one's life has been threatened. And fighters for ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State, in a nod to its efforts to establish a vast caliphate in the Middle East under its strict version of Sharia law -- are continuing to kill innocent civilians in Iraq and Syria. So what's next? The threat from ISIS has been brewing for some time. Having begun a decade ago as al Qaeda in Iraq -- only to be disowned earlier this year by al Qaeda, the group behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, for its heavy-handed tactics -- ISIS has taken advantage of instability in Syria and Iraq to become one of the most prominent and feared groups in the Middle East. ISIS, which is also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL, managed to become one of the most successful rebel groups working to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It also rampaged through much of Iraq, thwarting seemingly overmatched Iraqi troops and massacring those who did not subscribe to its extreme version of Islam. It wasn't until last month -- albeit before Foley's killing -- that the American military jumped into the fray. ""It's a bit like trying to predict an earthquake: You can see pressure building up on the fault lines but not knowing when it's going to materialize (or how) quickly it can disintegrate,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Saturday night. ""Those things are very hard to predict."" Partnering with the Iraqi military and Kurdish fighters, U.S. warplanes have been striking ISIS targets in Iraq regularly since August 8. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama announced that U.S. airstrikes would go after the extremist group in Syria, and perhaps beyond. ""We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" said Obama, who insisted American troops wouldn't fight ""on foreign soil,"" though they will play support roles. ""That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."" The President vowed the United States won't do it alone. To this end, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Egypt on Saturday seeking that country's help in the fight against ISIS. Britain is one country, at least, that has stepped up -- even before Haines' killing. That includes providing ""urgent military support"" at the Iraqi government's request, including heavy machine guns, body armor and nearly half a million rounds of ammunition to Kurdish fighters known as the Peshmerga. The scale of that support, though, could ramp up now with one Briton executed and Henning's life in limbo. To this end, 10 Downing Street announced early Sunday that Cameron will convene an emergency meeting of his top security officials to discuss what Britain will do next. Obama released a statement late Saturday after what he called Haines' ""barbaric murder,"" offering his support for the aid worker's family and his native Britain. ""The United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve,"" the President said. ""We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.""

"More than 20 Syrian rebel commanders, including members of Christian opposition groups, have signed off on what they called a historic agreement to unite in the fight against ISIS and President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The deal came out of a meeting Thursday in Turkey facilitated by staff from the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Washington-based Syrian Emergency Task Force. Two U.S. congressmen sat in on the final negotiations between the groups, just days after Congress signed off on President Barack Obama's call to arm and train moderate rebels to fight ISIS. Under the agreement, moderate Muslim rebel groups fighting under the Supreme Military Council of Syria agreed to form an alliance with the predominantly Christian Syriac Military Council. It marks the first meeting between Syrian rebels and members of Congress since Obama announced the new policy. Envisioning a free Syria . The agreement calls for the groups to work together to assure any free Syria will be inclusive of all ethnic, religious and political parties. While the group called it historic, it may at this stage be only a symbolic gesture given that these groups are already fighting alongside each other against al-Assad's forces and ISIS. Among the groups that met with Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. George Holding, R-North Carolina, was the Supreme Military Council of Syria and the Syriac Military Council, made up of Christians. CNN was the only news agency present at the meeting. It is unclear when the groups might receive the arms and training they've been promised. It's also unclear if all of the groups present will benefit. This is not the first time that groups opposed to ISIS have agreed to fight together. Previous efforts faltered, sometimes over ethnic and religious divides. U.S.-led airstrikes on ISIS in Syria: Who's in, who's not . While the Supreme Military Council of Syria includes the Free Syrian Army, which is considered one of the leading moderate forces, there are questions about other members of the alliance. The Syrian Revolutionary Front reportedly signed a deal with ISIS in one suburb in Damascus, and another -- the Hazzam group -- put out a statement this week condemning U.S. airstrikes. ""Well, I think the question has been answered,"" said Khalid Saleh, the spokesman for the National Coalition for Syria. How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria . He said the Free Syrian Army brigades, which have been receiving aid for months, have been vetted, and he called for an increase in the flow of aid and support to them. Airstrikes are not enough . The rebel groups told CNN that coalition airstrikes against ISIS targets were not enough. The strikes must also hit al-Assad's forces, they said. ""This is a partial strategy. It's a containment policy that did not work and will not work,"" Saleh said. ""We need to deal with this problem at its root cause:  Assad, the gangs that support him and ISIS. Those are the three problems every Syrian deals with."" The groups were also critical of the way the strikes were being carried out. ""We also delivered a message how Syrians are upset about the killing of civilians from these strikes,"" said Abdul al-Bashir, head of the Supreme Military Council. How far does ISIS' global reach extend? Notably absent at the meetings, but very present on the Syrian battlefield, were jihadist groups who have also been fighting ISIS and al-Assad's government, including the Islamic Front and the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. The groups have been blacklisted and sidelined by the United States, but critics have said cutting them out will weaken the effectiveness of the coalition on the ground. ""We do want to make sure that we don't put weapons in the hands of the wrong people,"" Kinzinger told CNN.

"Running back Ray Rice was released by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL on Monday, the same day a shocking video surfaced showing the NFL star knocking out his future wife with a punch in February. The news release from the Ravens was terse. ""The Baltimore Ravens terminated the contract of RB Ray Rice this afternoon,"" it read. Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday night that the team had not seen the video before it was released online by TMZ. ""It was something we saw for the first time today, all of us. It changed things, of course. It made things a little bit different,"" he said. Harbaugh said he and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome called Rice to inform him of the decision. He declined to discuss what Rice said or how he reacted. ""I have nothing but hope and goodwill for Ray and Janay (now his wife),"" Harbaugh added. ""And we'll do whatever we can going forward to help them as they go forward and try to make the best of it."" Shortly after the team's announcement, the league said the three-time Pro Bowl selection was suspended indefinitely. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who had originally given Rice a two-game ban, increased the suspension after viewing the new video for the first time, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said on Twitter. The NFL players' union didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. CNN also tried unsuccessfully to contact Rice's agent. The person who answered the phone at Todd France's office said France wasn't in. Former teammate and ESPN analyst Ray Lewis said he had texted with Rice on Monday. Lewis, who played with the Ravens from 1996 to 2012, said on ""Monday Night Countdown"" that he will meet with Rice soon to counsel and mentor him. ""I want to sit down and I want to know what is going on in his heart,"" said Lewis. In a press conference in July, Rice said his actions were ""inexcusable"" and that he and his wife were in counseling. The couple married on March 28. ""We're taking the necessary steps to move forward,"" he said. ""My job is to lead my family. My job is to lead my wife. My job is to lead in whatever I do. And If I'm not being the example, then my family crumbles."" Before Rice, 27, can play again in the NFL, any potential contract cannot be approved without further direction from the commissioner, Aiello told CNN. The Canadian Football League said Monday night Rice is ineligible to play in the CFL while he is suspended by the NFL. Reactions pour in . Video shows what happened inside elevator . The new video shows Rice punching Janay Palmer, who was his fiancee at the time, inside an elevator at a hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, seven months ago. TMZ Sports posted the video Monday showing Rice and Palmer entering an elevator. Inside the elevator, Rice punches Palmer. Palmer lunges after Rice, and then Rice hits her again and she falls to the floor. Previously, TMZ Sports had released hotel surveillance video of Rice dragging an unconscious Palmer out of the elevator. This is the first time video has been released that shows Rice punching her. A few months after the incident, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice without pay and fined him an additional game check for ""conduct detrimental to the NFL."" However, no one in the NFL offices, including Goodell, had seen the newly released footage of the incident until Monday, the league told CNN. Ray Rice: 'My actions were inexcusable' ""We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including the video from inside the elevator,"" NFL senior vice president of communications Greg Aiello said. ""That video was not made available to us and no one in our office has seen it until today."" Rice won't be prosecuted . The NFL has previously said that Rice entered a pretrial intervention program in May. Under the program, he won't be prosecuted, and the felony charge -- one count of third-degree aggravated assault --  will be expunged after one year. CNN commentator and ESPN senior writer LZ Granderson said Monday that prosecutors let a lot of people down. ""A lot of people are mad at the NFL and the Ravens. I'm mad at the judicial system that failed this woman and society at large,"" he said. ""Here you have clearly an act of violence. Clearly an act of violence. To give him a slap on the wrist, an opportunity to even have this wiped from his record, tells you how powerful money, fame and sports is in society."" Jeffrey Toobin, a senior legal analyst for CNN, said Rice's punishment was of the kind that teenagers get when they are caught spray painting graffiti. ""It is a tiny, tiny penalty that is an absolute disgrace,"" he said. ""The D.A. (office) embarrassed the country, embarrassed themselves. And Roger Goodell did an appalling job then for the NFL. But ... law enforcement was horrendous here."" Rice firing not enough, says senator who wants 'special scrutiny' of NFL . Goodell admitted punishment was too lenient . Goodell has already been scrutinized for suspending Rice for just two games, months after the first video aired. Many felt the suspension wasn't enough, and in August, the commissioner himself agreed. In a letter to all NFL team owners, he said the league had fallen short of its goals in its handling of the Rice case: ""We allowed our standards to fall below where they should be and lost an important opportunity to emphasize our strong stance on a critical issue and the effective programs we have in place."" ""I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will,"" he added. Some NFL fans have questioned why Harbaugh would call Rice ""one heck of a guy"" after the news broke and why the Ravens would tweet out in May ""Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident."" The tweet was no longer available on Monday. They have also questioned why Cleveland Browns receiver Josh Gordon would be suspended for a year after testing positive for marijuana when Rice was suspended for just two games. In his August letter to team owners, Goodell said the league will institute a six-game unpaid suspension for personnel who violate the league's personal conduct policy when it relates to domestic violence. A second domestic violence incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league. Opinion: NFL, apologize to women for Ray Rice .

"(CNN) -- At a time where former tennis greats are returning to the tour, there is one man whose presence looms large. It was always going to take something special to lure Boris Becker away from the home comforts of his family and the sanctuary of the television studio. But with one phone call and a glimpse at a man who made him think twice, the opportunity to work with Novak Djokovic was a challenge he could not resist. ""I see in Novak a little bit of Boris Becker,"" the German tells CNN's Open Court. ""I see him against Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, probably the two most popular players in the world, and he doesn't always get a fair deal from the crowd. ""It makes him work even harder and more determined to win. I see some similarities between him and a young Becker."" Becker began his partnership with Djokovic in December 2013 and was courtside when the Serb star claimed his seventh grand slam title at Wimbledon in July -- one more than his coach managed during a 15-year career. Becker, whose first of three triumphs at the All England club came as a raw teenager, was heavily criticized when he moved away from the microphone to become an integral part of Djokovic's coaching set up. His former rival Stefan Edberg joined forces with Federer around the same time, while Ivan Lendl -- another star of their era -- enjoyed a successful spell working alongside Andy Murray before they split in March. But it was Becker's arrival that caught the headlines. The 46-year-old says he could not turn down the offer -- especially given the similarities he saw between Djokovic, now 27, and his younger self. ""I live with Novak. Whenever he makes a mistake I feel that I make it too,"" Becker says. ""Whenever he hits an ace, I feel like I've hit an ace. ""I have to keep my poker face and have a very cool demeanor. He's looking at us up in the box and we have to give him confidence. ""Inside it's a volcano, I'm burning. After matches he needs to take a quiet minute to relax -- I need to take one too!"" Becker burst onto the scene by winning Wimbledon at the tender age of 17 and repeating the feat the following year, becoming known as ""Boom Boom"" for his ferocious serve-and-volley game. A U.S. Open triumph in 1989 and two Australian Open crowns capped a fine career in which he won 64 ATP titles, earning $25 million in prize money. But since his retirement in 1999, Becker's main contribution to tennis has been through his television work. It is something he enjoys immensely, his enthusiasm laid bare for all to see every time he picks up a microphone. While Becker received a couple of phone calls from players curious as to whether he would be willing to take up a coaching role, it was only once Djokovic got in touch that he began to consider moving back onto the circuit. But even then, Becker needed reassuring -- he had to know what was driving Djokovic. ""I have a pretty successful second career which is nothing to do with tennis or sport so I was already on the road for so many years, so I thought, why bother?"" he says. ""But Novak called me and I told him I felt honored. I told him I appreciated that he remembered me and that I could bring something he didn't have yet. ""I considered going back on the road but I wanted to talk to him first to see how driven he was. ""I didn't want to spend weeks with him away from my wife and kids if he wasn't driven. ""I go on the road because I want to win the majors and not being happy with the quarters or the semis. He had the same mindset and that's why I felt it was the right decision."" Becker's presence at the 2014 Australian Open sparked much interest. Djokovic, having won the title on each of his three previous visits to Melbourne Park, was dethroned by eventual winner Stan Wawrinka 9-7 in the fifth set of their quarterfinal. That result sparked skepticism over Becker's appointment, though he dismissed that as ""part of being Boris Becker."" Instead, Becker believes the defeat to Wawrinka allowed them time to assess which way they needed to go, and allowed him to begin to influence the Serbian's game -- especially the mental side. Defeats in the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S Open in 2013 and the 2014 French Open had left question marks over Djokovic's morale, but Becker believes any doubts have since been erased. ""I was known to be a pretty hard-nosed guy on court with a very strong mentality,"" he adds. ""I was a fighter's player. Maybe I wasn't the quickest or most talented but I put all my character into the match. ""Maybe that was something he was looking for. He's so talented and physically he's amazing, maybe that was the one part he was lacking. ""I think that's why we gel and get along. I have something he doesn't have, he certainly has things I don't have anymore, and I think that's a foundation of our relationship."" Djokovic will start his 2014 U.S. Open campaign next week hoping to secure a second victory at Flushing Meadows to his growing list of triumphs, having lost in the last two finals there. Since Wimbledon, and his wedding, top-ranked Djokovic has struggled in the North American hard-court swing. A heavy defeat by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Rogers Cup was followed by a shock loss against world No. 18 Tommy Robredo in Cincinnati last week -- a result which has cast doubt over whether he will be ready for the final grand slam of the season. But with Nadal ruled out of the tournament with injury, Djokovic will still be confident of reaching the final, especially with Becker by his side. ""Novak is a great student given he's someone who has won so much already,"" says Becker. ""He's been world No. 1, is a multiple grand slam winner and is a very rich man. He really wants to learn, wants to get better and be in the history books of tennis. ""He had a dream, coming from very humble beginnings. His parents gave everything for their children and he feels he has a very big responsibility to give everything he has and eventually give back to his family. ""That's what makes him tick. He's much more mature than normal 27-year-olds often come across as."" That maturity is also in evidence off the court following Djokovic's marriage to long-term girlfriend Jelena Ristic and the imminent arrival of their first child. Becker believes fatherhood will only enhance Djokovic's game and says children can have a positive effect on a player's psyche both on and off the court. ""It changed me for the better,"" says Becker, who has children by both his first and second wives. ""It changed Roger Federer for the better and gave him a new zest for life. A tennis player's life is sometimes very lonely but to have your wife and kid with you sometimes gives you a better quality of life. ""There's something to go back to after practice or a match. It gave me another three or four years on my career and I think it will do the same for Novak. ""He's a true family man. He loves his wife and family more than anything in the world, and having that addition to his family will make him a better man.""","Boris Becker says he sees a lot of Novak Djokovic in himself .

"Polls for the Syrian presidential election opened Tuesday against the backdrop of a bloody and protracted civil war. The outcome is hardly in doubt: President Bashar al-Assad is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many Western countries say has been be rigged from the start. Syria isn't renowned for holding free and fair elections. When al-Assad came to power 14 years ago, he ran unopposed, securing more than 99% of votes, according to state media. Seven years later, he won again with a similarly mountainous share of the vote. His father, Hafez al-Assad, ruled Syria with an iron fist for 29 years before he died in 2000. The Syrian regime says the election has to be held under the new constitution and shows the country is moving forward. But some analysts say the purpose of this week's vote, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged the Syrian government not to hold, is to send a message to al-Assad's opponents, both in Syria and abroad. Syria's presidential election: How fair can a vote be in a war zone? 'A coronation' ""It's a coronation of Assad, it's a celebration of his ability to survive the violent storm and basically go on the offensive,"" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. The election takes place amid a grinding three-year conflict that has killed around 150,000 people, displaced about 6.5 million within Syria and prompted almost 3 million to flee outside its borders. Voting will take place only in areas controlled by the regime. State television showed al-Assad and his wife, Asma, casting their votes at a school in Maliki, a neighborhood of Damascus. Rebels hold significant parts of the north and east of the country. There are concerns that violence could disrupt the election process, with voters wary of the threat of car bombs and shelling at polling stations within range of rebel mortars. The Islamic Front, one of the largest armed rebel groups, announced it wouldn't target election centers.  It claimed the Assad government was blackmailing people to vote in a fake election, but said it wanted to avoid civilian casualties. The British Foreign Office has said the vote ""will be a grotesque parody of democracy."" The U.S. State Department says the Assad regime has taken steps ""to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in Syria."" The regime has said election monitors from the United States, the European Union or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe won't be present, but observers from some other countries will be. War continues amid election . Warplanes bombed anti-government neighborhoods Tuesday as Syrians cast their ballots, the opposition-run Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. In the western city of Rastan, warplane shelling killed at least two people, the LCC said. And warplanes dropped at least 20 barrels packed with crude explosive devices over Daraya in the Damascus suburbs, pushing thick columns of smoke into the afternoon sky, social media video showed. The LCC also said that 28 people, including three children, were killed during voting Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the once bustling commercial capital of Aleppo, residents dropped mock ballots in a makeshift ballot box ""to withdraw the citizenship of President Bashar al-Assad,"" social media video showed Tuesday. CNN could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the videos. Syria's official election body praised what it called a high turnout of voters and said ""no problems whatsoever have been reported so far during the balloting process ongoing in Syria,"" said SANA, Syria's national news agency. Syrian state television reported that because of the high turnout at polling stations, the Higher Judicial Committee for Elections extended voting by five hours, so it will end at midnight Tuesday. Little-known challengers . One aspect of this year's election distinguishes it from the previous foregone conclusions. Al-Assad actually has people running against him -- although it's questionable how much of a challenge they present. The two other candidates are relative unknowns: Hassan al-Nouri, a businessman and former government minister; and Maher Hajjar, a lawmaker. Critics say they are just pawns or window dressing to give the election a veneer of democracy. But the Syrian government has dismissed any criticism of the process. Hajjar has kept a low profile, but al-Nouri says he's serious about challenging al-Assad and is ""trying to attack his weaknesses."" Speaking ahead of the election, he claimed he would be ""more aggressive and more effective"" than al-Assad on economic, administrative and social issues. But on the overarching question of the war, al-Nouri offers no dissent. ""Politically, I think he's doing what he has to do,"" he said. Rebels divided . What al-Assad is doing is continuing the brutal offensive against those opposed to his regime, raining down barrel bombs on rebel-controlled parts of cities such as Aleppo and Daraa. The opposition groups fighting against him are divided, with squabbling between factions and jihadis who have flocked from around the world to try to establish an Islamic state. The rebels have lost ground around Damascus and Homs and are under pressure in Aleppo and the south of the country. Talks this year mediated by the United Nations did little to change the situation, ending with the regime and the opposition firmly opposed. Ban's office has warned that the elections are likely to worsen the situation, saying they ""will damage the political process and hamper the prospects for a political solution that the country so urgently needs."" If al-Assad emerges victorious, as expected, it will further diminish the likelihood of his stepping down anytime soon. The Syrian opposition and Western countries insist that al-Assad can't be part of any body that, under an agreement signed in Geneva, Switzerland, earlier this year, would lead the country through a transitional period.","Rebel group said it won't target election centers so it can avoid civilian casualties .

"The debate over a link between autism and vaccines continues. A study published earlier this month concluded African-American boys are more at risk for autism if they're given the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before the age of 2. The study author says researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention knew about the link in 2004 -- and covered it up. CDC researchers are standing by their original findings: that there is no link between autism and vaccination schedules. The new study was funded by the Focus Autism Foundation, which says it is dedicated to exposing the causes of autism, ""focusing on the role of vaccinations."" The study has since been removed from the public domain pending further investigation, according to Translational Neurodegeneration. In an online statement, the scientific journal said the paper had been removed ""because of serious concerns about the validity of its conclusions."" CNN first became aware of the study when an iReport was posted about its publication and the controversy surrounding it. iReport is CNN's user-generated news community. Brian Hooker, author of the study and a biochemical engineer, found African-American boys who were given the MMR vaccine before age 24 months were more likely to be diagnosed with autism. To reach this conclusion, Hooker said he analyzed the same set of data that was the basis for a 2004 study done by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2004, scientists at the CDC's National Immunization Program published their study in the journal Pediatrics. Researchers compared 624 children with autism, age 3 to 10, with 1,824 developmentally healthy children. Most of the children, according to the study, were vaccinated between 12 and 17 months of age in accordance with vaccination recommendations. The CDC study authors found no link between the age children were given their first MMR vaccination and autism diagnoses. Nor did they find a statistically significant increased risk for a particular racial group. The CDC's raw data was made available for other scientists to use when its study was published in 2004. Hooker said he began his research after he was contacted by one of the original study authors, William Thompson, in November 2013. Thompson is a senior scientist with the CDC, where he has worked since 1998. Hooker said he believes the increased risk for African-American boys he found was not identified in the CDC study because the researchers, including Thompson, deliberately limited the number of participants they included in their analysis, which he said altered the results. Hooker said that by excluding children without birth certificates, the CDC study results were skewed. ""I regret that my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article,"" Thompson said in a statement sent to CNN by his lawyer. ""I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making and analyses should be transparent."" However, Thompson went on to say that Hooker had recorded these conversations without his consent, and had posted them online without his knowledge. In a statement to CNN on Monday, the CDC said its study presented results for two sets of children: all children initially recruited for the study, and a subset of children for whom a Georgia birth certificate was available. ""Access to the information on the birth certificates allowed researchers to assess more complete information on race, as well as other important characteristics,"" the CDC statement said. Dr. Frank DeStefano, lead author of the 2004 study, said he and his colleagues stand by their findings.  DeStefano said all the study authors, including Thompson, agreed on the analysis and interpretation before the study was submitted for publication 10 years ago. However, he said he plans to review his notes and will decide whether to run another analysis on the data. The new study by Hooker has been publicized by groups like Focus Autism, which say vaccines have contributed to the ""current autism epidemic and rise of chronic illness in children."" Hooker is a scientific adviser for the Focus Autism Foundation. He also has a 16-year-old son with developmental delays who he said is ""vaccine injured."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said the design of Hooker's study is questionable, and that his analysis is ""not fine-tuned enough to give you meaningful information."" ""If you analyze data enough times and enough ways, you're bound to find something that is statistically significant,"" said Witznitzer, after looking at both studies. ""This does not mean that the result is a true positive (vs. a false positive) or meaningful."" The debate over whether autism spectrum disorders are caused by vaccines started when researcher Andrew Wakefield published a now-retracted study in The Lancet in 1998 that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. Most of Wakefield's co-authors withdrew their names from the study when they learned Wakefield had been compensated by a law firm intending to sue manufacturers of the vaccine in question. In 2010, Wakefield lost his medical license. And in 2011, The Lancet retracted the study after an investigation found Wakefield altered or misrepresented information on the 12 children who were the basis for the conclusion of his study. Other researchers have not been able to replicate Wakefield's findings. In fact, several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism, including several reviews by the Institute of Medicine. Most recently, a study published in Pediatrics on July 1 concluded that vaccines do not cause autism spectrum disorders. An editorial published with the Pediatrics study added that the debate should be put to rest. This review was done by the RAND Corporation at the request of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and claims to be the most comprehensive review on the safety of vaccines. ""I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives,"" Thompson said in his statement. ""I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race."" While the cause of autism is not known, several studies indicate it starts in utero, long before a child is given the MMR or any other vaccinations. As such, DeStefano and other experts in the field have said it is biologically implausible for vaccines to cause autism. ""We know the brain and cellular features for children begin when the child is still in the womb. The brain is already developing the wiring that will manifest in autism,"" DeStefano said. Hooker said his results raise more questions than answers and pointed to the need for additional studies. The advocacy group Autism Speaks, which declined to comment on Hooker's study, referred CNN to its ""Vaccine and Autism"" statement, which says: . ""We strongly encourage parents to have their children vaccinated for protection against serious disease. We recognize that some parents still have concerns about vaccines, particularly if they have a child or relative with autism. We urge them to find a health practitioner who will consider their concerns and help them ensure the well-being of their child.""","Journal removes study published on alleged link between vaccines and autism .

"Thousands of people are being evacuated from the area around an active volcano in the Philippines after the country's seismology agency issued an alert saying a hazardous eruption could happen ""within weeks."" Mount Mayon, which towers over the city of Legazpi in the central Philippines, has shown ""a noticeable escalation of unrest,"" the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said in a bulletin late Monday. Molten lava and volcanic gas are making the mountain's crater glow red, it said. Are you there? Share your photos, videos if you can safely . The agency raised the alert level to ""critical"" for Mayon, which is famed for its near-perfect conical shape. Critical is the agency's third highest alert level after eruption and imminent eruption. Authorities in the region of Albay responded Tuesday by launching efforts to relocate more than 10,000 people from a 6-kilometer radius around the volcano, the official Philippines News Agency reported. The seismology agency said 39 rockfalls, caused by breaches of a bulging lava dome at the volcano's summit, had been detected over the course of Monday. It also said low level volcanic earthquakes had been recorded. The raised alert level ""means that Mayon is exhibiting relatively high unrest and that magma is at the crater and that hazardous eruption is possible within weeks,"" the agency said. Lava from volcano threatens to cut off community on Hawaii's Big Island . Previous deadly eruptions . Situated on the island of Luzon, about 330 kilometers (205 miles) southeast of Manila, Mayon is one of the world's most active volcanoes. Since 1616, the imposing stratovolcano has erupted 47 times, with many of the explosions causing deadly mudflows and ash falls. In 2013, five climbers died when they were hit by falling rocks thrown up by a particularly violent blast. The volcano's most devastating eruption took place in 1814, killing at least 1,200 people.","Seismology agency: Mount Mayon has shown ""a noticeable escalation of unrest""

"A CIA assessment puts the number of ISIS fighters at possibly more than three times the previous estimates. The terror group that calls itself the Islamic State ""can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria,"" a CIA spokesman told CNN on Thursday. Analysts and U.S. officials initially estimated there were as many as 10,000 fighters, including those who were freed from prisons by ISIS, and Sunni loyalists who have joined the fight as the group advanced across Iraq. ""This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity and additional intelligence,"" the spokesman said. The news came a day after President Barack Obama laid out his plan to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" ISIS, including authorizing airstrikes. Mass executions and videotaped beheadings, including those of two American journalists, have led to the push for a broader counterterrorism mission, including possible airstrikes in civil war-torn Syria. It's unclear how the ISIS ranks swelled, and whether the increased numbers include recruits from within Iraq. More than 15,000 foreign fighters, including 2,000 Westerners, have gone to Syria, a CIA source told CNN on Thursday. The fighters come from more than 80 countries, the source said. It's not immediately clear whether these were primarily ISIS fighters or were dispersed among a number of groups fighting the Syrian government. The details about the increased number of fighters followed news that the United States has begun surveillance flights over Syria, which a U.S. official told CNN is part of an effort to gather intelligence that will help the decision whether to launch airstrikes against ISIS. The Pentagon is refining its targets based on improved intelligence-gathering, including the surveillance flights now under way over Syria, a Defense official said. The United States ""will take action at a time and place"" of its choosing, a third official said. But while a broader campaign is not imminent, the officials -- who all spoke on condition of anonymity -- said the military can strike at any time if there is a target of opportunity. 5 takeaways from Obama's ISIS speech . The Pentagon spokesman suggested that striking ISIS also means going after the terror group's leadership, something the United States has not done to this point. ""One of the ways you get at and you destroy the capabilities of an enemy like (ISIS) is to be pretty aggressive against them, and that does include disrupting their ability to command and control and to lead their own forces,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the spokesman. The President has been reviewing options and targets with his national security team, according to officials at the White House. Those officials would not characterize the number or scope of those targets but said the review was based on the expanded gathering of intelligence in Syria. ""These targets have been exposed because of the president's early decision to ramp up our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets that were operating in the region,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. ""By improving our visibility into the situation on the ground, Pentagon planners have been working with some success to develop additional targets."" Kerry: U.S. not at war with ISIS . While officials work to develop targets in Syria, the U.S. military is flying about 60 surveillance and reconnaissance flights a day over Iraq, according to the U.S. official. Those flights have ""developed over time a tremendous clarity of the intelligence picture within Iraq"" and has offered a better understanding of the targets, the official said. The Pentagon also plans to have ""armed and manned"" intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft flying from Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital, in the coming days to supplement similar unmanned aircraft carrying out missions over Iraq.

"Time named Pope Francis its person of the year Wednesday after nine months of a papacy that has brought accolades from reformers, raised fears among conservatives, and drawn widespread adulation from people around the world for his man-of-the-people ways. ""He took the name of a humble saint and then called for a church of healing,"" Time wrote in its announcement.  ""The septuagenarian superstar is poised to transform a place that measures change by the century."" Following him in the top five were NSA leaker Edward Snowden, gay rights activist Edith Windsor, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The top 10 also included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, singer Miley Cyrus, U.S. President Barack Obama, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services. The new pope ""comes at a time when the church seemed to be needing a huge burst of new energy,"" Time contributor Howard Chua-Eoan said in a video announcing the magazine's decision. The magazine's international editor, Bobby Ghosh, said Francis' contributions in his short time in office have changed the church's image as well as its substance. ""He's changed perceptions of the church from being this out-of-touch institution to one that is humble and merciful,"" Ghosh said. ""He's changed the focus of the church from being focused on doctrine to becoming more about service. And he's changed the tone in which the church speaks to one of compassion. It's all about the poor. This is the church as it used to be in its -- arguably its best period in the past. And Francis seems to be bringing that back."" He has also opened up church finances and addressed controversial issues other popes have shied away from discussing publicly, Ghosh said. ""He's talking about homosexuality, about giving women a bigger say in the church. These are things that are very, very important. They're not just words. He's actually following them up with action,"" Ghosh said. The Vatican welcomed Time's selection, while making it clear the man so widely recognized for his humility didn't seek the award and didn't want its light to shine on him but on the mission of the church. ""We think that the declaration of the Pope as the man of the year is a positive sign. because it is a very prestigious declaration, given to a man that announces the love of God and the peace for all,"" the Rev. Federico Lombardi told reporters. ""And the Pope does not look for honors, but he is happy if his message -- his message of the love of good -- is received and understood. And then, in this sense, he can be happy of this declaration."" A pope of many firsts . Francis, formerly known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina, is known as a humble man, a capable administrator and -- as expected of a new pope -- a man of great faith. He is also a man of many firsts: the first non-European pope in the modern era, the first pontiff from South America, and the first Jesuit to be elected head of the Roman Catholic Church. In his first public act, the new pope broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square to pray for him, rather than blessing the crowd first. He later controversially washed the feet of a young woman at a juvenile prison in Rome in a ceremony that's traditionally been restricted to men. In a recent letter to the church, he admonished leaders to focus on helping the poor and broken above all else. ""I prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,"" he wrote. And he has revitalized an ancient church office dedicated to aiding the poor. Francis appointed a new head of the office of the Vatican Almoner, instructing him to spend his time outside the Vatican looking for people to help. ""You can sell your desk,"" Francis told the new almoner, Archbishop Konrad Krajewski, Time reported. ""You don't need it. You need to get out of the Vatican. Don't wait for people to come ringing. You need to go out and look for the poor."" Francis has also stirred controversy among some conservatives for trying to steer the church away from focus on social issues such as contraception, abortion and same-sex marriage. In what has been seen as a conciliatory tone toward homosexuals, he has said he was in no position to judge gays. Pope's past . Francis, 76, was born in Buenos Aires on December 17, 1936. The son of an Italian immigrant, he trained as a chemist before deciding to become a priest. He was ordained by the Jesuits in 1969 and became co-archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1997, then sole archbishop of that city one year later. He was made a cardinal in 2001 and was president of the Argentine bishops conference from 2005 to 2011. As cardinal, Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to same-sex marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. He was runner-up in the 2005 papal conclave, behind then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, according to a profile by CNN Vatican analyst John Allen published by the National Catholic Reporter. The new pope brings together the first and the developing worlds, Allen wrote. Besides his Italian roots, Francis studied theology in Germany. His career coincided with the so-called Dirty War in Argentina, which lasted from 1976 to 1983. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the country's military dictatorship. The church was seen by some as not having done enough in that period. In a complaint filed three days before the 2005 conclave,  Francis was accused of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests, Allen wrote. Francis reportedly denied the charge. He is known for his simplicity and has a reputation of being a voice for the poor. Full profile .","Francis has ""changed perceptions of the church,"" Time's international editor says .

"Beijing (CNN)Diplomacy can be a lot like theater -- with a whole cast of characters jostling for spotlight and applause. On the world stage, Chinese President Xi Jinping has emerged as a force to be reckoned with since he took the leading role in the world's most populous nation in late 2012. For the 61-year-old Xi -- considered China's most powerful leader in decades -- his marquee appearance last November as the host of a global summit has offered good clues on his future moves. During the 2014 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Beijing, Xi met and entertained more than a dozen other leaders from countries that have been called China's friends, enemies and -- more often than not -- ""frenemies."" No ""frenemy"" relationship is more important -- or complex -- than that between the United States and China, the world's reigning and emerging superpowers with huge bilateral trade as well as conflicting strategic goals. ""It's difficult to find space on containers -- ships are full even in normally slow seasons,"" said Ben Schwall, an American buyer of lighting equipment based in southern China. His optimism on the rebounding U.S. demand for Chinese-made goods echoes the sentiment of many analysts, who see the world's two largest economies cooperating more on the economic and trade front. Tensions remain high, however, over geopolitical issues ranging from alleged state-sponsored cyber attacks, to territorial disputes involving what Washington views as Beijing bullying its smaller neighbors. With China's defense budget growing at a double-digit rate annually, Xi -- who also heads the ruling Communist Party and the world's largest standing army -- hasn't been shy in showing off the country's latest military wares, including its first aircraft carrier and a new generation of stealth fighter jets. China's fast-expanding global clout comes as the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama -- whom Xi met several times during the APEC gathering -- finds its hands tied by a host of other domestic and international issues. ""Obama's famous 'pivot to Asia' policy has been disrupted,"" said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""He is still keen to assert U.S. supremacy in Asia Pacific -- so the U.S. will continue to boost ties with Vietnam, Philippines and India to form a wheel to contain Chinese influence."" Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Beijing's Renmin University, predicts increasing confrontation between Beijing and Washington - a worrying prospect as Xi is set to make his first state visit to the United States in September. ""The U.S. government will have to decide whether it's going to accept China's strategic interests in the western Pacific."" These interests include a group of tiny, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, claimed by China as well as Japan, a key U.S. ally in Asia. Diplomatic ties between the two historical rivals had soured so much over the dispute that both sides resorted to invoking Voldemort, the fictional villain in the Harry Potter books, in their heated rhetoric about each other. Amid rising fears of potential military clashes, Xi finally agreed to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the APEC summit -- for the very first time since they took power in their respective countries. Despite their now-infamous photo-op -- with Xi barely looking at Abe as they awkwardly shook hands in front of a sea of flashing cameras -- many others have managed to look beyond the two men's frosty demeanors. ""The two governments have resumed some senior-level talks -- that's remarkable progress,"" said Shi, the Chinese professor in international relations. ""But China will still confront Abe as well as talk to him -- it'll do a combination of both."" Indeed, while Chinese foreign affairs and defense officials have attended recent bilateral talks in Japan, Beijing has reportedly started building naval facilities in an island near disputed waters and also announced plans to hold a rare military parade in September -- with state media describing a major goal being to ""frighten Japan."" Besides Japan, though, China seems to have adopted a similar two-pronged approach in the South China Sea, where it is locked in a bitter territorial dispute with several Southeast Asian nations over another group of uninhabited islands sitting on resources-rich waters. ""On one hand, China is trying to ease tensions; on the other hand, it's staking out bigger claims in the South China Sea,"" said Hong Kong analyst Lam. ""Some of China's nervous neighbors are asking: Shall we call on the U.S. to boost defense cooperation or shall we come to terms with the Chinese?"" One neighbor that seems to be seeking a third option is North Korea. Long considered close Communist allies whose ""great friendship cemented in blood"" from the Korean War, China and North Korea have grown apart in the past decade with Pyongyang's steadfast refusal to negotiate its nuclear disarmament. Relations have become further strained after Xi came to power -- and recent reports by China's state media on North Korean army deserters killing Chinese civilians in border towns in several armed robberies have created a strong public backlash. ""They keep demanding things from China and China has received very little in return,"" said Deng Yuwen, a former editor of an influential Communist Party journal who was once punished for calling on China to abandon the Pyongyang regime. ""This kind of one-way relationship is not sustainable,"" he added, pointing to the lifeline China provides to North Korea through energy supply and trade. ""A new leader would certainly want to change this, especially because North Korea -- which is like a spoiled brat -- can't change its ways."" Breaking with tradition, Xi has yet to agree to a meeting in Beijing with North Korea's young supreme leader. Kim Jong Un's first official overseas trip, instead, is reported to be a visit to Moscow in May -- a sign of his effort to pursue other allies. ""Once he's traveled around, Kim will realize North Korea can't live without China,"" predicted Deng. ""They want to get close to Russia, but Russia has too many of its own problems to worry about."" Like other great powers before it, China is facing more and more tough choices in international affairs. Adopting the ""carrot and stick"" approach, Beijing now dangles cash or flexes muscles in front of various countries -- and throws in a charm offensive starring its glamorous singer First Lady when needed. As he amasses ever more power at home, a self-confident Xi has been expanding China's influence around the world, even in regions long considered out of its reach like Africa and Latin America. ""Xi is changing China's foreign policy, which will be much more proactive in the foreseeable future,"" said Shi. ""He's very different from his predecessors -- he's obviously more hardline."" As China prepares to usher in the Year of the Sheep, which begins on February 19 based on the lunar calendar, few expect to see President Xi take any meek steps on the global stage in 2015.","No relationship is more important -- or complex -- than that between the United States and China .

"The Obama administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to keep in place an Obamacare requirement that certain religious-affiliated groups cover birth control and other reproductive health services in their employee insurance plans. The high court was poised to decide whether to grant a temporary injunction sought by a Catholic charity of nuns to delay the mandate, which carries fines for non-compliance. The Denver-based Little Sisters of the Poor and other non-profits had filed a lawsuit against the federal government, saying the contraception coverage requirement violates their moral beliefs and their religious liberty. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued an emergency injunction on Tuesday for the charity that cares for the elderly poor and sought a response from the Obama administration. The Catholic-affiliated group submitted a rebuttal after the Justice Department submitted its brief. It is not clear how Sotomayor will handle the matter ultimately, but one option would be to ask the broader court to weigh in. The appeal again thrusts the politically charged Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, into the national legal spotlight. President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative, ruled constitutional by the court in 2012, became even more controversial this past fall during its flawed public rollout. The current case spotlights a major sticking point in the law over contraception coverage. The mandate was designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit, religious-based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith-based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay. 5 things: Obamacare and contraception . A court ruling on this matter could ultimately impact dozens of religious groups and businesses that have mounted legal challenges in recent months. Church and state . The church and state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated last year between the Obama administration and various outside groups to address the controversy over contraception. Under the law, churches and houses of worships are exempt from the mandate. But other nonprofit religious-affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and certain charities must either provide no-cost contraception coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement. Organizations that choose to opt-out of direct coverage must sign a document certifying their religious objections, and the government would then require the outside insurer pick up the costs. ""At that point, the employer-applicants will have satisfied all their obligations under the contraceptive coverage provision,"" the Justice Department said in its brief with the Supreme Court. The Catholic charity has ""no legal basis to challenge the self-certification requirement or to complain that it involves them in the process of providing contraceptive coverage,"" the government said. But the Little Sisters of the Poor and the entity that administers its insurance plans, Christian Brothers Services, both qualify for exemptions under the conditions in the law, the Justice Department said. But the groups raised objections in their appeal to the Supreme Court that an exemption ultimately amounts to tacit approval of something that violates their religious and moral beliefs. Contraception coverage would be provided by someone in the future -- and they oppose that. ""The government demands that the Little Sisters of the Poor sign a permission slip for abortion drugs and contraceptives, or pay of millions in fines"" for non-compliance, said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the group representing the nuns. ""The sisters believe that doing that violates their faith, and that they shouldn't be forced to divert funds from the poor elderly and dying people they've devoted their lives to serve,"" Rienzi said. The Supreme Court in March will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate, when it hears arguments over whether some for-profit corporations should be exempt, again on religious liberty grounds.

The election, which has been branded a sham by the West and by the Syrian opposition, is widely expected to return President Bashar al-Assad to power. CNN International Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen has reported from inside Syria numerous times during the conflict, which has left an estimated 150,000 people dead. He breaks down the key questions ahead of Tuesday's election. Why is it happening now? The government says Syria's new constitution stipulates that presidential elections must be held now. The regime says it shows the country is moving forward and that it is the first time a president will be elected by the people rather than appointed. The opposition says the election is a fraud, that voting will be rigged and that the poll serves only to cement Assad's power. Who are the other candidates? The other two candidates are relative unknowns. One is Maher Hajjar, an entrepreneur and member of parliament. He keeps out of the limelight and has not been heard from much. Hajjar's election posters declare that ""Syria is with Palestine,"" which seems like a very narrow slogan. Other than that it is unclear what he would change should he win. The more intriguing candidate is Hassan Nouri, a former economics professor and cabinet minister who told me he had to resign because he was too critical of Assad's government. Nouri studied at the University of Wisconsin and still refers to himself as a Badger. He says the election is an uphill battle for him, but feels he is making headway. His main message is economic. He is for market liberalization and fighting corruption in government and in the private sector. But when it comes to fighting Syria's civil war, Nouri says he wouldn't do anything differently -- and much like Assad, he refers to the regime's three-year assault on the opposition as ""fighting terrorism."" Are they for real? It's very hard to tell whether Assad's opponents are for real. They certainly don't seem to stand much of a chance, but Hassan Nouri says he is fighting. We talked to many people on the streets of Damascus and Homs, and many had never heard of the other two candidates. But as far as the campaigns are concerned, both of them are very present. There are many Hajjar and Nouri election posters up in Damascus, even though there are a lot more for Bashar al Assad's re-election. Assad's campaign slogan is ""unity"" and he is trying to portray himself as a reluctant leader who is only running for office again because the people want him to. One of his election posters declares, ""It is not your choice, the people have chosen you."" It is hard to imagine that either candidate has a chance against Assad, but their campaigns certainly do not look like they are being repressed. What should we look out for? The big threat is that there could be widespread violence on election day. The opposition says the poll is a sham and that it will be a major target. Early voting at the Syrian embassy in Beirut had a massive turnout, but will that be replicated inside the country? If the turnout is high, that would indicate people in the areas where voting is possible take it seriously -- and opposition candidate Nouri says the election can't be considered valid if turnout is lower than 50 percent. Will the election be monitored? Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad told me there won't be any monitors from the U.S., the EU, or the OSCE, but he did say that monitors from ""other countries"" will be present. Mekdad said the presence of monitors would also depend on the security situations in certain parts of the country. What percentage of Syrians will be able to vote? It's almost impossible to say. Nearly 3 million Syrians have been forced to flee the country and more than 6.5 million are internally displaced. It will obviously be difficult for them to vote. Large swathes of Syria's north and northeast, as well as some places in the south, are not under government control and there will be no election in those areas. There are some who say people could leave those areas and come over to the government side to vote, but that seems pretty utopian. Voting will be possible in government-controlled areas, but it is not clear what percentage of the population actually still resides in these places. Is it dangerous to vote? It is dangerous to vote in certain places. In areas along the Syrian coast like Tartus and Latakia it will not be too dangerous because they are firmly under the control of the government. But elsewhere there will be major security concerns as voters will be weary of the threat of car bombs and shelling at polling stations within range of rebel mortars. What will change? It is not clear what, if anything, will change as a result of this election. The agreement signed in Geneva earlier this year called for an inclusive body to govern Syria through a transitional period. The Syrian opposition and the West say the transitional period means that Assad must resign -- but while the regime acknowledges that institutions must be reshuffled to accommodate the opposition to some degree, it says Assad must stay at the helm. If Assad wins the election as expected, the prospect of him stepping down as part of a deal would seem even less likely than it does now. Why would someone ""elected by the people"" leave his post? That would be the argument coming out of Damascus. And the fact Assad now has the upper hand militarily in most places makes it even less likely he'll step down any time soon.","President Bashar al-Assad widely expected to be returned to power in Tuesday election .

"CNN has learned the White House wanted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to wait until this week to resign, so it would have a new nominee in place by then. But Hagel refused to wait, deciding if the White House was going to push him out, he wanted to make his resignation known as quickly as possible. Hagel resigned a full week earlier on Nov. 24. A source very close to Hagel and the resignation process detailed that decision to CNN. ""Once the secretary saw that he would have to go, he wanted to move quickly,"" the source said. After months of frustration with the White House, Hagel wanted to ""at least control his departure."" A second source highly familiar with the resignation of Hagel, and the search for a new nominee, tells CNN that in the days before he resigned, Hagel consulted both Republican and Democratic former senators about whether there was a way for him to stay on the job, and concluded there was not. GOP Sen. John McCain told News Talk 550 radio in Arizona on the day Hagel resigned that the defense secretary had recently visited him and expressed his displeasure with the White House. ""I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision making process,"" McCain had said. ""His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully. McCain added: ""Chuck's situation was no different."" Behind the scenes one close Hagel advisor is former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell. It is not clear how closely the two men talked about this issue. Officials have characterized the decision to replace Hagel as mutual between the President and the secretary.  A senior US official not in the Pentagon says the White House had become increasingly disenchanted with Hagel, feeling he was not clearly articulating White House strategy and Hagel had become frustrated. Hagel's determination to resign on his own timing, began a series of events that has left the White House scrambling to find a nominee. Often, a replacement is announced at the same time a resignation is made public. Both sources tell CNN that the supposed front runner, Michele Flournoy, was not a fully vetted and selected candidate by the time Hagel resigned, and that she pulled her name after talks with the White House. Several people familiar with Flournoy's thinking say she decided to withdraw her name in part out of concern over dealing with White House micromanagement. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, the second source says, was essentially put on the White House's so called short list after Flournoy withdrew to make it look like there were high-level candidates under consideration. But several sources tell CNN that Johnson quickly made it clear he didn't want to go through another confirmation hearing and was reluctant to leave DHS after less than a year on the job. Democratic Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Carl Levin of Michigan also said they did not want the job. That essentially left Ash Carter as the last candidate under serious consideration. But even on Tuesday, as the final touches were putting on the White House plans to announce Carter, still another administration official said the White House was going back one more time to see if there were other possible higher profile candidates. Carter is deeply respected inside the defense establishment, and has a long track record serving in a number of Pentagon jobs, but he is not likely to bring significant change to the Pentagon. Nearly one dozen Pentagon officials CNN has spoken to say they doubt this White House really wants a secretary of defense who will offer significant new ideas.","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel refused to wait for his replacement before announcing his resignation .

"Mariupol, Ukraine  (CNN)Less than two days into a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, deadly violence erupted once again between the military and pro-Russian separatists, casting further doubt about whether the peace plan will hold. Five Ukrainian security forces were killed and 25 were wounded in fighting with the separatists, Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said. He said at least 129 violations of the ceasefire have already taken place -- ranging from small arms fire to mortar attacks. But pro-Russian separatists have also blamed Ukraine for violations. Dmytro Chalov, a spokesman for a sector of the Ukrainian army, said mortar fire pummeled the Mariupol area of eastern Ukraine. The ceasefire went into effect more than 24 hours earlier, at midnight Saturday night. Monday was slated to be a key day in the truce -- when both sides are supposed to withdraw heavy weapons. But neither has done so. The Ukrainian army still has plans to pull heavy weapons out of the area, but it won't happen until the situation is quiet, Chalov said. ""We emphasize that our military will only fire in response,"" Lysenko told reporters Monday. The ceasefire aims to end 10 months of fighting in eastern Ukraine. But less than 90 minutes after it started, Ukrainian officials reported mortar shelling at a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has warned that if the separatists do not abide by the ceasefire, he will impose martial law throughout Ukraine. Despite the reports of violence Monday, the truce did appear to hold up in many parts of eastern Ukraine. And that means some residents who have been holed up for weeks were able to venture out to buy food and medicine. But the future remains uncertain. ""How long can this bloodshed go on for?"" one woman told CNN. ""All we want is peace."" Frederik Pleitgen reported from Mariupol, and Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta.","A Ukrainian defense spokesman reports 129 violations of the ceasefire so far .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Louis Jourdan, the debonair leading man who romanced Leslie Caron in ""Gigi"" and played a wealthy Afghan prince in the James Bond film ""Octopussy,"" has died. He was 93. The French actor, who brought his smooth, continental charm to such films as ""Letters From an Unknown Woman"" (1948), ""The Happy Time"" (1952) and ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" (1954), died Saturday in his Beverly Hills home, according to French publication Le Point. After World War II, Jourdan attracted the attention of famed producer David O. Selznick and was cast in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Paradine Case"" (1947), which starred Gregory Peck and Ethel Barrymore. The late 1940s and '50s were Jourdan's most fertile period, a time of lavish romantic features perfect for his cultivated persona. During this period, he starred in Vincente Minnelli's version of ""Madame Bovary"" (1949) opposite Jennifer Jones; in ""Bird of Paradise"" (1951) with Debra Paget; and as a pirate in ""Anne of the Indies"" (1951), with Jean Peters and Paget again. The Hollywood Reporter: First photo of Daniel Craig in new Bond film . He portrayed an effervescent French-Canadian in ""The Happy Time"" and showed his versatility by playing four roles in ""Decameron Nights"" (1953), starring with Joan Fontaine. He was born Louis Gendre on July 19, 1921, in Marseille. He studied acting at Ecole d'art Dramatique, and his first movie role came in ""Le Corsaire"" (1939), a French film that was never completed because of World War II. After his father was arrested by the Gestapo, Jourdan joined the French Underground. He paired with Fontaine for the first time in Max Ophuls' ""Letters From an Unknown Woman,"" playing a Viennese concert pianist who receives a letter from a woman he once had a love affair with but no longer remembers. Jourdan as ever played the suave lead, a predatory prince, in ""Three Coins in the Fountain,"" and in 1956, he portrayed a commoner who falls in love with a princess (Grace Kelly) in ""The Swan."" With his cosmopolitan currency at its peak, Jourdan was cast by Minnelli to star in the MGM big--budget musical ""Gigi"" (1958) as a wealthy bon vivant in love with a beautiful courtesan-in-training (Caron). The film won the best picture Oscar and eight other Academy Awards. After the huge success of ""Gigi,"" Jourdan brought his dashing elan to a number of films, including ""The Best of Everything"" (1959), opposite Joan Crawford; the musical ""Can-Can"" (1960), with Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine and his ""Gigi"" co-star Maurice Chevalier; ""The V.I.P.s"" (1963), opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; and the Gallic romp ""Made in Paris"" (1966), with Ann-Margret. The late 1960s and '70s, with a changing sensibility toward romance in moviemaking, did not serve up the kinds of roles that Jourdan was known for. He did, however, bring his polished presence to the role of the prince and smuggler Kamal Khan in ""Octopussy"" (1983). The Hollywood Reporter: Actors who have played James Bond . Jourdan played eccentric villains in ""Counterforce"" (1988) and ""The Return of the Swamp Thing"" (1989), and his last credit came in Peter Yates' ""Year of the Comet"" (1992).

"(CNN)Amedy Coulibaly apparently tried to justify himself to his hostages in a deadly standoff at a kosher market in eastern Paris -- and perhaps unbeknownst to him, a radio station was listening, a recording purportedly reveals. French radio station RTL says that it called the market Friday after authorities say Coulibaly took customers and workers hostage. Coulibaly apparently took the call and then tried to hang up, the station says, but the line remained open. In a recording of what followed, a man the station identifies as Coulibaly holds a dialogue with others -- apparently hostages -- in which he says he attacked because the French military has attacked Muslims in the Middle East and Mali, including ISIS militants. ""I was born in France. If they didn't attack other countries, I wouldn't be here,"" a voice says in RTL's recording. Officials say Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store, and he was then shot and killed when police raided the store to free the hostages. One freed hostage, who gave her name only as Marie, told CNN affiliate BFMTV that the gunman started shooting ""as soon as he got inside."" ""We were sitting, and at our right there were two corpses -- two customers who died at the very beginning,"" Marie said.  ""... He scared us because he told us, 'I'm not afraid to die.' And he said, 'Either I die or I go to jail for 40 years.' "" Store worker Lassana Bathily told BFMTV that he guided a group of shoppers into a downstairs walk-in freezer. Coulibaly demanded the people come upstairs or he would shoot them, Bathily said. The worker said he shut off the light in the room and the power to the freezer and told the people to stay calm. ""I'm the one is going to go out,"" he recounted telling them. ""I took the elevator and went upstairs."" When the doors of the freight elevator opened, he looked both ways. He saw no one, so he ran. Once outside, he was detained by police, but later helped them by describing the supermarket floor plan. It was unclear whether the people were able to remain downstairs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he'd spoken by phone with a survivor who told him that a young, male Jew was shot after he tried to grab the gunman's weapon. ""He was shot, and struggling for his life for 45 minutes,"" Netanyahu said, recounting what the survivor told him. The four slain victims were identified Saturday by the French Jewish publication JSSNEWS as being Yohan Cohen, 22, Yoav Hattab, 21, Philippe Braham and Francois Michel Saada. The four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Friday. Recording: 'Militants are going to come' Coulibaly was part of the same Islamic jihadist groups as Cherif and Said Kouachi, the brothers who police say committed Wednesday's massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices in Paris and were killed in a separate standoff north of Paris on Saturday, French police union spokesman Pascal Disant said. In RTL's recording, the man purported to be Coulibaly tells the hostages that they are accountable for France's actions against Muslim militants abroad, in part because the hostages pay taxes and elect the government's leaders. ""But I am telling you, it's almost over. Militants are going to come. There are going to be more and more. They (France) need to stop. They need to stop attacking ISIS,"" the man says, referring to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Sunni Muslim extremist group and al Qaeda offshoot that is waging a brutal war for what it says is its Islamic caliphate in the Middle East. ""They need to stop asking our women to remove the hijab,"" the man continues. A French law banning the burqa, a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes, went into effect in April 2011. Argument with hostages about taxes . The man purported to be Coulibaly, 32, apparently argued with hostages about taxes, RTL's recording shows. ""You pay taxes, so that means you agree"" with France's actions in Mali and the Middle East, the apparent gunman says in the recording. ""But we have to pay,"" another voice says. The response from the apparent gunman appeared incredulous: ""What? We don't have to. I don't pay my taxes!"" ""When I pay my taxes, it's for the highways, schools,"" an apparent hostage says. ""We pay our taxes but we don't harm anybody,"" a person also says. The man purported to be Coulibaly says: ""Everyone could get together. If they could get together for Charlie Hebdo ... they could do the same thing for us and get together for us."" CNN could not independently verify that the speaker was Coulibaly. Separately, Alexi Delahousee, a journalist with CNN affiliate BFMTV, spoke to Coulibaly on the phone during the hostage situation, BFMTV reported. Coulibaly said that he belonged to ISIS and had synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers. Paris police say that Coulibaly is suspected in Thursday's fatal shooting of a police officer in the Montrouge suburb, a day after the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 12 people and a day before the Friday market raid. Israeli government sources told CNN that French President François Hollande had told Netanyahu that 15 hostages were rescued. Police are searching for Coulibaly's romantic partner, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26. Disant initially said she was a suspect in the market raid and may have escaped, and police also named her as a suspect in Thursday's shooting of the police officer in Montrouge. But it wasn't clear if she was in France. She entered Turkey on January 2, a Turkish prime ministry source told CNN on Saturday. If that is accurate, it could mean Boumeddiene was not in France at the time of this week's attacks. CNN's Ray Sanchez and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.","French radio station RTL says line remained open after hostage-taker spoke via phone on Friday .

"When is a strategy not a strategy? When it's a political football. President Barack Obama has ignited fresh conservative criticism by saying ""we don't have a strategy yet"" for airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria. Republicans immediately jumped on the President's comment during a news conference Thursday by saying it proved their longstanding complaint that his foreign policy failed to seriously respond to the terrorist threat from Sunni jihadists in the Syrian civil war. ""I'm not sure the severity of the problem has really sunk in to the administration just yet,"" said GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House intelligence committee. Referring to the ISIS lightning sweep across northern Iraq this summer, Rogers said ""we knew it was a problem before June"" and noted that ""even the President said he was talking about this to Iraqi officials over a year ago."" ""When a terrorist organization acts like an army, they present military targets the way any other army would do,"" he said, arguing the United States should have been going after such ISIS targets earlier ""to degrade and disrupt the momentum of this very dangerous organization."" Waffling allegation . Retired Army Gen. George Joulwan, the former NATO supreme allied commander, told CNN on Friday that while he believed Obama's approach amounted to a bit of ""waffling,"" launching airstrikes in Syria requires lots of preparation. ISIS is not a state but an organization fighting the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, whom the United States also wants out of power, Joulwan noted. That creates complications, as does what he called Syria's ""very sophisticated air defense system."" ""I think we need to have clarity here of what that mission is, what it is before you start sending an airstrikes or troops,"" he said. ""What is the clarity here of what the end state is that we want to achieve? We didn't do that in Iraq or Afghanistan or in Vietnam. We've got to do it if we're going to get involved again."" The White House made the same point, with spokesman Josh Earnest attributing any uproar over Obama's phrasing to spin rather than substance. Former CIA chief: Matter of time before ISIS tries to attack West . Obama strategy . He told CNN that Obama ""was asked a specific question about what approach he was going to pursue when it came to possible military action in Syria"" against ISIS. ""That was the specific question he was asked, and the President was explicit, that he is still waiting for plans that are being developed by the Pentagon for military options that he has for going into Syria,"" Earnest said, adding that ""the President has been very clear for months about what our comprehensive strategy is for confronting"" the ISIS threat in Iraq. He listed steps that have become a mantra of sorts in responding to persistent questioning by reporters in recent weeks about a strategy for confronting ISIS in Iraq and Syria: . • A unified Iraqi government ""that can unite that country to meet the threat that's facing their country right now""; . • Strengthening the U.S. relationship with Iraqi and Kurdish security forces ""to make sure that they have the equipment and training that they need to take the fight to"" ISIS on the ground; . • Getting regional governments to join in taking on ISIS; . • Forging an international coalition to join in taking on ISIS, something Obama failed to do when he contemplated but eventually decided against attacking Syria last year over its chemical weapons; and, . • The use of military force, such as the airstrikes launched in Iraq against ISIS to protect American personnel and minority groups under threat. ""The President is clear that the strategy is one that's not going to solve the problem overnight, but he's also clear about the fact that our strategy can't only be the American military,"" Earnest said. ""If we've learned anything over the last 10 or 12 years ... it's that a strategy that only includes military force will not be an enduring solution to this problem."" Who is the ISIS? Partners needed . Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington concurred, telling CNN that Obama's ""no strategy"" comment specifically referred to airstrikes in Syria that awaited final planning. ""I think the real issue there is finding a partner to work with,"" he said, adding that ""we need to find partners that we can work with in Syria to help us contain ISIS."" At the same time, ""we certainly don't want to come in a way that is supportive of the brutal and illegitimate Assad regime in Syria,"" Smith said. ""So it is a difficult problem to figure out the best strategy. I agree, they have safe haven there in parts of Syria and that will have to be part of the strategy for containing"" ISIS. 5 key questions in the fight against ISIS . Past arguments . Republicans led by hawkish conservatives such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona have called for years for greater U.S. involvement in the Syrian conflict. They complained when Obama rejected arming the Syrian opposition against al-Assad's government as far back as three years ago. Even the President's former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, advocated more help in 2011 and 2012 for rebel factions considered moderate. However, opponents of such a move warned the Syrian opposition was too splintered and ideologically diverse to arm it. The rise of ISIS from former al Qaeda affiliates gives fodder to the stances of both sides. Obama critics say backing moderate Syrian factions could have prevented the extremists from gaining traction and helped the opposition topple al-Assad, as desired. Supporters say U.S. weapons would now be in the hands of ISIS if they had been sent to Syria when the war began. Now the United States is sending weapons and other aid to some Syrian opposition groups. Opinion: How U.S. can help Syria drive out ISIS . Leading from behind . The Syria issue touches on broader aspects of Obama's foreign policy and ideological differences with conservatives. Obama campaigned on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he forged a foreign policy based on easing the global reliance on the United States to always lead the intervention charge. His shift came as America emerged from recession and confronted budget austerity issues that brought spending cuts across the board, including to the military. Obama and Democrats want reduced spending spread equally as part of recalibrating government priorities. Republicans, especially conservatives, seek to maintain and wield U.S. military might and influence while cutting spending elsewhere to shrink the overall size of government. The debate underpins much of the political strategy and maneuvering in Washington, especially with congressional elections looming in November.

"Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova has returned to the Catalan club's training ground just two weeks after undergoing surgery to remove a tumor from his throat. Vilanova suffered a recurrence of a tumor on his parotid gland -- located at the back of the mouth -- and was released from hospital on December 22. The former assistant coach, who replaced Josep Guardiola in June, returned to training on Wednesday ahead of the Spanish league leaders' derby match with Espanyol on Sunday. Vilanova also dropped in on the Catalan national team -- featuring nine Barca players -- as it prepared for a friendly match with Nigeria. Blog: Barcelona's Vilanova coach of the year? ""The manager ... led the team's second training session of the year,"" read a statement on the club's official website. ""This morning, Vilanova stopped by the Ciutat Esportiva to meet with the Catalan players ahead of this afternoon's Catalonia vs. Nigeria match."" Barca president Sandro Rosell said last weekend he hoped Vilanova would be fit to return to work in two-to-three weeks. Despite not being recognized by football's global governing body FIFA, a squad made up entirely of Catalan players occasionally plays exhibition matches. The team, led by Dutch former Barca player and coach Johan Cruyff, was held to a 1-1 draw by Nigeria at the Camp Nou. Midfielder Sergio Gonzalez, without a club since being released by Levante in 2011, gave the Catalan team the lead from the penalty spot after three minutes. But Nigeria earned a draw when U.S.-born Portland Timbers striker Bright Dike equalized after 55 minutes. Super Eagles coach Stephen Keshi is preparing Nigeria for this month's 2013 African Cup of Nations in South Africa, where the two-time tournament winners have been drawn in a group with 2012 champions Zambia, Burkina Faso and Mali. Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes picked up an injury in the match which will see him sit out training on Thursday. Vilanova's team, under the temporary guidance of assistant Jordi Roura, is looking to continue a run which saw them pick up a record 16 wins from their first 17 league matches of the season. The Espanyol tie will see Argentine star Lionel Messi take to the field for the first time this year, after a record-breaking 2012 which saw him score 91 goals. Barca currently lead second-placed Atletico Madrid, who face Mallorca on Sunday, by nine points, with archrivals Real Madrid a further seven points back. Cruyff described Real's start to the season as a ""failure"", while also questioning coach Jose Mourinho's decision to drop Spanish international goalkeeper Iker Casillas. ""At this stage of the season Real Madrid being 16 points behind Barcelona can only be called a failure,"" Cruyff was reported to have said by Spanish newspaper Marca. On Mourinho favoring Antonio Adan over World Cup winner Casillas, Cruyff commented: ""You don't lose your place overnight.""

"Kurdish Peshmerga fighters claimed to take control Saturday of Sinjar, the northern Iraqi town that ISIS militants stormed this summer causing minority Yazidis to flee into nearby mountains and spawning a humanitarian crisis. The Kurdistan Region Security Council (KRSC) said on Twitter that its forces entered Sinjar district around 1:45 p.m.(9:45 a.m. ET) and, just over an hour later, ""succeeded in taking complete control of it & nearby villages."" The message ended ""#Shingal #Kurds."" Shingal is another name for Sinjar. The advance is the latest in recent days by Kurdish forces against ISIS, which has been blamed for atrocities around the area for its treatment of those by any who resist or don't subscribe to its extremist Islamist beliefs. And few, if any, have gotten worse treatment than the Yazidis -- one of the world's smallest and oldest monotheistic religious minority groups. Yazidis, most of whom are ethnic Kurds, revere an angel figure that some Muslims believe to be the devil. Last summer, ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, according to Vian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament. Women in the group were ""treated like cattle,"" Kurdish Regional Government adviser Nazand Begikhani said. Many were enslaved, raped and sold by ISIS. The town of Sinjar became central to this drama, when Yazidi residents ran for their lives to Sinjar Mountain, just to the north. But they had very little food, medical care or water, shortages compounded by Iraq's intense summer heat. Their dire situation, as well as the harsh treatment they got from ISIS simply due to their religious beliefs, spurred an international coalition to act. This effort began with the airdrop of supplies to Sinjar Mountain. Rescues came next. And now, the U.S.-led coalition is waging regular airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and neighboring Syria -- an air campaign that helped pave the way for the recapture of Sinjar. Fight over Sinjar Mountain, surrounding area . This summer's combination of humanitarian and military efforts helped, as thousands of Yazidis fled on foot to Syria. Still, a few hundred remained on Sinjar Mountain. And ISIS never really went away. In fact, the tug-of-war in the region has continued for months -- prompting a fresh allied onslaught in recent days. Tuesday night, coalition aircraft conducted 48 airstrikes near Sinjar --  the heaviest concentration of such airstrikes to date, according to two U.S. defense officials. Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the KRSC, said Thursday this ground-and-air operation helped ""open ... a corridor from south of Zummar to the Mountain Sinjar,"" giving direct access to those displaced on the mountain and in need of aid. ISIS fighters, meanwhile, fled toward the Syrian border and ISIS strongholds such as Mosul and Tal Afar, the Kurdish agency said. Kurdish agency: 'Morale remains high' The Peshmerga are keeping up the heat. A press release Saturday from the Kurdistan Region Security Council indicated these fighters launched a new phase of the offensive around 8 a.m. (midnight ET) south of Rabia to Sinjar Mountain. Three hours later, the KRSC claimed its forces had taken ""complete control of Mushrefa"" but that they weren't done.

"Turkey is in a tough spot. It has ISIS militants threatening the Syrian border town of Kobani, inching ever closer to confronting Turkish security forces. In addition thousands of Syrian Kurds, fleeing ISIS attacks, have massed along its border, adding further to Ankara's troubles. Amid mounting pressure to become more active in the U.S.-led international coalition against ISIS, the Turkish parliament last week overwhelmingly authorized its military to make incursions into Syria and Iraq; also to allow foreign troops to operate out of Turkish bases. The move has been greeted in Western capitals as a welcome sign that Turkey is finally fully on board with the anti-ISIS coalition. Yet the Turkish parliament's actions herald neither a complete about-face in policy toward Syria nor immediate military action against ISIS. Indeed, Turkey's reasons for joining the war may be more to do with suppressing Kurdish separatists and removing the al-Assad regime than with destroying the jihadist group. Toppling the leadership in Damascus and keeping in check the Syrian Kurds who are closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, have long been Ankara's priorities in Syria. The wording of last week's parliamentary resolution -- which states that ""the terrorist elements of the outlawed PKK still exist in northern Iraq"" -- suggests that Kurdish separatists still remain the Turkish government's top concern. The vote does not signal intervention against ISIS any time soon: despite thousands of Syrian Kurdish refugees and ISIS's fast advance towards Turkey's southern border, Ankara seems unwilling to act. Turkey's defense minister Ismet Yilmaz said: ""Don't expect an imminent step after the approval of the authorization request."" Rather, the Turkish government is likely to give its full cooperation to the campaign against ISIS so that it can secure agreement of a U.S.-backed no-fly zone in Syria: this, Ankara believes, would address both concerns. Turkey thinks that Assad regime's ability to attack mainstream opposition forces from the air has strengthened ISIS, causing the Free Syrian Army to flee and allowing the Islamic militants to capture the vacant territory. Enforcing a no-fly zone over Syria would ground al-Assad's air force and boost rebels fighting to topple him: it could also establish a Turkish military presence, ridding northern Syria of Kurdish fighters linked to the PKK and smothering the autonomous Kurdish region. Turkey has become increasingly uneasy about the emergence of yet another Kurdish entity on its frontier after the PKK-affiliated Syrian Kurdish groups established autonomy in northern Syria. The military and diplomatic boost that the PKK has received through its effective fight against ISIS has also worsened the situation for Ankara. In response to the growing ISIS threat, the PKK, the Peshmerga, and the People's Protection Unit (the PKK-linked Kurdish militia group fighting in Syria), have established a united Kurdish front, with the PKK militants coming to the aid of Peshmerga fighters and halting the jihadi group's advance into the autonomous region of northern Iraq. The People's Protection Unit was the main force battling ISIS, and it helped thousands of Yazidis escape from the western part of the region as ISIS attacked. The PKK has effectively become the West's best hope for on-the-ground troops, winning the group positive reviews in Western media. Since the group started its assault against ISIS in northern Iraq, there has been a lot of talk in Western capitals about removing the PKK from the terror list. The fight against ISIS has also empowered the PKK militarily: Turkey is concerned that that weapons sent to the Peshmerga might ultimately end up in the hands of the PKK at a time when Ankara is moving forward with a deal that would disarm its group. The Turkish government puts the blame for this on the West but Ankara's overtures towards its own Kurdish minority have been mostly strained by its own short-sighted Syria policy. The ongoing conflict around Kobani has underscored the many challenges the Syrian war poses for the peace process Ankara launched in 2012 in an effort to end the 30-year old Kurdish insurgency. The intensified shelling in Kobani has angered Kurds on the Turkish side of the border, who have blamed the Turkish government for allowing ISIS to fester and not doing enough to stop its assault against Kurds. Turkey's reluctance to get involved for fear of empowering Kurdish militants in Turkey is now contributing to the growing discord between Kurds and the government. Last week, after reports that Turkey closed the border gates to impede the flight of Kurds from Kobani, Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK's imprisoned leader, warned that if ISIS carried out a ""massacre"" in Kobani then the peace process with the PKK could end. If engaged by Ankara, the PKK-linked groups in Syria could be integrated into the moderate Syrian opposition and become an effective fighting force against the al-Assad regime. But the Turkish government's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the group signals that such a shift in Ankara's thinking is not in the works. Last week, Erdogan said ""While the ISIS terror organization is causing turmoil in the Middle East, there has been ongoing PKK terror in my country for the last 32 years, and yet the world was never troubled by it. Why? Because this terror organization did not carry the name 'Islam.'"" If Turkey keeps seeing the PKK a bigger threat than ISIS activities in Syria, then the legislation passed last week is unlikely to lead to a deeper involvement of Turkey in the fight against the jihadist group.","Gönül Tol: Turkey may be joining the anti-ISIS coalition to suppress Kurdish separatists .

"It began before dawn: One thousand troops taking up position. The goal? Push ISIS fighters back toward Mosul and farther from Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region. ISIS had already destroyed a bridge linking the two cities a month ago, hoping to prevent any opposing force from advancing on Mosul -- the country's second largest city. But the Kurdish fighting force, known as the Peshmerga, found another way, taking a long route around, traveling on dirt roads through mountainous areas -- first north, then west, then back south, past the bridge. They stopped near villages seized by ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State. Most people had fled or been forced out of the area, the Peshmerga told CNN. Only fighters for the terrorist group and its sympathizers remained. ISIS, also known as ISIL, has seized large swaths of land as part of its effort to create a caliphate -- an Islamic state -- that stretches from western Syria to eastern Iraq. Once the Kurdish forces were in place, the firing began -- a series of loud explosions of mortar and artillery, says CNN producer John Fiegener, who along with CNN correspondent Anna Coren embedded with the Peshmerga. ""Then you hear the aerial bombs, and those are bigger. Then you hear the small arms -- the machine guns."" That sound indicates the Peshmerga forces have reached the areas where ISIS fighters are holed up, he said. It lasted hours. ""You see a lot of fires, smoke coming out -- whether it's a fuel station or a gas tanker."" Hidden bombs and snipers . But ISIS, known for its ferocious acts of terror and military tactics, expected Pesherga forces to arrive at some point, so the militants were prepared with hidden bombs and snipers. ""ISIS had a tanker full of explosives that they tried to drive into the Peshmerga,"" Fiegener says. It caused a ""really huge explosion,"" followed by a ""very large cloud of dust."" The United States played an instrumental role in the operation Tuesday, with airstrikes that shattered some ISIS positions. ""At least two jets were flying the entire time that we were there,"" Fiegener said. There were two U.S. airstrikes northwest of Irbil, according to the U.S. military. That's the same area where the Peshmerga operation was underway. The strikes targeted an armored vehicle and ISIS fighting position, according to the military. The Peshmerga estimated it faced about 100 ISIS fighters, killing between 20 and 30 of them. Six or seven members of the Kurdish forces were killed in explosions, a commander said. The Peshmerga did not say whether they had captured any ISIS fighters. The Kurdish forces took back enough terrain to include the bridge site and nearby villages. ISIS says it downed Syrian fighter jet . But in Syria, ISIS claimed a victory of its own. The group said it shot down a Syrian military fighter jet. Photos distributed by the Reuters news agency and the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights show ISIS fighters posing with pieces of what is described as debris from the aircraft. The observatory, based in London, said the plane was shot down while it was conducting airstrikes on the ISIS stronghold Raqqa, in Syria. The incident came as world leaders worked to develop strategies to combat the terror group, which claims it has established an Islamic caliphate. If ISIS is allowed to fester, it will threaten ""our homeland,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned Congress on Tuesday. U.S. strikes close to Baghdad . U.S. military aircraft targeted ISIS positions southwest of Baghdad for a second day. Three airstrikes targeted ISIS vehicles and weapons, as well as a small ground unit and two small boat on the Euphrates River that was resupplying the extremist fighters, according to the military. President Barack Obama announced last week that the United States would lead ""a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat"" and that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS would expand from Iraq into Syria. The United States has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, which has seized control of large areas of northern Iraq and Syria. But it remains unclear exactly which countries are on that list and what roles they'll play. ISIS put its brutality on display once again over the weekend, posting a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines and threatening the life of another hostage from the United Kingdom. It was the third videotaped killing of a Western hostage released in less than a month. The latest killing, ISIS said, was ""a message to the allies of America."" What will world do about ISIS? How many more Western captives is ISIS holding? What should the world know about Muslims?","U.S. airstrikes hit southwest of Baghdad for a second day, military says .

"Australian number one Bernard Tomic was quick to turn his attention to family matters after pulling out of the French Open saying he still loves his father despite a looming criminal trial. John Tomic will face a Madrid court in October after headbutting his son's training partner Thomas Drouet outside a hotel in the Spanish capital in May. Tomic, who coaches his 20-year-old son, has had his credentials for the men's tour revoked and was banned from attending the French Open at Roland Garros. But his son explained that he is still being coached by his Dad and that he had traveled with him to the second grand slam of the season. ""My Dad is in Paris,"" Tomic told a media conference after retiring from his first-round match against Romanian Victor Hanescu while 7-5 7-6 (8) 2-1 down due to a hamstring injury. ""He's still my Dad and he is still working with me. I love him a lot."" Drouet was left with a broken nose following the incident with Tomic's father in Madrid. Tomic's lawyer Carmen Dieguez said the reason that he used his head to attack Drouet was because the tennis player, 29, was holding the coach's arms at the time and that he was acting in self-defence. The 20-year-old Tomic was facing the media for the first time since the fracas but said: ""I don't really want to talk about the incidents. It's all difficult to put into words and I want you to respect that. ""My Dad will always be my coach. He knows me better than anyone. But I may get someone in to help him and work with us. ""I haven't made a decision yet who. It might be a few weeks away, maybe after the grass,"" added Tomic, referring to the upcoming grass-court season ahead of the Wimbledon Championships which begin in London next month. ""But I'll see. I'd like to get someone in before the grass who can help me and my Dad."" World number 61 Tomic conceded defeat to Hanescu in Paris after suffering a muscle tear in his right hamstring. Tomic broke into the limelight when he reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 2011 as an 18-year-old but he has also been no stranger to controversy with his father during his short career. Croatian-born John, who moved with his family to Australia when his son was three, has been coaching him since he was 13, even though the former taxi driver had no previous tennis experience. In 2009, he was forced to publicly apologize after telling his son to walk off court in the middle of a match against fellow Australian Marinko Matosevic in Perth as he was unhappy with the officiating. Despite the incident resulting in a one-month ban from the International Tennis Federation, a year later Tomic's father was railing at an Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley so vehemently about the scheduling of one of his son's matches that security had to be placed around the official. Last year, the 20-year-old Tomic was booed off court at Wimbledon, picking up a code violation after smashing his racket, as he made a first round exit before then requesting that his father should be ejected from the stands at the Miami Masters later in the year. ""I know he's my father but he's annoying me,"" Bernard stated to the match referee. Tomic's father has often clashed with Tennis Australia, having previously threatened to switch his son's allegiance to Croatia unless his demands were met. Matters seemed to be improving as Bernard won his maiden ATP title in Sydney in January but he has yet to build on his fine record at junior level.","Australian Bernard Tomic says his Dad is still his coach despite being banned from the ATP Tour .

"Roger Federer has become the latest tennis star to turn to a former legend for help with the 17-time grand slam champion adding his ""childhood hero"" Stefan Edberg to his coaching team for the upcoming season. The 32-year-old Swiss announced the move on Facebook, revealing that Swede Edberg will join the team for the first grand slam of 2014 in Australia next month. ""I am happy to announce that beginning in Melbourne, Stefan Edberg will join Severin Luthi on my coaching team,"" Federer posted. ""Severin, who has been part of my team for the last seven years, will do most of the weeks and Stefan has agreed to work with us for at least 10 weeks. ""Stefan was my childhood hero, and I am really looking forward to spending time and learning from him."" Federer endured a difficult 2013 and dispensed with the services of American coach Paul Annacone in October. But Swiss Davis Cup captain Luthi has remained in the fold and told Federer's official website that he was looking forward to working alongside Edberg. ""Like Roger, I have a tremendous amount of respect for Stefan and I am sure he will bring a lot to our team as Roger continues to chase titles in 2014,"" he said. Edberg spent a couple of days with Federer in Dubai earlier this month and his hiring follows a recent trend, started when reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray took on Ivan Lendl before the start of the 2012 season. Six-time grand slam champion Edberg will be hoping that his involvement with Federer will prove as successful. ""I'm really excited to be part of Roger's team and I hope together we can bring out his best tennis,"" he told Federer's official website. Others leading stars have also followed suit although Maria Sharapova's association with Jimmy Connors lasted just one match. Earlier this month, ATP World Tour Finals champion Novak Djokovic hired German great Boris Becker to his coaching team. Former French Open Michael Chang is helping Kei Nishikori of Japan while another clay court ace, Sergi Bruguera, is in Richard Gasquet's team. Becker has been watching Djokovic in action this week at the big exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi and the Serbian reached the final Friday with a 7-6 6-3 win over Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He will play David Ferrer, who upset fellow Spaniard and world number one Rafael Nadal with a 6-4 6-4 win on a fast indoor surface. Djokovic, who ended 2013 with 24 straight wins, revealed he will not play any further warm up events ahead of his defense of the Australian crown. But he believes Becker's experience will take him to even greater heights next year. ""He had a great serve and he can help me in different parts of my game on court as well, including the mental aspect,"" Djokovic told gathered reporters. Meanwhile Murray, returning after injury wrecked the back end of his 2013 campaign, finished fifth in the six-man field when he beat Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3 6-4.","Stefan Edberg joins Roger Federer's coaching team .

"Reluctant approval from Congress for providing military support to Syrian rebels allows the Obama administration to move forward with plans first announced almost six weeks ago. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday that the goal of the military aid expected to include small arms, ammunition and perhaps anti-tank weapons is to keep the Syrian opposition going against forces aligned with President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Noting al-Assad's forces have been helped by Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as Iran, Carney said Syrian rebels need the help of the United States and allied nations to withstand an increased assault. ""The aid is intended to help the opposition resist Assad and eventually prevail,"" Carney said, adding that any resolution of Syria's civil war will require a political transition. His comment appeared intended to soften any expectations that the rebels could topple the regime by military means alone. A source, speaking on condition of being identified only as an official, said Monday that President Barack Obama can begin acting on plans for increased Syrian aid first made public last month now that concerns of Congress had been resolved. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers said Monday that his panel agreed to the administration's plan for military aid despite reservations about its chances for success. ""After much discussion and review, we got a consensus that we could move forward with what the administration's plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations,"" the Michigan Republican said. At a congressional hearing on Tuesday on next year's defense budget, GOP Rep. Rich Nugent of Florida said he worried that arming Syria rebels today could mean his sons in the military might face those weapons in the future, if they fall into the wrong hands. ""We want to make sure that we don't put our sons or daughters in any jeopardy particularly as it relates to arming those that we have no idea who they are,"" Nugent said. The Obama administration has been reluctant to enter another military engagement, but announced on June 13 that it would provide military support to rebel fighters because al-Assad's forces had used chemical weapons. Its plans so far stop short of calls by some in Congress, such as veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, to establish a ""no-fly"" zone over Syria. In a letter released Monday, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey warned U.S. military involvement would likely cost billions of dollars and include a range of risks for the forces involved. Eddie Izzard: In Syrian refugee camps, another day of childhood is lost . ""It is no less than an act of war,"" Dempsey wrote to Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. The United States has learned from the past 10 years ""that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state,"" Dempsey's letter said in apparent reference to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Syrian opposition questions Taliban rebel role . McCain, who has long advocated arming Syrian rebels, said Tuesday he was disappointed by Dempsey's letter. ""Most military experts that I know totally disagree"" with Dempsey's assessment of the size of the task and U.S. capabilities, McCain said. ""The question should be is the status quo acceptable and obviously that is not."" Last month, McCain called for taking out al-Assad's air assets to create a safe zone for the Syrian opposition. ""I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly' zone, to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are, and establish a 'no-fly' zone with Patriot missiles,"" McCain said in June. ""And if we can't do that, then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer, to the Pentagon, 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we can't even take care of this situation?'"" McCain said. Dempsey: Syria intervention is ""act of war"" that could cost billions . More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian crisis began in March 2011, while refugees fleeing the conflict threaten to overtax government services and destabilize neighboring Jordan. In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry met Tuesday with U.N. agencies and other international aid organizations to discuss challenges to addressing what he called a humanitarian crisis. ""We are having a very difficult time being able to access people, move people directly and protect people so we intend to have a very solid, in-depth discussion today about creative ways that we can meet our obligations to human beings who are in huge danger and distress,"" Kerry said. He noted his visit this week to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan where he said he witnessed ""the dramatic and unbelievably moving ways in which people are separated from homes and family, so many people murdered and killed in massacres and yet somehow these people try to pull themselves together.""

"Washington (CNN)The straight talking governor is suddenly mealy-mouthed over measles. As he toured the United Kingdom on Monday, Chris Christie seemed to leave his tough guy persona back in the United States. The potential Republican 2016 presidential contender punted on questions about whether Americans should vaccinate their kids amid a 14-state outbreak of a disease which is staging a comeback after being largely eradicated by science. ""All I can say is we vaccinated ours,"" Christie said, while touring a biomedical research facility in Cambridge, England, which makes vaccines. The New Jersey governor added that ""parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide."" Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids? The meandering response trampled his message on a trip apparently meant to polish foreign policy credentials. And it was uncharacteristic for Christie, a political bruiser who regularly shouts down critics and, just a few months ago, defied the White House by forcibly quarantining a nurse who treated Ebola patients. WATCH: Obama: Vaccinate your kids . The flap is a reminder that as a politician who made his name by telling it like it is, Christie will be carefully watched for any sign he is toning down his act or hedging on difficult issues as he tries to navigate the early skirmishes of a likely presidential campaign. With Democrats pouncing on a new chance to brand Christie as ""anti-science"" and reporters jumping on a story that livened up a routine trade mission, the Christie camp rushed out an unusual clarification. ""To be clear: the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,"" said Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts. ""At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate."" The episode hit the headlines because federal health officials are expressing alarm that a spate of measles cases is being fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules. The United States is one of the most vaccinated nations in the world. Experts note that infants face more than 20 shots before they are 18 months old and some parents question the speed and utility of all the doses. Claims picked up by the so-called anti-vaxxer movement, now debunked by scientific research, argue that shots can cause childhood autism and other unintended side effects. So it's not surprising that politicians should face questions about the issue --  especially if they are a governor who is thinking of running for president. Christie seems to have been tripped up more by policy than substance. When he spoke with nuance, it came across as a political calculation because his careful remarks contrasted with his own tendency to talk most of the time in an unmistakeably blunt way. ""Get the hell off the beach ... and get out, you're done,"" Christie, for instance, once told people he saw on news footage who had yet to take Hurricane Irene's approach seriously in 2011. So his equivocation on Monday raised questions over his motives. Was Christie for instance fudging on an issue that could play into suspicions of government mandates - in health care, education and other areas -- that could animate the 2016 Republican primary race? There is, after all, precedent for a vaccination flap having political reverberations in a primary race. Then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry came under fire in 2012 from Republican opponents who opposed his executive order requiring girls to be vaccinated against human papillomavirus, which spreads through sexual transmission. Social conservatives opposed making the shot mandatory for girls as young as 11. Another candidate, Michele Bachmann, helped torpedo her own campaign by suggesting the drug could cause ""mental retardation."" Christie is not the only candidate being forced to weigh in on the vaccinations debate which looks set to rumble through the 2016 campaign. Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a physician, said he thought vaccinations were a good thing but parents should have some input in how they are used. He told CNBC he had staggered a program of doses for his children when they were newborns. And he added that he had heard of ""many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."" Another potential Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was quoted by Buzzfeed.com as saying that ""vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense."" But she added: ""I do think parents have to make those choices."" Christie's struggles in getting his own message across may have several explanations, not all political. He could simply have been caught off guard in a place far from the early skirmishes of the Republican presidential sweepstakes. Or perhaps he was off his game, when appearing before a small traveling press pack, after battling a five-hour time difference to stay up late to watch the Super Bowl. But the episode is a reminder of the perils facing a politician who prizes speaking off the cuff. ""Is he going to have to be clarifying his comments all the time?"" said Jonathan Jaffe, a communications consultant who publishes a daily newsletter on New Jersey politics. MAP: The measles outbreak . ""Christie is a very casual speaker. He talks a lot of the time off the top of his head,"" Jaffe said, saying that quality could become a liability when every word is parsed by political journalists or opponents. Indeed, candidates like Christie who build a brand on straight talk, often face extra scrutiny when they appear to hedge on an argument. ""It depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest,"" Christie said, trying to explain his initial quote. ""I didn't say I'm leaving people the option. What I'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns."" He went on: ""Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that's what I mean by that so that I'm not misunderstood."" Christie's remarks, for once, were not as direct as those of the more professorial President Barack Obama, who touched on the issue in a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC. ""There is every reason to get vaccinated but there aren't reasons to not,"" said Obama, adding ""the science is pretty indisputable."" Taken out of their political context, Christie's remarks seem a lot less contentious. Mark Largent, a Michigan State University professor who wrote a book about the vaccination debate in modern America, said that issues like inoculation schedules tend to be seen as a barometer for candidates on wider issues of scientific and medical issues. He says the debate is a rare one which cuts across political divides. On the right, objectors tend to sense the overweening hand of big government and infringments on individual liberties.  On the left, suspicion is driven by skepticism about the motives of the pharmaceutrical industry, he said. The result is a debate in which legitimate concerns can be drowned out by politics. Christie ""is very moderate in what he is saying, but he is going to get pummeled as anti-vaccine,"" Largent said. Christie's comments may also be conditioned by his time in New Jersey where there has been a spirited debate over the issue, with activists complaining about what they say are the nation's most expansive mandates for child vaccines. The Daily Beast reported on Monday that as far back as his first gubernatorial campaign in 2009, Christie expressed sympathy for parents of autistic children who wanted more input over which vaccines were administered to kids. The speed with which Christie's camp rushed to put out Monday's storm appeared to signal that the governor was not making some sort of clever play for government-hating activists on the conservative right -- a sector of the Republican Party where he must make inroads. But Democrats wouldn't give him a break, giving him a dose of his own tough talk. ""Chris Christie isn't a scientist. He isn't a doctor. And he sure as heck isn't a leader,"" said Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee.","Measles flap stamps on Christie message in UK .

"Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in Syria since unrest began in the country two years ago, according to the latest estimate from the United Nations. And that might actually be an underestimate.

"The United States has evidence that the chemical weapon sarin has been used in Syria on a small scale, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday. But numerous questions remain about the origins of the chemical and what effect its apparent use could have on the ongoing Syrian civil war and international involvement in it. When asked whether the intelligence community's conclusion pushed the situation across President Barack Obama's ""red line"" that could trigger more U.S. involvement in the war, Hagel said it's too soon to say. ""We need all the facts. We need all the information,"" he said. ""What I've just given you is what our intelligence community has said they know.  As I also said, they are still assessing, and they are still looking at what happened, who was responsible and the other specifics that we'll need."" In a letter sent to lawmakers before Hagel's announcement, the White House said that intelligence analysts have concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in Syria, specifically the chemical agent sarin."" The White House cautioned that the ""chain of custody"" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Read the letter to Sen. Carl Levin (PDF) But, the letter said, ""we do believe that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would very likely have originated with the Assad regime."" The Syrian government has been battling a rebellion for more than two years, bringing international condemnation of the regime and pleas for greater international assistance. The United Nations estimated in February that more than 70,000 people had died since the conflict began. Caution urged . The Obama administration said it is working to gather more information on the reports and is calling for a full-scale United Nations investigation into what may have happened. ""Given the stakes involved, and what we have learned from our own recent experience, intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient -- only credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision-making,"" the letter said. What's next in Syria . State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the U.S. is working with its allies to get to the bottom of what may have happened. He said the intelligence assessments were ""not the final corroborative facts we're looking for."" ""We want the highest possible level of confidence because of the seriousness of the matter,"" he said. Lawmakers call for action . After the announcement, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the United States needs to take action, but offered different proposals for what the next steps should be. ""It is clear that 'red lines' have been crossed and action must be taken to prevent larger-scale use,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said in a statement. ""Syria has the ability to kill tens of thousands with its chemical weapons. The world must come together to prevent this by unified action which results in the secure containment of Syria's significant stockpile of chemical weapons."" Rep. Eliot Engel, D-New York, said the U.S. government -- which currently supplies ""nonlethal aid"" to Syrian rebels -- must start ""to immediately arm vetted elements of the Syrian opposition."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, urged the administration to work for the establishment of a safe zone for Syrian rebels. ""Everything that the non-interventionists said would happen in Syria if we intervened has happened,"" he said. ""The jihadists are on the ascendency, there is chemical weapons being used, the massacres continue. ""The president of the United States said that if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons that it would be a game changer, that it would cross a red line,"" the Arizona senator said. ""I think it is pretty obvious that red line has been crossed."" Later, McCain said the reported use of chemical weapons was only a matter of time and that the United States ""should have intervened a long time ago whether Bashar al-Assad was using them or not."" ""No one should be surprised that he would do such a thing. We all know he will do whatever's necessary to hang on to power,"" McCain told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. ""And why should, frankly, chemical weapons be a red line when he's slaughtering and massacring, raping and torturing, his own people?"" Searching for evidence . The White House letter, signed by legislative affairs director Miguel Rodriguez, indicates that the assessment is based ""in part on physiological samples."" On Wednesday, Syrian Free Army leader Gen. Salim Idriss told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in several places, including Homs, Aleppo and Otaiba, near Damascus. Idriss said rebel forces had some of the people reportedly exposed to chemical weapons examined by doctors, and they took soil and blood samples. ""And the samples were tested, it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons,"" he said. The British Foreign Office said Thursday that it had ""limited but persuasive"" evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, and it urged al-Assad to allow unfettered access for international investigators. Ventrell told reporters on Thursday that allowing a team of U.N. experts to investigate would be the ""most direct way"" to find out what happened. ""We have the U.N. ready to deploy inspectors on a couple of days notice. We're already pre-deploying out in the field near Syria and ready to go in,"" he said. ""And you have the regime resisting a full and thorough and credible investigation within Syria. So we urge the regime to allow these inspectors in. That currently is the most direct route to getting to the bottom of what may have occurred."" Read the letter to McCain (PDF) NATO leaders discuss the issue . The administration disclosure comes two days after Secretary of State John Kerry urged NATO members to prepare for the possible use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, while Russia's foreign minister accused the West of politicizing the search for such weapons, comparing it to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Tuesday that reports of chemical weapons in Syria must be carefully investigated to avoid a repetition of the ""Iraqi scenario"" in which unconfirmed allegations that the regime of Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction were the basis for the U.S.-led invasion. He accused Western nations of trying to ""politicize the issue"" and broadening the investigation. Experts were supposed to be sent to Syria to study the possible use of chemical weapons in Aleppo. Instead, Lavrov said, investigators demanded access to all facilities in Syria and the right to interview all Syrian citizens. ""I believe that is too much,"" he said. NATO remains conflicted about Syria's two-year civil war. While members are concerned about the mounting causalities, millions of refugees and the potential for a wider regional spillover, they are loath to become embroiled in another Middle Eastern conflict. Israeli evidence . Earlier this week an Israeli intelligence official said Damascus was using weapons banned under international law against its own people in the country's civil war. On Wednesday, Israeli President Shimon Peres said that he expected the United States to fall in line with its estimate on chemical weapons use in Syria. ""I think the United States and us and others will do whatever we can to meet this very dangerous weapon,"" he said. ""The sooner the better."" Syria has said it is rebels who have used chemical weapons. Explainer: Chemical weapons frightful, relatively inexpensive . Sarin gas is an odorless nerve agent that can cause convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure. Nerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sarin quickly evaporates from liquid to vapor form to disperse into the environment. It also mixes easily with water and can poison a water supply.","Democrat and Republican lawmakers call for action, but differ on what next steps should be .

"President Barack Obama's administration is trying to open channels of communication with Iran regarding the war on ISIS. Amid revelations that Obama sent a letter to Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last month pointing out the countries' shared interest in beating ISIS, a senior U.S. official and a Western diplomat tell CNN that Washington has gone through the Iraqis to communicate with Iran. The conversations do not include taking joint military action against ISIS targets, the sources said, but are seen as necessary to avert conflict in U.S. and Iranian operations. Senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer wouldn't address specific outreach efforts in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, but said: ""We work very closely with the Iraqis and the Iraqis have a relationship with the Iranians."" The discussions through the Iraqis are informal and conducted on a case-by-case basis via the Iraqi military, the sources said. The channels have become necessary, the U.S. military official said, because the United States and Iran are now operating in the same spaces. As a result, ""accommodations must be made indirectly,"" this official said. This includes airspace management, so U.S. and Iranian forces do not conflict while carrying out military operations in the same airspace, CNN was told. The revelation of the communications channel comes even as the military and administration continue to insist it is not cooperating with the Iranians on strategy or intelligence. ""With respect to Iran, we're not coordinating with Iran, as you know,"" said Gen. Lloyd Austin, the head of U.S. Central Command, at an event moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday, when asked how the United States prevents any accidental killing of Iranians who are on the ground advising Iraqi forces. The White House also stressed it is not working alongside the Iranian military. ""The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran in that effort. We won't share intelligence with them,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday when asked about another communication between President Obama and Iran's Supreme Leader. Earnest would not acknowledge Obama's letter, saying he would not talk about the ""private correspondence"" of the President. ""I can tell you that the policy that the President and his administration have articulated about Iran remains unchanged. The United States is engaged in conversations with Iran in the context of the P-5-plus-1 talks to resolve the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,"" Earnest said. ""We have also discussed on the sidelines of those talks on at least a couple of occasions, the ongoing campaign that is being conducted against ISIL by the United States and 60 members of -- now more than 60 -- members who are part of this broader coalition."" Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham blasted the Obama administration, saying it's ""outrageous"" to reach out to the ""same Iranian regime that has been complicit in the rise of ISIS by pushing a violent sectarian agenda throughout the Middle East."" ""The administration needs to understand that this Iranian regime cares more about trying to weaken America and push us out of the Middle East than cooperating with us,"" McCain and Graham said in a joint statement. ""Until we recognize that reality, and formulate a regional strategy to counter the Iranian regime's malign influence, we will continue to harm U.S. national security interests, as well as our relationships with our closest regional allies and partners, in pursuit of the illusory goal of rapprochement with the current Iranian leadership. The consequences of this ill-conceived bargain would destroy the Syrians' last best chance to live in freedom from the brutal Assad regime."" ISIS kills 300 members of Sunni tribe . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S.-Iran nuclear talks aren't linked to U.S. cooperation with Iran in combating ISIS. ""We don't look at it as a linked situation,"" she said. ""Our concerns about Iran's engagement are more expansive than that. Obviously, we understand that they have concerns about the threat of ISIL, which they have expressed as well, but I would not look at it as a path to a different type of coordination."" While the United States acknowledged notifying Iran before striking in Syria earlier this year, administration officials have said there is no cooperation between the countries in combating ISIS.  Secretary of State John Kerry said there would be no ""cooperation,"" but the United States wanted to ""de-conflict."" ""The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran in that effort. We won't share intelligence with them. But their interests in the outcome is something that's been widely commented on -- commented upon and something that on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations,"" Earnest said. Central Command general to ISIS: We can hear you . While there are many other concerning aspects of Iranian behavior for the United States, including human rights and Americans in captivity, the nuclear deal is seen as the major impediment, one of the sources said. The administration did not notify its Mideast allies in Israel or the Gulf about the letter, the other source said. In September, Khamenei said he rejected U.S. overtures to join the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. Report: Children say ISIS captured, beat them on way home from exams . In comments released by Iran's FARS news agency, Khamenei detailed what he called ""U.S. demands for cooperation."" ""During the hard days of Daesh's attacks on Iraq, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq demanded our envoy in the country (Iraq) that Iran and the U.S. meet for negotiations and coordination on Daesh,"" Khamenei said, using a derogatory nickname for ISIS. ""Our ambassador reflected the issue to Iran and although some officials didn't voice opposition, I opposed it and said we will not cooperate with the Americans in this regard since they have a corrupt intention and stained hands and how could we have cooperation with the Americans under such conditions?"" Referring to Kerry's comments that Iran would not be invited to join the anti-ISIS coalition, Khamenei said, according to FARS, ""The same U.S. secretary of state had personally demanded (Iranian Foreign Minister) Dr. (Mohammad Javad) Zarif, and called for cooperation with us on Daesh but Dr. Zarif had rejected his demand.""  He added that Acting Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator in the nuclear talks, ""repeated the same demand for cooperation with Iran"" with her counterparts. Opinion: Why West must roll back military involvement in Iraq, Syria . Obama has made at least two other overtures to the Supreme Leader since taking office in 2009. News of the letter angered congressional opponents of a nuclear deal with Iran. They are already deeply discomforted by details of a possible agreement that have been emerging ahead of an end-of-November deadline. One senior GOP congressional staffer told CNN's Stephen Collinson that the letter was sending ""shock waves"" through Capitol Hill and suggested it would also anger Israel and U.S. allies in the Middle East who think the President is already going behind their backs to negotiate a ""bad deal"" with Iran.","Sources say Obama noted Iran, U.S. both interested in defeating ISIS .

As a child, Woods wanted to be a teacher, but her mother steered her toward a singing and radio career, according to a Disney biography. She had a weekly radio show in 1944 in New York and had worked with Bing Crosby and Al Jolson, among others, by the time she turned 18, Disney says. She was chosen from among 400 hopefuls to voice Cinderella. Walt Disney told Woods that Cinderella was his favorite Disney heroine, the Disney biography says. ""Once I went into his office and he said to me, 'You're my favorite heroine, you know,'"" the bio quotes her as saying. ""I said, 'You mean Cinderella?' 'Yes,' he said. 'There's something about that story I associate with.'"" ""I think it was the rags-to-riches tale,"" Woods says in the bio. ""Of course, then I didn't know how many times Walt had risked it all to realize his dreams."" In addition to her work on Cinderella, Woods appeared on television on ""The Steve Allen Show"" and ""The Garry Moore Show,"" among other programs.

""The video CLEARLY depicts the beheadings of these victims,"" Catholic Online said. ""DO NOT follow the link unless you are over the age of 18, and are prepared to view content of this nature.""

Read more: Returning to Syria's ghost town . Christians in Syria have been caught in the crossfire of the country's civil war, in which a government dominated by minority Alawite Muslims is squaring off with a rebellion dominated by Sunni Muslims. They've also faced hostility in other places, such as Iraq during the war last decade and in Egypt in recent years. Last week, the Vatican noted the monk's death in a news release, saying it occurred June 23 in Gassanieh -- a predominantly Christian village in the district of Jisr al-Shughur in the province of Idlib, near the border with Turkey. ""The village had been under attack from Islamist rebels for the past few weeks, forcing the majority of the population to flee,"" the Vatican said, citing the Rev. Pierbattista Pizzaballa, head of all Franciscans in the Holy Land. ""When Fr. Francois tried to oppose resistance to defend the nuns and other people, the guerrillas shot him, killing him,"" it said. The violence in Syria since March 2011 has been well-recorded in homemade videos that have surfaced daily. Constant examples of brutality by President Bashar al-Assad's forces have emerged. Over the past year, there also have been a growing number of images showing rebel brutality. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which began as peaceful opposition to the al-Assad regime. As the regime cracked down on the protesters, the conflict morphed into a full-blown civil war.","Catholic Online: ""Martyrdom isn't an ancient phenomenon""

"(CNN)Serena Williams needed a coffee to go with her ""bagel"" in order to help United States see off Italy 3-0 at the Hopman Cup Monday. Williams, who was representing her nation in Perth alongside John Isner, began proceedings with a victory over Flavia Pennetta. The World No. 1, however, was not her usual self in the opening stages as she lost  the first set of the match to love -- a ""bagel"" --  leading her to request an espresso to help blow away the cobwebs. The hot drink seemed to do the trick, as Williams went on to dominate Pennetta, dropping just three more games and going on to win 0-6 6-3 6-0. The 33-year-old finished up with five aces and 31 winners to help make up for the 38 unforced errors in her first match of the new season. ""I wanted coffee with my bagel and whatever coffee it was, it was really good,"" Williams said in an on-court interview afterwards. ""I'm so jet lagged and Flavia played really, really well. And yeah, everyone needs coffee every now and then. I needed coffee to get my feet moving."" Williams had asked a ball girl to get her the espresso, though she was unsure as to whether she would even be allowed to drink it. ""I just asked them to get me a shot of espresso. I asked them if it was legal, because I've never done it before,"" she added to reporters. ""I am a coffee drinker. I didn't have mine this morning and I was just feeling it, so I just had to get some coffee into me."" After Williams had set U.S. on their way, Isner secured the win over Italy by defeating Fabio Fognini 7-5 5-7 7-6 (7-4).

"A lawyer representing the father of Australia's top-rated tennis player Bernard Tomic says John Tomic was acting in self-defense when he headbutted his son's training partner Thomas Drouet on Saturday. On Monday, John Tomic, who is also his 20-year-old son's coach, denied a charge of assault in a Madrid court which ruled that a judge will decide his guilt or innocence at a hearing on May 14. The incident -- which resulted in a broken nose for the Monegasque Drouet -- took place on Saturday afternoon outside the hotel in the Spanish capital where players were staying for the Madrid Masters. Bernard was in town to contest the tournament only to suffer a first round at the hands of Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic. ""I don't feel guilty. I did not do anything wrong,"" Tomic Senior told reporters of the fight. His lawyer Carmen Dieguez said the reason that Tomic Snr used his head, rather than his arms, to attack Drouet was because the tennis player, 29, was holding the coach's arms at the time. In a statement, Tennis Australia said they were awaiting further details before discussing the incident. ""Obviously media reports regarding a recent incident are very concerning,"" the country's governing tennis body said. ""We are working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident and are unable to comment further until the full facts are known."" The incident continues the mixed career of Bernard Tomic, ranked 53rd in the world, and who was dropped from his Davis Cup side earlier in the year for what Australia captain Pat Rafter called a lack of professionalism. The youngster, who broke into the limelight when reaching the quarterfinals of Wimbledon as an 18-year-old, is no stranger to controversy involving his father, with the duo having been involved in several incidents. Croatian-born John, who moved with his family to Australia when Bernard was three, has been coaching his son since he was 13, even though a man who used to drive taxis for a living had no previous tennis experience. In 2009, John was forced to publicly apologize after telling his son to walk off court in the middle of a match against fellow Australian Marinko Matosevic in Perth as he was unhappy with the officiating. Despite the incident resulting in a one-month ban from the International Tennis Federation, John was up to old his tricks a year later -- railing at Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley so vehemently about the scheduling of one of his son's matches that security was ultimately placed around the official. Last year, Tomic Junior was booed off court at Wimbledon, picking up a code violation after smashing his racket, as he made a first round exit before then requesting that his father should be ejected from the stands at the Miami Masters later in the year. ""I know he's my father but he's annoying me,"" Bernard, who was ranked as high as world no. 27 last year, stated to the match referee. Tomic Senior has often clashed with Tennis Australia, having previously threatened to switch his son's allegiance to Croatia unless his demands are met. Matters seemed to be improving as Bernard won his maiden ATP title in January but this latest incident appears to be yet another setback in a stop-start career for a player with a fine record at junior level.","Lawyer representing John Tomic says tennis player's father attacked Drouet in self-defense .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Bhutanese refugees began arriving in the United States on Tuesday, the first wave of what the United Nations describes as one of the world's largest resettlement efforts. The U.S. has offered to resettle 60,000 of the estimated 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now living in seven U.N. camps in southeastern Nepal -- their home for the past 17 years. Six other nations -- Australia, Canada, Norway, Netherlands, New Zealand and Denmark -- have offered to resettle 10,000 each. ""Once they arrive, they will be sent to different cities around the U.S.,"" said David Derthick, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, which is screening and transporting the refugees. The first group, arriving throughout the week, includes 121 refugees. They are being sent to New York; Chicago, Illinois; Syracuse, New York; St. Louis, Missouri; and other cities, the International Organization for Migration said. The United Nations said several families had arrived in New York as of Tuesday, and more are en route to locations in Texas, Arizona and Maryland. So far, however, only about 25,000 of the refugees have registered for resettlement, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Web site, and not many more than 10,000 are expected to leave Nepal by the end of the year. Bhutan, wedged between China and India, is a Buddhist kingdom about half the size of the U.S. state of Indiana. It's considered one of the world's most isolated countries and the government strictly regulates foreign influences, including tourism, to preserve the country's Buddhist culture.  See Bhutan on a map » . The country had no electricity, paved roads, cars, telephones or postal service until the 1960s. It allowed access to television and the Internet only in 1999. Bhutan stripped the minority ethnic Nepalis of their citizenship and forced them into exile in the early 1990s, allegedly in an attempt to ensure a homogenous culture, according to the independent, nongovernmental group Human Rights Watch. Many of the Nepalis have taken up arms and joined with violent Maoist rebels, the group said. The refugees claim they were forced to leave Bhutan by security forces, but Bhutan has disputed whether all are truly refugees. Some 15 rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan have failed to resolve the issue. The United States' resettlement plan has divided the refugee community, as members disagree over whether it is best to resettle in the United States or hang onto hopes of returning to Bhutan. A report posted on the UNHCR Web site quotes refugees who have chosen to go to the United States. ""We chose to resettle because there was no other outlet,"" said refugee Jay Narayan Adhikari. ""Talks between Nepal and Bhutan have produced no results."" ""Everyone says 'America, America, America,' but I don't know much about it,"" said his wife, Sita, according to the U.N. report. ""It's only for the sake of the children that we are ready to go."" Nearby, the Bajgai family was separating because of its large size. Three children were leaving first, to be joined by the others later, the report said. Two of the daughters were crying as they packed their bags, but their mother told them: ""Why are you crying? We have nothing here anyway. We will join you soon. Our future will be brighter there."" Of the 25,000 who have registered for resettlement, more than 12,000 names have been submitted for consideration for host countries, mainly the United States, the UNHCR said. More refugees are expected to register after they hear how those in the first group have been integrated into new homes, it said. Bhutan became the world's newest democracy on Monday when an election ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the South Asian nation.  Watch Bhutanese line up to vote » . Officials in Bhutan declared the first elections in the Himalayan kingdom a resounding success. Officials said 79.4 percent of the country's 318,465 registered voters went to the polls -- a surprisingly large turnout for a populace that had largely said they preferred to remain under the rule of their revered king. But many Bhutanese changed their minds after former King Jigme Singye Wangchuck went around the country pitching his case for the elections. E-mail to a friend .

"Maria Sharapova certainly means business when she steps onto a tennis court. Whatever the situation, winning or losing, there is no let-up. A big serve, blistering ground strokes, winning points often greeted with a clenched fist and shrieks of exultation. Opponents are not so much beaten as bludgeoned into submission -- although at the handshake Sharapova is never less than courteous and sporting, the intensity replaced by a smile. It's a winning formula that has brought the 24-year-old Russian three grand slam titles and made her the highest-paid sportswoman in the world, with an eight-year Nike deal worth a reported $70 million. Sharapova: Serving social media or backhanded marketing? She can return to the top of the world rankings by winning Saturday's Australian Open final, capping a remarkable comeback after injuries almost ended her career. With such a hunger for success, it's no surprise that Sharapova pays great attention to every aspect of her performance -- and that extends to her on-court appearance and apparel. ""When you look good, you feel good,"" she told CNN. ""Confidence with what you're wearing is very important. If you feel good, you will always perform your best without worrying about anything."" A shrewd businesswoman off the court, Sharapova took matters into her own hands with her own range of clothing and footwear, which has developed into a successful commercial venture. The Maria Sharapova Collection is made in collaboration with her sportswear sponsors and leading fashion house Cole Haan. First launched at the Australian Open two years ago, the design brief is to come up with a separate outfit for each grand slam. This year's offering in Melbourne is called ""The Statement Slam."" Sharapova has already made a big statement by beating Petra Kvitova, her conqueror in last year's Wimbledon final, to set up a title clash with Victoria Azarenka. Maybe, just maybe, the outfit played its part. The PR handout from Nike would certainly have us believe it. ""The carefully-constructed vents with mesh inlays along the bodice reflect the breathable gills of a powerful shark or super-charged race car and help keep Sharapova cool and ready to attack. Contrast color in the mesh becomes a stealth weapon to distract the opponent."" Whatever the hype, a great deal of work goes into the final product, with the process starting up to 18 months before it is unveiled and made available to the general public. Sharapova is intimately involved in the design process of the outfit to which she lends her name, coming up with sketches and design ideas. ""It's exciting to see my collections in the store,"" she said. ""What's even more thrilling is to see women wearing and loving the product. If I can create something that allows a woman to feel better -- that is the true reward."" Several young female players on the WTA Tour sport her collection in tournament play, including Sofia Arvidsson, Kai-Chen Chang, Indy De Vroome, Andrea Hlavackova, Madison Keys and Anastasia Pivovarova. In fact, her reputation for fashion sense is already legendary among the game's elite. When Rafael Nadal was questioned at the Australian Open about the design of his training top, the world No. 2 owned up. ""I'm not Sharapova,"" the Spaniard told reporters.  ""Maria is doing it. I just say, 'I like, I don't like!' "" Don Hightower, the president of major U.S. retailer Tennis Warehouse, told CNN that the clothing range was well thought out. ""It's the perfect combination of fashion and function. Maria's dress has become consistently more marketable over the last few years,"" he said. But she faces as much competition off the court as on it. Especially among the women, the leading tennis players are battling for world domination in the fashion stakes. The Williams sisters Serena and Venus have their own ranges, while recently-deposed No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has paired with British designer Stella McCartney to produce eye-catching outfits. Hightower said his outlets see a spike during the grand slams as customers want to purchase the latest ranges, but noted that the Sharapova-led Nike offering is ""the clear leader in women's tennis apparel."" Sharapova has history in setting fashion trends -- the diamond-encrusted 'Little Black Dress"" she wore on the way to winning the 2006 U.S. Open was widely acclaimed. At the time, Nike did not market the outfit for wider distribution, but the company is determined to avoid a repeat and capitalize on Sharapova's global appeal. Her collaboration with Cole Haan has extended to an exclusive range of women's fashion clothing and a series of glitzy publicity launches. It undoubtedly helps that Sharapova -- at 1.88 meters (six foot two inches) -- has the natural height of a supermodel and is the perfect showcase for her creations. ""Since I was young, the artistic expression that fashion embodies has inspired me,"" Sharapova said. ""It's a way to communicate oneself."" When Sharapova does decide to hang up her rackets, it is fair to assume that she will utilize her flair for design and business savvy to extend her fashion empire. She would follow legendary style names such as 1930s tennis icons Henri Lacoste and Fred Perry, while of the more recently retired stars Martina Hingis has a new collection set to hit the stores. For now, tennis takes precedence, and success in the 2012 season is a priority. ""I'm focused on going out every day and doing my best,"" Sharapova said. Of that there is no doubt.","Maria Sharapova has designed her own clothing for grand slams since 2010 .

"(CNN)The door is open, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to Jews worldwide. ""Extremist Islamic terrorism has struck Europe again, this time in Denmark,"" he said Sunday. ""We are preparing and calling for the absorption of mass immigration from Europe. To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms."" Netanyahu extended the invitation after violent acts of anti-Semitism, most recently the killing of two people in Copenhagen, one at a free-speech forum and the second outside a synagogue. The Israeli Prime Minister did the same thing in January after terrorists killed 19 people over three days in Paris, including during an attack on a Kosher grocery. Another reminder of anti-Semitism came Monday when it was announced five teens were charged with vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in France. With occurrences of anti-Semitism putting many in Europe on edge, will Netanyahu's words resonate with Danish Jews? Chief Rabbi of Cophenhagen Jan Melchior said no and struck a defiant tone Monday. ""We will not let terror dictate our lives,"" he said. ""We will not. We will continue living as Jews here in Denmark and everywhere else in the world."" However, many European Jews are voting for Israel with their feet, according to the website for The Jewish Agency, the liaison group between Israel and Jews worldwide. Nearly 7,000 people moved from France to Israel in 2014, making France the top country of origin for immigrating Jews for the first time, the TJA website said. That's up dramatically from 3,400 French Jews in 2013 and 1,900 in 2012, TJA said. Inquiries by French Jews shot up 300% after the January attacks, TJA said last month in a press release, with 80% of the calls coming from Paris. ""It's meteoric,"" TJA Global Center Director Yossi Leibovitz said. Figures on Danish immigration and actual immigrations in 2015 were not provided. Overall, 26,500 people immigrated to Israel in 2014, a 32% spike over 2013. Cyril Berdugo told CNN he grew up in France but left for the United States a few years ago because of increasing violence against Jewish people, from murders to people being beaten in the streets for wearing the Star of David or a yarmulke or ""because they are apparently Jews."" ""I told my family anti-Semitism was being impossible in France, it was being an intolerable situation in France,"" he said. ""I told my parents I would leave so I could express my Judaism in a very free way here in the United States."" He said his family members stayed in France because they didn't want to uproot their lives, having lived there for decades. Jewish citizens are an integral part of the country, French and Danish leaders say. French President Francois Hollande spoke broadly to French Jews last month at a ceremony marking the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp near the end of World War II, saying, ""You, French people of the Jewish faith, your place is here, in your home. France is your country,"" according to Reuters. Danish Prime Helle Thorning-Schmidt, speaking Monday night at a candlelight vigil for the shooting victims attended by an estimated 40,000-plus people, said, ""An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone. The Jewish community is an important part of Denmark. We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know. We stand together as Danes."" The Copenhagen attack had similarities to the Paris attacks. Both targeted cartoonists -- Lars Vilks in Copenhagen and the staff of the satiric Charlie Hebdon magazine in Paris. Both were small terrorist operations that reaped big headlines. The name of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was invoked both times -- by Paris kosher grocery gunman Amedy Coulibaly in a video and by the Copenhagen gunman in a Facebook posting. Copenhagen's crisis moment with terrorism occurred Saturday when a gunman opened fire at a free speech forum in Copenhagen, killing one man, before shooting several people outside a synagogue and killing another. The gunman was killed in a shootout with police. It could have been worse, said  Don Rosenberg, a Jewish community leader in Copenhagen. ""The shooter could have gotten into the community center,"" he said. ""The outcome could have been a massacre I dare not to think about."" In the days following, two men were charged with being accessories to murder and Vilks, a Swedish cartoonist who attended the forum and escaped unharmed, went into hiding. Vilks, known for his controversial depictions of the Prophet Mohammed, is on an al Qaeda hit list. Anti-Semitism has increased in Europe, especially since the most recent Gaza conflict and the rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Gerard Araud, French ambassador to the United States, told CNN that it's crucial for France to protect its Jewish citizens. ""It would be a major moral, political, human failure if the French Republic if we are not able to protect our Jewish compatriots,"" Araud said. ""It's a major challenge but we'll do our best to face it."" Rabbi Bent Lexner, former chief rabbi of Copenhagen, said there's historical precedent for Netanyahu's invitation. ""In 1961 Ben-Gurion, the first Israeli prime minister, came to Denmark and said the same thing,"" Lexner told CNN. ""The chief rabbi went out in the media and said, 'This is not the way to come here, Prime Minister, and tell people to leave.' "" People should not move to Israel out of fear, he said. ""I'm a father of three children who have left Denmark and are living and have establishing families in Israel,"" he said. ""They did not leave Denmark because they were afraid. They went to Israel because they wanted to live in Israel. And I want those people who come to Israel, they should come to Israel because they want to go, not because they're afraid to be in another European country."" CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Israeli Prime Minister: ""To the Jews of Europe and to the Jews of the world I say that Israel is waiting for you with open arms""

"Zaatari refugee camp, Jordan (CNN) -- They carried teapots and tiny gas canisters, shopping bags filled with clothes and overstuffed bundles of blankets balanced on their heads. Many held jerry cans, once full with water, now dangling empty. This was our first day in Jordan, and nothing could have prepared us for the scene in front of us: Hundreds of refugees from Syria making the long walk to safety in Jordan, one long jagged line stretching out into the open desert. SEE MORE: Stunning photo gallery of Syria's refugees . The refugees came from the outskirts of Damascus, walking for days in order to escape the ugly civil war that has engulfed their country for the past three years. Their destination, like so many thousands before them, is the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. The numbers are staggering: Syrian refugees are now estimated to make up 10% of Jordan's population. These are the scenes I remember the most from our journey from the Syria-Jordan border to Zaatari. The Long Walk from Syria . Two children clutching plastic soda bottles filled with olives from their family farm in Syria. One exhausted woman, eight months pregnant, gratefully taking the hand of a Jordanian border police officer as she struggled over the dirt mound that marks the Syria-Jordan border. UNHCR staff and Jordanian border police carrying bag after bag, child after child, and, most of all, the astonishing number of injured and sick brought in on wheelchairs. INTERACTIVE MAP: Syrians turn Zaatari into a home . An old man sitting on his battered suitcase. He offered me a biscuit. When I asked him how old he was, he said maybe 90 or 95. ""I don't remember my birthday,"" he said with a toothless smile. A woman who stopped and sat in the endless stretch of sand to feed her six-month-old child. She didn't want to be filmed. I spoke to her off-camera. She had travelled for three days from Damascus. Her home had been destroyed. I asked about the baby. Was he sleeping? Was she able to get enough food, produce enough milk to feed him? She smiled shyly. I showed her a picture of my little boy. She let me take a photo of her beautiful baby. The ""Mayor of Zaatari"" Zaatari is not simply a camp. More than 127,000 people have fled to the sprawling desert encampment since it opened in June 2012. If it was a city it would be the 5th largest in Jordan -- and, in fact, Zaatari is much more like a city than you might imagine: Hundreds of shops line a main road known as the ""Champs Elysees."" There are supermarkets and vegetable gardens, bicycle workshops and beauty salons. Overseeing all this is Killian Kleinschmidt. He has been called the ""Mayor of Zaatari"" but he's actually the UNHCR Field Coordinator for the camp. He believes in tackling problems head on and always with an impish sense of humour. He was kind enough to let us tag along on one of his frequent afternoon strolls through the camp. It turned out to be one of the most entertaining tours I've ever been on. A Town Called Zaatari . The day in Zaatari begins with bread. At dawn, the World Food Program delivers millions of loaves of bread for distribution to the camp's residents. Many families send their children to fetch the daily bread. And they come running in, waving pink vouchers in their hands. They leave loaded down with bags of bread, five pieces per family member. But that's only the start. In fact, Zaatari has a bustling economy: the U.N. estimates that $12 million is exchanged in business transactions here every month. The population demographics in Zaatari are skewed towards women and children but also a surprising number of elderly residents. Consider these statistics: More than half (54%) of the camp's residents are under the age of 17. 42% of families in the camp are led by a female head of household. 3% are more than 60-years old. Syrian government demolished thousands of homes, report says . Safah's story . Many of Zaatari's children bear the physical and emotional scars of war. Six-year old Safah is one of them. She and her family survived a rocket attack on their home in Aleppo, but they were hit by a second rocket outside Damascus. Safah lost her leg in the blast and has struggled to cope. Her father spoke to us about his heartbreak in seeing his bubbly daughter become quiet and withdrawn. Syria's 110-year-old refugee . One of my favorite moments was meeting Jabaari Alawali. He's doesn't remember his birthday, so he doesn't know exactly how old he is. But he reckons he is 110-years old with more than 200 grandchildren. And he is a charmer. His eyes sparkle when he tells you stories of life in Syria before the Assad family came to power. And he recites poetry, lots of poetry, in a wavering voice. ""Assad made beggars out of his people,"" he told me. Bringing beauty to Zaatari . I expected to see many things in Zaatari: A bustling market-place, caravan homes under construction and many, many kids at play. I did not expect to get a facial experience in home-made spa. But that's exactly what I got from Rowaida Abu-Zaid, the proprietor of Alma's Salon for Women, one of three wedding shops in Zaatari. I was really taken by her fearless attitude and candid views. We talked about the fears of the camp's young women and why so many are now getting married much earlier. She also showed me how the simple act of applying lipstick is an act of resilience for the women of the camp. ""Even the bread doesn't taste the same"" Zaatari is the main collection point for Syrian refugees in Jordan. But the vast majority of Syria's refugees actually live outside the camp, trying to find work in Jordan's cities. We met with one man, a baker, hoping to find work on the outskirts of Amman. He lives in one bare room with his family of five. He spoke to us on condition of anonymity because he fears his family at home in Syria could be targeted. But it's very unlikely he'll be able to find work. He lost his foot in a rocket attack, and his young son was crippled for life in the same attack. One of the most poignant moments, however, we did not catch on camera. We showed him the video we had shot of him using crutches to walk with his son. ""Look!"" he cried out, ""when you fast-forward the video it looks like I am running again. At last!"" Nothing can take away from the pain and loss of being a refugee. But everyone we met had a remarkable story of resilience and determination. Zaatari is a remarkable place because its residents are building a strong community out of what little they have. They build homes, invest in businesses, plant vegetable gardens and paint works of art. But every single Syrian refugee I spoke to said the same thing: if the war stopped today, I would be home tomorrow.","Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have streamed into Jordan since 2011 .

"(CNN)Airport and paradise are two words destined never to sit next to each other in the same sentence, but looking at the plans for Singapore's new airport that could soon change. Construction on the city state's new structure for Changi Airport, the Jewel Changi, is underway. Images of how the project looks when it's finished . show impressive steel-and-glass biosphere-style structures filled with plants and a gigantic waterfall. Scheduled for completion in 2018, if all goes according to plan, Project Jewel is likely to cement Changi's reputation who is recently named SkyTrax World's Best Airport for the third consecutive year. The massive donut-like structure at its core will be 10 stories -- five above ground and five underground -- integrating airport facilities, with retail and leisure outlets. There'll also be playgrounds and a hotel. More than simply a new terminal, Jewel Changi Airport will be constructed on the site of the old parking lot fronting the existing Changi Airport's Terminal 1, and will be ""seamlessly connected"" to the existing terminals, according to the airport. Maintaining Singapore's reputation as the ""garden city,"" Jewel Changi's centerpiece will be Forest Valley, a five-story garden with thousands of trees, ferns and shrubs. Commuters will even be able to take a hike up the valley.  ""We wanted to create a space where activities that were traditionally outdoors in nature are brought to an indoor environment,"" Robin Goh, Changi Airport Group spokesperson, tells CNN. Cascading through Jewel's donut hole, in the middle of the forest, will be the 40-meter-high Rain Vortex. On completion, it'll be the world's tallest indoor waterfall, according to the airport. At night, the Rain Vortex will transform into a light and sound show. Four different gateway gardens will feature unique landscape elements. The North Gateway Garden, for instance, will use the trunks of rain trees recycled from the airport's old open-air parking lot. On the top level, Canopy Park will have gardens, walking trails, playgrounds and eateries spanning approximately 13,000 square meters. ""We envisaged an area that comes with big sprawling spaces and play activities,"" says Goh of Canopy Park. ""We wanted to create a place where visitors can simply relax and have fun with their families and friends."" Travelers will be able to stay at Jewel's own hotel -- approximately 130 rooms operated by international hotel brand YOTEL. The complex will house an ""integrated multi-modal transport lounge."" That means ticketing, boarding pass and baggage transfer service will be available for passengers. Early check-in facilities at the complex will allow passengers to check-in and drop off luggage ahead of regular check-in times. There'll also be new subway links connecting all the airports terminals to the MRT network. A winner of multiple best airport awards over the years, Changi served 54.1 million passengers in 2014. The airport expects a new Terminal 4 opening in 2017 for Cathay Pacific and Jewel in 2018 to bring 85 million passengers a year. ""In order for Changi Airport to stay ahead amidst intensifying competition from other airports, it's important for continuous innovation to be introduced,"" says Goh.","Jewel Changi Airport in Singapore is expected to be completed by the end of 2018 .

"Hackers appear to have posted account info for 4.6 million users of quickie social-sharing app Snapchat, making usernames and at least partial phone numbers available for download. The data were posted to the website SnapchatDB.info. By late Wednesday morning, that site had been suspended. The hack was seemingly intended to urge Snapchat to tighten its security measures. The anonymous hackers said they used an exploit created by recent changes to the app, which lets users share photos or short videos that disappear after a few seconds. ""Our motivation behind the release was to raise the public awareness around the issue, and also put public pressure on Snapchat to get this exploit fixed. It is understandable that tech startups have limited resources but security and privacy should not be a secondary goal. Security matters as much as user experience does,"" the hackers said in a statement to technology blog TechCrunch. In the statement, the hackers said they blurred the last two digits of the phone numbers they posted but were still considering whether to post more with the full number visible. By Wednesday afternoon, developers had used the data to set up a website letting Snapchat users find out whether their accounts had been compromised. Snapchat did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Last week, Gibson Security -- a group of ""white hat"" hackers, meaning they don't exploit the security gaps they find -- published what they said was code that would enable such a hack. The SnapchatDB group said Snapchat implemented ""very minor obstacles"" after that. ""We know nothing about SnapchatDB, but it was a matter of time til something like that happened,"" Gibson Security wrote Wednesday on its Twitter account. ""Also the exploit works still with minor fixes."" In a blog post Friday, Snapchat appeared to minimize the potential damage from such a hack, claiming that it would require a ""huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an area code,"" to match usernames to numbers. ""Over the past year we've implemented various safeguards to make it more difficult to do. We recently added additional counter-measures and continue to make improvements to combat spam and abuse,"" the post read. ""Happy Snapping!""","A hacker group says it accessed info for 4.6 million Snapchat users .

"(CNN)Like many of his counterparts across the world, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was quick to stand with France in the wake of the deadly attack on the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. While most people in India were equally disgusted by the events in Paris, others felt it was preventable. Opposition National Congress Party lawmaker Mani Shankar Aiyar wrote an opinion piece claiming the magazine was ""virtually inviting a reaction week after week."" Kiran Bedi, a politician and former senior police officer, tweeted: ""France Terror-Shoot-Out sends a message: why deliberately provoke or poke? Be respectful and civil. Don't hurt people's sensitivities!"" But in a post on its Facebook page, the country's Aam Aadmi Party, or the ""Common Man's Party"" that just swept state elections in Delhi in an unprecedented victory, pointed to an issue much closer to home. ""A lot of you have expressed shock at the attack on satirists Charlie Hebdo and have shared some of their cartoons as well. But did you know that doing so can get you jailed here in India?"" The use of controversial cartoons had reignited a furious debate about freedom of expression in the world's most populous democracy. Take the case of Ambikesh Mahapatra. In 2012, the chemistry professor was arrested for circulating by email a cartoon that poked fun at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The cartoon, which was a parody of a scene in a popular Indian movie, went viral on social media. He was charged with a range of offenses including defamation, insulting a woman and sending offensive messages from a computer. Mahapatra called the charges a misuse of the law ""in the name of surveillance, to curb democratic rights, freedom of speech and human rights of common people."" Cyber law in India stipulates that alleged offenders could face up to three years in jail for posting material that is ""grossly offensive,"" has ""menacing character,"" -- or perhaps even more ambiguously -- causes ""annoyance or inconvenience."" Delhi went one step further in its digital crackdown in 2011. The so-called ""intermediary guidelines"" implicated web platforms themselves. The rules now require Internet companies to take down any content seen as ""disparaging,"" ""blasphemous,"" or ""defamatory"" within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal. In Mumbai, India's financial center, police spokesman Dhananjay Kulkarni told CNN that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations. Google says that in the last half of 2013, it removed 540 items from its pages in compliance with orders issued by Indian courts, government agencies, and law enforcement. It's a similar story with Facebook. The social networking site took down nearly 5,000 pieces of content reported by the Indian government in the first half of 2014. Meanwhile, MouthShut.com -- an Indian equivalent of Yelp, which allows online users to write reviews of products and services -- has taken its case to the country's Supreme Court to protect what it says are the rights of Indian citizens and consumers enshrined by the Indian constitution. A number of companies had objected to negative feedback and applied to have comments removed under the guise of ""harmful speech"" in current legislation. The question marks over India's Internet freedom come at a time when Modi is planning to splash out $17 billion to build a fiber optic ""broadband highway"" that will cover the entire country. If the prime minister's ambitious plan bears fruit, more than a billion Indians will be surfing the web for the first time within three years. But a rapid rise in access to the web potentially exposes millions of ordinary Indians to a new threat. ""Schemes like this will bring the bulk of Indian communications online and therefore, open to interception, unless we regulate this before we start. Unless we have proper laws,"" said constitutional lawyer Bhairav Acharya. Ultimately India is an important case study in how developing markets deal with regulating an increasingly connected society. ""A lot of people don't see the relationship between free speech and privacy,"" explained Acharya. ""But when you survey communications and intercept private communications ... this has a chilling effect on free speech."" In 2013, the Indian government rolled out the Central Monitoring System, a mass surveillance system capable of intercepting all phone and Internet-based communications. Human Rights Watch warned of its potential to threaten civilian rights, given the Indian government's ""reckless and irresponsible use of the sedition and Internet laws."" As of the time of writing, India's Telecom Minister had not responded to multiple requests for comment on this issue. Later this year, an Internet surveillance mechanism called NETRA -- an acronym for network traffic analysis -- is expected to go live. Its exact functions haven't yet been spelled out by the government, but Acharya pointed to its possible use as a tool for untargeted, dragnet surveillance. The Defense Research and Development Organization -- reportedly the architect of NETRA -- has refused to comment on the project. Where privacy rules dovetail with Modi's digital aspirations is especially troubling. ""If you have Digital India and NETRA hand-in-hand -- in effect, what this scheme will become is a large, massive surveillance project,"" warned Acharya. It's not all necessarily bad news for India's future Internet users. In the latest Freedom on the Net report, of all 65 countries surveyed, India showed the biggest improvement worldwide where Internet freedom was concerned. Relaxed restrictions on access and content -- plus a drop in the number of arrests for social media posts -- pushed India up in the rankings. Behind the gains -- the country was not, as regularly, calling into action its existing Internet controls. So, it wasn't that policy was being reformed; it's that these controversial provisions were being called upon with less frequency than in past years. A more lenient approach was reinforced only last week when Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta -- India's third most senior law officer -- said posts made ""on any Internet medium which were not grossly offensive would not be treated as a criminal act."" In effect, that could mean dramatically reduced restrictions over what can be freely said in posts made on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. But ultimately, the government is bound only by its written submissions, so it remains to be seen whether these verbal concessions will find their place in ink in the Indian penal code. For now, this spate of embroiled cyber legislation is under deliberation in the country's highest court. Cyber security expert, Vijay Mukhi, will be among those looking to see where the anvil falls on digital freedoms. For him, the answer is simple: ""Let society or the legal system decide what must be seen on the Internet, not the state or the police.""","Attack on Charlie Hebdo reignited a furious debate about freedom of expression in India .

"(CNN)It's been a big week for makeovers in the world of aviation. First, U.S carrier Southwest Airlines unveiled its new branding, which included a complete overhaul of its livery. The old ""canyon blue"" was retired for a darker shade, the stripes on the tail have been modified, the fonts brought into the 21st century, and -- most significantly -- a yellow, red and blue heart added to the plane's belly. ""The heart emblazoned on our aircraft, and within our new look, symbolizes our commitment that we'll remain true to our core values as we set our sights on the future,"" explained Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines' CEO, in a statement. A few days later, Frontier Airlines similarly announced a redesign, this one a homage to the carrier's original incarnation (the first Frontier Airlines closed down in 1986). In its newest form, Frontier borrowed design elements from the original livery, including the stylized, Saul Bass-designed F in the brand name. Both carriers are experiencing a shift in their corporate identity; Southwest should be finalizing its takeover of AirTran Airways, while Frontier recently rebranded as an ultra low-cost carrier. ""It's common for airlines to shake off their image with a new livery,"" explains Jonny Clark, an airline brand specialist and founder of thedesignair.net. ""When United merged with Continental, they created a new livery to show they were one entity."" Livery delivery . While usually, according to Clark, airline liveries have a shelf life of 20 years or so, there's been a recent spate of aircraft redesigns. American, Iberia, Air New Zealand are just a few of the carriers to tweak their appearance of late, and rumors abound that Abu Dhabi airline Etihad will soon undergo a major facelift as well. ""In the last couple of years, there's been an influx of new aircraft into a lot of fleets: 777s and A380s. A lot of airlines have taken advantage of this opportunity to create a point of differentiation,"" explains Clark. American and European brands, he notes, tend to follow a similar aesthetic, known as ""Eurowhite"". It's a concept known for its simplicity, and usually comes down to an airline putting an emblem on the tail of an aircraft, and their logo on the fuselage. ""A lot of carriers do it. It comes down to cost,"" explains Clark. ""If you have an airplane in a hanger for 12 days, that's 12 days that aircraft is out of service. Especially for larger carriers with 100 aircraft in their fleet, the simpler the design, the less money they're loosing."" The Pacific Rim effect . There are a handful of airlines, however, that have taken a different tact. Several carriers in the Pacific Rim have also made over their liveries, favoring intricate designs that highlight the local design culture. When Fiji Airways rebranded itself earlier this year, for example, it took inspiration from Fijian Masi art, and borrowed several traditional motifs, particularly the Teteva symbol on the tail. When Hawaiian Airlines introduced its regional subsidy, 'Ohana by Hawaiian, it similarly opted for a local aesthetic when crafting the new livery this year. The carrier teamed up with father-and-son design team Sig and Kuha'o Zane to craft a look that honored the local culture. The duo came up with livery that is simultaneously based on Hawaiian Airlines' inter-island route map, and traditional Hawaiian crafts. ""The 'Ohana by Hawaiian brand is deeply rooted in the communities of our islands, and it was important for the design to reflect that sense of family and community,"" explains Avi Mannis, Hawaiian Airlines' senior vice president of marketing. Mannis admits that the planes have a more complicated paint job -- each aircraft takes 14 days to complete. Going viral? Finally, liveries can be a great marketing exercise for an airline. During the 2012 London Olympics, for example, several airlines introduced special edition liveries. To mark Hello Kitty's 40th birthday, Taiwan's Eva Air introduced the Hello Kitty Jet to more locations around the world. Few airlines have mastered liveries' marketing potential like Air New Zealand, however, who for years has partnered with the Lord of the Rings franchise, creating Tolkien-themed safety videos, and emblazoning their aircraft with a new decal for each film that hits the theaters. Last year, one of their planes sported a decal of Smaug -- the fire-breathing dragon from the latest Hobbit movie. ""Their partnership with Lord of the Rings created this huge viral following,"" says Clark. ""It was a relatively small carrier, but now everyone's heard of them. It increased their awareness in the worldwide scope of passenger travel.""","A  number of airlines unveiled new liveries this week .

She still looks gorgeous, but OMG she's flawed. The image came from a photo shoot from 2013 with Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America. The U.S. edition of Marie Claire is thrilled.  ""No matter where the photo came from, it's an enlightenment -- we've always known Crawford was beautiful, but seeing her like this only makes us love her more."" Oh, Marie Claire -- how big of you! We all know you don't actually believe real women sell magazines. Sadly, Crawford's husband doesn't seem to think so either. Shortly after that unaltered picture of Crawford hit the Internet, Rande Gerber shared a picture of his bikini-clad wife lounging by the pool. No age spots in that photo. Girl looked 25. I must admit it was refreshing, though, to read the many, many comments from women around the world taking comfort in the imperfect Cindy. Vickie wrote on my Facebook page: ""This is how all Mom's look. A little pouch tummy, tan lines, flawed skin, and we still look great. Seeing this makes me feel better about how I look. It's a shame ""beauty"" mags have to alter these kinds of pics at all."" Vickie, I hear you loud and clear, but you've gone mad! I don't know about you, but the first time I picked up Seventeen Magazine at the age of 12, I realized I was way too chubby and my skin already looked like leather. When I graduated to the high fashion magazines, I discovered my body had to look unreal to be sexy. It still does. Why do you think that photo of Kim Kardashian-with-a-glass-of-champagne-on-her-rear almost broke the Internet? Besides, a good chunk of Americans deride what's real. The National Enquirer loves to regale us with truly awful pictures of stars with cellulite, back fat and dark roots. And the captions underneath don't say, ""Wow, ain't she sexy!"" Try googling ""unretouched photo"" and see what you get. A veritable potpourri of supposedly unaltered photos of Madonna, Lady Gaga, Mariah Carey and even Justin Bieber. (That's my fave -- the re-toucher enhanced his, um, attribute.) Opinion: Is Crawford's cellulite photo empowering? Some magazines are trying. Like Sports Illustrated. Recently it featured an impossibly slender, busty, hairless woman with her pants down on its cover, but inside -- and SI says this is historic -- there is a ""real"" woman. And, by that, SI means, ""plus-sized."" As Deadspin so wonderfully put it:  ""SI Nobly Accepts Ad Money To Put Normal-Sized Woman In Swimsuit Issue."" Hmmm, maybe next year SI will put her on the cover. I wouldn't bet the farm on that one. Perhaps the most honest assessment of the whole Cindy Crawford uproar came from a co-worker who shall remain nameless. She told me her eyes went directly to Crawford's stomach and then to her sun-damaged skin. In other words, she noticed Crawford's flaws first and fixated on them, just as she fixates on her own flaws every morning when she looks into the mirror. I do it, too. And that's the thing, right? Those retouched photos that we're accustomed to seeing have invaded women's psyches and held us up to impossibly unrealistic standards. So it was a moment of surprise and relief that when I showed that unaltered picture of Cindy Crawford to my husband. He didn't notice her flaws. He simply said, ""Wow, she looks great!"" No wonder I love him.","Carol Costello: We all know that real women won't be able to sell magazines .
While people are praising Cindy Crawford's unaltered photo, the truth is that retouched photos won't go away ."
"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)The man accused of killing Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend said he didn't have a choice. ""I had to kill men today. It wasn't a want to, it was a need. I had to, to get out of that situation I was in today,"" Eddie Ray Routh said in a confession video that was played Monday in a Texas courtroom. He is charged with murder in the February 2, 2013, shooting deaths of Kyle and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range. Routh's lawyer admits his clievnt killed the men but contends he was insane at the time. In the 90-minute confession tape, the defendant was interviewed by Texas Ranger Danny Briley. Briley asked Routh what he did after he killed the two men. ""I fled. I didn't know what else to do. My adrenaline was so high. I didn't know what was right. I didn't know what was wrong. I mean, I know what was right now. I left, you know,"" Routh responded. When asked what he would say to the families of his victims, he said: ""I would tell them I'm sorry for what I've done."" Routh's answers to other questions were less intelligible. At one point, he veers off into talk about his soul. ""You can't just keep letting people eat your soul up for free, you know. It's not what it's about, it's about having a soul that you have in you for yourself. And there are tons of people that are eating on my soul right now,"" the defendant said. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, has grossed the most ever for a war movie. Kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. He had already risen to fame through his book when he died, and was involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh, a veteran with mental problems, to the firing range as a kind of therapy. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated. A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. Jason Morris and Chris Lett reported this story from Stephenville, Texas. Dana Ford wrote it from Atlanta.","Eddie Ray Routh is on trial for the 2013 shooting deaths of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield .

"Formula One legend Michael Schumacher remains in a medically induced coma, according to his agent, while one of his former teammates is ""praying"" for his recovery. The 45-year-old suffered a severe head injury while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps. ""Michael is still in the wake-up phase,"" said his manager Sabine Kehm in a statement on Friday. ""The situation has not changed."" Germany's seven-time world champion was placed into a medically-induced coma to help reduce swelling on the brain. Schumacher has had two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and to remove haematomas at Grenoble Hospital, France. Kehm once again confirmed that ""any medical information published which is not confirmed by the team of doctors treating Michael or his management has to be considered as not valid."" His friend and fellow racing driver, Felipe Massa, says he is optimistic Schumacher will recover after visiting him in hospital last month. ""I pray for him every day,"" Massa told CNN. ""I believe things can be better and normal for him. ""I keep praying and hope everything will be fine."" Schumacher, who retired from F1 in 2012 following a record-breaking 19-year career, had been skiing off-piste when he fell and hit his head against a rock. Last month, his family issued a statement where they said they still ""strongly believe"" in his recovery. They also conceded that the ""wake-up phase"" can take ""a long time."" Schumacher, who won five consecutive titles with Ferrari between 2000-04, also claimed two drivers' championships at Benetton in 1994 and 1995. Unlike his friend, Massa has found success harder to come by and ended his eight-year spell at Ferrari to join Williams for the 2014 season. The 32-year-old, who won eight grands prix with Ferrari, came agonizingly close to winning the drivers' title in 2008 only to be defeated by Lewis Hamilton in the final race. Now the Brazilian hopes he can succeed with Williams following the unveiling of the British team's new car. ""It's my dream,"" said Massa of winning the sport's top prize. ""I always had this dream and I'll do everything I can to make it real. ""It's very nice and important to me. I was very close to achieving that. ""We keep wishing, fighting and I think we need to believe all the time that things can change from one year to the next. ""It's a new year and I hope we do well.""","Michael Schumacher remains in medically induced coma .

"In unscheduled and unusually personal remarks, President Barack Obama tried Friday to explain why African-Americans were upset about last week's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin while lowering expectations for federal charges in the case. ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama told White House reporters in a surprise appearance at the daily briefing. His remarks, which lasted about 20 minutes, escalated a nationwide debate on the verdict that has prompted protests, including some that turned violent. A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman last Saturday in Martin's February 26, 2012, shooting death, inciting anger among many who considered the incident racially motivated murder. Obama issued a written statement on Sunday, noting that the jury had spoken and urging calm and reflection. Despite some calls for him to speak about the case, the nation's first African-American president had made no further public comment until Friday. Speaking without a teleprompter, Obama noted a history of racial disparity in law as well as more nuanced social prejudice that contribute to ""a lot of pain"" in the African-American community over the verdict. ""There are very few African-American men in this country who have not had the experience of being followed when they are shopping at a department store. That includes me,"" the president said. ""There are probably very few African-American men who have not had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me - at least before I was a senator,"" he continued. Read the full transcript of President Obama's remarks . ""There are very few African-Americans who have not had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had the chance to get off. That happens often,"" he said. Saying he didn't intend to exaggerate those experiences, Obama added that they ""inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida."" ""The African-American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws, everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws,"" he said. ""And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case."" African-Americans feel the context of the Martin killing is little known or denied, ""and that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different,"" Obama said. These cases usually matter for states . At the same time, Obama responded to calls by civil rights groups for federal hate crimes charges to be filed against Zimmerman by saying the Florida legal process had reached a verdict. ""Once the jury's spoken, that's how our system works,"" the president said, later adding that while Attorney General Eric Holder was looking further at the case, those calling for federal charges must ""have some clear expectations here."" In America, law enforcement and the criminal code are ""traditionally done at the state and local levels, not at the federal level,"" he said. On Saturday, ""Justice for Trayvon"" vigils are scheduled outside federal buildings across the country by Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network. Sharpton called Obama's remarks Friday ""significant and much needed,"" saying in a statement that the president ""set a tone for both direct action and needed dialogue."" Martin's parents said they were ""deeply honored and moved"" that Obama spoke publicly about their son, saying the president's comments ""give us great strength at this time."" ""Trayvon's life was cut short, but we hope that his legacy will make our communities a better place for generations to come,"" said the statement by Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. ""We applaud the president's call to action to bring communities together to encourage an open and difficult dialogue."" However, some conservative commentators criticized Obama for what they called divisiveness by speaking as an African American instead of representing the entire country. Todd Starnes, a Fox News Radio anchor, tweeted ""race-baiter in chief."" Stark contrast: How comments sparked very different reactions . Zimmerman's defense team cited Obama's courage in addressing the case and its racial context, but said the facts showed their client acted in self-defense and the jury reached the proper verdict. ""While we acknowledge the racial context of the case, we hope that the president was not suggesting that this case fits a pattern of racial disparity, because we strongly contend that it does not,"" the lawyers said in a statement. A White House official told CNN Chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin that Obama decided Thursday night to make his public remarks after watching the reaction to the Zimmerman verdict over the past week. The official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said Obama talked to friends and family members about the verdict, and told his senior staff he wanted to speak publicly about it. His staff recommended that he make the remarks in the White House briefing room, as opposed to an interview. In his remarks, Obama said demonstrations and other responses to the Zimmerman verdict must be non-violent or they will dishonor what happened to Martin and his family. He outlined possible future steps, calling for the Justice Department, state governors and city mayors to work with law enforcement agencies ""about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists."" For example, he noted that racial profiling legislation he pushed as a state senator in Illinois helped police departments think about the issue and act more professionally, which helped build trust with communities they serve. Stand your ground laws . Obama also called for reconsideration of ""stand your ground"" self-defense laws in Florida and other states, that he said ""may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential altercations."" Sharpton and other civil rights leaders call for abolishing the ""stand your ground"" laws. ""If we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms, even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" Obama asked. Protesters stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely here to stay . To supporters of such laws, Obama said they should consider if the right to fight back with a gun would have applied to Martin. ""Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?"" the president said. ""And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws."" While rejecting any ""grand new federal program,"" Obama also called for providing more support for African-American boys and young mans who disproportionately end up in prison or homicide victims. No national conversation . However, he rejected calls for him to launch a national conversation on race, saying ""I haven't seen that be particularly productive when, you know, politicians try to organize conversations."" His comment could have been a slap at his own response to the 2009 arrest of African-American university professor Henry Louis Gates by a white police officer responding to a report of a possible burglary at his Boston-area home. After coming under criticism for saying police acted stupidly, Obama later invited the Harvard professor and the arresting officer for a beer at the White House. On Friday, Obama instead endorsed ""soul-searching"" discussions in homes, churches and workplaces where people might be more honest about whether they were ""wringing as much bias"" out of themselves as possible. ""As difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people, I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better,"" the president concluded, making a reference to his daughters' generation. ""It doesn't mean we're in a post-racial society. It doesn't mean that racism is eliminated,"" he said. ""But, you know, when I talk to Malia and Sasha and I listen to their friends and I see them interact, they're better than we are. They're better than we were on these issues.  And that's true in every community that I've visited all across the country.""","Obama decided Thursday to speak out on the Martin case .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN)Indonesian authorities remain on course to execute two Australians for drug trafficking, despite pleas for leniency made by the government in Canberra and six former prime ministers. Australia's second longest serving premier, John Howard, said: ""Mercy being shown in such circumstances would not weaken the deterrent effect of Indonesia's strong anti-drug laws,"" while Kevin Rudd, who served as premier on two occasions, said: ""As a deep, long-standing friend of Indonesia, I would respectfully request an act of clemency."" Julia Gillard, Bob Hawke, Malcolm Fraser and Paul Keating all followed suit in a united plea to Indonesia's president. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, members of the so-called ""Bali Nine,"" were sentenced to death in 2006 and after several failed legal appeals and two denials of clemency, their execution by firing squad may now be close. Bali's Kerobokan prison was given permission this week to move Sukumaran and Chan to a maximum security facility on the island of Nusa Kambangan to have their sentence carried out. But the transfer has now been delayed due to ""technical reasons."" On Friday, Agence France-Presse quoted the vice president's office as saying the executions will be delayed for up to a month. The two men were among five inmates scheduled to be transferred, Tony Spontana, a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general's office, told CNN. Spontana said requests from Australian officials for the families to spend more time with the prisoners had been granted. He also said one of the prisoners, a Brazilian, needs medical attention. Spontana added that there was an issue with the holding cell at the prison where the executions would take place. The inmates will be transferred when those issues are resolved, he said. Perhaps fearing a boycott, national carrier Garuda Airlines has said it would not be involved in their transportation. Most observers believe the executions will proceed despite a last minute appeal to Indonesia's Administrative Court and a new claim that the 2006 trial judges offered a lighter sentence in exchange for a bribe. And this hasn't gone down well in Australia. Speaking on Monday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott asked Indonesia to reconsider their position on Sukumaran and Chan, considered the ringleaders of the Bali Nine -- a group of nine Australians who failed in a bid to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin back to their country in 2005. ""Well, what we understand is that there are still legal options available to these two Australians and their legal teams and we certainly appreciate that the Indonesian government doesn't normally go ahead with executions of this type, while there are legal options still available and that's what we're saying to the Indonesian government,"" he said. At the weekend, Abbott struck a more combative tone when he told The Bolt Report on the TEN television network ""we will be finding ways to make our displeasure felt."" He did not detail what the government intended to do. ""What we are asking of Indonesia is what Indonesia asks of other countries when its citizens are on death row, and if it's right for Indonesia to ask and expect some kind of clemency, it's surely right for us to ask and expect some kind of clemency,"" he said. It's also a point that the mothers of the two men, Raji Sukumaran and Helen Chan struggle to comprehend. ""They are helping the Indonesian citizens overseas who are on death row and what is the difference between my son and these people overseas?"" Sukumaran told reporters in Jakarta, where she had sought the help of Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights. ""I don't want my son murdered. Please help."" READ MORE: Capital punishment: Inhumane aberration or necessary deterrent? But on Tuesday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told CNN that Australia should not interfere with Indonesian law and policy. ""Although we understand the position of the Australian government ... it should be underlined that this issue is purely a law enforcement issue. Law enforcement against extraordinary crime. Law enforcement by a sovereign country, Indonesia,"" she said. ""Both Indonesia and Australia have wide ranging cooperation in many fields -- political, security, trade and investment, as well as sociocultural and people to people. ""Bilateral relations between two counties should be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. Indonesia is committed this principle."" Meanwhile, the Australian Federal Police has been criticized for its part in the case. Speaking to media in Sydney last week, AFP Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton admitted the role his force played in the 2005 Bali arrests of the nine but denied it was responsible for what then transpired. Instead of stopping one of the convicted drug mules, Scott Rush, from traveling to Bali -- which had been the request of his parents -- the AFP alerted its counterpart, the Indonesian National Police of his intentions. It offered the names of the conspirators, some of whom had been on the AFP's radar. ""The AFP had no evidence or lawful reason to detain, much less arrest or charge, any member of the Bali Nine before their departure from Australia,"" the AFP noted in a February 7 statement. It also explained it could not limit ""its cooperation to countries that have similar legal systems as Australia."" The AFP is not compelled to answer requests for information about Australians from countries where the death penalty might be imposed, but there are no guidelines to stop it volunteering information, as it did with the Bali Nine. Opinion: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. ""Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,"" Bishop told the Australian Parliament last week. The foreign affairs spokesperson for the opposition Australian Labor Party, Tanya Plibersek delivered a personal account of what it means to be given a second chance. Long before she met her husband, he'd been convicted in Australia of conspiracy to import heroin from Thailand where the death penalty applies to such crimes. Aged 19, Michael Coutts Trotter was sentenced to nine years in prison but released after three. He is now one of the most respected public servants in state of New South Wales and the father of three children, all of which might not have been, said Plibersek. ""I feel a genuine debt of gratitude,"" Michael Coutts Trotter told CNN. ""So like it or not, you have to accept a deeper sense of responsibility to try to make something useful of your life to repay the trust people have invested in you,"" said Coutts Trotter, the current Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services. Short of a miracle, redemption is not a gift likely to be offered to Sukumaran and Chan. If last-minute appeals fail, Sukumaran and Chan will be allowed a few final choices: whether to stand or kneel, wear a blindfold or face the 12 man firing squad, one or more of whom will kill them. The hashtag, #BoycottBali trends in Australia whenever news of the men's plight features in the media. While Chan's parents have now left Bali, Sukumaran's will stay to the end. As they prepare for what appears inevitable, it is surely little comfort for them to know that according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the man police suspect was the mastermind of their son's trafficking enterprise is reportedly living a life of luxury in Sydney. He was investigated but escaped prosecution and is believed to have won U.S. $3.89 million in a lottery just after the young Australians were convicted. His fortunes stand in stark contrast to that of Sukumaran and Chan.

"A federal jury in New York on Monday found radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri guilty of charges that he aided terrorists in incidents that span the globe, from a remote Oregon ranch to the dusty desert of the Arabian Peninsula. Abu Hamza al-Masri faced 11 criminal counts for allegedly aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen; sending a young recruit to jihadists in Afghanistan; violating U.S. sanctions against the Taliban; and attempting to establish an al Qaeda-style training camp on the West Coast of the United States. The jury deliberated for more than 12 hours over two days. Al-Masri was found guilty on all counts, and showed no discernible reaction as the verdict was read. ""The defendant stands convicted, not for what he said, but for what he did,"" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, describing al-Masri as ""not just a preacher of faith, but a trainer of terrorists. ""Once again our civilian system of justice has proven itself up to the task of trying an accused terrorist and arriving at a fair and just and swift result."" The high-profile London mosque leader gained notoriety for the metal hook he's sometimes depicted wearing in place of one of his missing hands, but he sported only an occasional writing prosthesis in the Manhattan courtroom. Contrary to stories that he lost the limbs in battle, al-Masri testified, his maiming was the result of an engineering accident. The government's three-week case against al-Masri was an effort to connect the dots between the defendant and events thousands of miles away, through key witnesses who often had never met the cleric themselves and testified in exchange for leniency or protection. A trial highlight was al-Masri taking the stand in his own defense and accusing federal prosecutors of using ""pay-as-you-go witnesses"" and a ""cut-and-paste"" approach to take inflammatory comments out context, including statements about his admiration for late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ""The deliberations confirmed our fears they would focus on words and ideas rather than the evidence,"" said defense attorney Jeremy Schneider, after the verdict was announced. The speed of deliberations, he said, make it clear jurors ""walked in with a foregone conclusion."" Defendant claims he was a 'mouthpiece' During his four days of testimony, al-Masri described bin Laden as a dangerous hothead in charge of an unfocused organization that has betrayed the Afghan people. As for the Taliban regime, it doesn't need his money; it has ""millions,"" yet doesn't feed its own people, he said. But in Manhattan, by invoking 9/11 and bin Laden's name, al-Masri mused, ""You can convict a person of killing the Dead Sea."" The 56-year-old cleric denied any part in the bumbling effort to launch a jihad training camp in Oregon and said he'd acted only as a ""mouthpiece"" in the fight against the Yemeni government when the hostage drama played out. During his closing argument, Schneider warned jurors not to be distracted by the ""quantity of irrelevant evidence"" the prosecution presented, including photographs of bin Laden found on computers in the defendant's London home and snippets of his videotaped orations. Al-Masri was convicted in the United Kingdom of inciting racial hatred and soliciting murder with his fiery sermons, but the charges against him in the United States are not for hateful speech or possessing photographs or other materials. Prosecution: Al-Masri could 'work a crowd' The prosecution played video clips of al-Masri endorsing suicide missions and saying the killing of non-believers is permissible, comparing them to cows or pigs. Prosecution exhibits also included the 10-volume ""Encyclopedia of Jihad"" recovered from the al-Masri family residence, with topics ranging from bomb-making to personal hygiene in the battlefield. ""It's a very slippery slope to use someone's library against them,"" Schneider said in his closing. The attorney conceded that his client sent money to benefit destitute widows and a secret girl's school in a Taliban-controlled territory, prohibited under U.S. sanctions -- the final charge of the 11-count indictment against al-Masri, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison. In the closing argument for the government, Ian McGinley told jurors the tapes and photographs reveal ""the real Abu Hamza"": a screaming hatemonger -- far from the calm, tolerant, and sometimes quite funny man they'd seen on the witness stand. ""He knows how to work a crowd,"" said McGinley. Key witness has checkered past . As for the quality of the government witnesses, McGinley said prosecutors didn't choose the co-conspirators, and that criminal trials involve unsavory characters. A pivotal witness for the prosecution was James Ujaama, a Seattle man who testified he conceived of the idea for the Oregon training camp and faxed a pitch letter to al-Masri. ""It looks just like Afghanistan,"" the letter reads and repeatedly points out that all planned activities would be legal in the ""pro-gun,"" ""pro-militia"" state. Two men were sent from London by al-Masri to train recruits, said Ujaama, but the pair left after realizing his claims of eager trainees, weapons stockpiles, and efforts to build housing and a mosque were lies. Only two run-down trailers sat atop the barren ranch land, and its sole training facility was a deer-shaped target in a dry creek bed. Al-Masri claimed the men made their way to Oregon on their own, after fishing Ujaama's fax from his trash can; he himself considered the pitch ""a hallucination,"" he testified. Ujaama also testified he agreed to escort a young recruit to an Afghani front-line commander for al-Masri, but said he actually left his young charge stranded and alone in a Pakistani hotel. Ujaama is on his second cooperation agreement with the government, having violated his first one by fleeing to Belize. He spent approximately six years in jail for his own role in the Oregon venture and testified that he continues to receive a monthly stipend from the government for living expenses. He also admitted a range of past criminal endeavors, including peddling knockoff watches and pirate CDs, and setting up an airport bathroom rendezvous to sell a computer without paying UK sales tax. Another witness against al-Masri, Saajid Badat, testified that he later saw the abandoned recruit at the infamous Al Farouq training camp -- a key point to the allegation al-Masri in fact aided terrorists in Afghanistan. A trainee himself at the time, Badat has admitted he conspired with failed shoe bomber Richard Reid on a plot to take down airliners, and, in fact, received shoe bombs from alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Badat backed out, he testified, after reconnecting with his parents. As part of a cooperation agreement in the United Kingdom, Badat saw his own potential sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole dwindle and ultimately served approximately six years, he said. Badat testified via teleconference from London to avoid facing pending charges in the United States. Young recruit a courtroom no-show . A glaring absence on the witness stand was the young recruit himself, Uganda-born computer student Feroz Abbasi. He was apprehended in Afghanistan as part of a roundup by U.S. forces in 2002, according to testimony. Jurors were not told Abbasi was released without charges after spending about two years at the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Now living in the United Kingdom, Abbasi declined to testify in al-Masri's case, according to defense attorneys. The most unassailable of key prosecution witnesses was Mary Quin, who was taken hostage with her fellow travelers during a trip through Yemen in 1998, allegedly as leverage for prisoners held by the Yemeni government -- including al-Masri's own stepson. Four of the tourists were killed during a harrowing shootout with government forces, Quin testified. Quin later traveled to London to confront al-Masri; the cleric agreed to let her record the conversation. On the tape, which was played for jurors in court, al-Masri falls short of confessing he knew of the kidnapping plan ahead of time, but uses a phrase prosecutors have said is devastating evidence of his involvement: ""We never thought it would be that bad."" The two criminal counts relating to the Yemen kidnapping plot both carry a possible life sentence. Sentencing is set for September 9.","Sentencing is set for September 9 .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Authorities in the landlocked African nation of Niger have arrested 160 suspected Boko Haram militants allegedly involved in deadly attacks near that country's border with Nigeria, a national police spokesman said Tuesday. The arrests happened over the last two days in Niger's Diffa region, which borders Nigeria. Those taken into custody include Kaka Bunu, who police spokesman Adil Doro said was ""involved in the recruitment of (Boko Haram) members."" Some of the suspects fled south, only to be arrested while on the run or in ""their hiding places,"" said Yakubu Sumana Gawo, the governor of Niger's Diffa region. Members of the Nigerien police's anti-terrorism unit are interrogating the suspects, all of them Niger citizens. Cameroon, meanwhile, is holding hundreds of suspected Boko Haram militants in prisons in its Far North Region. Two Cameroon security sources said more than 1,000 alleged terrorists are in custody in the central prison in the town of Maroua. Col. Joseph Nouma, commander of Cameroon's special military operation targeting terrorists, offered a more conservative number of more than 600 detained. Nouma said his forces squared off Monday with Boko Haram fighters and beat them decisively. The battle in Gnam-Gnam, which is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Nigerian border, began when Cameroonian soldiers on a reconnaissance mission ""were ambushed by the terrorists,"" the Cameroonian colonel said. It ended a few hours later with at least 100 militants and five Cameroonian soldiers dead, according to Nouma. He said Cameroonian troops also seized an armored vehicle, two machine guns and a large amount of ammunition. Even with these mass arrests and reported military victories, though, no one is under the illusion that Boko Haram is finished. The group, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. Niger became more of a target following its decision to join the regional alliance fighting Boko Haram. The group has been blamed for raids and suicide bombings in recent days in Diffa, which is in the far southeastern part of the country. In response, Niger's government last Wednesday declared a state of emergency in the region that gives authorities the OK to go house to house in its crackdown on Boko Haram. Cameroon has been battling the terrorist group for longer. The African nation has deployed about 7,000 troops across the Far North Region, where Boko Haram has scaled up attacks over the past year. These include cross-border raids and attempts to take over a Cameroon military base in Kolofata and another in Achigashia, forcing Cameroonian soldiers to retreat and then for the first time use airstrikes against the insurgents. And last month, Boko Haram militants kidnapped 80 people in northern Cameroon, Said Abdulkarim, a journalist for the state broadcaster, told CNN. Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Nigeria, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. Journalist Ngala Killian Chimton contributed to this report.","Colonel: 100 Boko Haram, 5 Cameroon soldiers killed in recent fighting .

"(CNN) -- Aviation isn't known as the most eco-friendly industry. Carbon emissions aside, running an airline produces an incredible amount of waste. Everything from uneaten food to outdated uniforms is potential landfill fodder. Southwest Airlines, for one, has decided to do something about it. After a large-scale redesign of many of its 737 aircraft, the carrier found itself with an excess of 80,000 leather seat covers -- enough to fill the Empire State Building. ""We had this idea of 'could we do something with this leather beyond recycling it or shredding it? Could we repurpose it?'"" says Marilee McInnis, the airline's senior manager of culture and communications. Southwest dubbed the initiative ""Luv Seat: Repurpose with Purpose,"" and reached out to potential partners to take the used leather, but found that there were few takers. ""It's awesome to have a great idea, but you have to have support for those -- quote-unquote -- great ideas. I worked with our green team for nine months to find a use for the leather. It's actually much harder than you think it would be,"" says McInnis. Following the advice of Bill Tiffany, a Southwest VP who grew up in Kenya, the airline started looking towards Africa for recipients of the used leather. Rather than just donating the goods and leaving it there, the airline decided to take a more holistic approach, giving the materials to NGOs that will use them to provide job training and health education. The main partner is SOS Children's Villages Kenya, which is providing paid apprenticeships and training to orphaned youth, who in turn make shoes and soccer balls from the leather. The shoes are given to Maasai Treads, who distributes them as part of a campaign to fight debilitating foot parasites. The soccer balls are donated to Alive & Kicking, a charity that uses sport to educate young people on HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention. ""It's really easy to donate and walk away. We didn't want to do that. The leather is finite, but the skills these young people will learn will hopefully take them through their lives,"" says McInnis. The redesign was itself an environmental measure. The seats were reupholstered with E-leather, a substance created from scraps the leather industry discards. The material is also lighter, reducing the weight of each aircraft by 600 pounds, and saving on fuel. No incentive . Scott Hamlin, the founder of upcycling company Looptworks and Southwest's only U.S. partner, says the reason companies are resistant to using second-hand materials is that there's no financial imperative. ""It is unfortunately cheaper and easier for most companies to take materials they've used or have purchased at some point in time and just throw them away. Just landfill or incinerate then,"" he says. There is, however, an ecological incentive. According to Hamlin, who will create special-edition bags from the leather, each bag uses 4,000 gallons less water than if created using virgin leather. He also puts the CO2 reduction at 82%. ""The circular economy starts to work when the value of the carbon emissions and water starts coming into play, like in the UK, where they will soon start having tax benefits for low-carbon companies,"" he says. An upcycling uptick? Though Luv Seat is perhaps the largest airline-led upcycling initiative, it is not the first of its kind. When KLM redesigned cabin crew uniforms in 2011, the carrier had the surplus fabric woven into the carpets that lined the business class cabin in the then-new 747-400 fleet. Air France last year had old uniforms recycled into car insulation, and in the past has repurposed plastic meal trays to create cutlery, and used the cables from seat backs to make headphones. ""When we launch a new product, we always ask, 'what is the life cycle of this product and what will we do with it at the end of its life?'"" says Sophie Virapin, Air France's vice president of sustainable development. It's a trend that's only likely to grow. ""This is a new area for us, and with the leather, we're just dipping our toe in the water,"" explains McInnis. ""Our CEO has asked, 'what else can we upcycle?' So I'm hoping we'll see upcycling for years to come.""

"(CNN)Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn should be acquitted of aggravated pimping charges because of insufficient evidence, a prosecutor told a French criminal court Tuesday at the trial of the onetime potential contender for the French presidency. The Lille prosecutor's stance on the case -- in which investigators argued that Strauss-Kahn organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes -- isn't new. His office said in 2013 that evidence didn't support the charges, but investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial, which began two weeks ago. ""Was (Strauss-Kahn) an organizer of these evenings? The answer is no. He did not give instructions,"" Lille Prosecutor Frederic Fevre said, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. ""Has (he) benefited financially from prostitution? The answer is no. Has he paid prostitutes? The answer is no."" Neither the investigation nor the trial supports the pimping charges, Fevre said. Investigators alleged that the sex parties, in locations such as Belgium, New York and Washington, stemmed from a prostitution ring, organized from the Hotel Carlton in Lille. Strauss-Kahn, who was married to French TV journalist Anne Sinclair until their divorce in 2013, has never denied that he took part in the parties. But the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved. In testimony last week, he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda, but he denied organizing the parties or knowing that the women involved in the parties were prostitutes. ""I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever,"" he said last week, adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him. In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. Prosecutors allege that two other defendants, businessman David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of the former IMF director,  picked up the bills for the sex parties. Strauss-Kahn saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011. He was later cleared of the New York allegations. Before that scandal erupted, he had been on track to run for the French presidency -- an election that his Socialist Party later won with Francois Hollande as its candidate. The Lille prosecutor's office in late 2013 asked for Strauss-Kahn's case to be dismissed, citing a lack of evidence. However, the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations. A judgment in the case could come ""within months,"" Fevre's spokeswoman, Maud Perraudeau, said Tuesday. Sandrine Amiel contributed to this report.","""Has (Strauss-Kahn) paid prostitutes? The answer is no,"" prosecutor says .

"(CNN)Kidnapped heiress, bank robber, actress -- and dog breeder? Patty Hearst, granddaughter of powerful publisher William Randolph Hearst, was kidnapped in 1974 by the radical Symbionese Liberation Army and supposedly joined the cause. She's also one of three owners of the shih tzu named GCH Hallmark Jolei Rocket Power, which won the toy dog category Monday at the 139th Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at New York's Madison Square Garden. The dogs compete for best in breed and then for best in group. The seven groups are sporting, hound, working, terrier, toy, non-sporting and herding. The seven dogs named best in group compete for the overall best in show title in the finals Tuesday night. Hearst, 60, has been involved in the dog world for the past decade, a world away from the controversial revolutionary life she once led. In a 1974 bank robbery after her kidnapping, surveillance cameras showed her with a rifle.  She was arrested the following year and charged with armed bank robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. A jury didn't buy her defense of brainwashing and fear that she would be killed if she did not join the Symbionese Liberation Army, and she served two years of her sentence before President Jimmy Carter commuted it in 1979. President Bill Clinton granted her a full pardon. Married to her security guard shortly after leaving prison, Hearst had two daughters and dabbled in acting and writing.","Patty Hearst is one of three owners of shih tzu that won toy dog category .

"(CNN)India may not be the first place to spring to mind when it comes to fine wine, but the country's tradition of viticulture stretches back for centuries. India has produced wine throughout its history, but its popularity waned after phylloxera, a pest which also heavily affected European wine production in the 19th century, ravaged many of the subcontinent's vineyards. However, one man is on a quest to get Indians drinking the grape nectar once again. Rajeev Samant's journey to becoming a winemaker has been unusual -- he studied engineering at Stanford University and got a high-flying job at Oracle after graduating. However, he left it all behind to return to his father's birthplace, Nashik, a city in western India, and started experimenting with different vines. ""I just noticed that Nashik was full of grapes, and no one was making wine in this beautiful place,"" he says. Initially, Samant had a modest goal --  to merely produce wine that was pleasant and drinkable. However, with the help of a noted Californian winemaker Kerry Damskey, he soon realized that the terroir had the potential for much more. ""Things went to a different level. We started from selling just 40,000 bottles of wine to something like 10 million bottles of wine... and it's a beautiful business that has brought not just profit to us but to the greater community at large,"" he says. International acclaim . Samant's Sula Vineyards were the first in India to be featured in Wine Spectator, a respected industry magazine, in 2002. Today, Sula is India's top wine producer, holding about 65% of the country's wine market. The entrepreneur's gamble proved successful, but what had made him abandon a prestigious Silicon Valley job  and throw himself into a new venture? ""I really wanted to do something that I was really passionate about when I wake up every day, and that was something that I wasn't feeling in my corporate job. I strapped on a backpack and just started moving across the world, landing up here in Nashik. ""There is a world of difference between the way I feel now about what I'm doing, full of passion, compared to what I used to do. Every day I'm so excited to take on the challenges. It's my baby, it's as simple as that,"" he says.","Rajeev Samant founded one of India's most successful wineries -- Sula Vineyards .

"Suspected Shiite militiamen opened fire Friday inside a Sunni mosque in northeast Iraq, killing dozens in an attack that appeared to derail the formation of a new government -- something world leaders have said is a must if the country hopes to defeat Islamic militants. The news of the attack that left 65 people dead came as Iraqi forces -- in some cases boosted by U.S. airstrikes -- touted successes in the fight to push back the extremist Sunni Muslim militant group, which calls itself the Islamic State. Militants control large swaths of northern Iraq and eastern Syria. The attack in the Musab bin Omar Mosque in the village of Bani Weis in Diyala province, about 75 kilometers northeast of Baquba, also left at least 17 people wounded, officials said. Sunni lawmakers withdrew from negotiations to form a new government, saying they would not return until those behind the attack were arrested, two party officials told CNN. Iraqi authorities did not immediately identify the attackers, but Sunni politicians have put the blame on Shiite militias. Calling it the latest in a series of attacks by militiamen aligned with Iraqi security forces in the fight against ISIS, Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq -- a Sunni -- said the government must conduct an investigation and hold accountable those behind the attack. ""We want serious action,"" he told CNN. But the United States and the United Nations called on Iraq to continue its efforts to form a united government, saying it is the only way for Iraq to defeat the sectarian divide that allowed ISIS to take hold. ""This senseless attack underscores the urgent need for Iraqi leaders from across the political spectrum to take the necessary steps that will help unify the country against all violent extremist groups,"" Marie Harf, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said. Sunni lawmaker Nahida al-Dayani, who was grew up in the village, told Reuters that roughly 150 people were worshipping inside the mosque Friday morning when Shiite militiamen stormed the building. The attack, al-Dayani told the news agency, was believed to be retribution for a roadside bombing earlier in the day that targeted an Iraqi security force vehicle. U.S. 'understands the threat' U.S. President Barack Obama authorized targeted airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq -- including military advisers -- as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS. The Pentagon also has said the airstrikes are meant to support Iraqi and Kurdish defense operations. Much has been made in recent days about whether the United States needs to expand its operations to go after ISIS fighters in their stronghold in eastern Syria. Asked Friday whether the United States was considering expanding the air campaign into Syria, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said, ""We don't telegraph our punches."" ""I'm not going to get ahead of planning that hasn't been done or decisions that haven't been made,"" Kirby said. ""... I think you can rest assured that the leadership here in the Pentagon understands the threat posed by this group, understands the threat posed inside Iraq."" ISIS vows retribution for killings . ISIS, through one of its Twitter accounts, said Friday that more than 50 of its fighters were killed while defending Jalawla ""against the Peshmerga mercenaries,"" a reference to Kurdish forces. A subsequent tweet said the group vowed revenge. What will it take to beat ISIS? The threat came as Iraqi and Kurdish forces lauded gains against ISIS fighters, taking back several villages in Diyala province, and they surrounded the large ISIS-held town of Jalawla, a spokesman for Kurdish forces said. The Peshmerga and Iraqi commandos inflicted heavy losses against ISIS on Friday as they took back a number of towns and villages around Jalawla in Diyala province, Pershmerga spokesman Brig. Gen. Halgord Hikmat told CNN. Jalawla, a mostly Kurdish city of about 50,000 people roughly 70 miles northeast of Baghdad, was taken by ISIS earlier this year. Kurdish and Iraqi forces now surround it, Hikmat said. In neighboring Salaheddin province, also north of Baghdad, Iraqi helicopters killed 30 ISIS fighters in the town of Dhuluiya, about 70 kilometers northeast of Baquba, Iraqi security officials told CNN. Also Friday, Iraqi forces took another step in their attempt to take back Tikrit, the birthplace of former Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein, Iraqi security sources said. The city fell to ISIS in June. More U.S. airstrikes near Mosul Dam . Meanwhile, U.S. aircraft conducted three more airstrikes against the militants, primarily ISIS-driven vehicles, near the Mosul Dam, the Pentagon said. Since August 8, the U.S. military has carried out 93 airstrikes, 60 of them in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam, according to the Defense Department. The dam is the largest in the country, and Iraqi and U.S. officials fear that a breach in the dam would threaten the lives of millions of Iraqis who live downstream in Mosul and Baghdad. The U.S. airstrikes have continued despite ISIS' threat to kill another American hostage. Earlier this week, ISIS posted to the Internet a video showing the execution of American journalist James Foley. The group threatened the life of another man, believed to be American journalist Steven Sotloff, if the United States didn't end airstrikes in Iraq. Obama vowed justice in a televised address on Wednesday, saying the country would ""continue to do what we must do to protect our people.""

"(CNN)Money makes the world go round, they say, but what if notes and coins were replaced with online code? Bitcoin  -- the world's much talked about cryptocurrency -- is just that. It can't be printed, it can't be directly controlled by governments or central banks, but it can be sent around the world instantly at a low cost. And in sub-Saharan Africa, where 75% of the population don't have a bank account, experts say the currency could help millions of people pay bills and get to grips with their finances. Transferring cash via a bank or a Money Transfer Operator (MTOs) like Western Union or MoneyGram can be costly. According to the Overseas Development Institute, the average charge to transfer $200 to Africa using traditional money transfer services is 12%. If you send $200, you pay $24. The ODI added up all the transfers that happen in a year, and found remittance fees cost the African continent $1.8 billion a year. What if that money could be spent on things, rather than fees? As Bitcoin is a virtual peer-to-peer currency -- designed to operate on the border-less internet -- the costs of transferring money can be radically cheaper than traditional methods, and the process is much quicker. ""Bitcoin can greatly alter the remittances industry and beyond,"" says Michael Kimani, who heads the African Digital Currency Association, a Kenya-based group launched last May to promote digital currency technologies. ""From seven days [for a transaction to clear] using banks & PayPal, down to 20 minutes speaks volumes."" African examples . Beam is a service in Ghana that converts Bitcoin sent from abroad into the local currency,  cedi. Since launching three months ago, it has attracted 30 users who pay a 3% fee on each transaction rather than the average 12% from traditional transfer services. Ghana received $1.7 billion of remittance income in 2012 according to the Bank of Ghana, and Beam's founders are optimistic about the future. ""Bitcoin is going to make a huge difference when it starts to get accepted by merchants in Ghana,"" says CEO Nikunj Handa. ""People won't need to change Bitcoin to any other currency so there will be no broker fees involved and people can get really very low-cost transactions. But Bitcoin is in its early days yet, and we need banks and merchants to catch up."" And the founders are also planning to launch ""Value Remittances"" -- a service which will allow people in other countries to use Bitcoin to pay the water, electricity and phone bills for their family members in Ghana. Kitiwa, a similar service in Ghana, says it has processed over $90,000 worth of Bitcoins, and BitPesa, in Kenya, is another remittance services doing the same thing but with Kenyan shillings. Another sign that Bitcoin is gaining traction in Africa came in August, when Johannesburg got the first Bitcoin ATM on the continent. The machine, which converts cash into Bitcoin, is located at the Metroman beauty salon where customers can pay in crytocurrency. But it's not the only place South Africans can spend their Bitcoin. According to South Africa-based Bitcoin startup Xoin, 30,000 online stores in South Africa now accept the cryptocurrency. ""We have about five transactions a week, and in total I would estimate we have had about 250 transactions,"" explains Rolf Deppe, who operates the machine. ""The main reason we launched the ATM was to create awareness of Bitcoin in Africa... We do expect to see more [Bitcoin] ATMs popping up."" Commission charges for Bitcoin ATMs vary, but Lamassu says the average commission is 5%. And Africa's second Bitcoin ATM is set to arrive in Cape Town soon -- a city hosting a Bitcoin conference in April. Crypto-critics . But not everyone is so optimistic about Bitcoin's future in Africa. Critics say the fees associated with buying crypto-currency must be taken into account when considering the cost of remittances. As well as overcoming the technical challenges of obtaining Bitcoins at an ""exchange,"" users have to also pay a commission. According to Lamassu, the fee is usually 0.5%, but that can vary between exchanges. Bypassing most of the online process is possible with voucher services like Azte, which charges a 4% commission for the convenience. And Xoin, based in Stellenbosch, have come up with a similar proposition involving QR codes on vouchers, which you scan with your smartphone. As well as standard charges, not all banks support Bitcoin companies yet. Some customers of British banks, for example, have to first transfer money from their bank account to a Bitcoin company's account in a European bank. To do this, they pay banking transfer charges and have to wait up to five days for the funds to clear before they get their Bitcoins. Not exactly speedy. Breaking traditions . Competition with existing, established services is also a major reason some say widespread adoption of Bitcoin in Africa is still a long way off. MoneyGram has agents in 25,000 locations across Africa, and Western Union has 32,000 registered locations across the continent. While its yellow and black outposts aren't going away anytime soon, the company is adapting to mobile money transfer. ""Africa, in particular, is kind of at the frontiers of mobile,"" says Hikmet Ersek, chief executive of Western Union. ""The people do like mobile, use it like mobile... but also as a wallet. This mobile wallet has been very successful in Kenya. We did not see a big success in other countries...but the future, I think, will be that, once the consumer figures out how to use it."" It is precisely this complexity, and this issue of trust, which makes the man who founded South Africa's Bitcoin exchange ICE³X.com skeptical about it's widespread adoption on the continent. ""You've got a company like Western Union, which has been around for longer than most people have been alive, and they trust that method,"" says Gareth Grobler. ""That's a huge stumbling block for Bitcoin acceptance."" For Grobler, the real value of the super-secure ""blockchain"" technology which facilitates Bitcoin could be in commodities trading where large sums need to be transferred across borders in a transparent way. Erratic price value . Another major issue with Bitcoin is its volatility. In January 2013, one Bitcoin was worth around $13, surging in December to a high of $1,147. But since then, its value has dropped again and at the time of writing one Bitcoin was worth $221, according to coindesk. ""If I buy Bitcoin and transfer it to another person, the price is very likely to change overtime,"" says Grobler. ""So I could send $200 worth of Bitcoin to someone, but as the price fluctuates they actually only get say $150. Bitcoin is really only going to be a better deal for someone who really understands financial markets and watches the price constantly. Further solutions need to be developed for mainstream adoption and tangible financial benefits."" More from Marketplace Africa . READ THIS: Africa's 'most intelligent' city revealed .

"(CNN) -- In many ways, airplanes are a retailer's dream come true. They serve a captive -- often bored -- audience who have proven their income is disposable enough to afford air travel. It's no wonder that in the last few years, airlines have adapted an increasingly sophisticated approach to parting customers from their money. ""By nature, airlines are mass transit operators, and they didn't necessarily have any retail savviness when they first started to unbundle -- it was very much low-hanging fruits, like chocolate bars and Pringles up and down the aisle,"" says Dan Thompson, senior vice president of global strategy at GuestLogix, a provider of in-flight retail solutions. ""Now, there's a new sense of maturity in retail strategies with airlines,"" he adds. Lately, carriers have replaced mass market beers with craft brews, standard chips with locally sourced gourmet goodies, and added ticketed events to the retail roster. In 2011, AirBaltic even experimented with selling cars on board their flights, becoming the first carrier to do so. ""We think of flight as a travel megastore; we expect to make money for the products that we offer,"" says Jannis Vanags, AirBaltic's vice president for communications. In many ways, the Latvian carrier has been a trailblazer when it comes to its retail offerings. Vanags claims it was the first airline to introduce bicycle rentals, and the first to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. It was also one of the first airlines to allow non-passengers to make surprise purchases (think roses and champagne) for their friends in the air. Currently, customers can also buy AirBaltic-branded shoes on the flight. ""Some things have been batted around in terms of thinking outside the box, in terms of 'how wacky can we get?' and in a sense, the sky is the limit -- excuse the pun -- for what you can sell on board,"" says Thompson. Mainly, though, he notes that it's the tried-and-true that entice customers the most. ""Really, passengers will spend on something that enhances their trip, and means something to them because of the experience they're in at the moment. It's hard to imagine them going on board and buying a sofa that will be delivered back to their apartment."" The odd factor . For many years, airlines left the quirkier retail offering to SkyMall, the quarterly in-flight catalog available on almost all domestic flights in the United States. An old business model (the company is nearing its 25th anniversary), SkyMall has recently had to contend with the more aggressive retail strategies employed by many airlines, as well as distracting new technology; iPhones in the air mean travelers are less dependent on the catalog for entertainment. The company, which has made a name for itself by proffering off-kilter items (the garden yeti and remote-control R2D2 robot are long-standing best-sellers), has recently started to adapt its business model, putting even more focus on quirky products. SkyMall is also in the process of launching a mobile app. ""One of the larger shifts in the last several years is we've become extremely product-centric,"" says Darin Geiger, SkyMall's director of merchandizing. ""We want to be proactive in finding what's new and unique. To that end, we've been going to a lot more trade shows, searching the globe for those new products."" Some of its biggest sellers, notes Geiger, are sports paraphernalia and pet products. Though he says SkyMall's customer base appreciates functionality, it's some of the stranger and more original products that capture the imagination. ""First, we look at products that are new to market, or solve problems. Then, we look for those social-media type products that our marketing team can have a lot of fun with,"" he adds.","To make money, airlines are pushing everything from craft beer to cars .

"(CNN)Some of the world's most important museums are confirming what we've suspected all along but didn't dare say: selfie sticks are stupid. If ever there was a product that preyed so heavily on our fear of insignificance, it's the selfie stick, or as I like to call it, the narcisstick. But wait, there's already a selfie stick company called exactly that, because it's witty and ironic, right? And not painfully honest. More and more museums in New York are announcing bans on the selfie stick. The Museum of Modern of Art (MoMA) has long removed the sticks from their exhibition halls to prevent damage to the artwork. If you've ever set foot in MoMA you'll know what a difficult experience it can be. Not because it isn't an exceptional art institution that's given the world some of its most mind-expanding exhibitions. But because of other people. The MoMA is one of the world's busiest museums -- add selfie sticks among the crowds and you've got a recipe for disaster. The same situation can be found at many famous tourist landmarks. The Forbidden City in Beijing received 15 million visitors last year, more than any other museum in the world. I used to enjoy walking the palace grounds every time I passed through the capital city -- now that everyone's got a selfie stick, I fear for my life. Am I being melodramatic? Let's just say, like seat belts and extramarital affairs, the selfie stick problem doesn't hit home until someone gets hurt. An increasing number of sites have seen the potential hazard and put a stop to things before a ""tragedy"" occurs. The Australian Open has banned selfie sticks, outside of designated selfie zones. Use of unauthorized selfie sticks in South Korea could get you fined. Sports and music stadiums around London have banned the stick, as well. Yet the real issue behind the selfie stick is the selfie itself. It's somehow become socially acceptable for us to take the narcissism of adolescence and extend it thorough adulthood, manifested in selfies. I know I sound like a tired curmudgeon who probably doesn't even know what Instagram is and hates Facebook. I'm none of those things and, yes, I do enjoy the occasional guilty pleasure of a selfie, so I can't and won't be a hypocrite about it. (The gallery above should prove that I understand.) When it comes to traveling, though, when it comes to once-in-a-lifetime visits to sacred landmarks and world-class museums or wandering side streets in strange cities, I'd hope that we could all turn the lens away from ourselves. Or simply put the camera away. Travel writer Paul Theroux once told his readers: ""I never bring a camera -- because taking pictures, I've found, makes me less observant and interferes with my memory."" How much do we rely on photographs to remember our vacations? Does it really matter that we have a formal permanent documentation of every moment of our travels? What if we entirely let go of documenting and just simply experienced? I tried it for a day. It is what I imagine skydiving would be like: terrifying at first, then exhilarating and finally, when I got my mind to stop subconsciously framing every street scene, I became more present than I've ever been on a trip. In any case, selfies are a cliche that have always reminded me of Rowan Atkinson as that sad old buffoon, Mr. Bean, taking self-portraits with his teddy bear in front of Buckingham Palace. Instead of waving a glorified tree branch to take a slightly better version of a cliched shot, let's just move on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zoe Li.

"(CNN)Myanmar President Thein Sein declared a state of emergency Tuesday in the country's Kokang region, where clashes have erupted between rebels and government soldiers. Thein Sein made the announcement on state television, saying that martial law would be imposed in the Kokang self-administered region for three months, effective immediately. Last week state media reported that days of clashes with Kokang rebels had left 47 government soldiers dead and dozens more wounded. Kokang forces lost fighters and territory during offensives by the Myanmar military in 2009, but have regrouped since. They are among multiple minority ethnic groups in Myanmar seeking greater autonomy. The rebels haven't agreed to sign a nationwide peace agreement the government has pursued with armed ethnic groups. According to Thein Sein's order, the commander in chief of Myanmar's military is now in charge of the region's ""administrative rights and responsibility, community peace and tranquility, rule of law and judiciary matters.""

"Copenhagen (CNN)The gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen grew up amid a violent gang culture that ultimately rejected him for his uncontrollable behavior, before he found a new identity in radicalization. So said Aydin Soei, an author and sociologist who met Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein as a troubled teenager in 2011. Police have still not formally named El-Hussein as the suspect in the shootings at a Copenhagen cafe and outside a synagogue. His identity was confirmed by a senior member of the Danish government, however. The Danish-born 22-year-old, reportedly of Arab origins, was killed in a shootout with police. Authorities said he was ""well-known by the police for several criminal incidents,"" including weapons violations and violence, and that he was ""known in connection to gangs."" But questions remain over who he was, how he became radicalized and whether the threat he posed could have been spotted before the deadly attacks. Denmark: The link between gangs and extremism . Soei has an unusual insight into the background of a young man he said was living on the fringes of society for years. The sociologist met El-Hussein and other members of a Copenhagen gang called ""Brothers"" in 2011, a time when rivalry between gangs was intense. ""It was an environment with a lot of gang wars where you couldn't move around freely,"" Soei said. ""The gang wars in Copenhagen started back in 2008 when (El-Hussein) was 15 years old and that's the environment he's been a part of. ""The gang wars meant that the amount of weapons, the amount of violence exploded, so that the generation that he's from has become much more hardcore than any other generation we've seen in Denmark before him."" As a result, Soei said, El-Hussein -- unlike some other would-be jihadists in Europe -- had no need to go to Iraq or Syria to learn how to wield a gun. ""He got his education in using weapons and dehumanizing other people and (being) able to kill them here in Denmark and in the inner city areas,"" Soei said. In El-Hussein's generation, living in his neighborhood, every kid knows someone who's been killed by other gangs, the author said. ""That wasn't normal in Denmark 10 years ago,"" Soei said. ""It's quite a new phenomenon and people like Omar and others from these kinds of gangs, they are more influenced by inner city areas in the United States and the idea of the American gangs than by the Middle East."" But even within that troubled generation, Soei said, El-Hussein -- athletic and a keen boxer -- pushed the limits. When the leaders of his gang and its rivals decided to forge a peace deal, they said they kicked out members whom they could not control, Soei said. El-Hussein was one of them. Deprived of his gang identity and serving time in prison for a violent offense -- a violent, unprovoked stabbing on a commuter train in 2013 -- he appears to have turned to radical Islam instead. Two weeks after leaving prison, he carried out the shootings at the Krudttoenden Cafe, which was hosting a free-speech forum involving Prophet Mohammed cartoonist Lars Vilks, and the synagogue. His former gang has since disowned his actions, saying attacking ordinary civilians is not part of the gang's culture, according to Soei. Officials said he had never been to Iraq or Syria. And it's not yet clear exactly how El-Hussein became radicalized. Many members of Copenhagen's gangs are from an immigrant background with ties to the Middle East, said Soei, so El-Hussein could already have come in contact with radical elements. But, he added, ""After he went to prison and came out, he didn't have anything to lose. I mean, he was a loser man from a ghetto from before he went into prison and when he came out of prison, he was even more isolated.  And it's not a secret that a lot of young men become more radicalized while they're in prison."" El-Hussein swore fidelity to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a posting made on what was apparently his Facebook page just before the shooting spree began Saturday. The post pledges ""allegiance to Abu Bakr in full obedience in the good and bad things. And I won't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief."" A Facebook friend of the shooter told CNN he believed the page, which has since been deleted, matched the profile of his friend. He also said he had trouble relating it ""to Omar the way I knew him,"" saying he had been a good friend who was loyal. Denmark's Security and Intelligence Service confirmed Tuesday that the country's prison service had sent a report last year warning that El-Hussein was at risk from radicalization. However, nothing in the report was enough to trigger suspicions that he was planning an attack, PET said. El-Hussein's path to radicalization -- and what propelled him to act -- will now be under scrutiny. Authorities are ""operating under a theory"" that the gunman may have been inspired by the January terror attacks in France, said Jens Madsen, the agency's chief. Seventeen people died in the Paris attacks, which targeted the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, and a Jewish supermarket. Two of the gunmen were linked to Yemen's al Qaeda affiliate, while a third -- supermarket attacker Amedy Coulibaly -- pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi in a video he emailed out before the assault. The similarities with the Copenhagen attack, in which El-Hussein also targeted a cartoonist who'd depicted Mohammed as well targeting members of the Jewish community, are chilling.

CNN's Ali Younes and Susanne Gargiulo contributed to this report.","Author and sociologist who met the gunman says he grew up in a hardcore gang culture .
