Boeing's machinists on Friday narrowly approved a crucial labor contract that secured thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity for Washington state but will cost workers their pensions. The vote of 51 percent to 49 percent to accept the deal means Boeing Co will build its new 777X jetliner and wings in the Seattle area, where Boeing has built aircraft for more than 90 years. Had the workers rejected the offer, Boeing would have considered making the successor to its popular 777 widebody jet elsewhere, and had received offers from 22 states interested in hosting the new factory. 'This decision means Boeing hopefully will stop pursuit of another site for its 777X program,' said a somber Jim Bearden, administrative assistant to machinist District 751 President Tom Wroblewski. Scroll down for video . Boeing workers cry after learning that voters in District 751 of the Boeing machinists union voted to accept Boeing's latest contract offer to keep the assembly of the Boeing 777X airplane in Washington state, Friday, Jan. 3, 2014, in Seattle . Tina Shay (left) reacts after hearing that a union vote narrowly passed by 51 per cent in support of Boeing's contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District Lodge 751 to construct the wings for the 777X jetliner in Seattle . Union member Gabrielle Rogano (center) reacts with fellow union members after hearing that a union vote narrowly passed by 51% in support of Boeing's contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District Lodge 751 . Tom Wroblewski, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District Lodge 751, enters the union headquarters to announce that a vote narrowly passed by 51% in support of Boeing's contract with the machinists' union . 'They held a gun to our head and our people were afraid,' said Lester Mullen, a District 751 council delegate who works on the current 777 wing production line. Boeing's reaction was in stark contrast to the mood in the Seattle union hall where the results were announced. 'The future of Boeing in the Puget Sound region has never looked brighter,' Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner said in a statement. 'This will put our workforce on the cutting edge of composite technology, while sustaining thousands of local jobs for years to come.' In clinching the agreement, Boeing secured the location favored by analysts and investors, who saw far lower risk in using the factory and workers who now build the 777. Boeing also ensured that the machinists won't have an opportunity to strike until 2024, when the new contract expires. The decision drew praise from political leaders who had brought pressure to bear on the union to approve the deal. In protest: Machinists display signs urging a 'no' vote in Everett, Wash. Boeing machinists had to decide whether to accept a contract that would concede some pension and health care benefits in order to secure assembly of the company's new 777X airplane in Washington state . Striking workers prepare to vote at their union hall on Friday, Jan. 3, 2014, in Everett, Wash . 'I'm very pleased that the best place in the world to build jet airliners for decades will continue for decades to come,' said Governor Jay Inslee in a brief media conference in the state capital Olympia. 'This has been a long road, and I respect everyone who has worked on it, but now's the time to come together, go build this airplane. I'm happy about that.' Addressing a concern raised by union members, Inslee said there were safeguards in recently passed state legislation giving $8.7 billion in incentives to Boeing and the industry to ensure the plane maker keeps 777X jobs in Washington state and doesn't open a second line in another state, as it did in South Carolina with the 787 Dreamliner. After winning the incentives and the contract vote, 'it is time for Boeing to hold up its end of the bargain,' said Rep. Rick Larsen, whose congressional district includes the 777 factory. 'Washington has shown that we stand behind a strong aerospace industry. Boeing should make the same commitment to our state.' Volunteer vote counters tally ballots at the Boeing Machinists union hall in Seattle. Workers were voting on the Boeing Co.'s latest contract offer to keep the assembly of the Being 777X airplane in Washington state . Workers had argued that with Boeing earning healthy profits, and its share price at a record high, it should not be demanding that its workers give up past contract gains. The choice Boeing offered had opened deep rifts between the local International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which opposed the contract, and its Washington, D.C.-based leadership, which forced a vote on the proposal. It had also revealed cleavages between younger workers open to the deal and older workers dead set against it. Some 49 percent of the machinists are 50 or older, the union said. In November, two-thirds of machinists voted against Boeing's first offer, which would have replaced their traditional defined-benefit pension with a defined-contribution savings plan, one of two retirement plans the workers receive. The union's national leadership negotiated that deal. But local leaders opposed it, saying the take-aways were too great. In the vote on Friday, members approved an eight-year contract extension that the union said provided $1 billion in additional benefits beyond the prior offer, but that will halt pension contributions in 2016. Ballots are tallied at the Boeing Machinists union hall in Seattle. Workers were voting on the Boeing Co.'s latest contract offer to keep the assembly of the Being 777X airplane in Washington state . About 600 votes separated yes from no, union officials said. Some members wanted a recount, but the national leaders would not allow it, said Wilson Ferguson, vice president of District 751. Ferguson said about 8,000 members did not vote, up from 5,000 in the prior ballot in November. The union has about 31,000 eligible members. Before the vote, a member filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board taking issue with the timing, just after Boeing's traditional closure between Christmas and the New Year, when many workers were away, the union said. The union allowed online absentee voting. The divide between the local leaders and their national counterparts is mirrored by divisions over the contract that appear to cleave along age lines. Younger machinists had voiced strong concern that failing to vote for the contract would cost them their jobs as Boeing moves the work elsewhere. The 777X is the last major development on Boeing's books for the next 15 years. If the plane was built elsewhere, it would have slowly eroded aerospace jobs in Washington. The average wage is $29 an hour. Many older workers, however, had said the pension was sacred and was worth risking job loss. 'There's plenty of aviation work in the world,' said Kevin Flynn, an aviation maintenance technician inspector, who has filed a separate complaint against the national union leaders with the National Labor Relations Board for holding the vote against the wishes of a majority of members. 'I'll just have to move to where the work is.' Tom Captain, head of the global aerospace and defense practice at Deloitte, said the difficult decision the union faced reflected the fact that aerospace work can be moved to new locations and that price competition between Boeing and rival plane maker Airbus is fierce. 'Although painful tense and emotional, it is clear that there is a sober recognition of the new reality in commercial aerospace manufacturing,' he said.","Boeing machinists had to decide whether to accept a contract that would concede some pension and health care benefits in order to secure assembly of the company's new 777X planes in Washington state .

Mitt Romney emerged for a rare interview Sunday in which finally showed his disdain for jokes made on MSNBC last week at the expense of his infant son. The former Republican presidential told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that liberal TV hosts like Melissa Harris-Perry are welcome to make jabs at him, but this one was below the belt. 'Children, you know, that’s beyond the line,' said the former Massachusetts governor and grandfather of 23. 'Beyond the line': Mitt Romney emerged for a rare interview Sunday in which he reacted to the comments made last week about his adopted black grandson Kieran . 'Moving on': Though he made clear his belief that involving family in political discourse is reprehensible, the former presidential candidate refused to express further outrage over the comments . Romney graciously accepted the tearful apology Harris-Perry gave on Saturday after guests used the race of little Kieran Romney to make a political point. 'He was an answer to prayer,' Romney says of his son Ben's infant boy. 'I recognize that people make mistakes and the folks at MSNBC made a big mistake and they've apologized for it and that's all you can ask for.' Romney kept his forgiving resolve, even as Wallace not-so-subtly tried to goad him into expressing a little more outrage. 'I suspect she took this somewhat more personally,' Wallace said, referring to Mrs. Romney, 'the idea that political discourse would include going after a little baby.' 'We hold no ill will whatsoever,' he said and reiterated that he and his family are 'moving on.' Apology: MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry offered an apology to the Romneys and other inter-racial families . Harris-Perry started her weekend show . with an apology after outrage over her guests' comments had built into a . full blown scandal. Complaints . were made after panelists gave comic captions for photos of key moments . in the past year, including a family portrait of Mitt Romney which . showed his adopted African-American grandson. After . admitting the section was in poor judgment, the MSNBC host was close to . crying as she apologized to the Romneys and other inter-racial . families. What had been meant as a fun review of the year spiraled into a segment where the youngest Romney, Kieran, became the butt of political jokes. Comedian Dean Obeidallah had said: 'It really sums up the diversity of the . Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black . person.' Kieran, pictured with his mother Andelyne, has been adopted by Mitt Romney's son Ben . And actress Pia Glenn added: 'One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same.' Although Harris-Perry, who is African-American, did not directly ridicule the baby, she said during her apology on MSNBC that the idea behind the segment was the result of 'poor judgment'. 'Given my own family history I identified with that picture and I intended to say positive and celebratory things,' she said. 'But whatever the intent was, the reality was the segment proceeded in a way that was offensive.' She added: 'My intention was not malicious but I broke the ground rule that families are off limits.' Forrmer Republican governor Sarah . Palin was among those who criticized the show, saying  MSNBC . should be ashamed of itself for allowing the segment to go to air. 'Leftist media hounds are not . expressing an opinion with this attack; they are expressing a prejudice . that would never be accepted if it came from anyone else but the . lib[eral] media,' Palin wrote on her Facebook page in a post . accompanying the photo of the Romney family. In the broadcast of her apology, Harris-Perry's voice cracked with emotion as she said the core principle of her show was to advocate diversity. She said: 'I am deeply sorry that we suggested that inter-racial families are in anyway funny or deserving of ridicule.' Harris-Perry responded to her critics, saying she was 'genuinely appreciative of everyone who offered criticisms' and adding: 'I am reminded that our fiercest critics can sometimes be our best teachers.' 'Poor judgment': Harris-Perry apologized for asking guests to comment on the Romney family portrait . Obeidallah has also sought to defend himself in an article on the Daily Beast. He said he had received scores of nasty tweets from people calling him a 'baby-bullying bigot.' 'You may think [my joke was]funny, unfunny, cliché, idiotic, etc. Comedy is subjective,' he wrote. 'But say what you will about my quip, I didn't criticize the Romney family for adopting the baby nor did I mock baby Kieran in any way. Nor would I.

The frontman for a fledgling Los Angeles rock band who was sentenced to seven years in prison in after illegally bilking more than $11 million from banks and using it to fuel his fantasy of being a rock star says he 'regrets losing control' over his fraudulent fortune. Robert Mawhinney, 30, pleaded guilty in April to five counts, including money laundering. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in October. The full story of Mawhinney and his lavish rockstar lifestyle will air on ABC's 20/20 tonight at 10pm. Robert Mawhinney, aka Robb 'TaLLLLL' University, was the self-styled frontman of a Los Angeles rock band Lights Over Paris . 'The thing I regret is...kind of . losing control,' Mawhinney told '20/20' over the phone from prison. 'My . lifestyle...it was crazy, and I was hoping deep down that I could . rectify the situation and...pay these things back.' 'I wish I could have done it, or I would have done it without all that money,' he said. Mawhinney was the lead singer for Lights Over Paris, and authorities say he gave the appearance the band was successful. Mawhinney grew up in Orange County, California and as a teen idolized bands like Blink-182, reports ABC. As Mawhinney entered his 20s, he still lacked gigs, a recording contract, and merchandising. What he lacked in actual talent, he mysteriously had in his bank account which he used for trips around the world and expensive hotel rooms. Brian King, who answered a Craigslist ad to be videographer for the band in 2009 told 20/20, 'It was crazy. There was a lot of shopping.  There was a lot of booze, a lot of . champagne, and the hotel suite ended up getting trashed at the end of . the trip.' 'I have no idea where all the women came from,' King said. 'He'd get a . woman to sit in the middle of the buffet table and hand people sushi off . of her body' He received more than $11 million in . loans from four banks. Prosecutors said he gave lenders statements that . claimed he had nearly $8 million in assets, but it turned out his . account had less than $10,000, authorities said. With his borrowed money, Mawhinney managed to afford a $10,500 a month house in the Hollywood Hills and he managed to buy his dreams of becoming a rock star in order for them to come true. In 2009 he was able to gain access to a recording studio equipped with session musicians and string support.

Actress Oliva Hardt was hired to co-star in one of his videos entitled, 'Turn off the Lights' told 20/20 she had questions about how he was able to fund the 6-figure video. 'He told me something along the lines of when his grandfather had passed away that he received some inheritance,' Hardt told 20/20. He lied. Mawhinney 'used the millions of dollars that he fraudulently obtained for the selfish purpose of funding his fantasy of being a rock star,' prosecutors wrote in court documents. Loan officers even visited a recording studio in Burbank to determine if Mawhinney, who used the stage name Robb University, was creditworthy. He said he sought the loans to finish a recording room in the studio, among other expenses, court documents show. Ranee Katzenstein, assistant U.S. attorney, told 20/20, 'The loan officer in the bank asked Mr. Mawhinney to provide proof of . the statements that he made in the application, regarding his assets and . his income.'

'The tax return was entirely fake, and the CPA whose name was used on the . letter...we interviewed him, and he said, again: 'Robert Mawhinney? Never heard of him,' said Katzenstein. Prosecutors said he attempted to pay off of some of his loans with proceeds he received from earlier payouts but eventually defaulted. The band released an EP 'Turn Off the Lights,' which appeared on Billboard's Heatseeker Albums chart, and also produced a video entitled 'I'm Not A Gangsta,' in which Mawhinney is riding shotgun in a Rolls Royce driven by The Game. It was on October 1, 2011 when Mawhinney's lies crept up behind him. Mawhinney was supposed to play a show at the Roxy in Los Angelos but sent a DJ in his place.

David Charles: The 21-year-old from Indiana allegedly stole human brains from a medical history museum . A 21-year-old man who allegedly stole human brains from a medical history museum has been arrested after another man who bought them online alerted authorities. Indiana's David Charles was arrested on December 16 after investigators were tipped off by Brian Kubasco, from San Diego, who became suspicious about six jars of brain tissue he'd bought on eBay for $600. Marion County court documents allege Charles broke into the Indiana Medical History Museum several times between September 7 and October 16 and stole jars of preserved human tissues, including brain samples, from long-dead psychiatric patients. The museum is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital, Central State Hospital, which closed in 1994. The museum's director executive director, Mary Ellen Hennessey Nottage, said the tissues are from autopsies spanning from roughly the 1890s to the 1940s. 'A museum's mission is to hold these materials as cultural and scientific objects in the public interest. To have that disturbed - to have that broken - is extraordinarily disturbing to those of us in the museum field,' she told The Indianapolis Star. Indianapolis police had investigated several break-ins at the museum's storage facility before Kubasco helped lead police to Charles. Kubasco called the Indianapolis museum after noticing labels on the containers that he bought on eBay, court documents state. The Indiana Medical History Museum: The brains were stolen from this museum which is located on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital, Central State Hospital . Stolen: About 60 human brains were reportedly stolen from the museum and 48 have been returned . Indianapolis police detectives traced the transactions and eventually spoke to the seller, Austin Rector. Police said that Rector had obtained the brain matter from Charles. Charles was busted during a police sting after Rector, the eBay middleman, arranged a meeting in a parking lot. A man who drove Charles to the scene - 19-year-old Joshua Milan - allegedly reached for a handgun and was tackled by officers. Court documents also state that the day before his arrest, Charles had stolen 60 jars of human tissue from the museum. NBC Los Angeles reports 48 jars of human brain matter were recovered by police and returned to the medical museum. Nottage said she's grateful much of the stolen material has been returned and that she spoke to Kubasco who tipped off the cops. 'He just said he liked to collect odd things,' she told The Star. Charles faces charges of theft, marijuana possession and paraphernalia possession, according to court documents. It is not clear if Milan, or others involved in the sting or sale of the human brains, will also be charged.","David Charles, 21, allegedly stole 60 human brains from an Indiana museum .

'He was kind of shy, very reserved, but also fun-loving,' Mr Chowdhury told DNAinfo. 'He loved to socialize with friends, he loved going to the movies, trying different dishes.' Haque came to the U.S. four years ago to attend Wabash University, an all-male liberal arts school in Indiana where he studied economics. On Thursday, the university's President Gregory Hess issued a statement of remorse. 'All of us at Wabash are deeply saddened by the news of Aronno's passing. He was a very kind and generous person, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.' Out of the blue: Haque was staying with his uncle in Jamaica, Queens for the break from school. His uncle says he had no idea the 22-year-old was having problems . Loved: Friends and family remembered the lost college student in posts on Facebook and Reddit . Friends and family have been sharing their memories of the young student on Facebook and Reddit. Rudolph Alan says he lived two doors down from Haque in a dorm at Wabash this semester and that they ran into each other often. 'It saddens me to think he may have been in much pain,' Mr Alan wrote, 'but I hope and pray he can be at peace and pray that his family may be given strength during this trying time. May we never forget Aronno Haque.'

A three-year-old girl from Hawaii, who suffered brain damage and fell into a coma after having dental work last month, died last night. Doctors had been unable to revive Finley Boyle, who went into cardiac arrest after allegedly being given the maximum dose of drugs at a dental surgery. Her mother, Ashley, plans to sue the dentist who was working on her daughter, claiming negligence and dangerous conduct. Despair: Ashley Boyle made the heartbreaking decision not to let her 3-year-old daughter live in a vegetative state after she went into a coma last month during dental surgery . Loss: Three-year-old Finley has died a month after a trip to the dentist left her in a coma . Closed: Dr Lilly Geyer, center, has permanently closed her practice, according to her website . Finley Boyle, a 3-year-old Hawaiian . girl who suffered massive brain damage after undergoing a dental . procedure last month, died Friday night, her family's lawyer said . Saturday. The lawsuit . against Lilly Geyer and her Island Dentistry for Children practice . alleges that improper medications with incorrect doses were given to . Finley on December 3, CNN reported. Ms . Boyle was left with the agonizing decision to not resuscitate her . daughter, saying that although she held out hope that her daughter would . recover she didn't want her to live in a vegetative state. 'It sounds like she's drowning in my arms,' Ms Boyle had said at a press conference earlier this week. She had taken Finley to the dentist on December 3 so the three-year-old could have four root canals and 10 cavity fillings. But when Finley was allegedly given the maximum dosage of drugs, she went into cardiac arrest and couldn't be revived. In . the lawsuit, Ms Boyle claimed that Dr Geyer and her associates administered . too much anesthesia and didn't follow protocol to closely monitor . Finley's condition. Ms Boyle is being represented by attorney Richard Fried who called the maximum dosages of five different drugs 'grossly excessive'. Too young: Finley went into cardiac arrest during a trip to a children's dentist . Adorable: Finley, pictured left with her mother and right, was given too high a dose of sedatives, friends claim . He . cited the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's standards which . warned that young children should be monitored every five minutes and that . an extra person should be there to help in case resuscitation is . needed. The procedure on . December 3 broke both of those rules. Instead of checking Finley's . oxygen levels every five minutes, records show she wasn't checked for 26 . minutes which explains why the brain damage was so severe. Innocent: Finley has opened her eyes a few times but has not been responsive, family friends said . When the girl went into cardiac . arrest, a doctor from another office had to be brought in to perform CPR . - which Ms Boyle believes is the main reason her daughter fell into a . coma. 'Had it been initiated at the correct time, she'd be walking out of the hospital right now,' Boyle said. Finley . may not have even needed the fillings. Ms Boyle has been contacted by . others mothers who got second opinions after visiting Dr Geyer and found . out that her recommendations were 'either totally unnecessary or . somewhat unnecessary' according to Fried. Other mothers said their children had trouble walking for a few days after having work done by Dr Geyer . Since Finley went into coma, Dr Geyer has refused to comment to the press. As of Friday, the practice's website says the office is permanently closed. Finley's case is extremely similar to that of Jahi McMath, the California 13-year-old girl who went brain dead after a tonsillectomy on December 9. Her parents just won the right to keep Jahi alive on a ventilator, after the hospital where she was treated tried to take her off life support. Ms Boyle decided to go a different route with her daughter, knowing the realities of her daughter's situation from her career as a nurse. 'She is going to be in a bed with pneumonia, getting turned every few hours. Our bodies can live on forever...I'm a quality of life person. She wouldn't want that,' she had said earlier. 'To see her go from a happy health three year old to going through puberty in a diaper, 15 years later is not a choice I was going to make,' she said. Ms Boyle calls the botched procedure a 'massive tragedy' that she and her family 'will have to deal with for the rest of our lives.'

A video of a middle-aged University of Alabama fan-mom jumping into a group of young male University of Oklahoma fans at the Sugar Bowl on Thursday has quickly become a sensation online, garnering over a million views in just 18 hours. When the video was first released, the audio was covered with music leaving the nature of the fight a mystery. But in the hours since the fight, the woman at the center of the video has stepped forward as Sweet Water, Alabama resident Michelle Pritchett and both she and the college student she kicked in the chest, Oklahoma junior Michael Connolly, have shared their sides of the story online. Scroll down for video . Penalty! A University of Alabama fan mom got into a fight with a rowdy group of young Sooners fans at the Sugar Bowl on Friday. The video of the kicking attack has garnered over a million views in just just a day . The video picks up just as Mrs Pritchett walks across the aisle at the New Orleans Superdome to confront the group of young Sooner fans. She gets up in the face Connolly, going so far as to touch his face. At one point a man who appears to be her husband comes and grabs her away but she soon turns around and leaps head first into the group. When they try to hold her down she starts bicycle kicking everyone around her. Eventually stadium security come up and grab her away and kick her out of the stadium. Mrs Pritchett told Yellowhammer.com that the video makes it look like she's the bad guy, but there's a deeper story which motivated her actions. Bama fan mom: The day after the attack, Michelle Pritchett of Sweet Water, Alabama stepped forward as the assailant in the viral video . 'What I did was probably not the thing to do. But they were taunting us. They began by going after me. But then they crossed the line and started taunting my 16-year-old son,' she said. So she went over to the Oklahoma side and asked the men to 'leave her son out of it' She said their rivalry banter started off friendly but escalated when they tried picking a physical fight with their son. 'I said, ""no, that's not going to happen. This crap needs to stop.""' That's when her husband pulled her away from the group the first time. It was when one of the men called her a 'stupid b****' while she was leaving that she snapped and jumped into the rowdy crowd. She says that the security guards had already warned that group about throwing bottles so when they escorted her out of the stadium, they said she shouldn't be worried about the college boys pressing charges. She believes if security had just kicked them out when they started throwing bottles originally, the incident would have never happened. The video starts with Mrs Pritchett confronting Michael Connolly, getting right up in his face . Breaking up the fight: A man who appears to be her husband grabs her away from the group .

Oklahoma Junior Michael Connolly gave a slightly different version of events to Sports Illustrated's Extra Mustard. He says Mrs Pritchett and her family were the first to talk smack at the beginning of the game when Alabama was winning. When Oklahoma took control of the field, he agrees that he and his friends got a little rowdy and started yelling anti-Alabama remarks in the family's general direction. Because she was the only one standing in her section, he believes she felt singled out. At one point one of his friends yelled: 'Bama fans, I yell ""Roll Tide"" when I eff my cousin.' One of their comments caused her son to try and pick a fight with them and they told him: 'No come down here'. On his Twitter, Connolly even captured Mrs Pritchett flipping the group off moments before the attack. The Sooner side: Oklahoma junior Michael Connolly (left) gave a different version of events on a different website, and even posted a video on Twitter showing Mrs Pritchett antagonizing his group before she attacked . That's when he says the video started. She came down into their section and started screaming at him and sticking her tongue out so he asked: 'Are you trying to make out with me?' and one of his friends started chanting 'Kiss her! Kiss her!' 'That’s when she walked away, and then jumped me. When she kicked me, it left giant boot marks on my shirt. I’m not sure if the guy restraining her was her husband or not—they weren’t sitting right next to each other—but she was kicked out of the game and her two daughters were crying,' Connolly said. As of late Friday night, Connolly claimed in a Tweet to have received an apology message from Mrs Pritchett. Earlier, Mrs Pritchett's only concern seemed to be how the video would impact her Roll Tide team. 'I'm embarrassed. I love The Tide and I apologize to all the players and to Coach Saban and to the entire fan base. I'm sorry. Coach Saban's going to say ""those crazy fans don't know hot to act."" And I wasn't intoxicated either. I want people to know that. I'd had a couple of drinks, but I was not intoxicated.' But as a mother, she knows where her real allegiances lie.

The Miami farmhand who brutally raped, murdered and dismembered nine-year-old Jimmy Ryce in 1995 will be executed next month, Florida Governor Rick Scott announced yesterday. Juan Carlos Chavez, 46, will be killed by injection on February 12 over the murder which shocked America and led to new laws allowing the state to indefinitely detain sexual predators. After nearly 20 years of anguish and uncertainty, Jimmy's family say Chavez's execution is the justice they have been waiting for. Death row: Juan Carlos Chavez, pictured on January 9, 2007, in a Miami courthouse, will be executed on February 12 over the brutal rape and murder of Jimmy Ryce, nine, in 1995 . Jimmy Ryce: The nine-year-old was kidnapped, raped and shot dead by farmhand Juan Carlos Chavez in 1995 . 'I just received the news that justice . will finally be done in the murder of my son, Jimmy, on September 11, . 1995,' father Don Ryce said in a statement, according to The Miami Herald. 'I feel . a combination of sadness and relief. I hope this sends a message to . predators that this behavior will not go unpunished.' Don Ryce is expected to address the media today. Jimmy disappeared on September 11, 1995, near his school-bus stop. In December, the young boy's book bag was found in the trailer where Chavez was . living. His dismembered remains were found sealed in cement-filled pots behind Chavez's home. Following 50 hours of police questioning, Chavez confessed to kidnapping Jimmy at gunpoint, driving him to the remote trailer on a horse farm, raping him, then shooting him when he tried to run away. Chavez said Jimmy asked him at least twice if he was going to be killed, a question Chavez refused to answer. In happier times: Jimmy Ryce (right) with his sister Martha and father Don Ryce . Chavez was sentenced to death in Orange County on November 23, 1998. At the sentencing, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marc Schumacher highlighted the savagery with which Jimmy was treated. 'The defendant, Juan Carlos Chavez, by his actions has forfeited his right to live among us,' Schumacher said. 'There can be no doubt that Samuel James Ryce lived every minute of the last few hours of his life with the fear of death.' However, Chavez delayed his inevitable execution by nearly 20 years by appealing the decision. The Miami Herald reported the Florida Supreme Court twice considered and rejected his appeals. Chavez's lawyers raised an array of appeal issues, including his original defense lawyer testifying in 2007 that he failed to properly defend Chavez because he was on medication for vertigo and a hearing disorder. Game changer: President Clinton signs the Jimmy Ryce ASAP Children's Assistance Act, on  January 19, 1996, in the White House as Ryce's parents Don and Claudine, along with Marc Klaas, right, whose daughter Polly was kidnapped and killed in 1993, look on . Jimmy's horrific murder sent shock waves around Florida, with the little boy's parents becoming crusaders . for child victims. Don and Claudine Ryce created a foundation in their son’s name, helping schools develop 'stranger-danger' programs, donating tracking bloodhounds to police . departments, supporting the parents of abducted children and pushing . for anti-predator legislation. In 1996, they met with then-President Bill Clinton as he signed . an order allowing the posting of missing children’s photos in federal . buildings. They also pushed for the 1998 Jimmy Ryce Act which allows the state to indefinitely detain violent sexual predators who have completed their sentences. Claudine Ryce died of a heart attack in 2009. Martha Ryce, Jimmy’s sister, committed suicide at age 35 in December 2012. Jimmy's killer had outlived them both. Chavez will be executed at the Florida State Prison in Starke.

A 19-year-old teen who was allegedly driving drunk when he lost control  of his pick up and killed a college volleyball star who was in the passenger seat has been charged with homicide. Ethan Kenney, of Dunbar, Pennsylvania, was 18 at the time of the crash that killed his friend, 19-year-old college volleyball star Catherine 'Cat' Healy . The two were driving on Ridge Boulevard in Dunbar Township about 4am on Sunday June 9 when the vehicle careered off the road and hit a guide rail and a tree. Deceased: Star college volleyball player Catherine 'Cat' Healy, 19, was killed in a car crash in Dunbar Township, Pennsylvania, in June. The driver of the vehicle was now been charged with her murder . Murder charges: 19-year-old driver Ethan Kenney has been charged with homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence and other related charges in a June crash that killed college volleyball player Cat Healy . Scene: Ethan Kenney, a known wrestler at Connellsville Area High School, was only 18-years-old and allegedly intoxicated when he lost control of the pickup he was driving and hit a guide rail and tree, killing passenger Cat Healy . Healy was kept on life support for a day and a half but was legally declared brain-dead. Kenney fled the scene after emergency medical personnel arrived but before police arrived. He was located a short time later suffering minor injuries, with police saying they believed he was intoxicated but were awaiting toxicology results. On Thursday Kenney was charged with homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence, accident involving death, driving under the influence of alcohol and nine summary offenses, all in connection with the crash, according to WTAE. Kenney was a well-known wrestler at Connelsville Area High School. Healy was a 2011 graduate of Connellsville Area High School and up for captain of the volleyball team at Penn State Behrend. Rising star: Catherine Healy was expected to be made captain of the volleyball team at Penn State Behrend when classes resumed in August. She died in June . Relatives of the Lion's middle-hitter said that, thanks to organ donation, Healy's death saved the lives of five people. 'We made the decision about the organ donations pretty quick,' said Healy's father, George Appel. The Center for Organ Recovery and Education (CORE) quickly prepared five recipients for Cat’s organs. 'It's the most selfless act that you could ever do, you know, is to share. To pass on,' said Appel. 'As hard as it is, you’ll be saving lives by passing on those organs.' The lives of five people were saved by the death of Cat Healy, whose parents made the quick decision to donate eight of her organs . The family has reason to believe one of those recipients was 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan, whose legal battle for an adult lung transplant changed the federal law. In August a volleyball court at Mountz Creek Park, near Healy's high school, was named in her honor. 'Cat was absolutely beloved by her teammates and coaches,' said head coach Phil Pisano. 'She had such a kind spirit and beautiful soul, and brought tremendous joy and energy to our gym each day with her presence. 'Although this loss is devastating, we feel blessed to have been a part of her life and will carry forward with us her spirit and enthusiasm.'","Catherine 'Cat' Healy, 19, was killed in a car crash on June 9 in Dunbar Township, Pennsylvania .

On the field Saturday night, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck showed the world his power and leadership. In the locker room after the game, she showed the world his naked hind end. The NFL star, who led his team to a stunning comeback victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, inadvertently appeared in the buff in a locker room picture tweeted by his teammate Pat McAfee. Luck was, well, lucky, that a well-placed cell phone shielded his modesty from full view. Oops: Andrew Luck, top left corner, was caught unawares - and unclothed - in this locker room picture tweeted y a teammate . Rally: Luck, 24, led his team to overcome a 28-point deficit and win . McAfee didn't even realize that Luck was in the frame - he was attempting to show a humorous picture of veteran kicker Adam Vinatieri wearing a collared shirt and sweater - with a towel wrapped around his waist - while he gave an interview. An NBC Sports photographer caught the error. He retweeted the picture with the words, 'Umm oops?' McAfee, the Colts' 26-year-old punter, soon spotted the mistake. 'Oh boy.. Half naked Andrew in the back of that last one.. He looked damn good though,' he tweeted. Later, adding: 'I feel awful for that Luck photobomb.. Really thankful all his parts were covered.. And now I'm hoping the future HOFer (Hall of Famer) forgives the mistake.' Luck's naked shot was likely one of the last things on his mind Saturday night. The second-year NFL quarterback, 24, led the Colts to a 45-44 victory over the Chiefs - after rallying from a 38-10 deficit after halftime. Luck's heroics - including throwing for 443 yards and four touchdowns - will no doubt go down as one of the best performances in NFL playoffs history. Only twice before have teams rebounded from such a deficit in league history. In 1980, the San Francisco 49ers rallied from 28 points behind to beat the New Orleans Saints. In 1992, the Buffalo Bills came back 32 points in the playoffs to beat the Houston Oilers. Luck, a Texas native who graduated from Stanford University with a degree in architectural design after playing football there for four years, was drafted in the first round by the Indianapolis Colts. He will face either Tom Brady and the New England Patriots or his Colts predecessor Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos next week in the first round of the divisional playoffs.","Luck led the Colts to a 45-44 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs Saturday night in the AFC wild-card game .

The bank, known as the Children's Development Khazana (CDK), was set up and is now run by children in the Fatehpuri neighbourhood of Old Delhi, India. The bank was established on the principle the children would make all the rules and . decisions. Show them how it's done: Street children queue up at the counter to deposit money at their very own bank . Deposit: Children wait to deposit their earnings at the bank - called the Children's Development Khazana . NGO volunteers from child rights organisation Butterflies, however, assist the day-to-day running of the bank and sort out any logistical issues. Children . aged nine to 18 can deposit anything from a couple of pence to . one pound and get 3.5 percent on their deposits. They can then withdraw up to five pounds at a time.

I can withdraw money when . the need arises.' Paperwork: Four members show their pass books - which are needed to make a deposit . Pass book: Information such as name and date of account opening is included in the document . Charity program manager at Butterflies, Shashidhar Sabnavis, said: 'Street children were telling us that they lose their money. Or they tend to spend their money here and there. 'So, we at Butterflies decided on the idea of operationalizing a bank for them. 'They use their savings in the khazana . (bank) to meet their future needs. 'Some of them use their money to go . for higher education, or vocational training. Some of them use it to . start small business enterprises.' The charity also provides education, shelter and care for Delhi's vulnerable children. Future: It is hoped the members, two with passbooks pictured, learn life skills while staying at the shelter . Education: The NGO also runs classes for the children (pictured) and offers them shelter and food . Learning: Many of the children were not in school  - one class pictured - before they joined the NGO . A teacher working for the organisation Firdaus Ahma said: 'Some kids here have jobs. They work in shops or tea stalls. We talk to those kids and motivate them to study and join our classes. 'This helps us bring them into the mainstream. 'When kids start depositing their earnings in the bank. That is an education for life. They will inculcate the habit of making savings. This will become a habit and help them in the future.'

Tearful goodbye: Phil Everly (pictured in 2011, right, and with wife Patti, left, at a Country Music Hall of Fame event in 2009) had been suffering complications from a lung disease . His widow Patti, who blamed his death . on a lifetime of cigarette smoking, said: ‘We are absolutely . heartbroken. He fought long and hard.’ The . Everly Brothers were arguably the most influential vocal duo in music . history. They brought their love of country music to rock 'n' roll in . the 1950s and 1960s, transforming the pop charts of the day and . inspiring legions of young proto rockers like the Beatles, Bob Dylan and . the Byrds who would go on to change popular culture. Songs . like 'Bye Bye Love' and 'Wake Up Little Susie' remain a shared memory . for generations of listeners who were hooked by their deceptively simple . harmonies that hid greater meaning in songs that were dark and new . compared with the pop music of the day. The . two broke up amid quarrelling in 1973 after 16 years of hits, then . reunited in 1983, 'sealing it with a hug,' Phil Everly had said at the time. There . was a heavy outpouring on social media following Evely's death, . proving The Everly Brothers remain relevant a half-century after their . first hits. Legendary . duo: Along with his 76-year-old brother Don, the Everly Brothers still . hold the record for the most top 100 singles by any duo in history . He left a towering legacy that still inspires half a century after The Everly Brothers' first hit. One could argue that while Elvis Presley was the king of rock `n' roll, Phil and Don Everly were its troubled princes. They sang dark songs hidden behind deceptively pleasing harmonies and were perfect interpreters of the twitchy hearts of millions of baby boomer teens coming of age in the 1950s and `60s looking to express themselves beyond the simple platitudes of the pop music of the day. The Everlys dealt in the entire emotional spectrum with an authenticity that appealed to proto rockers like the Beatles and Bob Dylan, who gladly pass the credit for the sea changes they made in rock to the ruggedly handsome brothers. The Beatles, the quartet whose pitch-perfect harmonies set the pop music world aflame, once referred to themselves as 'the English Everly Brothers.' And Dylan, pop culture's poet laureate, once said, 'We owe these guys everything. They started it all.' Two generations later, artists are still finding inspiration in the music. Most recently, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong and Norah Jones lovingly recorded a tribute to the Everlys and their unique album 'Songs Our Daddy Taught Us.' Singing . in heaven: The country crooners' signature harmonies and steel-string . guitars influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Elvis Presley, Neil . Young, Jack White, and Elliot Smith . 'There's so much darkness in those old . songs,' Armstrong said recently. 'I think mainly that's just how people . communicated when it came to mourning and loss. Then with the Everly . Brothers it sounds like these two little angels that sing.' That reaction was universal for the Everlys. Their hit records included the then-titillating 'Wake Up Little Susie' and the era-identifying 'Bye Bye Love,' each featuring their twined voices with Felice and Boudleaux Bryant's lyrics that mirrored the fatalism of country music and the rocking backbeat of modern pop music. These sounds and ideas would be warped by their devotees into a new kind of music that would ricochet around the world. Listen to the Everlys' 'Cathy's Clown,' for instance, then the Fab Four's 'Please Please Me.' You'll hear it right away. Simon & Garfunkel also were strongly influenced by the Everlys and recorded live versions of 'Bye Bye Love' and 'Wake Up Little Susie.' In all, the brothers' career spanned five decades, although they performed separately from 1973 to 1983. In their heyday between 1957 and 1962, they had 19 top 40 hits. 'They . had that sibling sound': 11-time Grammy winner Linda Ronstadt covered . the brothers' track When Will I Be Loved back in 1975 . Influential: Sir Paul McCartney mentioned 'Phil . and Don' in his song Let 'Em In, and Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman . Anthony Kiedis named his six-year-old son Everly . Although their number of hit records declined in the late 1980s, they made successful concert tours in this country and Europe. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, the same year they had a hit pop-country record, 'Born Yesterday.' They also are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame, a nod to their heritage. Phil Everly was born to folk and country music singers Ike and Margaret Everly on Jan. 19, 1939, in Chicago, two years after his older brother. As the sons of country and western singers, they had been performing since they were children and were the most country-oriented of the early rock giants. The brothers began singing country music . in 1945 on their family's radio show in Shenandoah, Iowa, and though . their sound would become more cosmopolitan over time, they never strayed . far from their country roots. Don Everly and Phil Everly, The Everly Brothers in 1970 - the brothers were hugely influential on acts such as The Beatles and Bob Dylan . Don Everly said in a 1986 Associated Press interview that the two were successful because 'we never followed trends. We did what we liked and followed our instincts. Rock `n' roll did survive, and we were right about that. Country did survive, and we were right about that. You can mix the two but people said we couldn't.' Their breakup came dramatically during a concert at Knott's Berry Farm in California. Phil Everly threw his guitar down and walked off, prompting Don Everly to tell the crowd, 'The Everly Brothers died 10 years ago.' During their breakup, they pursued solo singing careers with little fanfare. Phil also appeared in the Clint Eastwood movie 'Every Which Way but Loose.' Phil Everly last performed in public in 2011, but his son Jason told The Associated Press on Friday he had been actively writing songs, living part of the year in Burbank and the rest in Nashville. He said his father had been in the hospital for about two weeks when he passed away. Together:  In this 1984 file photo, Phil, left, and Don Everly, of the Everly Brothers joke around for photographers in New York City.  Everly, who with his brother Don formed an influential harmony duo that touched the hearts and sparked the imaginations millions . Though the COPD caused by smoking affected his health, Jason Everly said it never affected that voice. 'He sang like an angel,' his son said. 'It was pretty surprising how he could still get those notes. We would still talk about it and sing together.' The inspiration attributed to the Everlys' voices brought the brothers together again in 2003 at the request of Simon & Garfunkel, a duo known to fight bitterly as well. The resulting tour brought a chuckle from Simon in a Rolling Stone interview. 'It was hilarious that the four of us were doing this tour, given our collective histories of squabbling,' Simon said. 'And it's amazing, because they hadn't seen each other in about three years. They met in the parking lot before the first gig. 'They unpacked their guitars - those famous black guitars - and they opened their mouths and started to sing. And after all these years, it was still that sound I fell in love with as a kid. It was still perfect.'","Phil Everly died aged 74 on Friday from complications from lung disease .

From the end of Prohibition through the 1960s, New York's Stork Club was the epicenter of celebrity society. The night club in Midtown was founded by ex-bootlegger Sherman Billingsley, who kept his famous customers happy with good service - communicating to his wait staff through a secret language of hand signals that ranged from 'No need to pay attention to these folks' to 'Bring a bottle of champagne'. Billingsley revealed his secret code in 1944, and LIFE recently republished the set of the pictures. Perhaps the most surprising hand signal is a simple thumbs up, which meant 'Get them out and don't let them in again'. Secret language: LIFE recently republished Stork Club owner Sherman Billingsley's secret hand signal codes that he used in the legendary New York club. A thumbs up was not a good signal for a customer receive. It meant 'Get them out and don't let them in again' That's a hand signal Milton Berle, Elliott Roosevelt, Humphrey Bogart and Jackie Gleason probably all saw when they visited the legendary club, as all four were eventually banned. But most of the secret signals were good signs, and usually meant a treat for whatever customer Billingsley was chatting up that night. If he adjusted his tie, it meant the table wouldn't be seeing a check - Billingsley was footing the bill. When he grabbed his pocket square, a server somewhere was sent to fetch a $200 bottle of perfume as a gift. 'The music in the main dining room is too loud': Some of Billingsley's hand signals were purely for the servers and not comments about the people he was talking to . Spoiler: Billingsgley often showered his customers with gifts from free rounds of drinks (hand signal left) to $200 bottles of perfume (hand signal right) And more gifts: When he adjusted his tie, it meant he was paying the tables check. And a laid out hand on the table it meant to bring a complimentary bottle of champagne . Billingsley was notorious for his generosity, and customers often left with anything from a gold compact to cigar clippers. Other than getting the boot, the only bad hand signals were the ones labeling customers as bores. When he scratched his nose it meant the table he was talking to had no important people at it. And if he made a cuffing hand over his ear, he wanted a server to pretend he had a call so he could leave. Bores: Scratching his nose meant the table he was talking to wasn't important (left) and cuffing his hand to his ear meant someone needed to pretend he had a call so he could politely excuse himself from the table (right) But with clientele like Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, and Ernest Hemingway, it's hard to imagine Billingsley used those hand signals very often. The Stork Club was torn down in 1965, and today a park sits in its place. But Billingsley's secret language of hand signals lived on even after his club's death and continues to be used in fine-dining restaurants across the nation.","The Stork Club was an upscale Manhattan club located in Midtown from the end of Prohibition to 1965 .

Charged: Matthew Sowders faces two capital murder charges for the death of his estranged wife Melissa and her unborn child . The estranged husband of a pregnant young mother whose strangled body was found in a Houston river has now been arrested and charged with her murder. Matthew Sowders claims that his now-dead wife, Melissa, pulled a gun on him and his lawyers are entering a not guilty plea. Prosecutors paint an entirely different picture, saying that Matthew told two different friends that he strangled his wife on Boxing Day after an altercation that occurred when she met him to drop off one of their children with him at an area McDonalds. 'The defendant came to her residence on December 26, she stated he was soaking wet and his truck was covered in mud. He told her she strangled her to death after he pulled a gun on her,' one of the prosecutors said in court, according to The Inquisitr. 'He said he stuffed her into a large black trash can and transported to Cypress Creek and there he submerged her body.' The 28-year-old now faces capital murder charges for both Melissa, 26, and her unborn child. Other reports assert that Matthew snapped when he found out that the unborn child was not his and rather was a result of her relationship with her current boyfriend Jason Sanford. Melissa, who has four children with Matthew, was two months pregnant with she and Jason's child at the time that she disappeared on December 26. Fears: Melissa Sowders, 26, has been missing since last Thursday. The pregnant mother-of-four was going to meet her estranged husband when she vanished and her abandoned car was found the next day .

The . investigation included surveillance footage that showed her rubbing her . stomach as she headed to meet Matthew's godparents the day before she . disappeared. She was not showing at the time, but her attention to her stomach made it clear to viewers that she was aware of her pregnancy. Concerns: Her family says she was terrified of her ex - but police have not named him a suspect . Matthew . Sowders originally claimed that he had nothing to do with his estranged . wife's disappearance, but went on to hire a lawyer and stop cooperating . with police. The . Inquisitr reports that he filed for divorce from Melissa, the mother of . his four children who are all under the age of 8, in October but still . had questions about the unborn child's paternity. 'As far as we know he has threatened . her numerous times. He has had a knife to her throat before,' Melissa's . cousin Michelle Bierman told ABC News. 'We think he just went off the edge when he found out she was two months pregnant with Jason's child.' Miss Sowder's family say they fear she is already dead, that she drowned in Cypress Creek. 'The water is cold, she's in there. It's not a proper place,' Michelle Bierman, Miss Sowder's cousin, told KHOU. Mr Sanford, told police he last saw her when she took him to work at 6.15am on Thursday in her white Honda Accord. He . told deputies that she was supposed to meet her ex-husband and their . youngest daughter at a McDonald's - and her family said they fear he . could be involved in her disappearance. Search: Deputies with the Harris County Sheriff Department had searched a wooded area along Cypress Creek on Saturday. They were then searching the water for any signs of the woman's body . Hunt: Volunteers used sonar equipment to search for the missing mother in the creek . 'She was terrified of him. Terrified,' Michelle Bierman, Sowders' cousin, told KHOU11 on Monday.

'Pretty much from the first day that we knew she was missing, and the circumstances of how she went missing. We knew. We knew,' Bierman added. Court records show that the ex-husband, who has custody of their children, actually filed for divorce in October. Authorities have interviewed the man but have not named him as a suspect.

According to a coroner's report released Friday, the actor's skin burned off, he suffered from multiple broken bones and a fractured jaw after his November 30 car crash in a California suburb. It was also revealed the driver of the Porsche Carrera GT carrying the Fast & Furious icon was going 100 mph or more.

Crash scene: The driver was going 100mph when the accident happened, according to a Friday report from Fox News . The 40-year-old could have taken a few breaths after impact as bits of soot were found in his trachea, the report states. The cause of death - which was already stated on his Death Certificate - was from 'combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries.' The actor's entire body was charred through the skin it was burned so badly none of his organs were suitable for donation, according to the report. His body was discovered in the passenger seat in a 'pugilistic stance,' which means he was in a defensive position preparing for a crash. There were multiple fractures throughout his body, including his jaw, collarbone, and left upper arm according to the report. There were also various ribs and pelvic fractures. Coroner's report: Also on Friday a final summation of the 'traffic collision' was released .

Guests rushed to put out the flames with fire extinguishers but the fireball had already engulfed the car. Final scene: Vin Diesel posts a picture of the last scene he filmed with Paul Walker in Fast & Furious 7 . The pair were friends and had been racing for several years.

A former Soprano's star who has recently been released from prison hopes to return to acting following his incarceration. In fact, Lillo Brancato, 37, already has his first on-camera role lined up. Brancato was sentenced to 10 years for his role in a botched robbery that led to the shooting death of an off-duty NYPD police officer. Prodigal son returns: Sopranos actor Lillo Brancato returning to his family home upon his release from prison Tuesday after serving more than eight years in connection with a botched robbery in which police officer Daniel Enchautegui was shot dead .

Close eye: Many NYPD officers are upset at the early release of Brancato Tuesday, and will be watching his every move . He must stay with his family in New York's Yonkers for at least six months under the conditions of his parole. Brancato told the New York Post that his friend nightclub owner and sometime producer Noel Ashman is producing a . short fim in which he will star that begins shooting later this month. 'I . really do love acting, and for any opportunity, for anyone to take a . chance on me so quickly, it’s humbling and I’m just so grateful,' Brancato said. After that, he said, he'd like to move to the West Coast and try and resurrect his once-promising acting career. Brancato rose to fame in the 1993 . movie A Bronx Tale, playing a young kid from the neighborhood who is . torn between two worlds and two men: a local mobster played by Chazz . Palmintieri and his straight-and-narrow bus-driver father, played by . Robert DeNiro. Other . roles followed, most notably a stint on the second season of The . Sopranos. His character carried out a series of low-level crimes for the . New Jersey mob before being gunned down by Tony Soprano and his . sidekick as he tearfully begged for his life. Brancato told the New York Daily News that he hopes to get back in touch with DeNiro and Pamintieri. 'These are the guys who gave me my first shot,' he said. 'I’d muse they’re definitely disappointed in what happened, and I just want to let them know I’m sorry for that. 'I want to show them I’m no longer that person, and I used my time in prison wisely.'

The . New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Assocation also said on Monday . that they were outraged by this decision and reiterated their belief . that Brancato was respons . Yolanda Rosa, the sister of Enchautegui, said that she was notified only on Tuesday that Brancato would be released on Wednesday after being granted parole earlier in the month. 'I’m still upset that he was not convicted of the murder, and that he did not serve enough time,' Yolanda Rosa said to the New York Post. 'I don’t know how I will feel tomorrow when he is free, walking on the streets, while my brother will not.' Authorities told Rosa that Brancato had been a model prisoner behind bars, a suggestion she scoffed at. 'Well, he wasn't a model citizen before - we’ll see if he’s a model citizen after he gets out,' she added. Speaking to the New York Daily News, Rosa expressed her disbelief that the once-promising young actor would be released so soon. 'He didn’t serve enough time. He was equally as responsible as the other guy,' Rosa said. 'Not a day goes by that I don’t think about my brother.' Announcement: Lillo Brancato took to Twitter from prison to announce that he was being released from jail on December 31 . Grief: Police Officer Daniel Enchautegui's father Pedro Enchautegui (3rd L) is consoled by a police officer as others prepare to carry his casket out of St. John's Chrysostom Church after his funeral mass in New York December 14, 2005 . Prosecutors said that in December 2005, Brancato and Steven Armento broke into the Bronx house of a friend looking to steal prescription drugs after a night of drinking at a strip club. Officer Enchautegui heard the commotion next door from his homeand went to investigate. Armento shot the 28-year-old officer with the .357 Magnum he was carrying in the heart and the dying officer fired back shooting both men. As a result of the death of an officer, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder - but was only convicted of burglary in 2008 and was sentenced to serve 10 years and five-years probation in 2009. Armento was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder. In a statement Monday, PBA President Patrick J. Lynch said he believed Brancato was guilty in the officer’s death. 'It is our firm belief that Lillo Brancato is guilty of the murder of police officer Daniel Enchautequi even though he was only convicted of attempted burglary. 'Even while incarcerated, this lowlife thug showed his true colors when he beat up a fellow inmate who wouldn’t get off a pay phone quickly enough,' Lynch said in the statement. Promising: Lillo Brancato with Robert De Niro as they film Bronx Tale in 1993 . Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association trustee Joe Anthony said he was outraged by the decision by the parole board. 'I sat in the courtroom everyday with the family while that smug punk smiled and laughed at them,' he said. 'I hope someone taught him respect in prison.' Brancato, who was allowed to maintain a Twitter account while serving his sentence, posted a message of thanks online to all his supporters. 'With that being said, this will be my last tweet from prison. Thank you for your love and support. I love you all!' he tweeted to his 3,364 followers. HBO hit : Lillo Brancato appears in the seminal mob drama The Sopranos in the early years of the 2000s . Brancato, now 36, and Armento, 51 , were drinking together at a strip club in December 2005 before deciding to break into the basement apartment in a hunt for Valium, prosecutors said during the 2008 trial. Brancato testified during the trial there was a never a break-in. He claimed that he had known the owner, a Vietnam veteran, for several years. He also said he had permission to go inside and take painkillers and other pills whenever he felt like it, and didn't know the man had died earlier that year. The pills were part of a drug problem that he said began when he was 'introduced to marijuana' on the set of A Bronx Tale. He later became hooked on crack and heroin, he said. He told the jury that while suffering from judgment-impairing heroin withdrawals on the night of the shooting, he accidentally broke the kitchen window of the apartment in a desperate attempt to wake up his old pill-supplier. 'I was becoming dope sick,' Brancato testified. 'Mentally, I was a mess.' Brancato tried to deflect suggestions by the prosecution that his testimony - at times punctuated by vignettes about his drug-crazed downfall - was another acting job. Warm welcome: Not everyone is as pleased as Lillo Brancato's family that he has been released from prison early, including Rosa Enchautegui, sister of the officer shot dead during the 2005 robbery . Media attention: Brancato says he is a reformed drug addict and alcoholic, and has been attending AA meetings in his hometown of Yonkers, New York . Brancato says his drug problem was so severe his own family nearly disowned him, and that he was still using at Rikers. ‘I had all these people supporting me, and they finally had had it,' he told the New York Post.

Jon Stewart has left his 'Daily Show' in the capable of hands of John Oliver for the summer, and it seems the eager Brit could not wait to get his bum in the chair as he hijacked last nights show just moments before Stewart signed off. As Stewart prepared to show his final 'Moment of Zen' before his 12-week summer break, Oliver was seen lurking under his desk, taking measurements and ordering directors to remodel the set in pink. Surprised Stewart was still around, the two chatted: 'Oh wow, you're still here,' Oliver said. 'Looks like we have us an awkward situation on our hands.' Scroll down for video . Signing off: Jon Stewart is taking a three-month break to work on his first feature film . Stewart played his supposed 'Moment of Zen' segment with Oliver interrupting. 'Hahaha! It's my show now! You can't even throw to Zen without me butting in. Hey look! I've got your pens! I'm putting them in my pants,' Oliver said as he shoved a dozen pens down his trousers. Stewart had promised viewers that Oliver would be a more than capable replacement. 'This show will be much classier while he is hosting. You have my word that on my return, it will instantly drop back to the level you have long expected of it,' said Stewart, who also said he was taking a break to undergo a 'massive plastic surgery makeover.' Eager: John Oliver will be hosting the show for eight weeks until Stewart returns in September . For more videos, please visit The Daily Show . Jon Stewart is taking a break to direct his first feature film, Rosewater, about Maziar Bahari, an Iranian journalist who was locked up after speaking with 'Daily Show' correspondent Jason Jones. The film is Stewart's adaptation of BBC journalist Maziar Bahari's New York Times best-selling memoir 'Then They Came for Me: A Family’s Story of Love, Captivity and Survival'. The British-born, Cambridge-educated Oliver has been a Daily Show regular since 2006 and will host the show for eight weeks starting on Monday. With an average of 2.5 million viewers a night, it's the top-rated late-night show among viewers under 50 and has racked up an unprecedented 10 straight Emmys for a variety series. Measuring up: Replacement host Jon Oliver was seen prancing around with a ruler as he prepares to take over the show from next week . Surprised: Jon Oliver said he didn't expect John Stewart to be in the chair as jokingly prepared to have the set remodeled in pink . For the time being, though, Oliver is focused on humorously lowering everyone's expectations. 'The goal is just don't have this building on fire when he returns, like one of those high-school-party-gone-wrong movies. You know, the parents are out of town and then they come home and it's just the smoking remains of what used to be their home,' he joked to the LA Times. 'That's the worst-case scenario.' 'I'll say 'yes' to anything he wants me to do,' Oliver explained at the 'Daily Show' offices in midtown Manhattan. 'I owe him so much — he brought me over here (to the U.S.) seven years ago — so I'll do anything he wants, whether it's hosting his show or operating as a drug mule between here and Bogota.' 'As it happens,' adds Oliver, looking relieved, 'what he wanted was just hosting this show.' Stealing the show: John Oliver prepared to give his boss Jon Stewart a sendoff to remember as he steals his pens... ...and shoves them down his pants! Oliver, 36, says his comic style was forged by early exposure to Monty Python and Scot Armando Iannucci who produced radio comedies, the British political TV satire 'The Thick of It' and, currently, HBO's 'Veep'. He will be a 'Daily Show' guest next week. Rory Albanese, the shows producer, says Oliver was the obvious choice for Stewart's replacement citing Oliver's strengths as a writer, producer and on-camera performer. 'I wouldn't be too worried that the show won't be as funny,' Albanese says. 'It's just going to be in proper English.' Stewart is expected back in the anchor chair the day after Labor Day on September 3rd. Oliver's first guest on Monday is Seth Rogen, followed by Armando Iannucci, Mavis Staples and Fareed Zakaria.","Stewart signs off for three months to work on his first feature film .

Discovery: Patrick Karegeya, pictured, was found dead in a hotel room, South African police said today . A key opponent of a despotic African president has been found strangled in a hotel room after predicting he would one day be assassinated. The body of Rwandan politician Patrick  Karegeya, 54, was discovered in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Karegeya, Rwanda’s former spy chief, fled the country after clashing with autocratic president Paul Kagame – whose country is given  £16million in aid every year by Britain. In 2012, Karegeya, pictured above, said he expected to be killed because he knew the regime’s ‘dark secrets’. South African intelligence sources claimed his drink had been spiked with poison to make his death look like suicide. But they added that the killer seemed to have bungled the job and had to strangle him. He had lived with his wife and three children in South Africa for six years, thwarting Kagame’s attempts to extradite him for ‘threatening state security’. Karegeya's body was discovered on New Year's Day on a bed at hotel and apartment complex Michelangelo Towers - where he had checked in three days earlier. His neck was swollen and a bloody towel and rope were found in the room's safe, South African police said. The opposition Rwanda National Congress, many of whose senior members are also living in exile, described Karegeya's death as an assassination. 'By killing its opponents, the criminal regime in Kigali seeks to intimidate and silence the Rwandan people into submission,' it said. A spokesperson for the Rwandan presidency declined to comment and it was not possible to reach Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo or spokespeople at the Rwandan embassy in Pretoria. Paul Ramakolo, a spokesman for South Africa's Hawks, an elite crime fighting unit, confirmed Karegeya had been killed. He said: 'We will check if it was as a result of strangulation or what could be the factor.' Scroll down for video . Discovery: The former head of Rwanda's external intelligence service was found in the Michelangelo Towers Suites, Johannesburg (pictured) Plot: Patrick Karegeya allegedly plotted a coup against Rwandan President Paul Kagame - pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron . Rwanda's ambassador to South Africa, Vincent Karega, earlier told local radio SAFM he was not aware of details of the killing. 'We encourage the authorities to really look into the matter so that we know exactly what happened,' he said. The alleged coup against President Paul Kagame was thought to have been planned by Karegeya and Rwandan army chief Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa - who was also exiled to South Africa. Nyamwasa was shot in the stomach in 2010 as he drove into the driveway of his upmarket Johannesburg home. Ally: General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa who was allegedly planning a coup with Patrick Karegeya . He survived what his family said was an assassination attempt ordered by Kagame. Both Nyamwasa and Karegeya fought alongside Kagame in Rwanda's 1994 war, which halted the genocide by ethnic Hutu militia who had killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in just three months. In 2011, South Africa declined a Rwandan request to extradite Nyamwasa to his homeland. He was also wanted in Spain and France for killings in the 1990s. Also in 2011, a Rwandan military court sentenced Karegeya, Nyamwasa and two other exiled officers to 20 years in prison for threatening state security after they were tried in absentia.","Patrick Karegeya, 53, found dead in Johannesburg hotel room .

Freshman Trevor Knight completed a Sugar Bowl-record 32 passes for 348 yards and four touchdowns for 11th-ranked Oklahoma, outshining Heisman Trophy runner-up McCarron.

Miliband demanding he produce concrete policy proposals. The party stalwart also questioned the 'character' of the new generation of Labour MPs. Ramping up pressure on the Labour leader, he said Mr Miliband's attempts to appear strong by seeking a . confrontation with the unions were 'not enough' and he needed to put . forward a 'coherent' agenda. Lord Prescott said Mr Miliband had to set out a 'very . clear idea' and a 'vision' about what he wanted to achieve as . Labour leader. He is the latest senior party figure to criticise Mr Miliband over his low-key leadership style and lack of policies. Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith this week likened Labour’s policy process to a ‘pregnant panda’. In a typically forthright interview with Total Politics . magazine, Lord Prescott dismissed suggestions that Labour was holding back . policies to prevent other parties stealing them, saying: 'Sometimes I . think that's a cover because we might not have thought what the f***ing best . alternative is, but anyway ... see the real problem now is there's got to be . coherence.' He said it was getting 'bloody close' to the stage . where Mr Miliband would have to set out the policies to back up his One Nation . agenda. Lord Prescott said: 'He's called ""weak, weak, weak"" every . day, every minister going on television, but as soon he gets into the scrap . with the unions it becomes 'strong, strong, strong'. 'But what about your policies? What are you doing about . that?' He compared the battle to that fought by John Smith to . reform the party, saying it resulted in 'the perception of the leader ... is he's become strong'. 'That is exactly what has happened to Ed Miliband at . the moment, but it's not enough, you really have to have a very clear idea, a . vision of what you're going to do. 'That's about campaigning, about drawing the . differences, and not being buffeted about by the problems that come from a . government who have chosen a different set of priorities. Lord Prescott is the latest senior party figure to criticise the Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured . 'It's not only to say 'we vote against' - you need to . put that into a coherent policy. Our campaigning has to remind people... traditional values in a modern setting. You have to deliver change but . connected to your principles and beliefs. 'Because the belief of the Tories is just money, money . money, it always was. If we talk about whether we want to be different to the . Tories you better find some framework in which we achieve it.' Lord Prescott, a former trade union official, compared his . background to that of Labour's current MPs who had been 'researchers, . things like that'. He said: 'The party is moving on, it's a different . system, and it's producing different people. There's less to pick from. There's . not many of them coming out now. 'Most of them have been to university. Well, fine, . great, they've got more brains but I'm not sure about the character. 'You've got . to have a message and a vision and a leader that feels they are taking that on . and believe in it. In politics, character is still part of it.'

Doreen Lawrence has admitted she is 'furious' that Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll is to hand . over the job he has held for eight years. The 61-year-old, who became a life peer last year, has demanded a meeting with Metropolitan Police . Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to discuss her concerns over the . future of the investigation. Worried: Doreen Lawrence is worried Scotland Yard is 'winding down' the hunt for her son's Stephen's other killers . The Met said today that Mr Driscoll had after 30 years reached his 'natural retirement' but the officer said that the decision was made by those above his head. 'I'm absolutely furious Clive is being taken off the investigation,' Baroness Lawrence told the Daily Mirror. 'It seems the clearest sign yet that the Met is planning on winding down the investigation and that is wrong. 'He is the first officer I have trusted and the only one to have delivered in the investigation.' Talks: Mrs Lawrence has demanded a meeting with Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe as she wants reassurances that the investigation into her son's death is not being shut down . Mr . Driscoll, who in 2012 helped secure the convictions of two men for the . attack, told the newspaper: 'The decision has been made above me and I . will always help Stephen's family and friends if I can.' A spokesman . for Scotland Yard said Mr Driscoll was among a number of detectives on . the case who had served for three decades and had reached 'natural . retirement'. A-level student Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old aspiring architect, was . stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked . racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Well Hall Road, Eltham, . south-east London, with a friend on April 22 1993. Police bungled the initial probe and it was nearly 19 years before the Lawrence family had the satisfaction of seeing some of his killers jailed. A public inquiry found ‘institutionalised’ racism within the Metropolitan Police was one of the primary causes of their failure to solve the case. Two of the original five prime suspects named by the Daily Mail in 1997 as being Stephen’s killers - Gary Dobson, 38, and David Norris, 37 - were convicted of his murder in 2012 after a belated forensic breakthrough in the case. But the other three young men accused of his murder - Neil and Jamie Acourt, and their friend, Luke Knight - remain on the streets.

In the last 20 years, some scientists have come to believe that Neanderthals had the ability to communicate with each other using speech, and new analysis of a fossilised hyoid bone has added weight to their claims. The horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck looks like a modern human’s and now computer modelling has revealed that it was probably used in a similar way. The hyoid bone of a Neanderthal - a horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck - looks like a modern human's and now computer modelling shows that it was used in a similar way. A male Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes hyoid bone used in the study are pictured . The hyoid bone supports the root of the tongue and enables humans to speak. Researchers believe the way the bone worked is ‘highly suggestive’ of complex speech in Neanderthals. Writing in journal PLOS ONE, a team of scientists said: ‘Neanderthal and modern human hyoids also present very similar internal architectures and micro-biomechanical behaviours’. The researchers used 3D X-ray imaging and mechanical modelling to analyse the throat bone and work out how it behaved in relation to the surrounding bones in Neanderthals. ‘We would argue that this is a very significant step forward. It shows that the Kebara 2 hyoid doesn't just look like those of modern humans - it was used in a very similar way, said Stephen Wroe, from the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. ‘Many would argue that our capacity for speech and language is among the most fundamental of characteristics that make us human. If Neanderthals also had language then they were truly human, too,’ he told BBC News. Before the discovery of a Neanderthal hyoid bone in 1989, it was thought that only modern humans were capable of complex speech, which evolved around 100,000 years ago. Many would argue that our capacity for speech and language is among the most fundamental of characteristics that make us human. If Neanderthals (illustrated) also had language then they were truly human, too,' Professor Wroe said . The hyoid bone is also known as the lingual bone. It is a horseshoe-shaped bone situated in the front of the neck between the chin and the thyroid cartilage. Unlike other bones, the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles or ligaments. It aids in tongue movement and swallowing and provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above, the voice box below, and the epiglottis (the flap that sits at the base of the tongue, which keeps food from going into the windpipe) and pharynx (which keeps food and liquids out of the lungs) behind. The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities. The hyoid bone was discovered in Kebara Cave in Israel and is similar to the same bone found in modern humans. Professor . Wroe said bones up to 500,000 years old, which were found in Spain and . are thought to belong to Homo heidelbergensis - a relative of modern . humans - could show that the origins of speech are even older than . thought. While he admitted that the research, which used computer modelling to investigate whether Neanderthals could speak, should not be accepted a proof, he said: ‘I do think it will help to convince a good number of specialists and tip the weight of opinion.’ A study by the Max Plank institute published earlier this year suggested that the last common ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals around half a million years ago, shared speech and language with modern humans. Dutch researchers believe that the origins of our modern language are ten times older than previously thought and are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity. Psycholinguistics researchers Dan Dediuand and Stephen C. Levinson, said that far from being slow brutes, Neanderthals’ cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours. The duo, who have looked at past findings in detail, argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans (another form of humanity known mostly from their genome). Professor Dediuand said he thinks the news study supports the idea that speech and language is an ancient feature reaching back at least to the last common ancestor we shared with Neanderthals.","Researchers including the University of New England, Australia, found that the hyoid bone in Neanderthals worked like a modern human's .

The edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the Himalayas today. Glaciers have chiselled Mount Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid, defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast, southeast, and northwest. The southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route. It is the one Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in May 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely.

While today’s stargazers eagerly anticipate comets, ancient cultures often branded them as ‘harbingers of doom’.

Scientists claim they can link Halley’s comet to a devastating famine that occurred in 536 AD. Scientists claim they can link the famous Halley's comet to a devastating famine that occurred 536 AD . The comet, they say, caused a change in climate when it threw up enough dust into the atmosphere to cause the planet to cool significantly. This led to a period of widespread drought, crop failures and famine. Scientists believe the event made humanity more susceptible to ‘Justinian's plague’ in 541-542 AD, which is the first recorded appearance of the Black Death in Europe. According to an analysis of Greenland ice that was laid down between 533 and 540 AD, large amounts of atmospheric dust fell on Earth at this time. The comet caused a change in climate when it hit. This, scientists believe, made humanity more susceptible to 'Justinian's plague' in 541-542 AD, which is the first recorded appearance of the Black Death in Europe . Halley's Comet returns to Earth's vicinity approximately every 75 years, so some people could see it twice in their lifetime. The last time it was here was in 1986, and it is projected to return in 2061. The comet is named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who examined reports of a comet approaching Earth in 1531, 1607 and 1682. Halley's most famous appearance occurred shortly before the 1066 invasion of England by William the Conquerer. It is said that William felt the comet heralded his success. The comet was put on the Bayeux Tapestry as a result. ‘I have all this extra-terrestrial stuff in my ice core,’ study leader Dallas Abbott, of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory told Live Science. Researchers believe the dust came from the Eta Aquarid meteor shower which is created by leftovers of Halley's comet. This may have caused a period of mild cooling in 533AD, but it cannot explain the global dimming event of 536-537, during which the planet may have cooled by as much as 3 °C (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Professor Abbot claims that one explanation is that something large hit the ocean. She claims to have found circumstantial evidence to support this theory. The Greenland ice cores, she said, contain fossils of tiny tropical marine organisms. An extra-terrestrial impact, such as from Halley’s comet, could have blasted these low-latitude organisms to Greenland. In August, researchers at Harvard University said that a cosmic impact 12,900 years ago could have led to the demise of the ‘Clovis’ people of North America.

Find: The skeletons of four adults and a child (pictured) have been discovered behind a townhouse in central Edinburgh . They were the real-life bogeymen whose murderous trade in bodies for medical research led to their names going down forever in infamy. Now, bones from five skeletons found in a shallow grave behind an upmarket townhouse in Edinburgh are thought to be linked to the period of 'resurrectionists' William Burke and William Hare. Archaeologists have determined that the five bodies - four adults and one child, which were found in Grove Street in the Haymarket area of the capital - date back to the early 19th century. Burke and Hare gained their murderous reputation after killing 16 people in the city in 1828 and selling the bodies. At the time there was a market for corpses and the remains are thought to belong to criminals or dwellers of poorhouses, who could also be sold on. John Lawson, from the City of Edinburgh Council Archaeology Service, was the first to examine the remains on site. He said: 'At the end of the Enlightenment period there was significant demand for cadavers - which indeed outstripped supply - and that led to a thriving illegal trade, with Burke and Hare clearly the most infamous of those who supplied bodies to medical schools. 'We can't rule out that those found on Grove Street were sold by the resurrectionists, as they were called, although it might be a stretch to say it was Burke and Hare themselves, given their crimes are well documented. 'It is possible that, given the fact they may have been acquired illegally, that someone should wish to bury them, or it could have been as simple as a house clearance. 'What we do know is that these were used to train the surgeons of the future and are a relic of our heritage, of that early stage of modern medicine. 'I'm not sure how far the project will go but there are techniques to determine where the remains came from by the kind of water they drank, the diet they had. 'It was just a chance discovery but despite the length of time that has passed we always like to put the person into context, how old they were, how they died, who they were.' Murderers: Irish serial killers William Burke (left) and William Hare (right) Maureen Kilpatrick, a lead archaeologist at consultants Guard Archaeology, said: 'We found four right-sided jaws and we also had enough bone likely to be a young person. There were quite a few little holes in them which were to cater for wires, which leads us to believe they were used for anatomical purposes. 'We found they were likely to date back to the early 1800s, and although there were no medical professionals living in the house, we believe they had friends who were.' Irish immigrants Burke and Hare sold the bodies of the dead on to Dr Robert Knox to use for medical research and teaching. When they were arrested, Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he testified against Burke, as authorities feared they would blame each other - making it difficult for a jury to convict. More than 25,000 people watched Burke hang in 1829 while Hare disappeared after his release. Burke's skeleton is displayed at the University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum. His death mask is exhibited at Surgeon's Hall in the capital. Over a period of ten months in 1828, 16 murders were committed in the Scottish capital. The killings were carried out by two Irish immigrants William Burke and William Hare - who then sold the corpses of their victims. Local doctor Robert Knox received the bodies as dissection material for his anatomy lectures. In order to keep the bodies in a good condition, the two killed their victims by smothering them, compressing their chests until they died. The duo did not work alone. Burke's mistress Helen McDougal and Margaret Laird, Hare's wife,  assisted them in their murderous spree. Burke was born in Urney, County Tyrone. He left his family - a wife and two children - to emigrate to Scotland in around 1817, and met his mistress while working on the Union Canal. Hare's birthplace is less certainly documented, but it is thought he was from either Poyntzpass near Newry, or Derry. He emigrated to Scotland and also worked as a labourer on the Union Canal. The duo met when Burke and his mistress moved in to Hare's wife's lodgings in around 1827. According to Hare' testimony -  the first body the duo sold was that of a tenant who died of natural causes in November of that year. Burke was executed in 1829 but Hare escaped being hanged after giving evidence against his former accomplice.","Skeletons found in a shallow grave behind townhouse in Edinburgh .

Lower and middle class Romans living in Pompeii feasted on exotic meats and spicy seafood in times before the city was struck by a devastating volcanic eruption in 79AD. Archaeologists have disproved popular preconceptions that the rich dined on imported delicacies including flamingo, while the poor survived on gruel, by revealing that all classes of people enjoyed a rich and varied diet. The researchers discovered sea urchin and the butchered leg of a giraffe among less exotic foods like grain and eggs, in a poorer area of the ruined city. Steven Ellis, an associate professor of classics at the University of Cincinnati led the search through drains and latrines of a non-elite area of Pompeii (pictured left) to find bones and food deposits, to build up a picture of lower and middle class Romans' eating habits. A rare kiln is pictured right . Inexpensive and widely available food, . such as grains, fruits, nuts, olives, lentils, local fish and chicken . eggs were found, as well as minimal cuts of meat and salted fish from . Spain, were found in drains and latrines in a relatively poor area of Pompeii. A drain from a central property in the district revealed a . rich variety of foods as well as imports from outside Italy, such as . shellfish, sea urchin and even delicacies including the butchered leg . joint of a giraffe. Archaeologists said their finds prove the richness, variety and range of a non-elite diet as well as the long-distance trade in exotic and wild animals at the time. The international team of researchers spent more than a decade analysing the homes, shops and businesses of a lower to middle class district in the Roman city, where earlier buildings date back to the 6th Century. The area covers 10 separate building plots and a total of 20 shop fronts, most of which served food and drink. Archaeologists examined waste in drains as well as 10 accident latrines and cesspits to discover charred food waste from kitchens, including fully-process foods like grain, as well as human waste. Steven Ellis, an associate professor of classics at the University of Cincinnati, said: ‘The material from the drains revealed a range and quantity of materials to suggest a rather clear socio-economic distinction between the activities and consumption habits of each property, which were otherwise indistinguishable hospitality businesses.’ Inexpensive and widely available food, such as grains, fruits, nuts, olives, lentils, local fish and chicken eggs were found, as well as minimal cuts of meat and salted fish from Spain. Archaeologists have disproved views that rich Romans dined on exported delicacies, while the poor survived on gruel, by revealing that all classes of Pompeians had a rich and varied diet. An inn with holes that held food and wine - the thermopolium of Lucius Vetutius Placidus in the city - in another area of the city is pictured . A drain from a central property revealed a rich variety of foods as well as imports from outside Italy, such as shellfish, sea urchin and even delicacies including the butchered leg joint of a giraffe. ‘That the bone represents the height of exotic food is underscored by the fact that this is thought to be the only giraffe bone ever recorded from an archaeological excavation in Roman Italy,’ Professor Ellis said. ‘How part of the animal, butchered, came to be a kitchen scrap in a seemingly standard Pompeian restaurant not only speaks to long-distance trade in exotic and wild animals, but also something of the richness, variety and range of a non-elite diet.’ Deposits discovered also included imported spices from as far away as Indonesia, highlight the incredible reach of the Romans. ‘The traditional vision of some mass of hapless lemmings – scrounging for whatever they can pinch from the side of a street, or huddled around a bowl of gruel – needs to be replaced by a higher fare and standard of living, at least for the urbanites in Pompeii,’ Professor Ellis said. Exotic delicacies discovered: While inexpensive . food such as grains, fruit, nuts and eggs were found, the archaeologists . also found rich foods including sea urchin (illustrated left) and the . leg of a giraffe in the drain of a property in a relatively poor part . of the Roman city . One of the deposits dates to the 4th Century and is rare since few other deposits survived the early stage in the development of Pompeii. Professor Ellis and his international team aim to reveal the structural and social relationships over time between working-class Pompeian households, as well as to work out the role that the middle classes played in shaping the city. ‘However, one of the larger datasets and themes of our research has been diet and the infrastructure of food consumption and food ways,’ he added. The research will be presented at the joint annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and American Philological Association (APA) in Chicago this weekend. Professor Ellis, who led the research, believes it disproves traditional views that the poor and middle classes living in Pompeii (pictured) were 'hapless lemmings' who scrounged for scraps of food or survived on gruel .","Archeologists led by the University of Cincinnati said the discoveries of exotic meats prove the richness, variety and range of a non-elite diet .

David Moyes admits there is no guarantee Wayne Rooney will sign a new contract at Old Trafford if Manchester United fail to qualify for the Champions League this season. Rooney, who will miss Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at home to Swansea with a groin injury, will enter the final year of his £250,000-a-week deal in the summer. United are anxious to open negotiations over a new one but it is thought the 28-year-old wants to wait until after the World Cup before assessing his future and the club's progress. Walking out? Wayne Rooney, yet to commit to a new deal at Man United, leaves hospital with his scan results . United's hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League title suffered another blow on New Year's Day when they slipped to seventh in the table after a defeat by Tottenham. It raised fears that Rooney, subject of a £30million bid from Chelsea last summer, could leave if United cannot qualify for the Champions League. Moyes said on Friday: 'We would have to wait and see what happened in that situation.' Asked if the England striker is happy at United, Moyes said: 'I think if you look at his performances he's certainly playing at his best.' Up for the battle: Rooney could return to the United team for the Capital One Cup clash against Swansea . Uncertain: The England international is unwilling to decide his future until after the World Cup . Rooney's groin injury has kept him out of two of United's last five games, although Moyes says he has 'a chance' of returning for the Capital One Cup semi-final against Sunderland on Tuesday. Moyes said Ashley Young also has a shoulder injury as a result of a challenge from Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris on Wednesday. Referee Howard Webb took no action, a decision described as 'scandalous' by Moyes, who thought the challenge was worthy of a penalty and red card for Lloris.","Wayne Rooney may not sign a new contract at Manchester United if they fail to qualify for the Champions League .

A £2 billion European probe that will map more than a billion stars in 3D has been launched into our galaxy. The two-tonne observatory blasted into orbit on a Russian Soyuz rocket from the European space port in French Guiana at 09:12 GMT this morning. Its five-year mission is one of the most ambitious in space history and its aim is to pinpoint millions of stars with unparalleled precision. It is also hoped Gaia will discover thousands of previously unknown objects, including exploding stars, planets orbiting other suns, and nearby asteroids. Scroll down for video . The Gaia satellite launched from the European Space Agency in French Guiana this morning, pictured. It is being sent into space to survey stars in nearby galaxies and and find clues about dark matter . Gaia, pictured, is fitted with a 1,000MP camera that will also hunt for planets and asteroids. It cost £620million to build and the project cost a total of £2billion . The purpose of the Gaia mission is to create a precise 3D map of the Milky Way. The billion stars that Gaia will map is still only one per cent of the Milky Way's total number of stars. It is Europe's successor to the Hipparcos satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars. Hipparcos was the very first mission for measuring astrometry - the positions, distances, motions, brightness and colours of stars. It is hoped Gaia will find also reveal new asteroids, dead stars, and test current theories about our cosmos. Its map will also become a reference frame to guide the investigations of future telescopes. Scientists also hope Gaia will yield clues about mysterious dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter is an invisible substance that glues galaxies together, yet cannot be detected other than by observing its gravitational effects. Dark energy is a strange propulsive force that appears to be hard-wired into the fabric of space itself and is causing galaxies to fly apart at an accelerating rate. The probe will also be able to detect far-off solar systems with their own families of planets, and, closer to home, spot potentially threatening asteroids whose orbits reach out as far as Earth. British scientists and engineers have played key roles in the design and construction of the spacecraft, called Gaia. The observatory will operate from a stable location 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth known as the L2 Lagrangian point.

Gaia's predecessor was the Hipparcos satellite, pictured, which mapped around 100,000 stars . Mission scientist Professor Martin Barstow, from the University of Leicester, said: 'Gaia is one of the most exciting space missions I have worked on during my career. Its survey of the Galaxy will be in unprecedented detail and the precision of the distance measurements it makes will transform astronomy and our understanding of the universe.' Professor Gerry Gilmore, from Cambridge University, the UK's principal Gaia investigator, added: ‘The results from Gaia will revolutionise our understanding of the cosmos as never before. ‘Our understanding of what's out there has been driven by looking at what we can see. 'We've never had a genuine opportunity to look at everything, to know what's there, and to know where they are in relation to each other. ‘We don't even know how much we don't know - there are sure to be objects out there that don't even have names yet, since we don't yet realise how strange they are.’ The Milky Way, an artist's impression is pictured, is a spiral galaxy believed to be between 100,000 and 120,000 light-years in diameter. The billion stars that Gaia is expected to map is still only one per cent of this galaxy's total number of stars . British universities and companies have won around £67 million worth of contracts from the European Space Agency to build key components of the spacecraft, including its camera sensors and micro-propulsion system. A state-of-the-art processing centre at Cambridge will sift and digest massive amounts of raw data from the probe. Dr Floor van Leeuwen, manager of Gaia data processing in the UK, said: ‘The sensors on board the spacecraft will be able to detect objects so faint the human eye would have to be nearly 4,000 times more powerful to see them. ‘This accuracy is equivalent to measuring a shirt button on the moon as seen from the Earth. It means we have to have the highest-capability computers to analyse the data.’ A state-of-the-art processing centre at Cambridge will sift and digest massive amounts of raw data collected by the cameras the probe .

MCC president Mike Gatting has questioned in public whether a joyless England camp has remained too intense through this Ashes debacle. Gatting, an Ashes-winning captain in Australia, made his comments while on a corporate breakfast function panel at the Sydney Cricket Ground before the start of the fifth Test. Gatting claimed Aussie coach Darren Lehmann has the work-play balance right, with a joke of the day and a beer on the bus rather than  England’s endless video analysis of their errors. Lighten up: MCC president Mike Gatting wonders whether England have been too intense Down Under . And Gatting added that he felt senior . players, as well as not scoring enough runs, had not given enough . direction to the rest of the squad. England’s . beleaguered team director Andy Flower defended his approach after a . fourth defeat in a row at Melbourne saying, if anything, a new intensity . was necessary for Sydney. Kevin Pietersen, still England’s marquee batsman, has Australian bat company Spartan Sports chasing his signature. They are aware that KP’s adidas contract expires in 2014 and will be first in the queue if it is not renewed. KP has been a major adidas client since they moved into cricket in 2008. But adidas will need to be convinced he intends playing on for a number of years before committing to another big contract. Spartan, who pay around £250,000 a year for Michael Clarke’s endorsement, are likely to meet KP’s asking price if adidas don’t. Meanwhile, Steve Smith, a century-maker for Australia on Friday, is said to be switching from Slazenger to a Spartan bat. Hairy moment: Australian bat company Spartan Sports want Kevin Pietersen's signature . The emergence of Ben Stokes is the only  positive that England can take out of this  dismal tour and the all-rounder looks to have some much-needed character as well. Asked after his six-wicket haul whether he was up for the ‘fray’, Stokes replied: ‘What does that mean? Don’t use those big words on me.’ The Australian media have ended the Ashes  as they began in Brisbane with another puerile newspaper offensive. The Sydney Daily Telegraph has a giant billboard truck displaying  the ‘sneering snouts’ of the England team, which they intend to whitewash to cover ‘their unsightly faces full of colonial smirk’. A star is born: England's Ben Stokes holds the match ball after taking six wickets on day one in Sydney . Swann gets on his bike . Graeme Swann, who has been keen on motor sport since growing up near Silverstone, may make his media debut commentating on motorbikes if he does join BT Sport. Their rights include the next five years of Moto GP. On the cricket front, BT will be bidding for the Indian Premier League along with the ICC’s T20 and 50-over World Cups and Champions Trophy. Swann is due to receive just 30 days’ notice money from his central contract after quitting  with two Tests to go Down Under. Paul Collingwood, who was eased out of the team following the Sydney Test victory three years ago, was paid the full nine months left on his ECB contract. Where's the mic? Graeme Swann may commentate on motorbike racing if he joins BT Sport . There is mystery as to why former Australian captain Bobby Simpson’s induction into the ICC Hall of Fame this week was such a low-key affair. The ceremony, despite Simpson starting in cricket right by the Sydney Cricket Ground, was a little-publicised reception there on the eve of the Test — previous inductees Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne were feted on the pitch during a Test. Certainly, Simpson is not the most popular of former Australian greats. Cricket Australia said arrangements were made by the ICC, whose spokesman added that one of their Hall of Fame events every year is always a function. Hall of famer: The induction into the ICC Hall of Fame of Bobby Simpson was a low-key affair . The MCC hierarchy, out in force in Australia, should take time to examine the facilities at Sydney, which make Lord’s look second-rate in comparison. The media’s working conditions at cricket’s headquarters lag behind almost all  international grounds in Australia and those in South Africa, India and even Bangladesh. A lot about Shane Warne has changed since the last Ashes tour Down Under, including his brilliant white teeth and his preferred insult for Sports Agenda. It used to be ‘you’re a muppet’ but has now been upgraded to ‘you’re a k***-jockey’.

Ford added that yesterday's City Council vote that he take time off to deal with his personal life was the second worst day of his life, after the death of his father. Since the City Council doesn't have the power to kick Ford out of the job, the decision was non-binding and Ford ultimately refused to step down. 'I'm not an addict of any sort. So I'm not quite sure why you're saying I need help,' Ford said after the vote. What stress? In his noon press conference today, Ford blamed the tremendous stress' of the past six months for his indecent language referring to alleged sexual advances on a staffer.

Straightening out: Ford said he was seeking help from 'healthcare professionals' but would not elaborate what type of treatment he is receiving . But today's second press conference was the first time Ford seemed at all remorseful for his behavior. He announced that he was 'getting support' from 'healthcare professionals' but wouldn't detail what kind of help. Ford said he was 'taking accountability' for his actions and 'accepting responsibility for challenges I face'. While . those statements seem an admission of guilt, the mayor continued to . deny the allegations in the police report saying they are '100 per cent . lies'. He has previously stated his plans to run for reelection in October 2014. During yesterday's City Council meating, hundreds of protesters gathered outside City Hall, many of them calling on Ford to step down. An . Ipsos-Reid poll conducted for several TV and radio stations showed that . 76 percent of Toronto voters think Ford should step down or take a . leave of absence, while only 24 percent agreed with Ford's insistence on . staying in his job. Newly released police documents reveal shocking details about Rob Ford's use of booze, drugs and even a suspected prostitute in the mayor's City Hall office on St Patrick's Day in 2012 . Time to go: People protest against Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in front of City Hall in Toronto on Wednesday . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and his brother Doug Ford (left) confront Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong (bottom center) during council at City Hall in Toronto on November 13, . Rob Ford's wife Renata Brejniak stood by her man today as he apologized for the 'graphic language' he used to describe allegations he made sexual advances towards a staffer. Not much is known about Renata, even to people within the Ford circle. She has been described as the 'invisible wife' and an 'enigma' by Toronto Life Magazine. The couple met in high school when they were only living a few blocks from each other, and got married in 2000. They have an 8-year old daughter, Stephanie, and a 5-year-old son, Douglas. Doug Holyday, Ford's former deputy mayor was at their wedding held at St George's Golf and Country Club. 'I don't even know if she has a job,' he told Toronto Life. The Ford marriage has been far from perfect. In 2008, a domestic dispute started between the two when Ford called the police because of his wife's 'irrational, out-of-control' behavior. When police 'saw the situation' they informed him to leave with the children so he took them to his mother's house. Happier times: Ford and his wife (right) celebrating his election as Toronto Mayor in 2010 . Television crews covering the dispute showed up to Ford's parents house where he used daughter Stephanie to deflect questions about the fight. He held her up in the front door and she said 'no comment' to the reporters gathered outside. The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police. Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her. At the time, a neighbor described Mrs Ford to the Globe and Mail as 'reclusive and rarely seen out of the house' The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part. The couple seemed to patch things up after the incident. 'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife. My wife supports me.' Renata rarely gives interviews. A June 2013 Toronto Sun article about the first-lady of Toronto references the last time she spoke to the press - October 25, 2010 when Ford was elected mayor. Renata was helping her husband out at the time, returning calls when one reporter got a rare opportunity to chat with the first lady of Toronto. When asked about their children, Renata says they try to shelter Stephanie and Doug from politics. 'We have decided to wait until they are older to explain about politics,' she said.","Toronto Mayor Rob Ford offended many this morning when he went on a vulgar rant about oral sex .

"By . Ian Drury . PUBLISHED: . 20:19 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:19 EST, 20 December 2013 . RAF fighter jets have been involved in near misses in the skies once every two weeks since the Ministry of Defence approved - but never fitted - a safety measure 15 years ago. Defence chiefs pledged to implement a collision avoidance system for Tornado GR4s in the 1998 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The warning system could have prevented the mid-air smash between two RAF jets that killed three airmen last year. Mid-air: New figures revealed the shocking number of times Tornado GR4 jets like the one pictured have almost collided . Near miss: Tornado fighter jets, such as the one shown here, come close to crashing every other week, new figures show . But ministers controversially delayed introducing the £55million device in a bid to save cash. It will finally be fitted in the fighter-bombers in late-2014. New figures uncovered by SNP MP Angus Robertson have revealed that since the MoD first promised the safety measure there have been two collisions and 361 near misses involving the Tornados. Critics said the extraordinary total - around 22 a year between 1998 and 2013 - exposed the seriousness of the situation and suggested defence chiefs were 'not putting safety first'. Mr Robertson, who represents Moray, said: 'It is very shocking that there have been so many incidents since the MoD promised to install a collision warning system on the aircraft which according to them would ""improve safety for man and machine"". 'It shows that the conditions that led to incidents like the tragic collision in 2012 are not isolated and rare. ‘We don't know whether such a system would definitely have stopped that collision and saved lives, but this is certainly being considered in connection with a potential fatal accident inquiry. 'I believe that the families of the victims deserve the fullest answers and the whole truth. The MoD has a lot of questions to answer about why they do not appear to put the safety of service personnel first.' Killed: Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders, pictured, was one of the men killed in the 2012 crash . Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole, left, and Squadron Leader Samuel . Bailey, right, also died in the crash . Retired RAF engineer and airworthiness campaigner Jimmy Jones said: 'This is a scandal. It is criminal that nothing has been done. 'The scale of these figures show there is a problem - why has it gone unchecked for so long?' Defence Minister Mark Francois revealed the number of 'airprox incidents' - near misses - in a Parliamentary answer. An 'airprox' incident is defined as a situation where two aircraft come so close together it has compromised safety. Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey, 36, and Flight Lieutenants Hywel Poole, 28, and Adam Sanders, 27, died when two £40million Tornado GR4 warplanes crashed during a training mission over north-east Scotland. Sq Ldr Paul Evans survived but was badly injured. The fighter-bombers, each carrying a pilot and a navigator, spun out of control and plunged into the Moray Firth on July 2012. The crew were all from 15 (Reserve) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth. They were understood to be taking part in practice bombing runs in fog. Wreckage: These chunks of the Tornado jet planes were recovered from the Moray Firth, above which two planes crashed last July . The MoD confirmed last week it had identified a collision warning system for the fast jets four years before the fatal accident. The state-of-the-art £53.5million device was not finally approved for the Tornados until October 2012 - three months after the tragedy. Military sources said cost-saving in the cash-strapped MoD meant the RAF was forced to shelve the scheme in favour of other kit. Defence chiefs might also have thought twice about spending millions of pounds upgrading warplanes that will be taken out of service in 2018. An RAF board of inquiry has completed a report on last summer's collision and handed a copy to the procurator fiscal who will decide whether a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) will be held. The board's findings have not been published. An MoD spokesman said: 'There are already a range of mitigation measures in place to minimise the risk of mid-air collision and tragic incidents such as that in Moray are extremely rare. 'A specifically designed Tornado Collision Warning System, which will be another tool for pilots to use, is currently being trialled and will be in service in next year.'","New figures were uncovered by SNP MP Angus Robertson .

The . 15-year-old is one of three footballing brothers. Joe, 13, is at . Arsenal too and Matty, 17, was released by Arsenal but is now due to . sign a professional contract with United. Chris, . a left sided midfielder who can play on the wing or behind the striker, . is one of the brightest talents in English football and has figured for . Arsenal's U18s, making his debut against Manchester City in February, . but he has yet to sign professional terms and turns 16 on January 31. Rising star: Manchester United are keeping an eye on Arsenal youngster Chris Willock (right) He . was player of the tournament at the MTU Indoor Cup in 2012, competing . against United, Bayern Munich and Barcelona before catching the eye . again in the Lion City Cup in Singapore last summer and the Nike Cup. Capped . by England at U16 level, City and Chelsea are also keen on the slightly . built Willock but United hope to have the upper hand to any ensuing . transfer with elder brother Matty in their ranks. Family affair: Chris' older brother Matty (right) is poised to sign a professional contract with the Red Devils . Joleon Lescott's availability at Manchester City has alerted West Ham United. Fresh from missing out on John Heitinga, manager Sam Allardyce is weighing up alternatives and would be interested if a subsidised loan can be arranged until the end of the season when Lescott's contract runs out. City are willing to let the England defender leave on loan should Martin Demichelis shake off his injury but Lescott's estimated £90,000-a-week wages are prohibitive to the Hammers and the likes of Newcastle and even Tottenham, to a degree. Reinforcement: Joleon Lescott has attracted attention from West Ham United . Big decision: Everton centre back John Heitinga decided against joining the Hammers . Besiktas are willing to pay around £2million a year tax free in wages and offer the 31-year-old a two-year contract and the promise of longer-term deals elsewhere at this stage could be difficult to find. Lescott has plenty to play for with a World Cup place at stake and is a model professional so clubs will be getting a proven Premier League performer but finances dictate a short term deal may be their best bet. Monaco are looking at centre backs but Chelsea and City target Kurt Zouma of St Etienne is a preferred option. Tottenham also have other possibilities in mind. Keen eye: Sam Allardyce has endured a miserable period following a series of defensive injuries . Allardyce will look at foreign options too should Lescott not fit financially but is eager to bring in Premier League experience among his three planned signings. Rickie Lambert looks like it will be too expensive a project to conclude with Southampton while Everton still want £4m-£5m for Nikica Jelavic who is a target for Crystal Palace also. Another loan signing up top is desired with numerous players still being discussed, however John Guidetti of Manchester City is leaning more towards a loan move to Stoke. Napoli have no intention of entertaining any bids for Gonzalo Higuain. Chelsea have shown interest in the former Real Madrid striker but the Italians say they have had no offer after telling all suitors not to waste their time. Higuain has become a cult figure for the passionate Napoli fans who craved a striker to idolise following Edinson Cavani's sale last summer. Higuain insists he is happy in Italy, saying: 'For someone like me, who loves this sport, Naples is a wonderful place. This is an incredible city where football comes first, followed by everything else. The fans live for football. Thank God they loved me straight away because the Neapolitans are very passionate and I find that enchanting. No go: Napoli will knock back any overtures for star striker Gonzalo Higuain this transfer window . 'The Neapolitans have a special affection for Argentines. They are similar to us as well as having Diego Maradona in their hearts.' Club president Aurelio De Laurentiis is convinced Rafa Benitez is heading in the right direction with his new-look Napoli project despite narrowly missing out on qualification from the Champions League group stage. Benitez wants a defensive midfielder, a centre back and a left back to help press Juventus and Roma for the title and win the Europa League for a successive year. He remains a big fan of Chelsea's Juan Mata but has not made any approach for the Spaniard. Temper, temper: Juan Mata fumes after being substituted for Oscar during Chelsea's win at Southampton . Napoli say they have had no approach from Liverpool for 17-year-old right back Armando Anastasio. Liverpool, meanwhile, are reluctant to loan out Raheem Sterling despite enquiries from Premier League sides. They are also yet to reach agreement with Basle for forward Mohamed Salah but talks are ongoing. One winger keen on a return to England is former Chelsea man Salomon Kalou, 28, who has attracted interest from Tottenham, Arsenal, West Ham and Liverpool in the past and is available for £2.5m from Lille. Reluctant: Liverpool remain loath to loan out Raheem Sterling (right) but are hoping to bring Mohamed Salah in . A few Championship club scouts have been beating a path to Cowdenbeath's Central Park this season. The focus of their attention is former Rangers striker Kane Hemmings. The 21-year-old, who has been likened in style to a young Stan Collymore by some observers, was born in Burton upon Trent and had trials for Derby County and Birmingham as a boy. He was signed by non-League Tamworth at 13 and from there was picked up by Rangers where he graduated to become captain of their U19 team before making his debut as a substitute against Malmo in the Champions League. Most wanted: Kane Hemmings is being watched by a number of Championship clubs . However, three knee injuries derailed his progress and following Rangers' liquidation he moved to Cowdenbeath on loan. He scored four goals in seven games prompting Rangers to recall him but finances dictated he had to go and he rejoined Cowdenbeath where he has scored 16 goals in 23 games this season. Hemmings, whose father Tony scored for Macclesfield Town at Wembley in the 1996 FA Trophy Final win over Northwich Victoria, is out of contract in the summer but the Scottish Championship side would be willing to sell now for around £50,000 and that has some clubs thinking he would be worth the gamble in England. Which . one-time Manchester United transfer target is considering getting a new . tattoo after team-mates gave him constant ribbing over one he has on his . arm of the Teletubbies which he had done to remind him of his children? QPR, Leicester, Burnley and Bolton will all be represented as Halifax Town visit Tamworth in the Conference on Saturday. On show is Halifax Town striker Lee Gregory who has scored 15 goals in 19 games this season and would have had more but for a broken hand which forced him to miss 10 games. The 25-year-old scored two in three minutes against Gateshead on New Year's Day and has had the likes of MK Dons following his form. However, now Championship sides are also watching to see what the fuss is about. Gregory is hoping to tread a similar path to former Halifax striker Jamie Vardy, now at Leicester. Halifax manager Neil Aspin, who is aiming for promotion, joked: 'Any scouts that were at the game should look at the third chance he had, the one where he missed, and leave him where he is with us. He’s rubbish! No, he took both his goals well, as he has done all season. He gets into good areas and what can I say, he knows where the goal is.' Meanwhile, Forest Green Rovers have signed Lee Hughes, 37, on an 18-month contract from League One Port Vale. Derby County are poised to sign Tottenham's Simon Dawkins for £500,000. The 26-year-old midfielder, who has had spells with San Jose Earthquakes and Aston Villa, has been on loan at Derby and impressed boss Steve McClaren. Loan star: Simon Dawkins (right) may earn a permanent deal to stay at Derby County from Tottenham . Nottingham Forest are continuing to bang on the door at West Bromwich Albion. Not content with asking about Shane Long, manager Billy Davies is also keen on midfielder Graham Dorrans. Davies wants to add a goal threat to his Championship promotion chasers and has also enquired about a big money bid for Blackburn Rovers goal machine Jordan Rhodes. However, word is Blackburn won't sell for under £10m. Fancy it? Nottingham Forest are keen on West Brom hitman Shane Long . Gabriel Tamas, formerly of West Bromwich Albion, is eager to make a return to the Premier League. The 30-year-old is a free agent who moved briefly to FC Cluj in October only for the move to end before it got started after an incident where he was filmed allegedly drunk in a Bucharest pub. Tamas is ready to go on trial at a club to prove he is fit for action and sticking to orange juice. Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Amos is ready to go out on loan again after returning from a spell at Carlisle United. Wolves may show interest in the 23-year-old with Wayne Hennessey poised to join Crystal Palace after facing Gillingham on Friday. Off again: Ben Amos is set to go out on loan again after some time at Carlisle United . Carl Ikeme has broken his hand for the second time in 12 months and Wolves have recalled young Irishman Aaron McCarey from loan at York City. Amos impressed at Carlisle and is keen to get more competitive games under his belt with his route to the first team at United blocked by David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard. Christian Benteke's agent has reaffirmed his belief the Belgium striker will stay at Villa Park this season. Villa need Benteke even more following the leg break suffered by Libor Kozak yet Benteke has attracted attention from Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United again despite his dip in form. Staying put: Christian Benteke's agent is adamant that his client will remain at Aston Villa for the time being . Kismet Eris, said: 'You have to be realistic. He played on New Year's Day, so to talk of him leaving is ridiculous. There's no question of him leaving at the moment. It wasn't planned at the start of the season, it's not planned now.' Wigan are looking to sign Leicester City's versatile Jeffrey Schlupp on loan for the rest of the season as Uwe Rosler looks to reshape his squad at the DW Stadium. The 21-year-old had an extended trial at Manchester United last season where he mainly turned out at left-back but has been playing back on the wing and scored for Leicester at Millwall on New Year's Day after coming on as a substitute.","United want Chris Willock, 15, to join his older brother Matty at Old Trafford .

President Obama took a break from the golf course during his Hawaii vacation yesterday to make a brief visit to his grandfather's grave. The president, who has played eight rounds of golf since arriving on December 20, spent just four minutes at the grave of Stanley Dunham. His motorcade then left the National Memorial Cemetery and took Mr Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha to the zoo for a private tour. Flying visit: The presidential motorcade, pictured at the National Memorial Cemetery on a visit last year, dropped the First Family off briefly yesterday . Close: Barack Obama with his grandparents, Stanley Armour and Madelyn Lee Payne Dunham . It took 30 minutes for the First Family to be driven from their vacation home to the cemetery, where they stayed for just a few minutes, according to the Weekly Standard. Hero: Second World War veteran Stanley Dunham helped raise Obama . As he visited the grave, Mr Obama could not be seen by the press pool following him on the 17-day vacation. Mr Dunham became a father figure to the president as he was growing up, after his own father left. The Second World War veteran died, aged 73, in 1992. The White House pool report recorded the visit, stating: 'President Obama's motorcade made its way . to Honolulu, passing by stunning vistas while occasionally being slowed . by congested roads.' It added: 'After a 30-minute drive, Obama and daughters Sasha . and Malia arrived at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at . Puowaina Punchbowl Crater.'

Rounding out the foursome Thursday were Max Key, the prime minister's teenage son, and Marvin Nicholson, Mr Obama's personal aide.

Police caught a presumed dead Georgia banker this week in a routine traffic stop, after he went off the grid almost two years ago following a $20million fraud scheme. Aubrey Lee Price, 47, made his first appearance in court today in Brunswick, Georgia after his arrest on Tuesday. He is being tried for one count of bank fraud and if found guilty could spend 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. The FBI had been searching for Prince ever since June 2012 when he sent a suicide letter to his family, saying he planned to take a ferry to Key West and jump into the ocean to end his life. Scroll down for video . In court: Aubrey Lee Price, who was caught on Tuesday after 18 months on the run, appeared in court today . Caught: Price, who will return to court for a bail hearing on Monday, allegedly faked his suicide to avoid charges . Price disappeared on June 16, 2012 after telling his family he was going to Guatemala on a business trip, authorities said. Two days later, his family and acquaintances received letters from him detailing his plot to jump off the ferry. 'My depression and discouragement have driven me to deep anxiety, fear and shame. I am emotionally overwhelmed and incapable of continuing in this life,' said a rambling confession letter investigators believe was written by Price. 'I created false statements, covered up my losses and deceived and hurt the very people I was trying to help,' the letter said. It seemed that Price had following out the plan when credit card records showed he bought dive weights and a ferry ticket. Price was captured on surveillance footage at the Key West airport and ferry terminal the day he disappeared, and the ferry ticket was scanned at the boarding point. Those letters prompted a U.S. Coast Guard search for Price, which caused $173,000. Back from the dead: Former bank director Aubrey Lee Price was caught by police, right, after he had been missing since June 2012, . when he had told family members he was going to commit suicide . More than a year ago, a Florida judge declared Price to be legally dead, but the FBI continued to search for him offering a reward of up to $20,000 for his capture. Price disappeared in June 2012 after sending a rambling letter to his family and acquaintances that investigators described as a confession . The FBI turned out to be right when police in Glynn County, Georgia stopped him for a tinted window violation on Interstate 95. Officers said that it was clear Price was giving them false information during the stop and they were soon able to determine that he was wanted by the FBI. After his capture, Price told authorities that since disappearing he had been working as a migrant worker, accepting cash for odd jobs. At his appearance in court today, Price sported long, unkempt hair and a straggly beard, a far cry from his neat, suited appearance two years ago. Back then, Price was the director of Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey, Georgia. In December 2010, when a company he controlled bought a controlling portion of the bank's stock, according to a complaint filed in June 2012 in federal court in New York. Price then opened brokerage accounts through a securities clearing and custodial firm in New York and told bank managers he would invest in U.S. Treasury securities. Instead of investing the bank's money, authorities say Price wired the funds into accounts he controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank managers with fraudulent documents. Raid: Officials believe that Price raised $40million from more than 100 investors in Georgia and Florida through an unregistered investment . fund that he managed . Web: Price allegedly forged bank documents to hide the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would continue giving him money . Price lived with his wife and . children in Bradenton, Florida, but bought a home in Valdosta in the . months before his disappearance, according to authorities. Price had . moved his family to the south Georgia city, where his wife's parents . lived, just a few weeks before he disappeared. FBI Special Agent Stephen Emmett said that he didn't know whether Price's wife and children had known that he was still alive. His family had previously told investigators they believed Price was dead. At the court hearing today, prosecutors called Price 'a flight risk' and recommended no bail be set. A bond hearing was set for Monday in Savannah.

Theo Walcott teased Tottenham Hotspur supporters with a 2-0 scoreline gesture as he was stretchered from the action during Arsenal’s FA Cup victory at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners were leading thanks to goals from Santi Cazorla and Tomas Rosicky when, with seven minutes remaining, Walcott made the cheeky hand signal to the visiting fans. The Football Association may choose to take action against Walcott for his taunt, while Tottenham may also come under fire after their supporters showered him with objects. Cheeky: Theo Walcott leaves the game on a stretcher and reminds the Spurs fans of the 2-0 scoreline . All smiles: Walcott cannot hide his grin as he makes the gesture, to the delight of Arsenal's fans . Two good: Arsenal were comfortable victors as they booked their place in the fourth round . Satisfaction: Walcott continued to tease the visiting fans as he made his way around the pitch . They had responded with a hail of coins, as well as a lighter, a plastic cup and a bread bun. But Walcott, who had been forced off with a leg injury, appeared unconcerned and was smiling ear to ear despite the irritation caused. He then donned a scarf thrown to him by a member of the home support who were thrilled with their player's jibe. Walcott’s team-mate Wojciech Szczesny also got in on the act and posted a picture mimicking the gesture on his Instagram account. Handy: Wojciech Szczesny copies Walcott's cheeky gesture in this instagram post . Money shot: A matchday steward holds a handful of coins that were thrown in the direction of Walcott . Target: A lighter, a bread roll and a plastic cup were all hurled towards Walcott . The Football Association will wait until receiving the match report of referee Mark Clattenburg before deciding whether the Walcott incident warrants investigation. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, however, moved to diffuse the situation. 'The doctors said to me that the coins had been raining over his (Walcott's) head and they had to protect him, maybe that is why he did that. Yes (the coins came before the gesture) that is what I have been told,' said Wenger. 'After that, what he did is not offensive. You look for every single incident, I can understand that, but it is an action that didn't offend anybody. Angry: Some of the visiting fans were incensed by Walcott's cheeky scoreline . 'I have seen the pictures after the game and it does not even look aggressive, he is smiling.' Last month, Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere was suspended for two matches after television pictures showed him making an obscene hand gesture towards Manchester City supporters in the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City. Wenger, though, maintained this situation did not merit any disciplinary action. 'My response will be simple, they (FA) have seen the pictures on television. If they judge it offensive, what can I say?' the Arsenal boss added. Injury: Walcott was taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the FA Cup victory . Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood, meanwhile, revealed in his post-match press conference he had not witnessed the incidents. Sherwood said: 'Someone just mentioned it to me in there. I didn't see it. 'Is that what he did? Well, listen I don't know Theo, I don't know him as a lad. It could have been a bit of banter, possibly. 'If they (Tottenham fans) did then it's a problem, isn't it?

Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond, 61, was seen out in London for the first time in months last night at a charity fundraiser at the Savoy Hotel . Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond was seen out in London for the first time in months last night, nearly a year after he resigned over the rate-fixing scandal. The 61-year-old banker, who pocketed £2m severance pay plus a pension when he quit the bank in disgrace last July, attended a fund-raising dinner at the Savoy Hotel. Dressed in black tie, he joined B-list celebrities including Tania Bryer, Patsy Palmer and Neil Fox on the red carpet at the Global Party, a fundraiser for disadvantaged young Londoners. Diamond has barely been seen since he stood down as Barclays chief executive after the bank was found guilty of manipulating the interbank lending rate, Libor. The American-born CEO, once described as 'the unacceptable face of banking' by then business secretary Peter Mandelson, initially refused to stand down when the scandal was uncovered. Barclays was fined a record £290m a year ago for attempting to manipulate Libor between 2005 and 2009. But days later, on July 3 last year, he resigned, after Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King apparently lost trust in him. Despite persistent rumours of Diamond's plans to start up a new banking venture, he has hardly been seen since. Diamond, who is married with three children, is said to have quit Britain following the scandal, and was spotted in New York last month riding the subway. He owns a vast house with pool in London's Kensington, a £24m penthouse in New York, and also has homes in Colorado and Nantucket. In an interview last year he admitted didn't like to dwell on how he had to quit the bank he had worked for for 16 years, saying: 'It's hard for me to talk about it - I've tried to move on.'

As ice storms battered Toronto before Christmas, hundreds of thousands of homeowners were left without power. But one man beat the blackout after siphoning off electricity from his car in order to power his home. Retired Air Force engineer Bob Osemlak used the battery in his Toyota Prius to heat his house, power his television and keep his lights on for a whole day on December 21. Ice storms left hundreds of thousands without power for days in Toronto, except for one man who managed to power his home using electricity from his car . Using his three decades of experience as a mechanic working on aircraft and cars he ran a cable from an outlet he fitted to his fireplace, through his basement and into the window of the Prius. Speaking to the Guelph Mercury, he said: 'When the furnace comes on, and the house gets up to temperature, I go to the thermostat and shut the furnace off. 'Now I can plug something else in: the TV, the fridge or the floor lamp.' He added that by powering just the lights and TV, the traction battery should run for a long time. Out of the nine hours he used the Prius the car's fuel gauge, measured in bars, went down by less than one bar — or roughly four litres' worth of petrol. However he doesn't recommend that anyone else try the trick, as it can be incredibly dangerous for someone without his training. The Toyota Prius is a hybrid car with two separate engines - one petrol, and one electric - and uses both a conventional fuel tank and a battery to power itself . According to his daughter Robyn, Osemlak has always been handy with cars, and in the 1960s while stationed in Winnipeg he invented his own automatic car starter to stop the cold damaging the engine. The motor would run for ten minutes every hour in order to keep the car warm so the engine wouldn't make a grinding noise as it started. However, Robyn added that she had no idea of her father's plans during the storm. Osemlak says he plans to keep the car on a full charge in case the power goes out again. The father added that he had driven a diesel Volkswagen for over a decade and only switched to a Prius a few years ago in the hope of getting better mileage.","Retired engineer Bob Osemlak powered his house for nine hours .

The business partner of a New York real estate developer whose body was found smoldering in a dumpster last week is now said to be fearing for his life. Security guards have been seen outside the home of Israel 'Sam' Perlmutter, 42, which is just blocks away from that of murdered Menachem 'Max' Stark, 42. Some have theorised that Stark was killed because of debts in the housing business, which he shared with Perlmutter, after defaulting on a $29million loan in 2008. Fear: The business partner of Orthodox Jewish real estate developer Menachem 'Max' Stark (pictured) is said to be fearing for his own life after Stark's murder last week . Hiding: Security guards have been seen outside the home of Israel Perlmutter, 42, following Stark's funeral on Saturday . Tradition: The funeral took place in Williamsburg just hours after Stark's badly burned body was found in a Dumpster on Long Island . According to the New York Post, Perlmutter now fears that whoever murdered Stark is coming for him and has 'loaded up with security guards' since the killing. According to the paper, 'any number of people' wanted Stark dead including nearly all of his dozens of . business associates and hundreds of tenants. Stark was branded a slumlord and a loan shark, and was accused of running substandard housing blocks, one of which was declared 'hazardous to life'. However family members have now hit back, saying that the rumours have been created by a few people envious of Stark's success. According to the New York Daily News, Stark's brother said: 'He was a good man, and he helped everyone. 'You know how people are. They’re looking for gossip. . . . People are jealous because he was successful.' Moses Strulowitz, 31, a brother-in-law added: 'This is the devil’s work. If you were chosen for this despicable act, God will punish you sooner or later.' Meanwhile a family friend suggested that Stark knew he was being watched and confided in his wife days before his death that he was feeling nervous. Hundreds of members of a Hasidic . community gathered Saturday in Brooklyn, New York, for an emotional . funeral service honoring Stark, a father of eight. Somber . mourners dressed all in black came together at the Lodiner Bais . Medrash synagogue in Williamsburg to pay tribute to Stark, whose charred . remains were discovered in a Dumpster on Long Island Friday afternoon. Detectives investigating the case are finding a that Stark left a trail of unpaid contractors, ripped-off tenants and tens of millions in debts related to the 17 properties he owned in the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn, according to the Post. His tenants were also furious. His 17 buildings had received 233 complaints and 148  violations - 49 of which were still open. Many tenants told the Post his properties were infested with rodents, sometimes didn't have heat or water and had shabby interiors. 'I’ve had many conversations with him, and of course in many of those conversations I wanted to kill him myself,' Greg Hanlon, who lived in one of Stark's Greenpoint buildings, joked to the Post. In 2009, according to the newspaper, one of Stark's buildings was so rundown, the city ordered all tenants to vacate and deemed it no acceptable to live in. Kind words: Speakers talked about Stark's well-known generosity and readiness to help those less fortunate . Ritual: Eulogies offered at the Lodiner Bais Medrash synagogue were frequently interrupted by wailing from the overflowing crowd . Tenants were forced to track Stark down in order to get back the four-months deposit they had put down. 'He pretty much ripped off the whole building,' a tenant organizer, Ryan Kuonen, said. 'They kept trying to serve him, and he kept hiding from them. When he’d hear ""Are you Max Stark,"" he would take off running.' Said one detective working the case: 'He f***ed a lot of people over.' Some neighbors told police that he was also a neighborhood 'loan shark,' according to the Post. He lent thousands to friends and then demanded it back with interest. 'He's a scammer,' a source told the Post. In accordance with Jewish tradition, Stark's funeral service and burial took place just hours after police . identified the scorched body found at a Great Neck, New York, gas station as the missing real . estate developer who was forced into a van during Thursday's blizzard. During the ceremony, which was conducted in Yiddish and was frequently interrupted by ritual wailing, speakers described the father of eight as a pillar of the Satmar Hasidic community who was always ready to help the less fortunate with money for food and rent, The Jewish Daily Forward reported. A body was found at around 4pm Friday in Great Neck with extensive burns and Nassau County police have identified the remains as that of Stark, 39, who was kidnapped in Brooklyn during the blizzard that hit New York City. A police source told the New York Daily News that the victim was likely suffocated before his killers wrapped his body in fabric, stuffed him into a trash bin at a gas station and set fire to his corpse. Fernando Cerff, the owner of the Getty gas station on Cutter Mill Road, told the paper that Friday morning his workers were shoveling snow when they noticed smoke rising from the Dumpster. Thinking that someone had tossed a cigarette inside, they sprinkled some snow into the container. When Cerff approached the Dumpster in the afternoon, he noticed a horrible stench coming from the bin. Cerff became suspicious and called police, which immediately discovered the body amidst the trash beneath a layer of snow. This development comes as cops released dramatic surveillance footage that shows the suspects forcing Stark into a Dodge Caravan after he left his offices in Williamsburg late on Thursday evening. Hunt: Police and the Willliamsburg community are looking for clues on the light-colored Dodge minivan (circled) which Stark appears to have been bundled into . On Friday the family of Stark, 39, offered a $100,000 'no questions asked' reward for his safe return on Friday, as police combed through surveillance video that appears to show his abduction. Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash. DNA Info . reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored . van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 . Rutledge Street. His wife, . Bashie, apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after . midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the . Orthodox community. Surveillance . footage was then discovered in Stark's office that shows a struggle . with one man, before the van pulls up and he is wrestled by two men into . the vehicle. Investigations: The incident is being looked into by the police and the Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the Orthodox community, who produced this report . Stark's brothers Yitzy and Yoely told the New York Post: 'We saw two people fighting with him, and they put him into a big white van, a Dodge Caravan,' Yitzy, 30, said. The brothers described Menachem's alleged attackers to the Post as 'big' and 'black.' The New York Daily News . reported that Stark was carrying $4,000 in cash, but Yitzy Stark denied . this when he offered the six-figure reward for his brother's return. 'We're . waiting for a phone call with demands. [We're] just hoping that he is . still alive,' Yitzy told DNA Info. 'We'll do anything they ask.' Shomrim . reportedly informed the NYPD of the incident at around 2.30 a.m. on . Friday. Both the police and the community are now looking for clues on . the white Dodge minivan. Officials spent the day in the local area conducting interviews and reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses. Scene: Stark was reportedly grabbed from outside his office on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg, seen in this file photo . The Real Deal . claimed that Stark, and associate Israel Perlmutter, were being sued . more than $51 million in 2011, over loans for development projects in . Williamsburg and Greenpoint.

Eyes transfixed with excitement, they gathered around a 4x2in screen to witness the moving image of a man who would be king flash 200 miles through the air. This is the moment that the first TV image was officially received outside London - on a £20 portable device known as a ‘Model A Televisor’ - at 11am on October 8, 1929 in Shipley, West Yorkshire. The group of men included Harry Barton-Chapple, a technical advisor and publicist for the TV set’s manufacturer Baird, and Sydney Moseley, an associate of the firm - who both travelled from London. Transfixed: Baird technical advisor Harry Barton-Chapple (seated) giving the first demonstration of TV outside London, in Shipley, West Yorkshire, in 1929. Also in the photograph is his associate Sydney Moseley (left) They gathered at the home of Sidney Wright, manager of the radio department at Christopher Pratt & Sons, which was the North’s top furniture store at the time and also offered early wireless systems. The device they used cost £20 - around £1,000 in today's money, based on inflation using the retail price index - and was first marketed in a Baird brochure in 1928, a year before the famed broadcast. The images have emerged following research into the broadcast by radio and TV expert Iain Logie Baird, an assistant curator at the National Media Museum in Bradford, who spoke to MailOnline. Explaining that signals were eventually picked up as far south as Africa and as far north as Iceland, he said: ‘This was the first documented reception of TV outside London as transmitted by the BBC. ‘This was the first time they’d really been able to get it working. It was to show the pictures were clear even that far away (in Shipley). People weren’t sure that TV could be sent as far as radio. ‘TV was of science fiction novels then. They were very pleased to be seeing an identifiable image. It was quite remarkable how many people then started to tune into these small images.’ Historic: The 'televisor' device (left) they used cost £20 - around £1,000 in today's money, based on inflation using the retail price index - and it showed an image (right) of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII . Following discussions between Baird, . the BBC, and the Government, it was declared in 1929 that TV broadcasts would begin over the BBC - and Baird would make the . programmes. TV signals would . be sent from the Baird studios in London through phone lines to the . BBC’s main radio transmitter, 2LO, and TV programming would appear . outside normal radio broadcasting hours. 'It was difficult to imagine that this vision was being flashed 200 miles through the air. The man disappeared. In its place there came another vision' Newspaper report from 1929 . This would be launched on September 30, 1929 - and a week later the image of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, would be officially received outside London, in the showing organised by Mr Barton-Chapple. He taught electrical engineering at Bradford Technical College - now the University of Bradford - from 1922 to 1925 and joined Baird in 1928. Mr Wright, whose home was used as the location for receiving the broadcast, supplied his own radio receiver set and loudspeaker - which was required for use in addition to the ‘televisor’ device. A report in the Bradford Telegraph and Argus newspaper on the day of the broadcast described the moment, saying the ‘enthralled’ group of men watched as the individual’s face moved on screen.

It said: ‘The people in the room watched this individual as he turned his head first to one side and then the other, opened his mouth, raised his eyebrows, laughed and scowled. ‘It was difficult to imagine that this vision was being flashed 200 miles through the air. The man disappeared. In its place there came another vision. 'TV was of science fiction novels then. They were very pleased to be seeing an identifiable image' Iain Logie Baird, radio and TV expert . ‘Still a man’s face, which in a moment was easily recognisable as a profile of the Prince of Wales. He was without a hat, and his collar and tie were easily seen.’ Mr Logie Baird, 44, who was born in Canada but now lives in Britain, is the grandson of John Logie Baird, described as the man who 'almost single-handedly invented the TV industry'. Mr Logie Baird Snr, who was born in Scotland in 1888, made the first transatlantic TV transmission, the first video recordings and gave the first demonstration of colour TV. He died in 1946 aged 57.

Just over a year ago, Antonia Eriksson's heart and organs were giving up, her bones were weak and her reflexes stopped working. But rather than surrendering to anorexia, the 18-year-old checked in to a hospital in September 2012 in a bid to reclaim her life. Eager to help other people suffering from a crippling eating disorder, the Swedish teenager used Instagram to document her difficult road to recovery and show that it 'was possible' to get better. Before and after . What a difference a year makes: On 5 October 2012 (left), Eriksson said she had 'horrible anxiety' and felt like 's**t'. But on 18 October 2013 (right), she felt 'amazing', she didn't 'fear food' and she was 'healthy and strong' 'When I first started @eatmoveimprove, it was actually called @fightinganorexia and it was an anonymous account,' Eriksson told The Daily Dot. 'It . took me a while before I decided to share my identity. So I had this . account alongside my personal [Instagram account] to track my recovery, . and then it grew and changed into what it is today.' Today, the photo-sharing account is brimming with body-positive messages, photos of Eriksson working out and healthy meals she's prepared for herself. However, her 15-month journey to recovery was often dark and painful. When she was admitted to hospital, Eriksson weighed just 84 pounds and feared she wouldn't survive another night. The Instagram photos were grim, with pictures of her hospital bed, thin frame and gaunt features. The hospital . Where it all began: On 28 September 2012, Eriksson posted this - her first picture - to Instagram, ' So i don't know for sure yet, but tomorrow I'm probably being put in #hospital for my #eatingdisorder. I just can't fight it on my own anymore and it's gotten really serious and out of hand. I'm anyway considering starting a blog so I can write about my life and my #disorder in a better way, what do you think?' Her actual hospital bed: On 30 September 2012, Eriksson posted this picture of her room, ' I have no idea how long I will have to stay but it feels good to be getting #help' But after two months in hospital, she overcame her demons, developed a healthy eating plan and got her life back on track. She said she reached a healthy weight in February . 2013. Now, Eriksson's photo feed . shows her posing in the gym, flashing the muscles she's worked hard . for, and the nutritious food she prepares. The teenager said the Instagram account has helped in her battle against anorexia. 'Instagram helped me a lot. I . found other people who felt the same way or were struggling with . battles like my own,' she told The Daily Dot. 'We supported each other a lot and when I . was feeling low I could always turn to my ‘Instagram family’ for . support and advice. 'I . felt I had a responsibility since I had a lot of followers who looked up . to me and saw me as an inspiration … it became very important to me to . recover in a good way and to stay healthy. To show people that it was . possible and worth it.' Road to recovery . Shaping up: Eriksson said she was growing to love her body again and was working hard to get in shape, seen in these pictures from 15 April 2013 (left) and 10 May 2013 (right) Eriksson said the shift from the . anonymous @fightinganorexia to the identifiable @eatmoveimprove account . was important for her recovery. 'Today I don’t see my account as . an inspiration for recovery, but for being recovered, [for being] . healthy, if you see the difference,' she said. 'Anorexia . is part of my history and a disease I once had, but it does not define . me as a person. 'Today I share my life, what I love to do, and who I am.

Food porn: Eriksson fills her Instagram with pictures of healthy foods such as yoghurt, blueberries and vegetables . Eriksson also runs a fitness blog, EATMOVEIMPROVE, where she answers questions about herself, her health and eating disorders in general. But she said she is very careful about what she shares online. 'People ask how much I weigh or how many calories I eat, and I won’t talk about that. I don’t want to share numbers because I know that triggered me, and I don’t want that to be what my account is about,' she said. 'I do post progress pictures, and that took me awhile. But followers were asking how my workouts were going so I decided to share more progress pictures—but I’m quite careful there too: I don’t talk about my body like I do about my progress. It’s not how I look, it’s how much energy I have or what I can lift in the gym. 'I’ll tell people off when they ask me how to lose weight. Me losing weight was me almost losing my life. You shouldn’t ask me how to do that. That’s like asking me how to commit suicide. 'I try to teach people who don’t understand. I’ll tell them what they doing and asking me is wrong; an eating disorder is not something to strive for.'

Astronomer Phil Plait was in Denver, Colorado working on a documentary when he happened to look up at the sky and noticed rare and majestic clouds formations called iridescent clouds and lenticular clouds. He grabbed his film crew and had them film the rare colorful swirls and one massive cloud ridge. Phil explained that iridescent clouds are characterized by striking colors like pink and green and are caused by sunlight reflecting off of tiny raindrops of ice crystals. The sunlight is broken up and the waves interfere with each other like 'waves in a bathtub.' Lenticular clouds or 'lens shaped clouds'  are heavy cloud formations that occur in moist air and wind. The spot in the cloud where moisture condenses is stationary and appears concave as the wind flows around it and gives it shape. Some of the clouds in the giant cloud ridge were beautifully shaded with two different colors as the setting sun hit the top of the clouds but not the bottom. Phil Plait writes for Slate's Bad Astronomy blog and says if he's learned any lesson from his studies it's 'Look up. If you do it enough, the sky will deliver.' WATCH FOOTAGE HERE .

Veteran actor George Cole has become ‘deeply depressed’ over a dispute with a neighbour at his idyllic rural retreat, his wife claimed yesterday. The 88-year-old, who starred as loveable rogue Arthur Daley in Minder, is said to be sick with worry at a saw mill being built next to his home of 70 years. He is already fighting illness and his wife Penny, 75, fears the row has made him worse. Battle: George Cole and his wife Penny have started legal action against local businessman James Morris . The couple and other villagers in Stoke Row, Oxfordshire, have launched legal action to try to stop local businessman James Morris, 44. He has started to build a metal barn 20ft high and 90ft long for his saw mill business which the district council has ruled does not need planning permission. Mrs Cole blamed the dispute for an agonising skin condition and heart palpitations which she is suffering. She added that her doctor has prescribed valium to combat the stress. Proposal: Mr Morris has started to build a metal barn 20ft high for his saw mill business. Above, his and Mr Cole's homes in Stoke Row, Oxfordshire . ‘This is the last thing we  need. It has made us both unwell,’ she said. ‘George has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems. This is shaking what he values. ‘He has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet. Otherwise he wouldn’t have lived here for 70 years. ‘This is our safe place and suddenly it isn’t any more. We can’t get away from it. Our master bedroom and sitting area face towards it. ‘At our age, we do not socialise except with our children and grandchildren. We never go away – we are always here.’ Protesters said beautiful trees will be hacked down, the mill will be an eyesore and noisy machinery will ruin the rural peace. Mr Morris runs a saw mill business two miles away in Nettlebed and lives yards from the Coles. He said he needs the machinery in the barn at his home to chop up trees. But Mrs Cole said: ‘The building looks like an escapee from an industrial estate. The problem is the planning department didn’t realise it would be quite so obtrusive and out of place. ‘It doesn’t nestle in the side of the hill and he has built on the plateau it stands on, so it is  visible from every angle from the open lane.’ The couple have taken on law firm Withers to challenge South Oxfordshire council’s decision that the building does not need planning permission. The firm said the ruling was ‘deeply flawed and unlawful’. Concern: Mr Cole, who starred as loveable rogue Arthur Daley in Minder (above), is said to be sick with worry . Not well: The veteran actor, pictured with Penny, 75, is already fighting illness and taking a range of medication . A spokesman added: ‘The council made . a gross error in failing to protect our clients’  residential amenity . in allowing the saw mill to begin with. ‘In so doing, it failed to have any regard to the noise implications of the proposal.’ The Coles and other neighbours are backed by planning consultant Nick Groves, who has lodged an objection with the authority. But . a council spokesman said: ‘A forestry building has been allowed on the . site on the basis that it falls within permitted development rights. ‘The council was satisfied that the proposed siting, design and external appearance of the  building was acceptable.’ Mrs Cole added: ‘We are having a bit of a struggle but we are putting our faith in the council and they said they would investigate.’ Her husband of 49 years has appeared in countless films and TV series in a career spanning more than six decades. One of the best known was Minder, in which he starred with Dennis Waterman from 1979 to 1994. Mr Cole also acted alongside Sir Laurence Olivier in the film The Demi Paradise in 1943. Mr Morris was not available  for comment.","Veteran actor George Cole is battling neighbour's plans to build saw mill .

The controversial badger cull cost an astonishing £4,100 per badger, it was claimed last night. It is estimated that the cull, which ended with just over half of the planned 5,000 badgers being killed, cost £7.3million in total. The taxpayer would have picked up the bulk of this – some £5.8million. Picking up the bill: It is estimated that the cull cost £7.3million in total . The calculations come from animal charity Care for the Wild which described the cull as ‘one of the most disastrous and expensive in history’. The badger cull, which began last autumn, aimed to help control the spread of TB among cattle by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in pilot zones in west Somerset and West Gloucestershire. But both ended without hitting their targets – despite the initial figures being revised down and the culling periods extended. Critics described the project as a fiasco but ministers insisted it has been worthwhile. The badger cull aimed to help control the spread of TB among cattle by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in pilot zones . Care of the Wild pieced together the cull’s cost from answers to parliamentary questions, statistics from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs and Freedom of Information requests. This put the total cost for at £7.3million – or £4,121 for each of the 1,771 dead badgers. This included £2.66million for policing the culls, which attracted protestors, and included the cost of overtime, helicopters and four-wheel-drive vehicles. Another £3.2million is estimated to have been spent by Defra and other Government departments on projects including pinpointing the location of badger setts and monitoring the cull’s humaneness.Farmers, who paid for the marksmen, were billed an estimated £1.49million. Care for the Wild has also calculated that if the culls are run annually for four years, as planned, the total bill will come to £19million. However, even if the cull did lead to a drop in TB among cattle, the taxpayer’s bill, including compensation for cattle that have to be destroyed, would only fall by £2.5million. Dominic Dyer, the charity’s policy advisor, said: ‘Taxpayers will not benefit from badgers being killed, the badgers certainly won’t benefit – and neither will the farmers because culling was always going to be a costly failure. ‘It’s time the Government realised that.’ The National Farmers’ Union said: ‘If marksmen had been allowed to go about their lawful business, there wouldn’t have been any policing costs.’","The figure was released by the animal charity Care for the Wild .

The Royal College of Midwives says the NHS coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than the service was designed for (file picture) Older mothers with high expectations are putting maternity wards under increasing strain, midwives have warned. The obesity epidemic is also contributing to a 'buckling' maternity service, according to the Royal College of Midwives. It says that the combination of a baby boom and staff shortages means the NHS coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than the service was designed for. In other words, it is lacking resources to deliver one in five of the 700,000 babies born in England each year. In its annual State of Maternity . Services report, the RCM says the situation is exacerbated by growing . numbers of complex pregnancies. There are also concerns that older mothers have idealised views about the care they should receive. 'The importance of complexity on the midwifery workload has been often overlooked,' says the report. 'One example of rising complexity is the continuing growth of births to older women.' In . 2012, there were almost twice as many babies born to women aged over 40 . than a decade earlier – the biggest rise in birth rate in any age . group. The RCM says that . while older women are as entitled to maternity care as their younger . counterparts, they are likely to require more support during pregnancy . and labour. They are more . likely to miscarry, as well as to have complicated pregnancies and to . deliver babies that are underweight or premature. Stillbirths are more . than twice as common in over-35s than younger women, while deterioration . of their eggs with time also leaves them at greater risk of having . babies with Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders. It is claimed that older mothers can also be more demanding, as they have had time to build up a 'rose-tinted' view of the type of care they should receive. The obesity crisis is adding to the strain, with tens of thousands of women requiring more demanding care in pregnancy because of  their weight. Around half of women of child-bearing age are overweight or obese and more than 15 per cent of pregnant women are obese. Figures show the NHS coped with almost 130,000 more births in 2012 than service was designed for (file picture) This raises their odds of dying in pregnancy, of their baby being stillborn and of a host of pregnancy complications. The RCM's most recent estimates suggest that there are nearly 50,000 more mothers-to-be in need of extra help because of their weight than 20 years earlier. And it is not just mothers that are getting older – midwives are, too. The largest single age group is now 45 to 49, leading to fears that the staffing shortage will be compounded when they retire. The RCM acknowledges that midwives are being recruited. Between May 2010, when the Coalition was formed, and July last year the number of full-time-midwives working in the NHS in England rose by 1,311 or 6.5 per cent. Statistics from the start of 2013 also suggest that the birth rate has started to drop. But the RCM stresses that with England still 4,800 midwives short, there is no room for complacency. Louise Silverton, the RCM's director of midwifery, said: 'Midwives in England have been run ragged for years as the number of babies born has gone up and up. 'Thousands of midwives short, as we are today, they are still running to catch up. 'We have reached a make or break point. The Government must  continue to pump money into maternity care. We need determined action from the Government and the NHS.'","Royal College of Midwives issues warning over 'buckling' service .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:38 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:12 EST, 6 January 2014 . Dr Maureen Baker warned that GPs needed an extra £1 billion of taxpayers' money to recruit sufficient staff to keep practices open at weekends . More than 20,000 extra GPs, nurses and other NHS staff are needed if David Cameron wants his plan for surgeries to open seven days a week to work, the head of the family doctor's royal college has warned. In her first major television interview since taking up the post, Dr Maureen Baker told Sky News that GPs needed an extra £1 billion of taxpayers' money to recruit sufficient staff to keep practices open at weekends. Without the extra money, the NHS risks becoming unsustainable as GPs and hospitals struggle to cope with the extra demand from patients over the winter months, she said. Dr Baker took over as head of the Royal College of GPs in November, a month after the Prime Minister declared his intention to get GPs to work more hours. But in an outspoken attack on the policy to be broadcast today she said that the idea was unrealistic unless the government was prepared to fund more staff. GP numbers would need to increase by a quarter alone, she suggested. 'If we were to move to seven days a week we would need 10,000 more GPs,' she said. 'We probably need the same number of practice nurses and a proportionate number of support staff. We don't think seven days a week is realistic'. According to the BMA there are just over 40,000 GPs currently working in the UK. The RCGP has previously suggested that 10,000 more would be needed for 7 day a week opening to function. However, it is believed to be the first time the College has warned that an equivalent number of nurses and support staff would be required as well. In a dire assessment of the current state of GP practices, Dr Baker said that family doctors feel 'besieged' as they struggle to deal with the influx of winter patients. 'It is constant demand with very little let up,' she said. 'We know our colleagues are working 11-12 hour days and that is really difficult to do day after day when it is a job you need to be on top form for. They are feeling pressurised and besieged and looking for a bit of respite.' Waiting times for appointments were rising, she said, leading to concerns that their treatment could be compromised. GPs need more resources, she said. 'The consequence (of not having extra resources) will be the winter pressure effect that comes up every year gets longer and longer. My fear is the whole of the NHS becomes unsustainable due to the failure to properly invest in general practice.' Dr Baker took over as head of the Royal College of GPs, based in Euston Square, London, in November . She also criticised the government's £500 million to hospitals to cope this winter. 'It wasn't the best use of money. It was a short term fix, finger in the dyke stuff,' she said. 'There is nothing about the use of that money that will stop the same pressures emerging again and again.' And she denied that full GP practices were to blame for increased numbers attending A&E . 'The problem is we have an increase in the number of patients turning up in ambulances very sick.' In October the Prime Minister said he would like GP surgeries to open from 8am until 8pm and over the weekends to fit in with the lifestyles of working people. He said a £50m pilot scheme would be rolled out across the country. He told Sky News : 'Sometimes people using accident and emergency really just need to see a GP but for hard-working people it is often too difficult because you are at work, you can't get an appointment at the time that fits. 'Let's see if we can have GPs' surgeries open 12 hours a day, seven days a week so you can always get that appointment you need.' A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'GPs do a vital job which is why we increased their overall budget last year as part of our protection of NHS funding. We have made £50 million available to help innovative GPs to extend their services and stay open longer — either on their own or by working with other local practices. We have also asked Health Education England to see how we can get 50 per cent of medical students to become GPs. 'Our changes to the GP contract will free GPs from unnecessary red tape so they can devote more time to patients. This goes hand in hand with a £3.8billion fund to join up health and social care and support the delivery of integrated services.'","Dr Maureen Baker said the NHS risks becoming unsustainable .

For those piling on jumpers at home, scowling at the frost outside and cursing the imminent heating bill, these nail-biting images will make you feel a whole lot warmer. Stripping to nothing but a pair of speedos and a cap, more than 700 foolhardy swimmers today dived into a -27C pool carved open out of thick ice. The ceremony hailed the start of the Harbin International Snow and Ice Festival, now in its 29th year, near the Siberian border of north east China. Scroll down for video . Bitterly cold: Swimmers dive into a pool carved into the thick ice covering the Songhua River during the Harbin Ice Swimming Competition in the northern city of Harbin, Heilongjiang province today .

The day started with workers cracking the thick ice sheets using metal sticks. The competitors, simply clad in swimming costumes, were organised into groups of age and gender then led out to race by invigilators wrapped in heavy-duty ski gear.

Slip: This man looks longingly at the finish line as - near the start - his goggles come loose. But he ploughs on regardless . According to organisers, more than 10,000 people were employed to prepare the ice sculptures adorning the arena for the next two months.

Weighing 440lb and 8ft long, the tiger was among exotic animals in a display for children. It was taken after only two days and workmen had to repair an illuminated panda after migrants began using it as a shelter. Police believe the tiger was stolen by a gipsy gang in Paris who planned to sell it for scrap. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has called for her town to be declared a high security zone and blames Britain for attracting migrants across the Channel and causing the port to become a bottleneck. Following repeated calls for action in December French Interior Minister Manuel Valls ordered a company of 60 riot police to be permanently based at the port. He has called on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to visit Calais to ‘see for herself chaos at the French port’ caused by migrants desperate to sneak into Britain. Valls visited Calais following a pitched battle between Asian and African migrants armed with iron bars and a fatal stabbing of an Eritrean.

This is the first picture of the woman believed to have been murdered by fugitive Briton Stuart Green, who is being hunted by police in Cambodia. The photo, posted on an expatriate forum by a writer using the name Ross, said the woman was named Nari and was 'a nice girl'. Police have so far refused to formally identify the dead woman. Other writers on the website said they recognised her face, although some questioned how 'Ross' knew she was the woman who allegedly had her throat cut by 47-year-old Green, from Manchester. Police said a Cambodian woman aged about 20 had been found naked under the bed in a room at a Phnom Penh hotel which Green and the woman had checked into on Christmas day. The Briton asked for the return of his passport at around 11pm on the night of December 28, telling reception staff that he needed it to go to a bank to get money to pay for the room - even though banks were not open at that time of night. He left the hotel and never returned. The following morning a cleaner found the blood-covered body under the bed. Since then there has been no sign of Green, with expatriates speculating that he might have been able to cross a 'loosely-guarded' border into a neighbouring country - most likely Thailand. Others have suggested he is hiding out in a remote 'flophouse' or a village where locals do not know that police are looking for him. One of the writers said he was certain that the woman whose photo has been posted was the local known as Nari. He wrote: 'My information was that the police did take a girl over from Sorya Mall (a shopping area where Nari is said to have associated with Western men) and she did identify the body.'

Claims: Michael Adebolajo (pictured) is alleged to have been assaulted by five officers in Belmarsh Prison in July . Five prison officers accused of assaulting one of Lee Rigby's killers are today facing a new investigation - with colleagues threatening strike action if they become 'victims of a witch hunt'. Michael Adebolajo was allegedly assaulted and his front teeth knocked out in Belmarsh prison, South East London last July. At the time, five long-standing prison officers were suspended and a criminal investigation was launched by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In December, the CPS said charges would not be brought against the officers. However, a new investigation is to be launched tomorrow by the National Offender Management Service - which has the ability to dismiss the officers if the complaint is proved. Today, the general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association said strike action was a real possibility. He told The People:'If we believe they are victims of a witchhunt by the Prison Service, we will take strike action. 'These men have been put under enormous pressure for simply doing their jobs. It is astonishing that given the CPS decision not to prosecute, they have not had their suspension lifted. 'These officers should be welcomed back to work and given the right kind of support. 'Instead, they have been virtually forgotten about by the Prison Service and left to rot. 'Our members are extremely angry and frustrated by the action against these men and a national walkout is a very real threat.' Investigation: Having been cleared of any criminal charges, the five officers of Belmarsh Prison (pictured) will now be investigated by the National Offender Management Service . A prison service spokesman said: 'Whilst the CPS have decided not to pursue a criminal prosecution against the five prison officers they remain suspended to enable an internal disciplinary investigation to take place. 'Given the serious nature of the allegations it is appropriate to investigate the matter under our own disciplinary arrangements.' In July the killer's brother Jeremiah Adebolajo told the BBC: 'They decided to twist his arm back... the arm that had been shot... He manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window.' Mr Adebolajo added: 'I wonder why it took five prison officers to restrain one man and how in the course of that restraint his teeth were able to be knocked out if they were following procedures.'

Labour Party leader Ed Miliband says expressing fears over the economic impact of an influx of low-skilled migrants is not 'prejudiced' More British workers will ‘lose out’ from the influx of cheap labour from Romania and Bulgaria, Ed Miliband has admitted. The Labour leader insisted it was not ‘prejudiced’ to believe that growing numbers of low-skilled migrants from the European Union would add to the problem of low pay and poor job security. Days after restrictions on workers from eastern Europe were lifted, Mr Miliband also called for a legal loophole to be closed which allows British workers to pay foreign workers less. From the start of 2014 curbs workers from Romania and Bulgaria coming to Britain have been lifted, raising fears of a fresh influx of cheap labour under-cutting people who already live in the UK. Mr Miliband warned that it would mean many British workers would be left worse off. Writing in the Independent on Sunday, the Labour leader said: ‘Labour won't conduct this debate in the shrill way that this Government does, for example, trundling vans through our cities telling people to ""Go Home"". ‘Instead, we will reform an economy hard-wired into a cycle of low wages, low skills, insecure jobs and high prices that is tearing into the living standards of ordinary families. ‘It means taking measures to stop unscrupulous employers using workers from abroad to undercut wages and worsen conditions.’ He hinted at radical reform of the UK economy to tackle the problem. ‘Unless we act to change our economy, low-skill immigration risks making the problems of the cost of living crisis worse for those at the sharp end,’ Mr Miliband added. ‘When millions of workers already have low pay and poor job security in Britain and we add high levels of low skilled migration mostly from within the EU, some benefit but some lose out.’ He added: ‘It isn't prejudiced to believe that.’ The Labour leader said he wanted to address ‘understandable’ public fears over lifting work restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians, conceding some UK nationals ‘lose out’ as a result of new arrivals. But while he backed stronger border controls and ‘fair’ benefit curbs, the key was ending the country's ‘chronic dependency on low-skill, low-wage labour’. The Labour leader said he wanted to address 'understandable' public fears over lifting work restrictions. Pictured, passengers by a bus in Sofia, Bulgaria a few days ago. Among steps Labour would take if it won the 2015 general election would be ending the ability of unscrupulous bosses to undercut regular staff by paying agency workers lower wages, he said. The TUC claims agency staff are paid up to £135 a week less than permanent staff despite working in the same place and doing the same job because of a loophole in the Agency Workers' Directive. Migrants are over-represented among the estimated one million agency workers in the UK, especially in sectors such as call centres, food production and logistics. Mr Miliband said he would work with the business sector to end the practice. Mr Miliband has conceded that the previous Labour administration was wrong not to impose transitional controls when Poland joined the EU - with far more arriving from there than anticipated. PM David Camerson once again refused to be drawn on estimates for the number of migrants heading to the UK . No official estimates have been given of the number of Romanians and Bulgarians likely to take advantage of the end of the restrictions later imposed on their countries. Today David Cameron again refused to give any indication of the number of people expected to arrive, despite schools, hospitals and other public services needing to plan for any major increase in population. ‘We are not making a forecast because I think it is unlikely we would get that forecast right,’ the Prime Minister told BC1’s Andrew Marr Show. Amid claims up to 50,000 people could arrive, the government has rushed through measures restricting access to jobless benefits and NHS healthcare. They came in the face of demands from Tories fearful of the threat posed by the eurosceptic UK Independence Party which is tipped to push the party into third place in May's European election.","Labour leader insists it is not ‘prejudiced’ to fear impact on jobs .

Two thieves were caught red-handed when a schoolgirl called police from under a bed when they broke into her home. Marcus Speirs, 32, and Richard Ansah, 29, broke in to the home in Erdington, Birmingham, by breaking down a back door. They then began searching the property for valuables. But the burglars hadn't realised a 13-year-old girl and her brother, nine, had run upstairs and grabbed a phone. Caught: Marcus Speirs, left, and Richard Ansah, right, who were caught red handed when a teenage girl called police from under a bed when they broke into her home . The quick-thinking teenager, who was alone in the house with her younger brother, hid under a bed and dialled 999 before Speirs spotted the siblings. When he did he threatened them with a garden hoe. Police officers arrived at the family home within four minutes of the emergency call and arrested the pair. Speirs, from Hockley, Birmingham, was charged with aggravated burglary whilst Ansah, from Sutton Coldfield, West Mids., was charged with burglary. The pair were sentenced to nine years and four years in prison respectively at Birmingham Crown Court on December 20 after admitting the charges. Speaking after the hearing, West Midlands Police Detective Sergeant Mark Langley, said: 'The young girl showed extreme courage and, crucially, had the awareness to grab a phone and take cover whilst dialling 999. 'She remained calm throughout what was undoubtedly a terrifying incident and was able to clearly and accurately relay details to a police call handler. 'The girl's textbook actions meant we were able to get officers to the scene within four minutes and catch both men in the act. 'These are two dangerous offenders - men who put young children through a shocking ordeal - and they have rightly been handed lengthy terms behind bars.' Case: The duo were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) for a total of 13 years for the crime . The two thieves - one of whom was armed with a metal bar - broke into the address just before 6.30pm on May 7 last year. The court heard Speirs was the main aggressor who snatched the phone from the 13-year-old girl and threatened her with the garden hoe. He was later found with the handset when searched in police custody. Det Sgt Langley, added: 'The evidence against both men was overwhelming and they pleaded guilty at an early stage. 'It meant neither child needed to give evidence - but had they been required to we have special measures in place to assist vulnerable witnesses when giving evidence and officers on hand to guide them through the process.'","Marcus Speirs, 32, and Richard Ansah, 29, broke in to Birmingham home .

An Irish traveller family single-handledly flooded the world with illegal rhino horn worth millions of pounds through a criminal network spanning the globe, it has been claimed. The gang from Rathkeale, in Limerick, Ireland, are thought to have been responsible for an epidemic of burglaries on more than 100 museums and auction houses across Europe since 2011 in their pursuit of the illicit product. Now new details of the lengths detectives went to in order to disrupt the major criminal network have emerged. Stolen: A gang of thieves took these rhino heads from the National Museum in Ireland which have horns worth £427,000 . Investigators from 33 European countries joined forces with the U.S. Fish and . Wildlife Service in an attempt to bring down the so-called Rathkeale . Rovers - an nexus of interrelated clans from the small Irish village. Years of following leads from America to Europe finally culminated in a raid on a traveller site in Cambridge in April 2013. Police made 19 arrests in connection with six burglaries at . museums and an auction house over four months in 2011. But that single raid helped unravel a much more complicated criminal network cashing in on the huge profits available from the illegal ivory trade. Raided: The horn from a preserved black rhinoceros was stolen from the Cron hunting trophy collection at the Museum in Ritterhaus in Offenburg, southern Germany . Rhino-mafia: Four unidentifiable people stole two horns of the rhinoceros in broad daylight during the museum's opening time in February 2012 .

'Now . horn in the United States is selling anywhere from $8,000 to $20,000 a . pound,' Edward Grace, deputy assistant director for law enforcement at . the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington told Business Week. 'By the time it gets to Asia, a single horn can easily be worth $500,000.' Authorities were first put on the trail of an Irish connection to the $10bn a year illegal industry following the arrest of two Limerick brothers in 2010 at Shannon Airport. Jeremiah, 33, and Michael O'Brien, 33, were caught illegally attempting to import rhino horns . worth almost €500,000. Crackdown: Police raid a traveller site in Cambridge during a massive police operation to arrest a gang of criminals behind burglaries of museums and auction houses across Europe . Both pleaded guilty to the illegal importation of four . rhino horns valued at €231,760. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, U.S. officials started on the trail when an Irishman calling himself John Sullivan was caught . in a sting trying to export rhino horn from America. Intelligence . had begun to link attempts to purchase rhino horn with a clan of Irish . travellers had been on authorities radar for years. Detectives in America to contact counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic and began to join the dots on a worldwide conspiracy to steal rhino horn and sell it illegally, usually to the lucrative Asian market. In 2011, Europol issued a warning . that an Irish Gypsy criminal network responsible for dozens of thefts of rhino horns . across Europe under an operation codenamed Oakleaf. By . the end of summer 2011, there had been 19 more thefts or attempted . robberies from museums and collections in France, Holland, Belgium, . Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the U.K . In April, 2012, masked men stole . stuffed rhinoceros heads bearing eight valuable horns from the warehouse . of Ireland's National Museum. Officials immediately . linked the raid on a storeroom in Swords, north of Dublin, to the Irish . Gypsy gang that specialised in similar heists across Europe. Discovered: Detective probing the theft of hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal rhino horn discovered a complicated criminal network based in the small village of Rathkeale, Ireland . Evidence began to stack up linking the series of thefts of high-value rhino horn on Rathkeale. One of the burglars behind a break-in at Portugal’s Coimbra museum in April 2011 made a phonecall from inside the building at 1am to an Irish cell phone registered to the . wife of a senior member of one of the Rathkeale clans. In . January 2013, a series of coordinated raids across eight European . countries led to the arrests of 30 more individuals with Rathkeale . connections. On September 13, . 2013, the climax of Operation Oakleaf, police staged simultaneous raids . on eight locations in the U.K. and Ireland - discovering a stash of rhino horn. Michael Kealy of Rathkeale was arrested on a European warrant for his involvement in the daylight robbery of a rhino horn from an auctioneer in a McDonald’s car park in Britain, and later served three months in prison for his part in the crime. In November, Michael Slattery Jr, of Rathkeale, plead guilty to a single charge of . conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act, which forbids trade in illegally . obtained wildlife.

Bulgaria has incited fury after banning foreigners from buying land - in the same week that its citizens gained the right to work anywhere in the EU. The country, which has seen restrictions lifted on 7.3million Bulgarians to live and work in Europe, has reinforced a ban stopping non-Bulgarian nationals from purchasing agricultural plots. But the move has prompted accusations of 'appalling hypocrisy' and breaches the agreement which let Bulgaria join the EU in the first place. 'Hypocrisy': Bulgaria has prompted fury among British MPs after banning foreigners from purchasing land in the same week its citizens gained the right to work in the EU . Bulgarian President, Rosen Plevneliev, does not support the ban, describing it as 'wrong' and has admitted the move could cause 'serious problems' for the country's image in Europe. Bulgaria's ban was due to expire on January 1, but rebel MPs passed a law in October among fears that land - which is ten times cheaper than elsewhere in central Europe - would be snapped up by foreign property investors. Despite the threat of hefty fines, the ban is due to remain until 2020 unless it is overturned by Bulgaria's constitutional court. Tory MP Nigel Mills, who is calling for tighter controls through an amendment to the Immigration Bill, told The Sun on Sunday: 'Bulgaria hasn't applied the obligations it signed up to. If It isn't satisfying all the terms of the treaty it doesn't deserve all the benefits.' An FCO spokesperson said: 'All EU countries are obliged to follow common EU rules. Those rules can be enforced by national courts. 'The European Commission and Bulgaria's president and prime minister have already made their views on this very clear.' Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Milliband today addressed 'understandable' public fears over the lifting of work restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians and said an influx of low-skilled migrant workers will make life harder. But while he backed stronger border controls and 'fair' benefit curbs, of more importance is ending the country's 'chronic dependency on low-skill, low-wage labour, he wrote in the Independent on Sunday. Ban: Bulgaria has banned all foreign developers from purchasing agricultural plots, which are up to ten times cheaper than the rest of central Europe . Among steps Labour would take if it won the 2015 general election would be ending the ability of unscrupulous bosses to undercut regular staff by paying agency workers lower wages, he said. The TUC claims agency staff are paid up to Â£135 a week less than permanent staff despite working in the same place and doing the same job because of a loophole in the Agency Workers' Directive. Migrants are over-represented among the estimated one million agency workers in the UK, especially in sectors such as call centres, food production and logistics. Mr Miliband said he would work with the business sector to end the practice. Public fears: Labour leader Ed Miliband has said low-skill immigration risks making wages lower in Britain . 'Unless we act to change our economy, low-skill immigration risks making the problems of the cost of living crisis worse for those at the sharp end. 'When millions of workers already have low pay and poor job security in Britain and we add high levels of low skilled migration mostly from within the EU, some benefit but some lose out.' He added: 'It isn't prejudiced to believe that.' Mr Miliband has conceded that the previous Labour administration was wrong not to impose transitional controls when Poland joined the EU - with far more arriving from there than anticipated. No official estimates have been given of the number of Romanians and Bulgarians likely to arrive in Britain, but amid claims they could number up to 50,000, Prime Minister David Cameron has rushed through measures restricting access to jobless benefits and NHS healthcare. They came in the face of demands from Tories fearful of the threat posed by the eurosceptic UK Independence Party, which is tipped to push the party into third place in May's European election. Mr Miliband wrote: 'Of course effective border control is important and while all the evidence is that most people come here to contribute, we need a benefits system that is seen to be fair. 'But this can only be a part of the solution because public concern about immigration is also a symptom of a deeper problem: an economy that no longer works for most working people.' The exit of Britain from the EU would however be 'a disaster', robbing the country of high-skilled foreign workers and forcing Britons working abroad to return home.","Non-Bulgarian nationals banned from buying agricultural plots .

Helicopters, speedboats and paramilitary police were deployed to raid the southern village of Boshe in Lufeng City, where 182 suspects were arrested. A reported 3,000-strong security force surrounded and entered the village where more than a fifth of the households were suspected to be involved in or linked to the production and trafficking of drugs, the Guangdong province police force said on its website. Scroll down for video . Crystal meth raid: Chinese authorities seized three tons of meth from the southern village of Boshe, notorious for drug production where one in five families is involved in the drug lab gang . Police and paramilitary forces from four cities were mobilized in Sunday's raid and arrested locals who allegedly worked for 18 large drug-making rings. Boshe's villagers have resisted Chinese authorities for years, blockading the village entrance with motorcycles when word of a raid spread. The villagers would brandish replica AK-47s, lay nail boards on the road and hurl rocks and homemade grenades at officers, said the paper based in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province. The provincial police say the city of . Lufeng, which Boshe is a part of, has become the source of a third of . the country's total crystal meth supply in the last three years. Endemic involvement: Some 182 suspects from the village were arrested on suspicion of working for 18 large drug-making rings . Resistance smashed: In the past the villagers had blockaded the entrance of Boshe with motorcycles when word of a raid spread but a reported 3,000-strong security force managed to enter on Sunday . Focused attack: Police and paramilitary forces from four cities were mobilized to make the arrests (left) and to seize huge amounts of methamphetamine (right) No one was harmed in the Sunday raid, a police statement said on Thursday. The statement said: ‘The village has made a criminal drug production a “clan-based, industrialized operation with local protection”.’ ‘The offenders have for a long time been brazenly committing crimes, avoiding investigations and even ganging up to violently oppose law enforcement.’ China routinely carries out operations targeting illicit drug rings but it is unusual for such wide-ranging law enforcement resources to be deployed against a single village all at once. 'Clan-based operation': The village had become a local operation, protected by members of the community, police said after the raid which saw crystal meth and raw materials for drug production seized (pictured) One in five families: Paramilitary police look at machines used by locals to produce crystal meth, where a large proportion of the population involved in the drug production process . An aerial photo posted on the police website showed dozens of police vans parked in rows outside a walled village of densely built old houses with traditional-style peaked, tiled roofs. Another photo showed a helicopter taking off and another one parked nearby. Speedboats were sent to prevent suspects from fleeing the coastal village by sea. Local newspaper The Yangcheng Evening News reported that the raid involved 3,000 police officers who seized three tons of methamphetamine in the raid. Photos showed paramilitary officers in camouflage uniforms and holding rifles stood over large boxes filled with large packets of what is presumably crystal meth. More than routine: Chinese authorities regularly target illicit drug rings but it is unusual for such a wide-ranging law enforcement resources to be deployed against a single village all at once for a raid which has resulted in a huge capture of crystal meth . Massive shutdown: Police in camouflage search the village which is part of Lufeng, the city that has become the source of a third of the country's total crystal meth supply in the last three years . Booby traps: Before the raid in which 182 were arrested, villagers would brandish replica AK-47s, lay nail boards on the road and hurl rocks and handmade grenades at authorities . Mass detention: The raid on Boshe, which revealed tons of illicit drugs and drug-making materials (pictured), was part of 'Operation Thunder,' an on-going crackdown on illicit drugs which has resulted in the capture of 11,000 suspects and eight tons of drugs . The paper said police first captured the village party secretary who allegedly was protecting the drug operations from authorities. Other officials captured included the local police chief and other police officers. Calls to police at the provincial and local levels rang unanswered on Friday.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's vital organs are beginning to shutdown as his medical condition deteriorates, the doctor in charge of his care admitted today. Mr Sharon, 85, who has been in a coma for eight years after a devastating stroke incapacitated him at the peak of his political power, is fighting and is not in pain, said Dr Zeev Rotstein, the director of Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv. Sharon was one of Israel's most iconic and controversial figures and his career stretched across Israel's 65-year history. Speaking to reporters today at the hospital, Rotstein said Sharon's life remains in danger and that 'there is a slow and gradual deterioration' in his condition along with 'multi-organ failure'. Test results show Sharon also has a blood infection, Rotstein said. The director refused to provide a prognosis but when asked if Sharon will recover, 'looking at the trend of deterioration, it doesn't give us good signs for the future'. Sharon's family was by his bedside, Rotstein said. Referring to Sharon by his nickname 'Arik,' Rotstein said Sharon 'is fighting like a real fighter, as he did all his life.' As one of Israel's most famous generals, Sharon was known for bold tactics and an occasional refusal to obey orders. Sharon is credited with helping turn . the tide of the 1973 Mideast war when Arab armies launched a surprise . attack on Israel on the solemn fasting day of Yom Kippur, causing large . Israeli casualties. He led an Israeli force across the Suez Canal, trapping part of the Egyptian army and turning the war in Israel's favor. As . a politician, he became known as 'the bulldozer' - a man contemptuous . of his critics while also capable of getting things done. He was elected . prime minister in 2001. In . mid-2005, he directed a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and . settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year military control of the . territory. Impact: Mr Sharon, pictured with former US President George W. Bush shortly before his stroke, is one of Israel's most iconic and controversial political figures . It was a shocking turnaround for a man who had been a leading player in building Jewish settlements in captured territories. He . later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the . centrist Kadima Party. It seemed he was on his way to an easy . re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006.

The Aurora Australis had been cracking through thick ice toward open sea after a Chinese helicopter yesterday plucked the passengers from a stranded Russian research ship and carried them aboard. But today, the crew of the Xue Long (Snow Dragon), the Chinese icebreaker that had provided the helicopter, said they were worried about their own ship's ability to escape the ice. Role reversal: The Chinese ship Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which had gone to rescue passengers stuck in an icebound research vessel, is now itself stuck in the heavy Antarctic sea ice . Complex operation: The Xue Long (Snow Dragon) Chinese icebreaker, as seen from Australia's Antarctic supply ship the . Aurora Australis, sits in an ice pack unable to make its way back to open water . The end is in sight: The first of the 52 passengers on a research ship trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week were finally rescued by helicopter after several aborted attempts to evacuate them . The helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time over approximately five hours . Sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, so the passengers are instead being taken to an nice floe next to an Australian vessel which will eventually take them to Tasmania . The Aurora was told to stay in the . area in case the Snow Dragon needs help, according to the Australian . Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Co-ordination Centre, which oversaw . the rescue. She had been . about to embark on a journey to drop off the 52 scientists and tourists . rescued from research vessel MV Akademik Shokalski at the Australian . island state of Tasmania. The .

The barristers' chambers led by Alex Cameron has announced it will back the strike against cuts on Monday morning . David Cameron’s elder brother has lent his backing to the lawyers’ strike designed to undermine the Government’s  legal aid reforms. The barristers’ chambers led by Alex Cameron has indicated it will support the strike, in which the elite lawyers who work as trial advocates have said they will refuse to turn up to court on Monday morning. Mr Cameron, a 50-year-old crime specialist reputed to be among the highest-earning barristers in the country, is a member of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), the organisation behind next week’s strike. A CBA spokesman said: ‘Alex Cameron’s chambers, Three Raymond Buildings, are supporting the CBA day of action. There isn’t a position from him personally.’ Mr Cameron has been head of Three Raymond Buildings since 2010 – billed in legal directories as ‘the chambers of Alexander Cameron QC’ – and so can be assumed to have been a leading voice in the chambers’ discussions about the dispute. The strike has been arranged to demonstrate to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling the depth of feeling among barristers over the Coalition’s latest attempt to cut £200million from the £2.1billion annual cost of legal aid. Yesterday, Mr Grayling’s civil servants published figures showing 1,200 barristers are paid more than £100,000 a year in public money for work in the criminal courts, and that 300 of them were paid more than £200,000 in fees from the taxpayer. Mr Grayling proposes to cut legal aid . fees for criminal barristers in everyday trials by around 10 per cent, . and to chop as much as 30 per cent off the bills of barristers appearing . in the longest-running and most expensive cases. A spokesman for the chambers said though it was backing the action, the Prime Minister's brother had no 'personal position' There will also be an attempt to cut the number of spurious cases brought by prisoners and funded by legal aid, an end to automatic legal aid for anybody with a disposable income higher than £37,500 a year, a squeeze on judicial review cases and a residency test to try to stop those without connections to the UK getting legal aid for civil cases. Alex Cameron, who is three years older than the PM, went to the same prep school and to Eton, before studying law at Bristol University. He rose to the rank of QC at the age of 39.","Barrister's chambers led by Alex Cameron is to support the strike .

The last 12 months have been the safest for air travel with only one fatal accident in every 2.5 million flights. Despite a number of high profile crashes, such as the devastating Boeing 737 crash in Pakistan that killed 127 people, 2012 has been a significantly safer year for air travel than 2011. The number of fatal crashes this year and the number of people killed in those crashes fell sharply compared, according to figures released today. Safety in numbers: The number of fatal crashes this year and the number of people killed sharply compared to 2011, according to figures released by flight advisory service Ascend . The fatal accident rate of one per 2.5 million flights makes 2012 the safest year on record and almost twice as safe as 2011, flight advisory service Ascend said. There were 15 plane crashes involving deaths in 2012, compared with 25 in the previous 12 months, according to the figures which relate to airliner safety. The number of people killed in fatal crashes this year was 362 compared to 403 in 2011. Nearly three quarters of the 362 deaths in 2012 resulted from two crashes. When a Bhoja Air Boeing 737 crashed near Islamabad airport in Pakistan in April 20 a total of 127 people were killed. The plane's fuel tank caught fire only three miles from the airport and is reported to have exploded in midair. Record: There were 15 plane crashes involving deaths in 2012, compared to 25 in the previous 12 months. The number of people killed in fatal crashes this year was 362 compared to 403 in 2011 . Wreckage: Remains of the DANA Air plane which crashed while approaching Lagos airport in Nigeria, killing all 153 passengers . The 32-year-old jet was first used by British Airways. In June, all 153 passengers on a DANA Air plane died when it crashed while approaching Lagos airport in Nigeria. A further 10 people were killed when the plane crashed into print works and residential buildings in the busy Iju-Ishaga suburb. Ascend said the passenger death rate for the last five years was about one per 6.1 million passengers, while the rate was one per 3.7 million for the period between 2000 and 2009. The rates have steadily increased since the 1990s when the rate was one per 1.8 million flights. Disaster: A further 10 people were killed when the plane crashed into print works and residential buildings in the busy Iju-Ishaga suburb . Horror: Wreckage from the 32-year-old jet, which first saw service with British Airways, was scattered across a wide area in fields about three miles from the airport in Pakistan . Insurance claims for loss of airliners in 2012 were worth approximately $980 million dollars (Â£612 million) - the lowest level since 1991. Paul Hayes, head of safety at Ascend, said: '2012 does not represent a new norm for the world airlines. 'Nonetheless, airline fatal accident rates have been steadily improving and on average, operations are now twice as safe as they were 15 years ago. 'About 335 fewer passengers and crew were killed each year in the last decade than during the 1990s.'","2012 becomes the safest year on record and twice as safe as 2011 .

Backing Becks: Lord Coe has previously said that David Beckham should be knighted for his footballing prowess and efforts bringing the Olympic Games to London . The row over David Beckham’s knighthood snub in the New Year Honours List took a new twist last night after a split was revealed between Sebastian Coe and the man in charge of  the awards. The Mail on Sunday, which revealed last week how Beckham and his wife Victoria had missed out on becoming Sir David and ‘Lady Posh’, has learned that the gong was approved by the secretive group headed by Lord Coe that deals with sports stars’ honours. But that decision was unexpectedly overturned when it was passed to the main Honours Committee, chaired  by the head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake. With Lord Coe also a member of the main committee, Beckham’s award was expected to have been rubber-stamped. But a fierce debate erupted at a meeting in November. Several committee members argued that 38-year-old Beckham should be made to wait longer, with one claiming there was a danger  of ‘the Wiggins effect’ getting  out of hand - a reference to last year’s knighthood for cyclist Bradley Wiggins. However, others pointed  out that unlike Wiggins, 33, Beckham’s sporting career is over following his retirement from playing football last May. One source said: ‘It was unfair to say this was too soon. It was more than six years ago that he helped London win the right to host the Olympic Games. Made to wait: David Beckham with wife Victoria  - who this year missed out on becoming Sir David and 'Lady Posh' ‘The faceless wonders who decide honours are happy to  dole them out to time-serving politicians but not sports heroes who have achieved far more.’ However, another insider countered: ‘Senior figures in the sports world expressed concern about awards going to too many sportsmen too soon after Wiggins was knighted - and Coe was aware of that.’ The honours system is shrouded in secrecy and overseen by the Cabinet Office Honours and Appointments Secretariat. The identity of those who make nominations, widened in recent years to include members of the public, is kept secret. Lord Coe had said the Sport Honours Committee believed a knighthood for Beckham was justified in view of his success on the football field and his support for London’s successful bid to host the Olympics. As leader of the 2012 Games, Lord Coe had first-hand experience of Beckham’s contribution when they travelled to Singapore together in 2007  for the crucial vote. Other members of the Sport Honours Committee who had backed Beckham included former England football manager Graham Taylor and Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson.","A group led by Lord Coe had approved a knighthood for the football legend .

Mystery: Sylvain Mollier, 45, was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin a year and four months ago . French police have ‘all but closed’ an investigation into a mystery cyclist who was shot dead in the Alps along with three members of a British-Iraqi family, it emerged yesterday. This is despite the first image of Sylvain Mollier being released – exactly a year and four months after the atrocity. The long delay has led to claims of a cover up being mounted around the 45-year-old’s past life. He was shot seven times by a pistol-wielding assassin, but the French led inquiry continues to focus on the al-Hilli family, who lived in Claygate, Surrey, as the attackers’ main target. An alleged ‘vow of silence’ by those close to Mollier has fuelled claims that an individual or group known to him wanted him dead. Mollier’s body was found in a forest layby near Lake Annecy in eastern France on September 5, 2012. Close by, in a BMW estate car, Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, lay dead. Each had been shot three times, all at least once in the head. Their two daughters, Zeena, then 4, and Zainab, then 7, survived. The focus of the inquiry has so far been on a dispute that Saad is believed to have had with his 54-year-old brother, Zaid, over their father’s inheritance. Mollier was, however, involved in a dispute over a lucrative pharmacy business that was being transferred to his girlfriend, Claire Schutz, a 30-year-old heiress, by her parents. Mollier had just had a son with Schutz and had given up his job as a metalworker at a factory making nuclear components. There was tension over the amount of cash that Mollier was accepting from Schutz, including the money to buy the £4,000 racing bike that he rode to his death. Detectives have also uncovered romantic entanglements that Mollier was trying to keep secret. Ongoing: French authorities insist the al-Hilli family, from Claygate, is the focus of the investigation . But a French police spokesman said today: ‘The focus of the investigations remains the al-Hilli family. It appears that the cyclist was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enquiries into his background are all but closed.’ The refusal of the French authorities to release a picture of Mollier has prompted the television channel France 2 to show it in its documentary programme Non Elucidé (Unresolved) yesterday and to put it on the internet in the hope of jogging people’s memories. The undated image, provided by a former colleague, shows Mollier in the football kit of his firm, Cezus, before a match. Detectives have confirmed his identity. Zaid al-Hilli, a payroll manager from Chessington, Surrey, who was arrested last year but provided police with a confirmed alibi, is convinced Mollier was the real target, saying in October: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’","Sylvain Mollier shot seven times by assassin a year and four months ago .

A 99-year-old who has served in the Girl Guides since she was 13 has been recognised as the country's longest serving member. Margaret Rigby from Chorley, Lancashire, has devoted most of her life to the group - and has just received a British Medal Empire in the New Year's Honours List for her efforts. After being a guide and a ranger in the 1920s and 30s, she continued her service after the war and was secretary and leader of various guiding groups. She now serves in the Trefoil Guild, an adult group which gives practical, financial and moral support to the guiding and scouting movement. And Mrs Rigby has no intention of giving up. She said: 'I have been involved with the Girl Guides continuously for 86 years, I've never stopped or taken a break, because I love everything about it. 'I was 13 at the time and the church my family went to started up a group, and so most girls my age from the area joined. 'We got up to all-sorts and were awarded all sorts of badges. There's nothing like it for teaching you valuable life skills that you just wouldn't learn anywhere else, and it's still very much part of who I am.' Mrs Rigby said her commitment to guiding even extended to helping the war effort between 1939-1945. 'I remember during 1941 in particular, there was a lot of bombing and it was difficult for people to get out so we would meet in the afternoon as there was a blackout in the evenings.

Cirrhosis of the liver is normally associated with binge drinking for ten years or more, but experts have suggested it is now occurring over a shorter period. Teenagers of 17, 18 and 19 years old across the UK are being treated for alcohol-related liver disease, which is usually associated with adults who have been drinking heavily for ten years or more (stock picture) According to information obtained by The Sunday Times, an 18 and a 19-year-old have both been treated for alcohol-related liver disease at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The two 17-year-olds, meanwhile, were treated at St James's University Hospital in Leeds and Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The second 19-year-old was treated at Royal Free Hospital in North London. The paper also reported that at least one patient in their 20s with the condition received a transplant. A doctor from Addenbrooke’s, Dr Alexander Gimson, told the paper the ‘portentous’ figures were in line with research showing that the age at which people suffer and die from alcohol-related liver disease is getting younger. At least one person in their 20s received a transplant after the alcohol-related disease (stock picture) The revelation follows figures released in September showing that 6,580 under-18s – and 293 children aged 11 and under – were admitted to A&E for alcohol-related admissions. Meanwhile, it was reported in The Sun today that cases of foetal alcohol syndrome - where babies are left deformed or disabled by their mother's drinking during pregnancy - rose by 48 per cent between 2009-10 and 2012. Last year, doctors saw 313 cases of the condition, up from 212 in 2009-10. Drinking during pregnancy can affect children's facial features, hearing and numerous diseases.

Paul Green of Saga said: ‘For some, the fear could mean they won’t turn their heating on, and in so doing, risk their own health and welfare.’ He called for cuts to green levies, more pressure on energy companies for fairer pricing and the development of new fuel sources linked to lowering bills. Jane Vass, of the charity Age UK, said high energy prices combined with poorly insulated homes were major factors behind excess winter deaths. Pledge: Ed Miliband has promised to freeze energy bills if he wins the next general election . ‘Those living in the coldest homes are three times more likely to die a preventable death than those living in warmer ones,’ she added. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the 2015 general election, although Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg dismissed the plan as a ‘con’. Labour public health spokesman Luciana Berger said: ‘This survey shows the desperate lengths older people are going to in order to keep warm in David Cameron’s Britain.’ However, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said the Government had a range of schemes to help cut bills and make homes more energy efficient. A spokesman said the Warm Home Discount will help two million British households this year – with more than one million vulnerable pensioners on low incomes receiving £135 off their bill. A spokesman for Energy UK, which represents the Big Six suppliers, added: ‘No one should have to resort to staying in bed longer or only using parts of their home to keep warm, your energy company wants to help, you just need to get in touch.’","One in eight also said they planned to stop using parts of their homes .

After 15 hours, army ballistic experts remain outside the cordoned-off house and neighbours have been evacuated. A team of soldiers, police, firefighters and paramedics was called to the terraced council house in Hull after an anonymous tip-off at 2.49 this morning. Raid: Armed officers burst into the property on Kilnsea Grove in Hull, arresting a boy, 15, and two adults . Neighbours were evacuated as armed officers entered the property. The teenager was detained as well as a 49-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man. More than 15 hours later, the multi-agency operation is still ongoing in Kilnsea Grove, east of the city. A blue forensics tent is stood outside the property with a number of police cars and fire engines. Earlier, dozens of people living in the area gathered behind the police cordon to watch the soldiers go into the property. One man said: 'I can't believe what descended on us. There's army, police, ambulances, four-wheel drive ambulances, fire engines. Everything's here. 'They came in the middle of the night after a tip-off about stuff in the house. Then all hell broke loose. I've not seen anything like it.' Another Kilnsea Grove resident said: 'They've just said they've found explosives inside and we're to stay well away.

"By . Anna Pointer . PUBLISHED: . 17:23 EST, 30 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:23 EST, 30 December 2013 . Young sufferer: Nikki Cooper, 32, thought she had trapped nerve, but found out she has MS . Stretching her arms above her head in the gym, Nikki Cooper felt a shock run from her neck to the base of her spine. ‘It lasted two seconds and it was like someone walking over your grave — but with a spark running through it,’ says Nikki, who was then 28 and in training for a rowing race. ‘I was working my arm muscles hard, so I blamed that.’ Over the next month, the sensation recurred every few days. Looking up the symptoms online, she diagnosed a trapped nerve in her neck. Six weeks later she went to her GP. Nikki, who was an investment banker, was given tests to check her balance and grip — these proved normal. ‘The doctor agreed that it was a trapped nerve.’ But this was not a harmless sports injury. In fact, Nikki — now 32, who lives in Guildford, Surrey, with her husband Steven, 33, a banker — was experiencing the beginnings of multiple sclerosis. This debilitating neurological condition, which affects around 100,000 people in Britain, happens when the immune system attacks healthy nerve fibres running between the brain and spinal cord. The nerves become inflamed, leading to muscle spasm, blurred eyesight or loss of vision, dizziness, numbness and tingling limbs. There is no cure, and it can cause varying degrees of disability, and eventually in some cases, paralysis. There is no clear cause for MS but one theory is that it is linked to a lack of vitamin D, obtained from the skin’s exposure to sunlight. The condition is more common in the Northern Hemisphere, and as Dr Waqar Rashid, a consultant neurologist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, explains: ‘The further away you are from the equator, the more likely you are to develop MS.’ Doctors also do not understand why MS affects three times more females than males — and the ratio is widening, says Dr Raj Kapoor, an MS specialist and consultant at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London. MS is also on the increase worldwide. Again, it’s not clear why, although Dr Kapoor says: ‘Some wonder about the impact of the modern lifestyle and diet. But MS doesn’t discriminate; anybody can get it. ‘There are possible links to environmental factors such as viruses or bacteria — although no single infection has been identified as a trigger.’ Big change: Heavily pregnant Nikki, pictured with son William, has had to leave her job as an investment banker as a result of her debilitating condition . The condition mainly affects the young, with up to 75 per cent of cases being diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40. Nikki’s case highlights the difficulties in spotting MS. ‘My GP thought it was nothing to worry about, but referred me to a neurologist to make sure,’ she says. ‘When I saw my GP again after my diagnosis a couple of months later, she was shocked and upset.’ Dr Kapoor says: ‘I have great sympathy with GPs because a lot of people might have pins and needles or tingling, which can be due to any number of processes — such as a trapped nerve or vitamin deficiencies.’ The time taken for diagnosis varies because there is no single test for the condition.  When Nikki saw the neurologist in July 2009, he diagnosed Lhermitte’s sign — a nerve pain which causes electrical sensations down the back. ‘He told me it generally signifies a brain tumour or MS, but I thought: “No, that’s not me. I’m not sick”,’ she says. Indeed, that weekend, Nikki ran a 10k race. But the next day she had severe muscle pain in her limbs, hands and feet. ‘It was only then I started worrying, and cried.’ She had an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture. Two weeks later, she and Steven saw the neurologist for the results. The scan showed lesions around her spine, a sign of MS. Dr Kapoor says lesions are like scars: ‘They are linked to damaged myelin, the substance surrounding nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Myelin insulates the nerve fibres and enables them to transmit impulses.’ As the neurologist confirmed the MS diagnosis, Nikki recalls: ‘I felt my whole world was caving in and I began sobbing. Steven and I wanted to start a family, but instead I saw myself confined to a wheelchair.’ Dr Rashid says: ‘Around 50 per cent of people require a walking aid or wheelchair 15 to 20 years after the first onset of symptoms. MS is unpredictable. The inflammation can clear up, and if it does, the nerve fibres can repair themselves. ‘There are cases of so-called “benign” MS, which stays mild throughout its course. But repeated attacks can leave permanent scarring.’ Nikki discovered no two cases of MS are the same: ‘There was no way of knowing if I’d be in a wheelchair at 40, or still running competitively at 50.’ Dr Kapoor says: ‘There are two main forms of MS; relapsing/remitting, and progressive. When symptoms get worse quickly this is known as a relapse. Periods when they improve or disappear are known as remissions.’ The soon-to-be mother-of-two is one of around 100,000 people affected by the debilitating neurological condition, where the immune system attacks healthy nerve fibres running between the brain and spinal cord . Progressive MS is characterised by worsening pain with fewer remissions, and increased likelihood of disability — or eventual paralysis. Treatment is centred around disease-modifying-drugs (DMDs), which interfere with the immune system and help prevent some relapses. Nikki says: ‘I needed a positive attitude. After reading about studies in the U.S. advocating vitamins, supplements and fish oils to combat symptoms, I started taking them, and found my energy levels soared. I also exercised.’ She remained well enough to not require drugs, which meant she and Steven could start a family; their son William was born in July 2011. Her symptoms virtually disappeared during pregnancy. However, in the months following William’s birth, her symptoms reappeared — with added facial numbness and weakened legs. ‘I feared I might not be able to care for William properly, or have any more children,’ she says. On her neurologist’s advice, she started injecting a DMD called Rebif three times a week, and soon felt better. But a more serious relapse came in November last year. ‘I was reading my Kindle and I noticed a dark shadow across my left eye. I switched the light on, but it made no difference. ‘I’d gone completely blind in my left eye. After half an hour my sight returned. Next morning, I called my MS nurse, and she exp-lained it was optic neuritis.’ This is when the optic nerve is inflamed, disrupting messages from the eye to the brain. Nikki began frequently experiencing sporadic sight loss, and this still recurs now when she is overtired. ‘This is due to scarring from the original attack,’ says Dr Kapoor. ‘Symptoms are more likely to recur if the patient is tired or stressed.’ The setback prompted Nikki to quit her City job and focus on a range of vitamins and supplements she has developed specifically for women. During another ‘remission’ earlier this year, she stopped her medication to try for another baby, and is due to give birth in early January. ‘I do have days where I worry, but I shut it out. There’s so much research going on that we have to remain hopeful.’ Dr Rashid agrees: ‘Advances are being made all the time, and there are four new therapies set for review by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Our ability to treat MS in the future is potentially very exciting.’ Nikki’s nutrient range, Inner Me, is available at Boots, Selfridges and Holland & Barrett from March 2014, innerme.co.uk.

A teenage girl was given just months to live after daily 18-hour alcohol binges left her body ravaged. Phoebe Haffenden would consume an astonishing six litres of cheap cider a day, and at the age of 19 was warned by doctors that her body was close to shutting down. The teenager, who is still 19, from New Milton in Hampshire, started drinking at just 15, but her habit spiralled out of control and she was soon drinking a litre of vodka at a time. Phoebe Haffenden (pictured with her mother, Kate) started drinking when she was 15 and by the time she was 16 she was addicted to alcohol . Her addiction became so extreme she was kicked out of her family home and would suffer uncontrollable shakes and terrifying hallucinations. Despite a happy childhood and a stable upbringing with mother, Kate, 39, a cleaner, and brother Ben, 17, Phoebe flew off the rails as the addiction took hold of her. At her worst, the once-shy schoolgirl would even wake to find herself in bed with strangers who she had forgotten having sex with. Phoebe first started drinking as a way to increase her confidence, but by the age of 16 she had developed a problem. By the time she was 18, she had totally hit rock bottom. Phoebe said: ‘I couldn’t stop and I was soon hitting the bottle from 10am to about 3am or 4am the next morning. ‘I was running out of money and soon turned to cheap cider to feed my addiction.’ Phoebe went on 18-hour binges and drank as much as six litres of cider a day. She is pictured at the age of 18 . Phoebe's addiction became so severe she was kicked out of the family home and she started to suffer from uncontrollable shakes and terrifying hallucinations . And with her new-found drunken confidence came outrageous promiscuity and a string of one-night stands. ‘I got myself into some awkward positions when I was drinking,’ said Phoebe. ‘I had quite a few one night stands that I do regret. ‘There was one night when I went to a party with a friend and I didn’t know the guy I woke up next to. ‘I was confused where I was and my friend had to explain what had happened. Most of the nights were a blur.’ The sixth form student struggled to keep up with her studies as debilitating hangovers left her unable to attend classes and she would often skip lessons to while away hours in the pub. Phoebe (pictured aged 18) was told that if she did not stop drinking she would die within a few months as her body was shutting down . Phoebe (pictured at the age of five with her brother) said: 'I couldn't stop and I was soon hitting the bottle from 10am to about 3am or 4am the next morning. I was running out of money and soon turned to cheap cider' ‘I knew I had a problem,’ said Phoebe. ‘I would watch EastEnders and the storyline when Lauren Branning was drinking and cry. ‘I knew deep down that parts of her character were like mine. I was so scared.’ And as her money started to dwindle away, Phoebe started drinking bottles of cheap cider to satisfy her habit. ‘When I was drinking cider I was spending anything between £3 and £10 a day but when I was on a massive binge I could spend £50 to £100 a night. ‘The most I’ve spent in one night is about £250 on alcohol.’ 'I knew I had a problem,' said Phoebe (pictured age six). 'I watched EastEnders and the storyline when Lauren Branning was drinking and cry. I knew deep down that parts of her character were like mine. I was so scared' On one occasion, Phoebe (pictured at 17) spent £250 on alcohol in one night . ‘The arguments between me and my family were horrendous - it got so bad they asked me to leave,’ she added. ‘I was sleeping on friend’s sofas and floors and there were times where I came very close to sleeping rough. ‘I could walk the streets until 4am before I’d find somewhere to crash.’ A couple of months later she ended up in the resuscitation room because of self-harming and excess drinking. Doctors told Phoebe that if she carried on drinking she would be dead within a few months. Phoebe (pictured at 14 with her brother, Ben) ended up in hospital as a result of her drinking and self harming . Phoebe's alcoholism meant she became extremely promiscuous and had numerous one night stands with men she didn't know . She said: ‘That was the turning point seeing how distraught and heartbroken I was making my mum, I had to stop being so selfish and think about my family.’ After a four-year battle with alcohol, in July this year, Phoebe spent ten days in a detox clinic and is starting to get her life back on track. She was told that she had a kidney infection and her body was so dependent on alcohol that to go cold turkey could have killed her. Instead she was weaned off gradually, using withdrawal medication. Phoebe (pictured at 15) has now spent time in a detox clinic and is getting her life back on track . Phoebe (pictured passed out at the age of 16) has now stopped drinking and has enrolled in college . Fortunately her body is young and will repair itself from any damage caused by the alcohol, but if she drinks again she could risk overdose. Now Phoebe is back at home and has started an acting course at her local college. She hopes to use her experiences to help other young addiction sufferers. ‘Everyone thinks it’s old men that drink and get an addiction,’ she said. ‘But it’s so accessible and can quickly become a problem to young people too. ‘I’m looking forward to the year ahead and putting all my energy into making my family proud of me,’ she added. ‘I’m taking one day at a time but I’m loving it.’ If you are concerned that you, or someone you know, has a problem with alcohol, visit the Addaction website.","Phoebe Haffenden started drinking at 15 and was addicted by 16 .

The ex-wife of an Englishman who killed his two children had ‘regularly fought’ him having custody, it emerged today. Julian Stevenson, 47, was arrested on Saturday after the bodies of Mathew, 10, and Carla, five, were found in his apartment in a suburb of Lyon, eastern France. He is said to have slit their throats in a fit of rage before fleeing on a pair of roller-skates. France’s judicial authorities are now trying to establish why Stevenson, who had a history of violence and alcoholism, had been left in charge of the children over the weekend. See the CCTV below . Julian Stevenson, accused of killing his two children in Lyon, France, seen on CCTV footage taking the children, Mathew, 10, and Carla, 5, to the bakers to buy sweets hours before their deaths . They had been dropped off with Stevenson at the former family home on Friday evening - the first time he had been allowed unsupervised access in two years because of a bitter custody battle . His wife Stephanie was badly beaten up by him in 2005 and 2010, when an order was made preventing Stevenson seeing the children without a third party adult being present. Yet CCTV footage shot at a bakery on Saturday shows Stevenson in sole custody of his son Mathew, 10, and five-year-old daughter Carla, five, as he buys them sweets. The 2010 order was said to have been reversed over the past few weeks, meaning Stevenson was allowed to have the children to stay on Friday night for the first time in three years. ‘We need to know why this happened,’ said a judicial source. ‘Interviews with the mother make it clear that she had regularly fought him having care of the children. ‘She is still in a state of extreme shock, and is being cared for by clinical psychologists, and as well as family and friends.’ Yesterday Stevenson was formally placed under criminal investigation and is likely to be remanded  in custody until his trial. Another judicial source said: ‘We are presently holding back from the charge of premeditated murder but this could always change.’ The source said all the circumstances surrounding the horrific crime would be investigated over many months. Stevenson was arrested after the children's bodies were found in the apartment, their throats slit. Yesterday he appeared before a judge, accused of their murder . The children, clutching balloons, can be seen outside the shop window arriving with their father . The children appear to be looking around the cake shop excitedly as their father walks behind them . Julian Stevenson appeared relaxed as he ordered a baguette, casually dressed in flip-flops, camouflage Bermuda shorts and a light sweater . The 47-year-old, originally from Cheltenham, even waved goodbye to staff as his children followed him out of the store in a suburb of Lyon . Neighbours of Stevenson said he had appeared ‘calm and relaxed’ as he wandered around the St Priest suburb of Lyon, where he lives, with the two children on Saturday morning. ‘It was a warm day and he was in T-shirt and long shorts,’ said one. ‘The children were smiling happily, and appeared to be enjoying a day out with their dad. ‘He was buying them little presents, including sweets, and did not appear in the least bit flustered.’ When Mrs Stevenson, an accountant’s assistant also in her 40s, returned to pick up the children from the second floor apartment at around 5pm on Saturday she saw Stevenson looking ‘panicked and angry’, according to a neighbour. ‘He was in the stairwell of the block, and his clothes were covered in blood,’ said the neighbour. ‘He made off on a pair of roller-skates, leaving his car in the apartment block’s garage.’ Following a short manhunt, Stevenson was found in Lyon’s 8th arrondissement at around 8pm on the same evening. A judicial source said that a knife which was thought to be the murder weapon had been found in the flat. The source said the double murder was ‘clearly linked to a painful separation’ and ‘legal procedures concerning the right to access to the children which the father deemed insufficient.’ Stevenson has been living in France for 10 years and married in 2005. His wife was finally heard by prosecutors on Sunday, providing them with details of her troubled relationship with her ex-husband. Investigators were particularly keen to know who gave the father legal authority to look after the children.

A monster tuna fish has been caught off the coast of Scotland and took a whole crew of fishermen to reel it in. Skipper Angus Campbell and his crew, Chris Gunn and James Morrison, were left exhausted as they battled for an hour to land the nine-foot fish. After hooking the 515lb tuna ten miles west of Leverburgh, the trio had to take it in turns to try and pull it aboard, leaving their equipment badly damaged. We're going to need a bigger boat: Angus Campbell and his crew (pictured) with the 515lb Atlantic Bluefish tuna they caught off the coast of Scotland . The mammoth catch came after a three week fishing expedition around the coast of the Outer Hebrides. They had also landed another tuna which weight in at around 400lbs, but let it go. Mr Campbell said: 'They were exhausted by the end of it - the rod was bent double. Iâ€™ve known for years they were there and today we finally proved it. 'We had a smaller one but let it go. I am planning to try and catch more. We will be going back but keeping the location secret.' Experts have claimed that Atlantic Bluefin Tuna are becoming increasingly common in the waters around Scotland due to rising sea temperatures . The crew of Kilda Cruises now plan to chop up the tuna and share it out amongst their friends. Mr Campbell adds: 'We are not allowed to sell this tuna so we will cut it up and give it to friends. We already have had plenty of offers. 'We are trying to market fishing trips so this has helped top that. We used a special lure to catch the tuna - it obviously works.' Atlantic Bluefin tuna are torpedo shaped and their streamlined bodies can travel up to 43 miles per hour. Experts have warned that they could become more common than cod in the waters around Scotland because of rising temperatures. Bluefin tuna can exceed 990lbs and are highly prized on the Japanese sushi market.","Fisherman Angus Campbell and his crew struggled to reel in the monster fish for over an hour .

She began suffering with crippling arthritis five years ago and has already had three knee replacement operations on her left leg. She has also had three operations cancelled by North Manchester General. Elaine Denton, 52, from Clayton, Manchester, is in a row with her hospital trust because they refuse to allow her to have her leg amputated .

I have two grand kids I can't play with. It's getting me down so much.' Elaine, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, has just been told she now has the condition in her right leg.

A mild-mannered company director from Peterborough has received hundreds of abusive tweets from people who confused him with the paedophile rock singer Ian Watkins. Unsuspecting businessman Ian Watkins, 56, was lucky enough to take the username @ianwatkins when he joined the social networking site. But despite being deluged with abuse since the Lostprophets singer of the same name was convicted of child sex offences, Mr Watkins has kept the username - and even replied politely to his attackers. Innocent: Peterborough businessman Ian Watkins, left, has been deluged with tweets which wrongly call him a paedophile after the Lostprophets singer of the same name, right, was jailed for 35 years for child sex offences . Mix-up: Some of the abusive tweets received by innocent company director Ian Watkins from Peterborough . Abuse: One user wrongly called the 56-year-old company director a 'f****** twisted pedophile' [sic] . Several users, including @steviejane_, did not initially grasp what Mr Watkins was saying and attacked him further . The tide of offensive messages continued despite him putting 'Not from the Lost Prophets' in his biography and creating hashtags such as #checkthebio, #shouldhavegonetospecsavers and #engagebrainb4usingkeyboard. He repeatedly pointed his attackers to the Lostprophets singer's account, which is @ian_watkins. To one user who called him a 'vile person', he replied: 'I thought I was pretty decent.' To another who said he should change his account name, he said: 'Why? Because there's some jerks out there? They need to grow up.' And when one user said he should die, the businessman replied: 'I'm all in favour of not dying. Have lots left to do. Did you mean @ian_watkins? :-)' Many users apologised once they realised their mistake, but others misunderstood and accused the innocent businessman of 'trying to pin your sick, deprived [sic] crimes on other people.' Anger: Many users assumed @ianwatkins was the Lostprophets singer tweeting from prison - it wasn't . Attack: This user referred to the Lostprophets singer's 35-year term and his catchphrase 'megalolz' Online abuse: This user demanded an apology, though was one of many attackers who later apologised . Moronic: Many Twitter users congratulated Mr Watkins on being so gracious in the face of the ill-directed abuse . Salute: This Twitter user said the businessman had 'endless reserves of patience and good humour' Responding to the furore, the businessman and supporter of anti-people-trafficking campaigns, who has 326 followers, said: 'The inability to differentiate between a rock star Welshman and a slightly balding fattish bloke is beyond some people. 'The saying ""stupidity is not a handicap, park elsewhere"" always springs to mind when dealing with these people.

A German architect has been given a one-year jail term after a Los Angeles firefighter was killed tackling a blaze in his modified Hollywood Hills home. Gerhard Albert Becker, 49, is expected to serve four months of his prison sentence before being deported to Germany, after he pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter. Firefighter Glenn Allen, 61, died after being trapped under several hundred pounds of plaster when a ceiling collapsed in Becker's home during a blaze in 2011. Jailed: Architect Gerhard Albert Becker has been sentenced to one year in prison . Becker was accused of ignoring safety recommendations when he remodeled the $11 million home after it had already had safety inspections. The verdict in the case was met with disappointment by Mr Allen's family and colleagues, who say the sentence sent the wrong message to contractors. Killed in action: Firefighter Glenn Allen died after the Hollywood Hills mansion collapsed . The fire was started by a fireplace Becker had installed in the building despite it being for outside use only, the court heard. Budget cuts in Los Angeles also meant that the nearest fire house to the property, due to be used in the filming of Germany's Next Top Model, had been closed. 'It was a perfect storm, with the budget cuts and an architect who cut corners, and ultimately one of our firefighters paid the price,' Frank Lima, president of a United Firefighters of Los Angeles association, told the New York Times. The fire was so intense that it melted the sprinkler system on the roof, causing water to build up and then cause the ceiling to collapse. During the court case a firefighter recalled hearing a bang followed by an 'eerie silence' as the ceiling came down on him, NBC 4 reported. Eleven other firefighters were injured when the plaster came down, and some still suffer with emotional and physical injuries. 'Some still have some traumatic effects, memory loss, ongoing neck pain; some have nightmares. This is going to be an ongoing thing for all of us,' fire captain Kevin Mulvehill said. The courtroom also heard an impact statement from Mr Allen's widow, Melanie, who said her life had been 'ripped to shreds' by her 61-year-old husband's death. 'We had such plans for retirement, which . was so close. I know it is cliche but we looked . forward to growing old together,' her statement said. Remodelled: Becker's $11 million Hollywood Hills home was due to be used in Germany's Next Top Model . Collapse: Allen was one of several firefighters trapped when a ceiling collapsed in the mansion . Firefighters had to use chainsaws to free Mr Allen, who died in hospital five days after the fire. Becker was sentenced to a year in county jail and must serve three years' probation, according to KTLA. Los Angeles Fire Department reacted to the verdict in a statement that read: 'Today’s guilty verdict in the case of . Gerhard Becker, should send a clear message and warning to those who try . to circumvent those codes'","Blaze started by outdoor fireplace that had been fitted inside mansion .

Just before Christmas: Aaron Hernandez spent the holiday behind bars, but he flashed a grin during his most recent court appearance December 23 . An uncle of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was legally drunk and possibly high on drugs when he died last year in a freak accident, police say. Robert Valentine's toxicology report came back positive for both alcohol and cocaine after he crashed a scooter early in the morning August 3 in Mr Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, he was also wearing sunglasses. Mr Valentine's blood alcohol level was 0.19 per cent, more than double the legal limit, the Hartford Courant said, citing a police report. The combination of alcohol, drugs and sunglasses in the dark led investigators to conclude Mr Valentine, 49, was operating the scooter 'in a negligent manner' when the deadly crash occurred in the dark. The accident ejected Mr Valentine, who neglected to wear a helmet, from the vehicle, causing him to sustain the critical head injury that caused his death, according to the report. Mr Valentine's death is one of many twists and turns met by authorities investigating the shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, a Boston . resident who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend . Mr Hernandez is charged with murder in connection with Mr Lloyd's death - three people close to him have mysteriously died since the former Patriot was jailed. Thaddeus Singleton III, who is married to a cousin of Aaron Hernandez, died in June car crash. He was found to have had Cocaethylene, Cocaine, Phencyclidine, Benzoylecgonine and Oxycodone in his system, according to a police report cited by the Bristol Press. Tabitha Perry, who has a child with Mr Singleton, survived the crash but was found dead last month in a Southington, CT, apartment. That death is still under investigation, according to the Courant. All three were due to talk to investigators about Mr Hernandez's involvement in the Odin Lloyd case.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney will run against Wyoming's senior U.S. senator in next year's Republican primary, her campaign said Tuesday. Liz Cheney, 46, is the elder of Dick Cheney's two daughters. Her announcement is a political challenge unlike anything Wyoming has seen for years, maybe decades. Republicans in the state rarely challenge incumbents of their own party in national office. All three members of the state's congressional delegation and all statewide elected officials are Republican. Republican battle ahead: Liz Cheney has announced she will run against Wyoming's senior U.S. senator Mike Enzi in next year's Republican primary . Liz Cheney is married and has five children. She hasn't been a longtime Wyoming resident but she and her husband bought a home in the posh northwest Wyoming community of Jackson Hole last year. 'I am running because I know, as a mother and a patriot, we can no longer afford simply to go along to get along. We can't continue business as usual in Washington,' Cheney said in a statement. Meanwhile, apparently aware that Cheney's announcement was imminent, Sen. Mike Enzi announced his bid for a fourth term. He made the announcement more than six months earlier in the political cycle than he has in the past. Enzi said he would continue to 'do the job I was already elected to do.' Up for the race: Republican Senator Mike Enzi, hasn't said yet whether he will seek re-election to the Senate, but Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has said she's prepared to challenge him in the 2014 Republican primary . 'Working behind the scenes - this is what I have been doing since I was elected and this is what needs to be done,' he said by email through his spokesman. The race promises to be hard-fought. Enzi has had few serious Democratic opponents - much less Republican ones - and remains well-liked as an affable former shoe salesman and mayor of the coal-mining city of Gillette. Enzi takes pride in keeping a lower profile and remaining much less partisan than most of his colleagues. He often refers to his '80-20' rule - that opposing parties usually can agree on 80 percent of the details of any given issue - as a model for Republicans and Democrats to work together. Enzi handily won re-election in 2008 with more than 75 percent of the vote. Battle looms:  Mr. Enzi, 69, says he is not ready to retire, and many Republicans say he has done nothing to deserve being turned out. Some critics have said if Liz Cheney runs, it will bring about 'the destruction of the Republican Party of Wyoming . The tradition continues: Dick Cheney was Vice President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. Now his daughter Liz Cheney, 46, will run against Mike Enzi, a popular three-term incumbent, in the 2014 Republican primary . Cheney's interest in the seat has been an open secret for months, dating back at least to last year's purchase of a Wilson home listed for $1.9 million. She appeared onstage with her father at last year's state Republican Party convention. It was Dick Cheney's first public appearance since he underwent a heart transplant, and father and daughter have been working on a book together. Since then, Liz Cheney has made frequent appearances at county-level Republican events in virtually every corner of the state. The Cheneys are well-established as a family with Wyoming roots - an important qualification for anybody seeking major office in the state. Her announcement release pointed out that the Cheney family goes back more than 100 years in Wyoming. Liz Cheney was born in Madison, Wisconsin. Running for office: Liz Cheney, 46 has been in the public eye in recent years as a Fox News political commentator. Last year, Cheney and her husband bought a home in the posh northwest Wyoming community of Jackson Hole . Liz Cheney has been in the national public eye in recent years as a Fox News political commentator. 'Anybody can get in the race that wants to get in the race. There's at least one person that's trying to get me to retire,' Enzi said earlier this month at a constituent meeting in Pine Bluffs. He declined to say who he was referring to. 'No, people can judge who they think that is themselves,' he said. Alan K. Simpson, a former U.S. Senator from Wyoming and a longtime observer of state politics, said Tuesday he couldn't comment on what the race would mean for the Wyoming Republican Party. 'Right now, I have nothing to say at all except one thing, I deeply care about both of them, and that's all I have to say,' Simpson said of Enzi and Cheney. Cheney holds a law degree from the University of Chicago and has worked as a lawyer for the State Department and the Agency for International Development.","Liz Cheney will challenge three-term GOP Sen.

Paving slabs bearing lyrics written by convicted paedophile Ian Watkins and laid in his home town will be torn up following complaints from disgusted residents. The words - once read with pride in a street in the singer's home town of Pontypridd, South Wales - now serve as an unwelcome reminder of the town's links to the former Lostprophets frontman, they say. Watkins, 36, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court last month to a host of sickening offences including two counts of attempted rape of a baby. Parents in the hometown of paedophile rock star Ian Watkins are calling for paving slabs bearing his lyrics to be ripped up from their high street . The disgraced Lostprophets singer allowed his lyrics to be engraved in the shopping centre pavement just months before he was arrested for 'depraved' child sex offences . The 11th-hour admissions, which have shocked and sickened fans and the general public alike, came as he was about to stand trial accused of 24 separate sex offences. And details of the singer's perverted sexual appetite have continued to emerge. Family, friends, fans and former bandmates have all spoken of their shock and horror at the despicable secret life of debauchery he led for years. Watkins will be sentenced on December 18. The 10 paving slabs transcribed with lyrics from the song Streets Of Nowhere were laid with pride in Taff Street last year. Part . of a civic regeneration project seeking to highlight the area's culture . and successes, Watkins' words state: 'Every time I walk these streets I . know they're mine.' Watkins, 36, pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court last month to a host of sickening offences including two counts of attempted rape of a baby . His words are on public display along with lyrics from Green Green Grass Of Home, a hit for Sir Tom Jones, another local. 'I think that the paving was originally put down in good faith when there was a lot of pride locally surrounding the Lostprophets,' said Labour AM Mick Antoniw. 'Since then there have been a number of concerns raised and quite a lot of shock in Pontypridd about the detail of what he did. 'This was something that was put in . place and intended for people to take pride in. The feeling is that it . should be ripped up now. 'It's . not something that the council should make a song and dance about but I . think that these pavings should be discreetly removed.' Moira . Jenkins, 53, said: 'The town was very proud of Ian and his band for . doing so well but now we just want to wash our hands of him. 'What he did was beyond sick and he should be scrubbed from the town's history. His pop lyrics 'Every time I walk these streets I know they're mine' now have a sinister double meaning after he prayed on fans and their babies . 'He doesn't deserve to sit alongside the likes of Tom Jones.' Claude Knights, chief executive of the child protection charity Kidscape, said Watkins's crimes are 'appalling' and had 'tainted' his songs. He said: 'It would be wise for the council to consider taking the slabs up. His work has been tainted.'It should be removed for the sake of the local community.' Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide. His former bandmates have turned their back on him - saying they are 'heartbroken, angry, and disgusted' at his sex crimes and have urged more of his victims to contact police.

The Senate confirmed Janet Yellen on Monday as the . first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, elevating an advocate of fighting . unemployment and a backer of the central bank's efforts to spur the economy . with low interest rates and massive bond purchases. Ms Yellen, 67, will replace Ben Bernanke, who is . stepping down after serving as chairman for eight years dominated by the Great . Recession and the Fed's efforts to combat it. Senators confirmed her by 56-26, with numerous . absences caused by airline flight delays forced by arctic temperatures around . much of the country. All 45 voting Democrats were joined by 11 Republicans in . supporting Ms Yellen, while 26 Republicans voted 'no.' She's in!: Dr. Janet Yellen speaking during her confirmation hearing of  the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee earlier this year . Vice chair of the Fed since 2010, Ms Yellen begins her . four-year term as leader of the century-old bank on Feb. 1. With the economy . rebounding from the depths of the recession but only modestly so far, many . economists expect her to focus on how to nurture growth without putting it into . overdrive, which could risk fueling inflation. 'The big debate will be when the Fed should . tighten and how much, rather than when to step on the gas pedal and how . hard,' predicted Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial . Services, who envisions a growing economy this year. Under Bernanke, the Fed has driven short-term . interest rates down to near zero and flushed money into the economy with huge . bond purchases, which it has just started to ease. Ms Yellen, a strong Bernanke . ally, has supported those policies and is expected to continue them until . concrete signs emerge of sustained improvement of the economy and job market. In a written statement, President Barack Obama said . Yellen's approval means 'the American people will have a fierce . champion' who will protect them. 'I am confident that Janet will stand up for . American workers, protect consumers, foster the stability of our financial . system and help keep our economy growing for years to come,' Mr Obama said. Lobbyists for the banking and financial services . sectors issued statements pledging to work with Ms Yellen. Both industries have . led a fight to water down restrictions imposed by Mr Obama's 2010 law overhauling . how the nation's financial system is regulated. The big moment:  U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks to members of the press as she is on her way for a vote January 6, 2014 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Janet Yellen was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 56 - 26 to become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve Board . A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Ms Yellen previously . headed the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, chaired President Bill . Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and has been an economics professor at . the University of California at Berkeley. Ms Yellen, who as an academic has focused on . unemployment and its causes, is considered a 'dove' who wants the Fed . more focused on creating jobs because unemployment is high and inflation is . low. 'Hawks' on these issues prefer a stronger emphasis on preventing . inflation. In brief debate on her nomination, Sen. Sherrod . Brown, D-Ohio, lauded Ms Yellen, who was one of the first to warn in 2007 of a . housing bubble that could burst and damage the entire economy. 'She understands how risky financial practices . deep inside the largest Wall Street banks can have a terrible and terrifying . impact on American families,' Brown said. But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, criticized . Ms Yellen for supporting the Fed's 'easy money' policies of low interest . rates and bond purchases. 'No one can deny that the risks are real and . could be devastating' if those policies continue for too long, Mr Grassley . said. Ms Yellen's GOP critics have said the Fed has inflated . stock and real estate prices by pumping money into the markets, creating . investment bubbles that could burst and wound the economy anew. Some also warn that as the Fed starts to trim its . bond holdings, it could spook financial markets, threatening the economy's . recovery by causing stock prices to drop and interest rates to rise. Last month, the Fed announced that it will start . gradually reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, trimming them . back initially to $75 billion this month and taking 'further measured . steps' as economic conditions improve. But the Fed also indicated that it will keep . supporting an economy that it considers less than fully healthy. It said it . will continue to keep interest rates low and try to boost unusually low . inflation, which can slow spending and borrowing. Before the vote: Then-Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen attending an event Dec 16 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Federal Reserve Act at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC . During her November confirmation hearing before the . Senate Banking Committee, Ms Yellen said the Fed's bond buying program has . successfully supported the economy by keeping long-term borrowing rates low. The Fed's holdings have reached $4 trillion, more . than quadruple their level before the financial crisis hit in late 2008. The U.S. economy has grown only modestly since the . Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, though it has shown encouraging . signs in recent months. Unemployment fell to 7 percent last month, down . from a recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009. The economy grew at an annual . rate of 4.1 percent from July through September and has added an average . 200,000 jobs monthly since August. President Barack Obama nominated Yellen in October . after considering selecting Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary who . had been a close Obama adviser early in his presidency. Summers withdrew after . opponents complained about his temperament and past support for bank . deregulation. Mr Obama called Ms Yellen a 'proven leader' and . hailed her frequent focus on the unemployed, saying, 'She understands the . human cost when people can't find a job.' She will be the first Fed chair newly appointed by . a Democratic president since Paul Volcker, picked by President Jimmy Carter, left . the post in 1987. Mr Clinton reappointed Alan Greenspan and Mr Obama gave Bernanke a . second term, though both were initially chosen by GOP presidents.

A New Jersey woman has filed a lawsuit claiming she's borne the brunt of a dangerous neighbors threats, intimidation and racist remarks. But instead of her neighbor, Cyndee Phoenix of Hamilton Township is suing the development company who sold her the home in October for 'knowingly concealing' her future neighbor was a 'dangerous individual.' Phoenix's suit also claims that developer Lennar Corp. directly aggravated the problem by sending Potter a letter that addressed his past behavior and made it look as if Phoenix had complained. Cyndee Phoenix, 53, accuses the home developer Lennar Corporation of failing to disclose what they knew about her neighbor in a Mays Landing, New Jersey development Kevin Elville Potter . Phoenix claims her bad experience with neighbor Kevin Elville Potter began before she'd even purchased the home, reports Courthouse News Service. Phoenix works as a community outreach director for a casino in Atlantic City and had just seen a home in nearby Hamilton Township. While she was mulling over whether or not to buy a home in a Lennar Corp.-owned planned development, Phoenix and a sale representative were approached by Potter. Potter demanded to know why he was no longer receiving community services such as landscaping. While the sales rep 'implied that Mr. Potter was no longer eligible (for) services as a result of the time that had passed since his house was purchased,' according to court papers, Phoenix says she learned after she bought the home that Potter was no longer getting services as a result of his 'aggressive, harassing and hostile interactions' with Lennar employees. Phoenix claims Lennar Corp knowingly concealed her neighbor's dangerous nature from her so that she would purchase the home . Phoenix ended up buying the home and says no sooner had she moved in then Potter began to harass her. 'He's made snide and racist comments, like, ""Go back to Atlantic City where you belong"" which is a more urban area,' Phoenix's attorney Brett Datto told ABC News. 'He blares his music loudly, takes pictures of my client's guests. He's a problem person.' The complaint claims Potter directed '""increasingly harassing' behavior toward Phoenix, going to far as to threaten her sister's life. It also states that during one confrontation, Potter became 'aggressive, hostile and kept mentioning' the letter written to him by Lennar. Phoenix says she had nothing to do with the letter but now claims it made matters a lot worse for her because Potter believed she was behind it. Damages? The home was in this Mays Landing, New Jersey housing development. Phoenix is seeking seeking damages for fraud, consumer fraud, misrepresentations and omissions . When she and her sister actually filed harassment complaints against Potter, Phoenix hired a bodyguard to protect them from her angry neighbor and even he became a target. The lawsuit says Potter 'started to confront the hired security guard by staring at him for long periods of time, calling the police on the security guard and even following the security guard for 15 miles on the Garden State Parkway.' Phoenix's complaint names Potter but not as a defendant. Phoenix says she 'is constantly living in fear' and that Lennar 'omitted material information' so that she would purchase the home. She is seeking damages for fraud, consumer fraud, misrepresentations and omissions, and violations of New Jersey's Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act.","New Jersey woman Cyndee Phoenix accuses the home developer Lennar Corporation of failing to disclose what they knew about neighbor Kevin Elville Potter .

The family of a New York real estate developer whose . body was found smoldering in a dumpster last week has increased the reward to $25,000 to find his killers. Slumlord Menachem 'Max' Stark, 39, was abducted outside his Brooklyn, New York office during a snowstorm last Thursday. His smoldering body was found in a gas station dumpster in Long Island on Friday. Stark's family held a press conference on Monday where they begged the killer of the married father of eight to come forward. Menachem 'Max' Stark (pictured) was murdered and his smoldering body found dumped at a Long Island gas station . Hiding: Security guards have been seen outside the home of Israel Perlmutter, 42, following Stark's funeral on Saturday . Brother-in-law Moses Strulowitz told the New York Post: 'We are not, as Hasidic, Orthodox Jewish people, looking for revenge.' He added: 'God will punish them no matter what happens.' Stark . was branded a slumlord and a loan shark, and was accused of running . substandard housing blocks, one of which was declared 'hazardous to . life'. Stark's business partner now appears to be fearing for his life following his colleague's violent death. Security . guards have been seen outside the home of Stark's business partner . Israel 'Sam' Perlmutter, 42, which is just blocks away from the house of . murdered Stark. Some have suggested that Stark was killed because of debts in the housing . business, which he shared with Perlmutter, after defaulting on a . $29million loan in 2008. According to the Post, Perlmutter now fears that whoever murdered Stark is coming for him and has 'loaded up with security guards' since the killing. According to the paper, 'any number of people' wanted Stark dead including nearly all of his dozens of . business associates and hundreds of tenants. Tradition: The funeral took place in Williamsburg just hours after Stark's badly burned body was found in a Dumpster on Long Island . However family members have now hit back, saying that the rumours have been created by a few people envious of Stark's success. According to the New York Daily News, Stark's brother said: 'He was a good man, and he helped everyone. 'You know how people are. They’re looking for gossip... People are jealous because he was successful.' Meanwhile a family friend suggested that Stark knew he was being watched and confided in his wife days before his death that he was feeling nervous. Hundreds of members of a Hasidic . community gathered on Saturday in Brooklyn for an emotional . funeral service honoring Stark. Somber . mourners dressed all in black came together at the Lodiner Bais . Medrash synagogue in Williamsburg to pay tribute to Stark, whose charred . remains were discovered in a dumpster on Long Island on Friday afternoon. Detectives investigating the case are finding a that Stark left a trail of unpaid contractors, ripped-off tenants and tens of millions in debts related to the 17 properties he owned in the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn, according to the Post. His tenants were also furious. His 17 buildings had received 233 complaints and 148  violations - 49 of which were still open. Many tenants told the Post his properties were infested with rodents, sometimes didn't have heat or water and had shabby interiors. 'I’ve had many conversations with him, and of course in many of those conversations I wanted to kill him myself,' Greg Hanlon, who lived in one of Stark's Greenpoint buildings, joked to the Post. In 2009, according to the newspaper, one of Stark's buildings was so rundown, the city ordered all tenants to vacate and deemed it no acceptable to live in. Kind words: Speakers talked about Stark's well-known generosity and readiness to help those less fortunate . Tenants were forced to track Stark down in order to get back the four-months deposit they had put down. 'He pretty much ripped off the whole building,' a tenant organizer, Ryan Kuonen, said. 'They kept trying to serve him, and he kept hiding from them. When he’d hear ""Are you Max Stark,"" he would take off running.' Said one detective working the case: 'He f***ed a lot of people over.' Some neighbors told police that he was also a neighborhood 'loan shark,' according to the Post. He lent thousands to friends and then demanded it back with interest. 'He's a scammer,' a source told the Post. In accordance with Jewish tradition, Stark's funeral service and burial took place just hours after police . identified the scorched body found at a Great Neck, New York, gas station as the missing real . estate developer who was forced into a van during Thursday's blizzard. During the ceremony, which was conducted in Yiddish and was frequently interrupted by ritual wailing, speakers described Stark as a pillar of the Satmar Hasidic community who was always ready to help the less fortunate with money for food and rent, The Jewish Daily Forward reported. A body was found at around 4pm on Friday in Great Neck with extensive burns. A police source told the New York Daily News that the victim was likely suffocated before his killers wrapped his body in fabric, stuffed him into a trash bin at a gas station and set fire to his corpse. Fernando Cerff, the owner of the Getty gas station on Cutter Mill Road, told the paper that Friday morning his workers were shoveling snow when they noticed smoke rising from the Dumpster. Thinking that someone had tossed a cigarette inside, they sprinkled some snow into the container. When Cerff approached the Dumpster in the afternoon, he noticed a horrible stench coming from the bin. Cerff became suspicious and called police, which immediately discovered the body amidst the trash beneath a layer of snow. This development comes as cops released dramatic surveillance footage that shows the suspects forcing Stark into a Dodge Caravan after he left his offices in Williamsburg late on Thursday evening. Hunt: Police and the Willliamsburg community are looking for clues on the light-colored Dodge minivan (circled) which Stark appears to have been bundled into . Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash. DNA Info . reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored . van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 . Rutledge Street. His wife, . Bashie, apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after . midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the . Orthodox community.

Launching her attack: Jill Kelley is now suing three government agencies and a number of officials demanding an apology for bringing her into the Petraeus scandal . Florida socialite Jill Kelley has launched a fight against the government in an effort to salvage her reputation in the wake of the scandal that brought down the head of the CIA and led to the retirement of a second four-star general. Last year, Mrs Kelley became a secondary participant in then-CIA director David Petraeus’ affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell after Mrs Kelley contacted the FBI about threatening emails she received from Broadwell. During an ensuing search of her email records, the FBI publicly announced that she had ‘inappropriate’ email conversations with General John Allen as well. Petraeus stepped down from his position at the CIA over his affair, General Allen retired, and Broadwell went into hiding. Mrs Kelley also went into hiding, but now she has spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be seemingly forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong. ‘Just because you’re stalked by a mistress doesn’t mean you are one… It’s not contagious,’ she said in an interview with The New York Times. All of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal- Petraeus, Broadwell, Allen and Kelley- were all married to other people, but Kelley claims that Petraeus and Broadwell were the only two that had a romantic relationship. Mrs Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Mark at her side, is fighting back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen. Heart of the matter: In 2012, it was revealed that former General David Petraeus, who was the then-CIA director, had an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell (seen together in 2011) Sending messages? Paula Broadwell sent Jill Kelley threatening emails while having an affair with David Petraeus and posted a cryptic Twitter message today (right) shortly after Kelley's interview was posted . At the time, an unidentified law . enforcement official said that Mrs Kelley’s hundreds emails with General . Allen were ‘sexually explicit’ but she claimed that the most salacious . remark in any of their conversations was that the Virginia-bred General . called her ‘a sweetheart’ on a number of occasions. ‘I saw the emails… I knew it was complete nonsense,’ Dr Kelley told The Times. Mrs Kelley has a number of problems with the whole situation- starting with the fact that the FBI and other government agencies looked through her emails in the first place, then the fact that they released her name to the public. She also now takes issue with the fact that they will not allow her to publicly release those emails in an effort to defend herself as she believes that they will help rehabilitate her reputation. ‘I am still suffering the consequences from the bad acts and false and untrue headlines. They created a sideshow at my expense,’ Mrs Kelley said. Big wigs: John Allen (right), who- like Petraeus (center right)- was a four-star general, also became looped in the scandal because investigators found 'inappropriate' emails between Allen and Jill Kelley . All friends: Jill Kelley and her husband Mark (center) hosted a number of parties in Tampa when David Petraeus (left) and his wife Holly (right) were stationed there in 2010 and the couples became friends . She argues that the exposure has . prevented her from moving past the scandal, saying that she still cannot . go out publicly to get groceries or attend her children’s Christmas . pageants. The scandal’s other participants have . all made slow entrances back to public life. General Petraeus is . teaching at three different universities and General Allen has become a . counsel to Secretary of State John Kerry. Even . Paula Broadwell is back on the speaker’s circuit, lending her name to . charitable causes supporting wounded veterans and getting involved in . community events in Charlotte, North Carolina. Though . she mostly leaves her public remarks to moments behind podiums at . charity events, Mrs Broadwell posted a rare and rather cryptic tweet . this morning, just hours after Mrs Kelley’s New York Times interview . went live. Sticking by one another: Mark Kelley said that he saw all of the emails that the government called 'sexually explicit' and was fine with them all, as she said the most salacious inclusion was the word 'sweetheart' Hosts: The Kelleys were figures on Tampa's military-heavy social scene but since the scandal, they say they are forced to rarely leave their house . She posted a picture of a Nelson Mandela quote, but given the substance of the matter, it seems like it may be another virtual attack on Mrs Kelley: ‘As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison.’ Mrs Kelley is sticking to clear public and legal wrangling in an effort to clear her name, suing three federal agencies and a number of FBI and Pentagon officials who she claims violated her privacy by searching her email and releasing her name. ‘People don’t understand what I went through,’ she told The Times.","Jill Kelley has spoken out about how .

In the first case of its kind in Kentucky, the court rejected Hamilton-Smith's bid and a move by the state Office of Bar Admissions to create and endorse a blanket rule that would have kept all registered sex offenders from gaining access to the bar. 'Rather, we believe the better course would be to allow any applicant for bar admission who is on the sex offender registry the opportunity to make his or her case on an individualized basis,' Chief Justice John D. Minton wrote in the December 19 opinion on Hamilton-Smith's case and the proposed rule. Hamilton-Smith, who was convicted of a . charge related to child pornography in 2007, has until January 13 to . ask the court to reconsider its decision. In an email, Hamilton-Smith . referred Associated Press questions to his attorney, who said the . reconsideration request will be filed. Nationally, . cases of felons seeking admission or re-admission to the bar are . common. But situations of registered sex offenders attempting to do so . appear to be rare. Beyond a recent rejection in Ohio and an ongoing case . in Virginia, legal experts and those who work to rehabilitate sex . offenders couldn't recall a similar situation arising in recent years. But . Shelley Stow of Reform Sex Offender Laws - a Massachusetts-based . organization that seeks to ease restrictions on offenders and promote . rehabilitation - said she wouldn't be surprised to see more cases out . there. 'It is so difficult for registrants to even get jobs and support . themselves and function day to day, let alone pursue a law career,' she . said. The . Kentucky case brings up the question of how to treat someone who has . admitted to criminal activity, wants to rehabilitate himself and serve . others, but is still monitored by law enforcement, said Hamilton-Smith's . attorney, Scott White, of Lexington. 'It's a highly stigmatized thing,' White said. Hamilton-Smith pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of matter portraying a sexual performance by a child in March 2007. He received a five-year prison sentence, which was suspended, and was required to register as a sex offender for 20 years - until 2027. Ruling: The Kentucky Supreme Court has blocked Guy Padraic Hamilton-Smith from taking the bar . After disclosing the conviction and sex offender status on his applications, Chase Law School at Northern Kentucky University and Brandeis Law School at the University of Louisville both rejected him in 2008. But the University of Kentucky College of Law accepted him in 2008 and he graduated in 2011. Hamilton-Smith later competed on the National Trial Team and National Moot Court Team, and he had a piece published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal through the University of California law school. Questionable past: Hamilton-Smith was charged in 2007 and graduated law school in 2011 . Since graduating in 2011, . Hamilton-Smith has held a non-lawyer position for Baldani, Rowland and . Richardson. The Lexington firm has filed letters in support of . Hamilton-Smith taking the bar exam, White said. But Hamilton-Smith still . has not been cleared by the Kentucky Office of Bar Admissions to take . the exam that would allow him to practice law. White called Hamilton-Smith 'a classic sex addict.' 'The . classic example is somebody who just downloads buckets of pornography,' White said. 'In that download, there just happened to be child . pornography.' In . this case, Hamilton-Smith has gone through Sex Addicts Anonymous, . despite a few admitted relapses with adult, but not child, pornography, . White said. White also said his client used law school as a redemptive and rehabilitative effort while owning up to his criminal conduct. 'He just hasn't let it define him,' White said. Elizabeth . Feamster, director and general counsel for the Kentucky Office of Bar . Admissions, did not return phone and email messages seeking comment from . AP. But in court filings, Feamster cited the seriousness of the charge . as well as Hamilton-Smith's acknowledgement of sexual addiction and . 'destructive and harmful behaviors when it comes to sex and sexuality.' Also, law school students are warned early in their legal education that behavioral issues could exclude them from being admitted to the bar, Feamster wrote. Hamilton-Smith 'was aware that he might be allowed into this profession,' Feamster wrote. For the justices, the nature of the crime defines someone lacking in the 'requisite character and fitness' to be admitted to the bar. 'Indeed, our certification could significantly mislead the public into believing that we vouch for (Hamilton-Smith's) good character,' Minton wrote. 'Consequently, a client's subsequent discovery of the registry listing could then justifiably lead him to question the value of this court's certification of the good character of those who are permitted to take the bar examination.'","Guy Padraic Hamilton-Smith, 30, has been banned from taking the bar because he is a registered sex offender .

The Supreme Court has put same-sex marriages on hold in Utah while a federal appeals court further considers the issue. The court issued a brief order on Monday morning blocking any new same-sex unions in the heavily Mormon state. It comes after an emergency appeal following the ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby last month that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage violated gay and lesbian couples' constitutional rights. More than 900 gay and lesbian couples have married since the decision. Joy: Chris Serrano, left, and Clifton Webb kiss after being married in Salt Lake City in December. The Supreme Court has put same-sex marriages on hold in Utah while a federal appeals court further considers the issue . But in papers filed last week, the state asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor to overturn it. Sotomayor handles emergency requests from Utah and other Rocky Mountain states. 'Numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah,' lawyers said in the filing. 'Each one is an affront not only to the interests of the state and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this court's unique role as final arbiter.' The high court order will remain in effect until the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decides whether to uphold Shelby's ruling. Together: Pictured last month, Cheryl Haws, right, and her partner Shelly Eyre have their photograph taken after receiving their marriage license at the Utah County Clerk's office in Provo, Utah . Judge Shelby's decision on December 20 . came as a shock to many in the state, which approved the ban on . same-sex marriage in 2004. His . decision, which came on a Friday, sent people rushing to a county . clerk's office in Salt Lake City - about 3 miles from the headquarters . of the Mormon church - for marriage licenses. The following Monday, 353 more gay and lesbian couples grabbed a license, some camping out overnight to get in line early the next morning. Nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles. The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. Decision: The Supreme Court has put the marriages on hold while a federal appeals court considers them . The church says it stands by its support . for 'traditional marriage' and hopes a higher court validates its belief . that marriage is between a man and woman. In the papers filed last week, Utah argues that children are best raised by a mother and father in a good relationship. 'On average children navigate developmental stages more easily, perform better academically, have fewer emotional disorders and become better functioning adults when reared in that environment,' it says. It insists that states have the authority to define marriage as between a man and woman. 'That . states have a powerful interest in controlling the definition of . marriage within their borders is indisputable,' Utah said in the filing.","SCOTUS has issued a temporary stop on same-sex marriages in the heavily Mormon state while federal appeals court further considers issue .

The 42-year-old managed to survive the terrifying two-and-a-half day ordeal in open water by clinging on to a wooden coffin lid he found floating nearby.

'On the lid, I was drifting and drifting ... during that period I hoped I could be picked up by any ships passing by,' he added.

Limited: British and Finnish researchers found we have limited brainpower to accommodate friendships . It is often said that you can’t have too many friends. But it seems that there is a natural limit the number of people we stay in touch with. A study found that when we make new friends, by starting a new job or going to university, we downgrade or even drop old ones. Even in today’s world when mobile phones, email and social networking sites such as Facebook make it easy to stay in contact with large numbers of people, we spend most of our time speaking to a small number of close friends and relatives. And while the friends may change, the number stays roughly the same. The British and Finnish researchers believe we may only have the brainpower to invest emotionally and mentally in a limited number of people. Oxford University researcher Felix Reed-Tsochas said: ‘Although social communication is now easier than ever, it seems our capacity for maintaining emotionally close relationships is finite. ‘At any point, individuals are able to keep up close relationships with only a small number of people, so that new friendships come at the expense of “relegating” existing friends.’ Dr Reed Tsochas asked 24 students in the final months of school to list all their friends and relatives and say how close to them they were. The pupils filled in the questionnaire twice more after starting work or going to university. They were also given free mobile phones and agreed to researchers could use their bills to work out who they called, when and for how long. Putting the two pieces of information together showed, unsurprisingly, that most people have a small circle of close friends, who they spend most of their time talking to. This inner circle is surrounded by group after group of ever more distant friends. As the volunteers’ lives changed, this overall pattern, including the number of best friends, remained roughly the same, meaning that some close friends from childhood were dropped or downgraded as new friendships were struck up. Dr Reed-Tsochas said: ‘Maybe my best friend is no longer the same person but the amount of time I allocate to my best friend is still the same.’ As we grow older we gravitate towards those we are around. The average number of best friends is five . He added that this findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that even with the advent of modern technology we are only capable of forming a limited number of true friendships. Chester University researcher Dr Sam Roberts said: ‘Our results are likely to reflect limitations in the ability of humans to maintain emotionally close relationships both because of limited time and because the emotional capital that individuals can allocate between family members and friends is finite.’ Oxford University researcher Robin Dunbar, one of Britain’s leading evolutionary biologists, said: ‘It seems individuals’ patterns of communication are so prescribed that even the efficiencies provided by some forms of digital communication are insufficient to alter them.’ Professor Dunbar has previously estimated that the human brain is capable of juggling no more than 150 friendships but only five or so of these will be very close.  And two of these can expect to be ditched when we fall in love.","British and Finnish researchers claim not enough brainpower for wide circle .

But as one political era ended, a new one began when Martin Walsh, 46, was sworn in as mayor. 'I will listen. I will learn. I will lead,' Walsh said in his inaugural address at Boston College, his alma mater. Walsh thanked Menino, who first took office in 1993, saying his 'legacy is already legend and his vision is all around us.' The new mayor is a former Democratic state representative and a onetime labor leader who called Boston a city of courage, of champions and of big dreams. He noted that he was once just a kid from the city's Dorchester neighborhood and joked that even his mother was surprised at how far he had come. Walsh outlined a series of broad policy goals, including improving public safety and ending 'senseless gun violence.' While noting that the 40 homicides in Boston last year were fewer than the year before, Walsh said the number was still too high. Legacy: Menino was praised as he left office.

A man who gained nationwide celebrity status on social media as 'Kai the hatchet-weilding hitchiker' today pleaded not guilty to a charge of killing a 73-year-old lawyer in the victim's New Jersey home in May. Caleb McGillivary, 24 - who shot to online infamy in February after a TV interview went viral - stood silent during his arraignment before Superior Court Judge Joseph Donohue. McGillivary's attorney, Union County Public Defender Peter Liguori, filed the not guilty plea to the charge of murder in the beating death of Joseph Galfy, according to Nj.com . Liguori said he could not comment on the case, but acknowledged that McGillivary is feeling better than he did shortly after his arrest. Caleb McGillvary, better known as 'Kai the hatchet-wielding hitchiker' thanks to some internet fame, has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. He is pictured here in a Facebook photo from July, which helped police arrest him thanks to his distinctive facial tattoo . Hospitalized: Caleb McGillvary, known as Kai, is . pictured here following his arrest in May. He was rushed to a hospital in . August with self-inflicted wounds following a suicide attempt. He has pleaded not guilty to murder . A YouTube video in February made Caleb McGillivary an internet star following a hitchiking incident in California. He had been picked up by a man who 'believed he was Jesus' and hit a gas station worker with his car. McGillvary subdued the man with the back of a hatchet . Victim: Lawyer Joseph Galfy Jr, 72, was found beaten to death at his New Jersey home in May. Police allege Caleb McGillvary killed him after a 24 hour rendezvous . 'He's doing better than he was a couple of months ago,' Liguori said. In July, McGillivary was rushed from the Union County jail in Elizabeth to a hospital for treatment of self-inflicted wounds following an apparent suicide attempt. He was later returned to the jail. McGillivary is suspected of beating Galfy, a partner in a Rahway law firm, in Galfy's home on May 12, about 24 hours after the two met in Manhattan's Times Square, authorities have said, following a sexual tryst. In custody: Mugshot of Caleb 'Kai the Hitchhiker' McGillvary, 25, taken after his arrest in Philadelphia . McGillivary is said to have gone to Galfy's home and stayed the night. The next day Galfy, the attorney for the Green Brook land use board, drove McGillvary to the Rahway Train station, from where the younger man left for Asbury Park. McGillvary returned to Rahway later in the day. After exchanging text messages, Galfy picked him up and brought him back to his house. Police allege the killing happened sometime that evening. The next day, Monday May 13, police went to Galfy's home after he did not show up for work or answer his phone. They found Galfy dead in his bed, wearing only underwear and socks. Authorities say McGillivary beat Galfy, then left for Asbury Park and later headed to Philadelphia with a friend. On May 14, McGillivary, who is originally from Canada, wrote a post on his Facebook page intimating he was drugged and sexually assaulted, but did not say where or when. The post read: 'what would you do if you woke up with a groggy head, metallic taste in your mouth, in a strangers house ... and started wretching, realizing that someone had drugged (and) raped ... you? what would you do.' Then-Union County Prosecutor Theodore Romankow has called those comments 'self-serving'.

Trafficking: Police in New Jersey are stepping up their efforts to curb sex trafficking ahead of February's much-anticipated Super Bowl at the Metlife Stadium in the state . Law enforcement agents in New Jersey have redoubled efforts to fight what they worry could be one of the biggest menaces to come with next month's Super Bowl: sex trafficking. Hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected to descend on New Jersey for the February 2 football game. Many believe the state's sprawling highway system, proximity to New York City and diverse population make it an attractive base of operations for traffickers. 'New Jersey has a huge trafficking problem,' said U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who is co-chairman of the House anti-human trafficking caucus. 'One Super Bowl after another after another has shown itself to be one of the largest events in the world where the cruelty of human trafficking goes on for several weeks.' Law enforcement in New Jersey has worked for years to battle forced prostitution. The state strengthened its human trafficking law in early 2013, but it hit a roadblock in August when a federal judge ruled that a portion of the law that pertains to commercial sex ads posted online may conflict with federal legislation. The state is appealing. There are scant statistics and much debate over how much sex trafficking increases during a Super Bowl or other large sporting event, but it's been enough of a concern to prompt New Jersey and previous Super Bowl host cities to pay attention to it. Scroll down for video . The MetLife Stadium: Super Bowl XLVIII will be held at the home of the New York Giants and New York Jets on Sunday 2 February . Danielle Douglas, a speaker and advocate who identifies herself as a sex-trafficking survivor, said any major sporting event attracts sex traffickers looking to make money. 'The Super Bowl is a huge, huge arena for sex trafficking,' Douglas said. Some visitors 'are coming to the Super Bowl not even to watch football — they are coming to the Super Bowl to have sex with women, and/or men or children.' Soon after the announcement that the 2014 Super Bowl would be held at MetLife Stadium, New Jersey officials set up training for legions of law enforcement personnel, hospitality workers, high school students, airport employees and others on identifying the signs of sex trafficking. Local houses of worship are handing out fliers notifying congregants of warning signs, and truckers are being trained to look for people — mostly women but also men — who may be held against their will. Sex trafficking, to be prosecuted as such, must involve — unlike prostitution — not only a buyer and seller of sex but also a pimp or trafficker controlling the transaction, according to the New Jersey attorney general's office. Officials are also warning the public to watch for people who are forced into labor and individual pimps exerting control over young women and men who are oftentimes underage. Crackdown: Representative Chris Smith(R-NJ) (left) wants to crack down on prostitution in the run up to the Super Bowl . 'We've enlisted, basically, every service provider that people coming to the Super Bowl are going to run into,' Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman said. 'There are a lot of eyes that are going to be on their activities and going to be on spotting potential victims of this crime.' The Super Bowl task force convened by Hoffman's office is composed of state, local and federal law enforcement officers, community groups, social workers and others. Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said ads are starting to pop up on Internet sites and law enforcement officials are gleaning information from them. 'When you're about ready to have 400,000 men come to this area of the country,' Molinelli said, 'you're invariably going to have more people try to take advantage of that by providing prostitutes and prostitution.' Officials in Texas, Louisiana and Indiana strengthened efforts to combat sex trafficking ahead of previous Super Bowls. In this Thursday, Dec. 19, 2013 photograph, Kathleen Friess gives a presentation on human trafficking in Hamilton Township, N.J., for hotel and nightclub employees and tries to dispel notions of what human trafficking looks like . In Arizona, which will host the 2015 Super Bowl, U.S. Sen. John McCain's wife, Cindy, has been speaking out, calling the Super Bowl the 'largest human-trafficking venue on the planet.' It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of trafficking cases in a given year or place because so much of it goes unreported. In 2012, the Polaris Project, a nonprofit that works to combat human trafficking, received 20,652 calls reporting trafficking to its hotline, 330 of which were from New Jersey, CEO Bradley Myles said. 'The overall size of the phenomenon in the United States is much more significant than statistics show,' Myles said. Polaris plans to add additional staffers to the hotline in February, but the organization has seen only a modest uptick in calls during previous Super Bowls, Myles said. In December, Kathleen Friess led a two-hour presentation in Hamilton Township for hotel and nightclub employees and tried to dispel notions of what human trafficking looks like. Often, Friess said, it's a local woman forced into sex work by a man she initially thought had romantic intentions. Other times, it's a woman from another country whose family is threatened. U.S. Sen. John McCain's wife, Cindy, has been speaking out, calling the Super Bowl the 'largest human-trafficking venue on the planet' Friess told the employees to look for women who may not be in control, who look frightened and may exhibit signs of physical abuse. Victims are often runaways, the impoverished, abuse victims or those living in the country illegally, she said. 'You guys are at that front line, seeing them coming and going,' Friess said. 'You're in a position to prevent human trafficking.' Ronald Moore, the security manager at the Grand Summit Hotel in Summit, said he plans to replicate the presentation for his staff. A former police officer, Moore said the hotel has been preparing for the possibility of crime during Super Bowl week. 'You're going to have the potential for everything from stolen goods to assault to check fraud. Everything you can imagine is going to be happening,' he said. 'You have to be aware.' Jane Wells, a filmmaker who recently released 'Tricked,' a documentary about human trafficking, said she wants law enforcement to focus on the crime all the time, not just around sporting events. 'This is a 365-day-a-year problem,' Wells said.","Police and law enforcement are stepping up their efforts to crack down on sex-trafficking ahead of the Super Bowl in New Jersey on February 2 .

Two pit bulls have mauled a homeless woman to death in Texas, before turning on the two men that came to her aid. The victims were attacked around 2am on Glen Prairie and Leonora in Southeast Houston. One of the dogs was caught immediately after the attack - described as been about one-year-old and weighing 30 pounds - and will likely be euthanized, but City of Houston Animal Control have not been able to locate the second, according to Chron. Police are yet to released the name of the deceased, but neighbors told ABC Local she was a regular in the area and in her 40s. Vicious: Authorities are trying to determine if this dog was part of an attack that killed one woman and injured at least two others in an attack in Southeast Houston . Animal control officers patrol the neighborhood where a woman was killed by two pit bulls on Sunday. One of the dogs is already in custody and will be euthanized . The woman was described as being petite and non-threatening and had been seen panhandling around dusk. One man, Osby Pineles, said he was on his way to the corner store to buy cigarettes when they saw the woman on the ground, with the two dogs pulling at her body. The 21-year-old said he tried to get the dogs off the woman but they turned on him, bloodying his legs, arms and hands. ""The dog knocked me down,"" said Pineles, who was treated at Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital. His friend, who quickly started knocking on nearby houses for help, received minor injuries. Animal control officers are working to take custody of the second dog. Its believed they have found the residence where the dog lives, but the tenant wasn't home or did not answer the door, according to ABC Local. Once properly identified, the owner could face criminal charges. An Animal Control officer speaks to residents in the Southeast Houston neighborhood where a woman was killed and two men were attacked by two pit bulls . The animal in custody lives in a nearby apartment complex and has a biting history, neighbors said. The dog does not show symptoms of rabies, but is currently under quarantine for further examination. A municipal hearing will be held to determine its fate. Neighbors say they often see dogs roaming the neighborhood and several houses carry 'Beware of dog' signs. Dog attacks killed 32 people in the U.S. in 2013. Pit bulls or pit-bull mixes were blamed for 25 of those deaths, according to DogsBite.org, a national dog bite victim group dedicated to raising awareness of the public health and safety issue. Pit bulls or pit-bull mixes were blamed for 25 of the 32 deaths resulting from dog attacks in the US last year. Seen here is an American pit bull Terrier . 'When dogs congregate in more than one or two, especially when they are allowed to roam freely, this kind of incident can occur,' Glaser said, warning of the 'pack mentality' of dogs. A 52-year-old woman was mauled by 15 mixed-breed stray dogs on a Houston street last July, he said.

As Christmas cheer starts to wear off, it seems that Brits nationwide are preparing to put their New Year's resolutions into action and make some serious life changes. Dubbed 'Massive Monday', today will see more extra-marital affairs begin to bubble and job applications written than any other day of the year. New research reveals that spending time with loved ones over Christmas, coupled with trepidation about the year ahead causes the spike in life changes. Massive Monday: As the festive cheer dwindles, today will see more affairs and job interviews than any other day of the year . 'Christmas and New Year is a week of lockdown when there is no excuse for avoiding family time. 'Marriages are often stretched to breaking point over the festive period and thousands of unhappily married people look for a new partner during this time,' claims a new study. Today is typically one of the first days back to work and back to freedom and spouses take this opportunity to explore all the things they couldn't under the watchful eye of their partner, claims the research. IllicitEncounters.com, who carried out the study, see 25 per cent higher levels of activity during this time compared with the rest of the year. Another survey by divorcedpot.co.uk found that 1.8million couples argued over the Christmas break and one in ten blamed this on the extra time spent with their partner, while one in four blamed it on the excessive alcohol consumption. Cabin fever: According to research, many couples say spending too much time with their other half led them to breaking point . As well as relationship doubts, one in three Brits want to change jobs for better job satisfaction or more money - recruiters even dub today 'Massive Monday' as CVs fly in. In the past, it was more common to have a 'job for life' and 'to work your way up the ladder' within one company or sector until it was time to retire. However, young workers aged 18-29 are twice as likely to drastically change career directions, with nearly two in three saying they have already changed careers at least once or are planning to in the near future. Career change: As well as relationship doubts, one in three Brits want to change jobs for better job satisfaction or more money . This seems to be a growing trend across generations; as opportunities for reinvention become more feasible, older workers are making changes in their careers too. More than four out of five people over the age of 50 who relaunched their career did so over the age of 40, while more than one in ten haven’t changed careers yet, but still plan to before they retire, found a study by Scottish Widows. Professor Wendy Loretto, of University of Edinburgh Business School, said: 'As people adapt to all of the factors changing our career environments - from the unstable financial climate, technological innovations, and an ageing working population - they are realising the need to be more self-reliant in achieving their ultimate aspirations, and this often means reinventing themselves to start on a new path.'

German leader Angela Merkel has returned from a Christmas and New Year break with a broken pelvis that she didn't know about. The chancellor was on a skiing trip in Engadin in Switzerland when she fell. She thought she suffered only bruises but a medical examination when she returned to the German capital Berlin showed she had actually broken a bone. Mishap: Chancellor Merkel, pictured while skiiing at the resort in the Engadine valley of Switzerland on December 22, broke her hip during a fall . Doctors told her she will have to rest for the next three weeks while the injury heals. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said said: 'She suffered serious bruising in connection with a partial fracture on her left posterior pelvic ring. 'We understand she was going at slow speed on a cross-country ski course when the accident occurred.' Although she can walk unaided she has been instructed she cannot travel by plane and must lie down as much as possible for the next three weeks. She will have to cancel a planned visit to Poland and a meeting with the Luxembourg Prime Minister in Berlin. Out of action: Angela Merkel, pictured during . her skiing trip to St Moritz on December 22, fell at 'low speed' according to her spokesman who said will spend the next few weeks . recovering . On holiday: The 59-year-old politician, pictured during her trip to St Moritz before Christmas accompanied by two bodyguards, suffered a pelvis injury during a fall . But she will be able to attend the first cabinet meeting of the new coalition government she leads on Wednesday. 'It goes without saying that as chancellor, she is capable of acting as well as communicating fully,' added Seibert. Mrs Merkel had already suffered her injury by the time Michael Schumacher endured his catastrophic accident in France. The . seven times Formula One world champion remains in an induced coma in . hospital in Grenoble, France, where he has undergone two operations to . remove blood clots and relieve pressure on his brain. Critical: Seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher suffered a serious head injury while skiing in the French Alps resort of Meribel . Schumacher's family have given . investigators the mini Go-Pro camera which was attached to his ski . helmet and may contain crucial footage of the moment he lost control and . hit his head on a rock. Today it emerged Schumacher made a will to distribute his £750million cash, cars and property empire among his wife and two children just three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink of death. Back in 2010 he admitted that he made a will for the first time, telling a German magazine: 'Yes, I have made my testament because I am a family man. But it is less about Formula One but because of the things that can happen in everyday life.' That premonition of 'everyday life' came sadly true on December 29 last year when he smashed his head on to a rock while skiing at the French resort of Meribel. Danger: This picture shows the off-piste Ski Area in Meribel where Michael Schumacher was seriously injured after hitting his head on a rock . The will, he said, 'covers all those who are important to me'. On Sunday his father Rold and brother Ralf were among the close family visitors at his bedside in Grenoble's University Hospital. German media reported that a brain scan on Friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend. Speculation is mounting that French prosecutors may be preparing charges against the operators of the piste where Schumi came a cropper. Vigil: Michael Schumacher's father Rolf, left, and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital, French Alps, on Sunday where the former seven-time Formula One champion is being treated after sustaining a head injury during a ski accident . Attorney Maurice Bodecher -  a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law and formerly Chief Judge of the French of Ski Federation until 2010 - has been retained by the piste management. If any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the Schumacher family. The main question, according to German media, is whether the scene of the accident - full of rocks of the type that Schumi collided with - was properly marked.","Doctors told Angela Merkel the injury was an 'incomplete' bone fracture .

But now the agency appears to have finally made its new priority official by quietly updating its mission statement. The bureau's fact sheet has now replaced its decades-long 'primary function' of 'law enforcement' with 'national security' to reflect reforms that have taken place over the last 12 years. The timing of the change, apparently made last summer, has prompted speculation by analysts that it has been influenced by the political climate. Now in black and white: The FBI has changed its fact sheet to replace its primary function of 'law enforcement' with 'national security' to finally reflect reforms made since the September 11 attacks . FBI historian and Marquette University professor Athan Theoharis pointed to the negative publicity the agency received after failing to prevent the Boston marathon bombings in April last year. Meanwhile, Washington-based national security lawyer Kel McClanahan, who noticed the altered fact sheet last month, said the rebranding could bring the agency more power and money. He told Foreign Policy: 'If you tie yourself to national security, you get funding and you get exemptions on disclosure cases. 'You get all the wonderful arguments about how if you don't get your way, buildings will blow up and the country will be less safe.' Political decision? One observer pointed out that the change comes after the negative publicity the agency had received for failing to prevent the Boston marathon bombings (above) in April last year . McClanahan spotted the change in a . Freedom of Information Act response from the agency, each of which is . accompanied by the fact sheet. Between . 2001 and 2009, the FBI has doubled the number of agents dedicated to . counter-terrorism, according to a Inspector General report. Conversely, that period has seen a decline in the number of criminal cases investigated nationally, particularly white-collar crimes. Times of change: The FBI's headquarters in Washington DC. The bureau has doubled the number of agents dedicated to counter-terrorism, leading to accusations that other law-enforcement areas are suffering . The changes last month prompted criticism from Robert Holley, the special agent in charge in Chicago, who said he was being hampered in his efforts to combat violent crime that is rife in the city. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the timing of the change. But he told Foreign Policy: 'When our mission changed after 9/11, our fact sheet changed to reflect that... so it is certainly accurate to say our primary function is national security.'","Fact sheet altered in the summer of last year, says national security lawyer .

Gwen Goodwin, 52, claims in court documents that City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito used campaign and political cash to help fund an art project that targeted Goodwin's apartment with bad juju. 'This intimated me and caused me fear. I’m a Christian. I don’t believe outside my religion, but strange things were happening,' Goodwin told the New York Post. Mark-Viverito, who represents the East Harlem and Upper East Side neighborhoods of the city and is almost certain to be named City Council Speaker, clobbered Goodwin in the 2009 Democratic primary - a race in which Goodwin collected just 12percent of the vote. Threat? Gwen Goodwin, left, claims her 2009 political opponent, City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, right, put a voodoo hex on her . The colorful mural of a rooster's head was painted on Goodwin's East 100th Street building as part of a project called Los Muros Hablan - 'the walls speak' - that was meant to showcase Hispanic art around the city. 'In the Caribbean culture, this constituted a curse and a death threat,' Goodwin alleges in court papers.

Goodwin told the Post: 'This is supposed to be a professional politician who came and graffitied the side of my building,' 'I really felt that people needed to understand who they were giving power to as the next most powerful person behind the mayor of New York City.' Mark-Viverito brushed off the accusations. 'These desperate and ­ridiculous allegations by a failed political opponent of Melissa are false, absurd and a waste of the court’s precious time. It’s sad but expected that Melissa’s ­opponents are resorting to these kinds of tactics,' a spokesman told the Post.

'With everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad. 'We all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. Green smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak. Perhaps most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy, this is hugely important. Smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.' Miranda and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. Combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy. Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices . Juicing or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems. Green smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness. The spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home. Freshly juiced fruits should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar content.  Blend the below ingredients, adding the water first.•    600ml mineral water (still) •    ½ chopped cucumber (skin & pips included) •    ¼ peeled avocado •    1 chopped celery stick •    Juice of ½ lemon or lime •    ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt •    Sun chlorella ‘A’ tablets: initially starting off with 5 tablets for the first three days, moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 tablets herein after. •    Small double handful (60-80mg) of mixed green leaves from the following (they can be combined): spinach, watercress, rocket, savoy cabbage, chard, lettuce, chicory, kale, bok choy, sprigs of mint, parsley, coriander, basil.","Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley are fans of the £500 Vitamix .

A 9-year-old girl was badly injured on Tuesday when a mule kicked her directly in the head. The young Emma Johnson was unconscious but breathing when firefighters arrived on Green Drive near Canton in Cherokee County Atlanta, Georgia. Emma and her mother were attempting to lure two wayward mules into their neighbor's empty pasture until they could find the mules' owner. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The mules had somehow managed to escape from their fenced-in enclosure . Emmas's neighbor Thomas Ross witnessed the unfortunate event and helped Emma's mother call 911 . Emma's mother carried a bucket of feed in attempt to lead the mules and Emma followed closely behind her. When Emma got a little too close to the back of one of the mules, it kicked her, said the girl's neighbor Thomas Ross. 'She’s 9 years old and she’s familiar with horses, but these were large mules,' said Thomas Ross to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late Tuesday. Ross told the girl's mother to call 911 as soon as he saw the kick. Emma's mother dropped her phone, so Ross was the one who gave the 911 operator information about Emma and what seemed to be a serious head wound. 'She probably didn’t think a thing about it,' Ross said. 'She was running and carrying a plastic feed bucket.' The paramedics took Emma to a church where she was airlifted via helicopter to the hospital. Investigators are trying to discover how the mules managed to escape their enclosure. They believe rain may have washed away part of the fence which allowed the mules to escape. The owner of the mules, Tim Byess, will not face criminal charges. He feels badly about the injury and said, 'a mule aint worth nothin'. A life is worth everything.' 'She’s a little jewel, she really is,' neighbor Thomas Ross said. 'I hope she pulls through.' Tim Byess feels bad about the incident and said that a little girl's life is worth more than a mule's anyday .","Emma Johnson, 9, got kicked in the head by a mule when she and her mother were trying to lure the mules to a pasture find their owner .

'We had just opened the pool and a lap swimmer said they didn't want to alarm me but there was a small crocodile swimming beside them in the pool,' he said. 'I jumped in with the pool scoop to get him out but then there were two, then three, then four and five. It is not every day you find little crocodiles swimming around.' But since then one of the young crocodiles has died after being found in the scorching sun. Reptile handler Gavin Lawrence said what started as a harmless prank ended up killing one of the reptiles. 'It’s annoying they’ve dumped them in the pool,' he told The North West Star. 'The chlorine is no good for them and at the end of the day it’s sort of reckless.' Mrs Rodriquez said she suspected the baby crocodile succumbed to the heat. Mr Rodriquez said he believed the reptiles were dumped in the pool by a group of pranksters. He said CCTV footage showed a group of people loitering out the front shortly before the crocs were spotted in the water. Mr Rodriquez evacuated the pool while he madly tried to catch the four-week-old creatures. 'Some of them were quite fast and didn't want to be caught,' he said. 'It was quite entertaining actually, only because nobody got hurt.' The remaining reptiles were put in a tank and kept at the pool overnight. They were tadpoles for dinner last night and tonight Mr Lawrence will safely release them at Moondarra Lake when it gets dark.","Nine baby freshwater crocodiles found swimming in Mount Isa Aquatics pool .

Mary Beard has weighed into the debate over Prince William studying at Cambridge University by saying he should use the opportunity to meet ordinary students. The Cambridge classicist and TV presenter said it would give the second in line to the throne a chance to learn about those who fear falling into debt or failing to see their hard work translate into successful careers. Her intervention follows anger over the decision to allow William to take a bespoke course in agricultural management even though he achieved an A, B and C in his A-levels – grades described as mediocre by the university newspaper. Debate: Mary Beard (left) said Prince William will get to learn about the modern struggles of undergraduates . Some students claimed William was getting a free pass and said it gave the impression that he was accepted because he was ‘posh and rich’. Cambridge normally requires an A* and two As from would-be undergraduates. The university pointed out that different admission rules apply for William’s agricultural course, and that he already has a degree, from St Andrews. Yesterday Professor Beard told the Daily Mail: ‘I very much hope that he will take the opportunity to meet some of our more “ordinary” students, struggling with making ends meet, worried about careers, future and debt.’ The academic has become Britain’s best-known classicist after presenting several BBC historical documentaries, mainly on the Romans. She has also spoken out on a range of subjects, including internet trolls who posted nasty comments about her looks. Back to school: The second in line to the throne will start his bespoke agriculture course this week . Her remarks follow research which shows students will run up £45,000 of debt on average during a three-year course. Many also face uncertainty in the jobs market and will struggle to save for a home as they try to pay off what they owe. William, 31, who has a geography degree from St Andrews University, starts a £10,000 ten-week course this week to give him an understanding of issues surrounding farms and rural communities. University newspaper The Tab ran an article last week which said: ‘Normally, students need A*AA at A-level to gain entry to Cambridge University, while the prince only achieved a mediocre ABC.’ Melissa Berrill, who graduated in French and German last year, said William had been given a ‘free pass’ which was ‘an insult to every student, whatever their background, who got into Cambridge by getting the required A-level or degree results’. Natural sciences student Tim Squirrell said he feared the public would ‘assume that he’s been let in simply because he’s posh and rich’. Time apart: William will spend week days living in Cambridge away from his wife and five-month-old son . Other students could not wait for William to arrive, however, with one describing it as ‘the most exciting news ever’. Cambridge academics also defended William. Professor David Abulafia, of the Faculty of History, said: ‘One of the functions of a great university is to educate some of those who are destined for leadership.’ William’s course, run through the university’s School of Technology, will involve around 20 hours of lectures, seminars and meetings each week, as well as study at home and field trips. A university spokesman said: ‘A*AA is our standard offer for undergraduate admission. The Duke of Cambridge has already undertaken his undergraduate studies, at St Andrews. ‘He is not attending as an undergraduate or as a mature student. He is attending Cambridge to complete an executive education programme, for which different admissions criteria apply.’","Mary Beard urged chance for prince to see struggles of modern young .

But . the first time he held his new grandson, Jasper Michael Brown Quintana, . the former leader of Gotham appeared slightly more at home. 'He didn’t drop him!' Miss Bloomberg said in an exclusive interview with the New York Post on Sunday. 'He didn’t choke up or cry,' she continued, 'he was just very happy and thought Jasper was adorable. 'I’ve . said in the past that my dad isn’t good around kids, but I guess when . it’s your own flesh and blood, it comes more naturally.' Shortly after little Jasper was born, her powerful father arrived at New York-Presbyterian Hospital carrying a bouquet of flowers and a gold charm bracelet for his daughter. 'He picked it out himself,' Miss Bloomberg, a 30-year-old professional horsewoman and animal rights activist, told the paper.

'Having a baby is something I’ve . always wanted and I’m obviously going to do as much for him myself as I . possibly can.' Georgina's decision to have a baby out of wedlock with her 36-year-old Argentinian-born boyfriend raised eyebrows amongst her friends and family, but she says people have accepted her non-traditional family situation, noting that becoming pregnant was 'a surprise' 'It was a happy surprise, something that we both wanted and were ready for,' she says.

'I was careful and chose horses which were less prone to anything . happening.' Georgina, it should be noted, is hoping to land a spot on the 2016 Olympic equestrian team. While she and Quintana share an apartment in the posh Central Park West section of New York, the young heiress spends the majority of her time at her farm Upstate and at her estate in Florida.

'At the same time, I’m not really sure I’m the sort of person who would want that either. We’re both very independent.' The couple has no plans to marry, Georgina says, and she received no pressure from her family to tie the knot after she became pregnant. 'By now, my family has gotten used to the idea that I do things my own way,' she says. 'I love the idea of being with one person for the rest of your life, but I don’t think you need a piece of paper to do that.'","Georgina Bloomberg, 30, gave birth to her son Jasper on Christmas Eve .

Well-wishers hoping to meet the Queen were again left disappointed yesterday after she chose not to accept flowers for the second week in a row. A crowd of around 250 had hoped they would be in luck after she broke with the tradition last week. Sienna Wheeler, eight, who is in a wheelchair after a hip operation, had travelled to St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, with her sister Imogen, ten, and grandfather David Branton, 69. Sienna Wheeler, 8 (in the chair), and her sister Imogen look on at the Queen's car as it leaves . The Queen doesn't accept flowers from wellwishers for the second week running as she attends church . She  said: ‘I don’t really mind that I could not give her my flowers. It was just a lovely to see her.’ The Queen broke with tradition last week by declining to accept flowers from children as she left morning service at St Mary Magdalene church. Around a dozen children including a girl in a wheelchair had hoped that she would have a change of heart and hopefully turned up with flowers today. But police officers monitoring the crowd told the youngsters that the Queen would still not be accepting them. Sienna's father: 'We brought flowers along, but the Queen didn't take them... We don't want a sob story' Her Majesty leaves church on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk without taking flowers today . The Queen, who was dressed in a beige . coat and matching hat, instead came straight out of church and was . driven away in her maroon Bentley, accompanied by her cousin Lady Mary . Colman. Some children left . their bouquets in a pile outside the 13th century church after police . said the flowers would be taken to Sandringham House later. Other . youngsters handed their floral gifts to guests of the Queen who were . walking the 600m back to Sandringham House with Prince Philip. One of the Royal guests who accepted flowers told the child's mother: 'I am sorry. It is a great disappointment.' Elizabeth Quintrell, 72, waited three hours in the cold with her great-granddaughters Kiera Quintrell, eight, and Megan Radford, six, only to be told that the girls would not be allowed to hand over their flowers. Mrs Quintrell of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said: 'It was a great shame. There were only a few children here with bouquets so it would not have taken very long. 'I brought the two girls to Sandringham House in the summer and they saw the place where the Queen has her Christmas tree. 'I told them we would come back over Christmas and they might be able to give her some flowers and they had been looking forward to it. A little boy watches the Queen leave last week, as he clutches a bouquet he had hoped to give her . 'We made some special bouquets with red, white and blue flowers and I got them up at 6.30am so we could drive over. 'It was quite disappointing to be told that the Queen would not be taking flowers personally, but I suppose if I was her age, I probably wouldn't want to do it either.' Sienna Wheeler, eight, of Bury St . Edmunds, Suffolk, who was in a wheelchair after a hip operation last . month was also told that she would not be able to hand over flowers to . the Queen.

Branton of Spalding, Lincolnshire, said: 'We did bring some flowers . along, but the Queen didn't take them. We were told to leave them and . the girls were happy with that. 'We don't want a sob story. The girls were just thrilled to see the Queen and they were warned that there was a chance that he Queen might not accept the bouquets.' Veteran Royal watcher Mary Relph said she thought the Queen's tradition of accepting flower outside church had now 'finished'. Speaking outside the church, she added: 'I don't want to say anything about it.' The Bishop of Rochester, the Right Rev James Langstaff, preached at the service today before joining the Queen at Sandringham House. Last week Buckingham Palace dismissed suggestions that the Queen was not accepting flowers as she did not want to be late for lunch.

Jailed: Rhiann Burnie from Burnley, Lancashire has been sentenced to two years and eight months . A young mother who left her boyfriend fighting for his life after she stabbed him for not calling her while on a night out has been jailed. Rhiann Burnie, 21, punched bricklayer Shane McMullen, 23, then knifed him in the shoulder when he returned from a night out with friends. She then casually lit up a cigarette while standing over his blood-soaked body. Despite the wound, which severed a major artery . and caused significant blood loss, Mr McMullen survived - but has . suffered memory loss and has nightmares of being stabbed again. Burnie who had a reprimand and a caution for battery on her criminal record admitted wounding and was jailed for two years and eight months. Sentencing, Recorder Andrew Long told Burnie: 'You sometimes deliberately set out to be confrontational with him. 'Throughout all of this, Mr McMullen never used violence against you, which in the circumstances was extraordinarily restrained, given the provocation. 'I am satisfied you were well aware you had caused him serious injury. 'Rather than offer him help or call an ambulance, you lit and smoked a cigarette. It’s clear Shane was close to death and only the skill of the medical team which operated on him saved his life.' 'He continues to suffer physical and psychological effects from what you did and is likely to do so for some considerable time.' Burnley Crown Court was told the couple had been in a relationship for a year and initially were 'happy and healthy' yet a 'darker, more sinister side' of Burnie's character emerged. Burnie had on two previous occasions turned on him with a knife with Mr McMullen having to wrestle it off her. Mr McMullen lied at work about a black eye Burnie had given him, but never thought she was capable of using a knife and would often leave the house to let her cool down. She had also smashed doors and furniture during heated arguments and had revealed she had been advised to attend anger management courses. Happier times: Shane McMullen with partner Rhiann Burnie, who stabbed him with a knife after he failed to call her every two hours while on a night out . Rachel Woods, prosecuting, added: 'She revealed a different side of her character, a volatile side, an aggressive side, an unpredictable side where she would lose her temper and damage the property and furniture, doors, in a fit of rage. 'No sooner would she blow up she would calm down. In flashes of temper the knife would come out and then matters would calm down - Mr McMullen had little realisation what lay ahead.' Mr McMullen saw the previous threats as empty and never thought she was capable of using a knife. He would often leave the house to let her cool down. Miss Woods added: 'It is quite apparent that she was very keen to know exactly what he was up to that evening. She had run out of credit on her own mobile phone and so she kept his so that they could continue contact throughout the evening. Violent: Rhiann Burnie and her partner had been happy in their relationship, but a 'darker side' of the young mother emerged . 'He telephoned her and spoke to her before he went to the party, not causing any difficulty at that stage. He made the error of not keeping in contact with the defendant.' The court heard Mr McMullen arrived at Burnie's home in Burnley after the function and she was said to be 'not best pleased'. She was so annoyed she punched him in the face fracturing his nose and leaving him with a black eye. She then went to the pub and continued drinking at a friend's house before returning home at around 3am. On arriving back she taunted Mr McMullen, telling him that she had been with another man. He got up and dressed before making an attempt to leave. But as he did so Burnie took the kitchen knife and attacked him in a 'fit of rage, or jealousy, or control,' added Miss Woods. Mr McMullen staggered into the backyard where he was found in the backyard with a blood soaked shirt. Police arrested Burnie but she initially claimed her boyfriend had come home injured, before suggesting there must have been an intruder at the house. She also refused 'point blank' to tell officers Mr McMullen's name, instead giving a false, foreign name despite police needing to call a next of kin. She then claimed she hadn't realised how serious his injuries were and only sought help when she looked out of a back window and saw him turning grey and eyes rolling. Miss Woods said: 'She claims that she was unaware that he had a serious injury and thought about turning the lights off and going to bed. She told the police she had a cigarette and she mopped up the blood in the kitchen.' 'The defendant did later accept that when she got back she was still annoyed and cross that he had left her alone whilst he was enjoying himself. 'She accepts that she had gone upstairs to the bedroom where he was sleeping and taunted him and tried to get a reaction out of him claiming she had just been with another man. 'There was a row in which she claims she was pinned down on the bed by him by her wrists, because he was angry and shouted. She accepted he didn't hit or hurt her.' In a videotaped interview Mr McMullen said: 'I went to the engagement do with all my mates and I forgot to ring her. I remember just coming round in hospital. I think my brain shut down.' Previous: Burnie had threatened Mr McMullen - who is now living back with his parents - with a knife twice before . He said of the relationship: 'It was good up until eight months. She just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house, breaking stuff then I would have to fix it. 'We'd argue when rough, after we'd been out, then it started happening when we were out and then it was getting worse and worse, we'd argue about little things. 'She would throw anything, like a plate, I thought 'what a nutcase' but she always calmed down. We would be arguing and she would go to hit me, she thought I had been looking at her mates if we were out. If I couldn't calm her down I used to go for a walk. Victim: Shane McMullen told the court: 'She just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house' 'She picked up a knife before but I never felt threatened. I thought she might have slashed me, I never took much notice because I never felt threatened. 'She got a knife and started waving it around, I said 'what are you doing', she started pointing it about. I was a bit paranoid. This is when it was getting ropey and I was thinking 'this isn't going to work'.' He said he had repaired the bedroom door four times after she broke it by kicking and pushing it through. He said: 'Every time we had an argument she would do that so I would have to repair it. I just think she needs to sort her anger problems out. She used to say people told her to go for anger management, she never really went into it.' 'I have the odd nightmare about being stabbed, not by her, by other people, someone comes and sits on me and stabs me in the chest. I've had it more than once, it makes me wake up. I just try and block it out.' Mr McMullen is now said to be back living with his parents. Burnie was cleared of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. In mitigation her lawyer Keith Harrison said she was 'truly remorseful' and extremely ashamed of what she had done. She had been in abusive relationships before the relationship with Mr McMullen but he had not given her any trouble. The barrister continued: 'It may be that became a mechanism she got used to and got used to responding to that by picking up a knife.' 'She didn’t realise he was so badly injured and did not callously sit there waiting for him to expire or sustain serious, long-standing injury. She regrets this may have put his life at risk. She wasn’t thinking straight at the time.' After the case Det Insp Neil Howarth from Lancashire Police said: 'This attack was unprovoked and it was only the skill and expertise of paramedics and medical staff that saved the victim’s life. 'The physical and psychological effects of the attack will remain with him but I hope that this sentence gives him some closure as he wishes to now move forward with his life.'Comparisons have been made between the case and a Coronation Street storyline featuring Kirsty Soames.","Rhiann Burnie jailed for two years and eight months at Burnley Crown Court .

David Cameron will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election, Vince Cable has declared. The Lib Dem Business Secretary said the target was ‘impractical’ and the Prime Minister ‘almost certainly won’t achieve’ it by 2015. His intervention could spark a new round of Coalition bloodletting – and comes only weeks after he accused Mr Cameron of behaving like Enoch Powell. Warning: Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) has declared that David Cameron (right) will fail to cut net migration to below 100,000 by the next election. He deemed the target 'impractical' and 'unachievable' by 2015 . Revelation: Mr Cable made his remarks in a BBC2 documentary about immigration, to be aired tonight. The programme features a poll showing that more than three-quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced . However, it also risked backfiring by exposing how out of touch the Lib Dems are with public opinion on the issue. Mr Cable made his comments in the documentary The Truth About Immigration, to be aired tonight on BBC2. The programme released a poll showing that more than three-quarters of the public want migrant numbers reduced, and more than half want them to be cut ‘a lot’. It would be better for Britain to be poorer but with fewer immigrants, Nigel Farage claimed today. The . UK Independence Party leader said he said he would ‘rather we weren’t . slightly richer’ if it means allowing more people into the country to . work and create jobs. But he . also revealed his party does not have an official policy on . immigration, although he spent ‘many hours’ yesterday discussing it. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: . ‘The fact is that if people come to this country from Eastern Europe and . they’re earning minimum wage, they’re getting tax credits, possibly . child tax credits, child benefit, housing benefit, and this so far has . been the undiscussed part of this. So I question the economics. ‘But if you said to me: “Would you . want to see over the next ten years a further 5million people come into . Britain and if that happened we’d all be slightly richer?” I would say: . actually, do you know what I’d rather we weren’t slightly richer. ‘I’d . rather we had communities that felt more united and I’d rather have a . situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance . of getting a job. ‘So yes, I do think the social side of this matters more than pure market economics.’ Mr Cable said it was ‘not sensible to have an arbitrary cap’ on net migration – because many elements which make up the target cannot be controlled. He said: ‘So it involves British people emigrating – you can’t control that. It involves free movement within the European Union – in and out. ‘It involves British people coming back from overseas. ‘So setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful, it almost certainly won’t achieve the below 100,000 level the Conservatives have set, so let’s be practical about it.’ ‘The idea it should come down to 100,000 is something the Liberal Democrats have never signed up to because we simply regard it as impractical.’ Net migration – the difference between the numbers arriving and leaving Britain – was below 100,000 during much of the 1990s before increasing sharply in 1998 under Labour. From 2004 it was consistently above 200,000 and reached a peak of more than 250,000 in 2010. After Theresa May entered the Home . Office it fell to 153,000 by 2012 but rose to 182,000 in the 12 months . to June last year, driven by arrivals from southern Europe. The . Tories pledged to reduce the total to under 100,000 by the time of the . next election, but the Liberal Democrats never signed up to the policy. Mr Cable recently claimed the Tories were spreading ‘panic’ about immigration. Last . night a Tory source said: ‘The public want the Government to control . immigration. If the Liberal Democrats don’t want to listen to the . public, then they ought to drop the democrats part of their name.’ The NatCen Social Research British . Social Attitudes survey found 56 per cent believe immigration should be . reduced ‘a lot’, and 21 per cent ‘a little’. Just 17 per cent want migrant numbers to stay the same, and 4 cent want them increased. In the programme, former home and . foreign Secretary Jack Straw admits predictions of how many would come . after 2004, when restrictions were dropped for certain EU countries, . were ‘completely catastrophic. They were wrong by a factor of ten’ After controls were dropped, he said, immigration became ‘bluntly a nightmare’. But . David Blunkett, Labour home secretary between 2001 to 2004, said: ‘I’m . unapologetic because if you don’t have legal managed migration and . people don’t sign up so they pay national insurance and tax, they’ll . work illegally.’ Comparison: Mr Cable's intervention comes weeks after he compared Mr Cameron with Enoch Powell (above) Opposing: In the programme, Jack Straw (left) admits predictions of how many people would come after 2004 were 'catastrophic', but David Blunkett, home secretary between 2001 and 2004, said he was 'unapologetic' Mrs May told the programme: ‘I don’t think people have looked at [immigration] sufficiently closely to be able to recognise the impact it has on members of the public.’ David Hanson, Labour’s shadow immigration minister, said: 'Vince Cable is right to say that the Prime Minister's net migration measure is actually rising and not falling to the tens of thousands as he promised. 'He could also point out that the Home Office's obsession with the net migration target ignores illegal immigration and is actually pushing migration into less controlled routes. This gap between the Government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence.'","Vince Cable dubbed David Cameron's target to cut migration 'impractical'

Dr Abhijit Banerjee has denied conducting an intimate chest examination, which was sexually motivated. Pictured arriving at a tribunal hearing in Manchester . A family doctor cupped a patient's breast in his hands and began breathing 'heavily and erratically' as she underwent an examination for a severe cough, a medical tribunal heard today. Married father-of-two Dr Abhijit Banerjee, 42, locked the door of his consulting room and told the woman to take off her bra before he knelt in front of her with his head in 'close proximity' to her nipples, it was claimed. He was also said to have squeezed the patient’s right breast and appeared to be 'jittery' during the routine chest examination. The woman claimed she could only see the top of the GP’s head as he listened under her right breast. The alleged incident occurred in March 2012 after the 42-year old woman known as Patient A went to see Dr Banerjee at the Abbeyview surgery in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, where he is senior partner. The hearing was told she had suffered chest conditions including pleurisy, pneumonia and sarcoidosis for a number of years which required up to 60 chest examinations. She had previously been prescribed antibiotics. Giving evidence from behind a screen at the Medical Practitioner’s Tribunal Service in Manchester, Patient A said: 'I told Dr Banerjee I had a severe cough and I took a place on the couch. 'He stood up and stood in front of me. I sat on the edge and he was facing me. He asked me to remove my top. He said it was so he could give me a chest exam. There was no screen or curtain. He didn’t offer me a chaperone, I’m very certain of that, but I didn’t request one either. 'I was wearing a bra and kept it on at that stage. He began to listen to my chest with a stethoscope. He wasn’t particularly talking. He also listened to my back. I leant forward because I’m used to having chest exams. 'He listened under my bra strap from the front to my chest but he didn’t explain that was what he was going to do. He then asked me to remove my bra. He said it was to listen to my chest. 'It was slightly uncomfortable but he’s a doctor. He removed it entirely and put it on the bench. I put my arm across my breasts to cover them. He began to listen to my chest through a stethoscope. 'He was listening to my chest and moved my arm away from my breast. He didn’t tell me that was what he was going to do and gave me no explanation. 'I didn’t say anything about it. He went . on his knees and held my right breast in his left hand. He was holding . the whole breast. He asked me to lean forwards into him while he was . still holding my breasts and I followed the instruction and then he . listened underneath my breast and all I could see was the top of his . head. 'His head was level with under my breast because I remember just being able to see the top of his head. He was touching my nipple as he cupped my breasts to lift it with the palm of his hand. 'He kept his hand still. He didn’t say anything while he put the stethoscope under my breast and he didn’t move it anywhere else. I thought his breathing seemed erratic. He hadn’t discussed breathing during the exam or whether he would give me a breathing demonstration. 'It came to an end when he got up and walked away and said I could get dressed. He was slightly uncomfortable but maybe that’s because I felt like that. He turned away from me quite quickly and told me to get dressed. 'I thought the chest exam was unusual while it was happening. It had made me feel uncomfortable as soon as it happened. There wasn’t one particular reason why I didn’t say anything at the time. I just wanted to leave. You don’t jump to conclusions quickly like this. She added: 'The door was locked when I came to leave the room. I recall the doctor locking the door. He didn’t tell me he had done that. When I was on the couch before he asked me to remove my top he locked the door. I unlocked the door to go out and I left. He didn’t say bye and neither did I.' Patient A claims Dr Banerjee locked the consulting room door At Abbeyview Surgery in Peterborough, before asking her to remove her bra while he examined her chest. During the examination, she claims he 'touched her nipple as he cupped her right breast', to lift it to allow him to listen to her chest . The woman later confided in a friend as to what happened before alerting her husband two days later. She made a formal complaint by letter to the surgery on May 11 and the case was referred to the Lincolnshire Primary Care NHS Trust. Chloe Hudson, counsel for the MPTS said: 'She says he locked the door of the room and told her he needed to listen to her lungs and asked her to remove her top. 'He moved her to a couch and asked her to remove her bra as it was obstructing him. She did so, and placed her arms across her breasts. 'He moved her arms out of the way and asked her to lean forwards and she says he placed his whole hand on her entire breast including her nipple. He was jittery and his breathing was erratic. 'She brought the consultation to an end, put her clothes on and soon realised she had been subject to an inappropriate examination.' Dr Banerjee, from Peterborough who specialises in minor surgery, dermatology and ear, nose and throat complaints, denies charges of sexually motivated misconduct. Miss Hudson said: 'He describes himself as being absolutely devastated to read the complaint in the letter. 'He describes a consultation which involved two complaints by the patient - she was concerned about her chest and the possibility of pneumonia. 'It is standard procedure that a full chest exam requires the doctor to listen to the front, back and side of the chest and because of the abdominal pain he had to listen to the abdomen.'","Dr Abhijit Banerjee denies charges of sexually motivated misconduct .

Row: Boris Johnson has weighed in on the conflict on the 100th anniversary of WWI backing Michael Gove's theory that it was sparked by German expansionism . David Cameron and Boris Johnson rode to Michael Gove’s defence over his call to banish the ‘left-wing myths’ of the First World War depicted on shows like Blackadder. Downing Street said the Education Secretary was right to blame German militarism for the outbreak of the war, while the London Mayor joined him in condemning the Left. But Mr Gove found himself exposed to a counter attack as Nick Clegg and a Cambridge academic he has condemned, embarked on a new round of hostilities. The Deputy Prime Minister said the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war should be a time for ‘sombre reflection’, not ‘wagging the finger of blame’. And Professor Sir Richard Evans, Regius Professor of History at Cambridge, said Mr Gove ‘should be ashamed of himself’. The row began last week when the Mail ran an article by Mr Gove in which he argued that the First World War was every bit as ‘just’ as the fight against Hitler. He criticised the Blackadder and Oh! What a Lovely War view of the war ‘as a misbegotten shambles’, as well as ‘left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths by attacking Britain’s role in the conflict’. He singled out Sir Richard, accusing him of ‘adopting the attitude of an undergraduate cynic’. At the weekend, Labour education spokesman and historian Tristram Hunt branded it an ‘ugly’ attempt to ‘politicise’ the centenary commemorations. But Boris Johnson yesterday called for Mr Hunt to quit, saying: ‘It is a sad but undeniable fact that the First World War, in all its murderous horror, was overwhelmingly the result of German expansionism and aggression. ‘If Tristram Hunt seriously denies German militarism was at the root of the First World War, he is not fit to do his job, either in opposition or in government, and should resign.’ David Cameron’s official spokesman also backed Mr Gove. Reality of war: French and British soldiers in trenches on the Western Front in 1916 . He said the 100th anniversary is an opportunity to ‘commemorate the fallen’ and reflect on ‘peace in Europe’. The spokesman said: ‘I think we can do that without being afraid of saying it was right for Britain to respond to aggression and to enter the war on that basis.’ But Mr Clegg, who has repeatedly clashed with Mr Gove, suggested the Education Secretary should have kept his thoughts to himself. The Lib Dem leader said: ‘I don’t think anyone sensible is saying you should airbrush out history. It’s the question about whether you think this is the occasion to start apportioning blame or wagging the finger. Conflict: Gove has come under fire from Nick Clegg who said this is the time for 'sombre reflection' ‘I think most people want a slightly more sombre and sensible reflection about what wars on that scale mean, how we, particularly in Europe, have overcome that.’ On Sunday, Sir Tony Robinson, who played Private Baldrick in Blackadder Goes Forth, described Mr Gove’s comments as a ‘very, very silly mistake’. Professor Evans accused Mr Gove of a ‘personal attack’. He points out right-wing historians like Niall  Ferguson and former Tory MP Alan Clark – who alluded to the phrase ‘lions led by donkeys’ for the  soldiers and their generals – have also condemned the war. He added: ‘Defaming historians and others who think and write  critically about Britain’s role in the First World War by accusing them of seeking to “denigrate virtues such as patriotism, honour, and courage” is no way to conduct the debate Gove says he wants to encourage. He should be ashamed of himself.’","Michael Gove condemned by Nick Clegg and Cambridge academic for 'wagging finger of blame' on 100th anniversary over 'sombre reflection'

Allegations: Chris Ling, 56, is accused of a catalogue of sex abuse against young female students . A violin teacher accused of a catalogue of sex abuse against young female students faces the threat of extradition proceedings so he can be put on trial in this country, it emerged yesterday. Chris Ling, 56, moved to the U.S. after a previous police probe over allegations that he preyed on girls at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester ended without charges. However a series of new allegations were made following last year’s conviction of the school’s former director of music, Michael Brewer, for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade 30 years ago. The 48-year-old mother-of-four committed suicide during his trial after enduring a torrid cross-examination. Another four music teachers are currently on bail after being arrested in a major police investigation into allegations of historic sex abuse centring on Chetham’s and the Royal Northern College of Music, also in Manchester. Mr Ling moved to the United States in the early 1990s and runs a talent management agency from his Los Angeles base. Yesterday, police said he had been invited to return to Britain for questioning by detectives, but had failed to comply. They added that steps to extradite him would now be considered. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A full file of evidence has been compiled and submitted to the CPS in relation to complaints against Chris Ling. 'That review process will necessarily involve the consideration of commencing extradition proceedings. Scene: Mr Ling moved to the U.S. after a police probe over allegations he preyed on girls at Chetham's School of Music (pictured) ended without charges. He is now facing extradition following a series of new allegations . 'We are working closely with the CPS as part of this process.' More than 30 women have made complaints that they suffered sexual abuse from classical music teachers at the two colleges or in private tuition and 39 people have been investigated, five of whom are now dead. Last February, the Guardian newspaper reported claims from ten women that Mr Ling abused them in the 1980s while he was a freelance teacher at Chetham’s. They claimed he would instruct girls as young as 15 to strip naked during lessons or spank their bare bottoms. Guilty: The new allegations were made following last year's conviction of the Manchester-based school's former director of music Michael Brewer (left) for indecently assaulting France Andrade (right) 30 years ago . Contemporaries described how his pupils were known as ‘Ling’s strings’ and that he bragged about taking nude pictures of them. Mr Ling, who is married to a former pupil, Pippa Clarke, now a concert violinist, has repeatedly declined to comment about the claims by reporters who have approached him in Los Angeles. Brewer was jailed for six years last March after he was found guilty of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 14 and 15. His trial heard allegations that sexual activity between teachers and pupils at Chetham’s was not uncommon in the 1980s. Among those on bail are violin teacher Wen Zhou Li, 57, a professor at the RNCM and a former teacher at Chetham’s, who was held last February on suspicion of rape. Renowned double bass teacher Duncan McTier, 58, was arrested at his home in London in May over allegations of sex abuse against a woman in her 20s in the mid-90s at the RNCM. Internationally acclaimed conductor Nicholas Smith, 65, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, was held in July on suspicion of committing sexual offences against a 15-year-old girl in the late 1970s while she was a pupil at Chetham’s. Former Chetham’s teacher Malcolm Layfield, 61, was arrested in August on suspicion of three historic rapes against three females, two aged 16 and one 18, between 1980 and 1991. The former head of strings at the RNCM was re-arrested in October on suspicion of the rape and indecent assault of a woman when she was aged between 18 and 21. The institutions concerned have insisted the allegations are historic and that child protection policies have been changed significantly since the period they cover.","Chris Ling, 56, accused of preying on girls at Chetham's School of Music .

Captured in its bold brush strokes are both Lady Thatcher’s steely strength of character and the vulnerability of a woman in the closing years of her life. The portrait was painted in 2007 by Lorna May Wadsworth, a Left-wing artist who came to adore her subject. Thought to be the last painted depiction from the life of Britain’s greatest modern peace-time prime minister, it has been kept hidden away until now. Bold yet vulnerable: The striking portrait of Margaret Thatcher by Lorna May Wadsworth will hang in Tory HQ . Yesterday it was unveiled in the House of Commons and will eventually hang in Tory Party headquarters. Miss Wadsworth said: ‘I wanted my painting to elicit a reaction as far away removed from political propaganda as possible, hence the timing of its unwrapping. ‘Some people hate that I’ve painted her at all. I vividly recall her from my childhood in Northern England. 'I wanted to create an image that captured the “Iron Lady not for turning”.’ She saw Lady Thatcher at the opera one . evening and, on the spur of the moment, gave a note to her bodyguard . asking permission to paint her. She persevered until granted five sittings. Miss Wadsworth – who describes herself as a Leftie bohemian – was artist-in-residence at the 2003 Labour Party Conference. Moved: Left-wing artist said she was moved by Lady Thatcher's gravitas and felt the urge to curtsey . This is the portrait of the former prime minister hanging in 10 Downing Street, pictured at the unveiling in 2009 . Icon: In 1998, artist James Gillick painted this portrait (left) to honour Baroness Thatcher's six years as chancellor of the University of Buckingham - the only private university in the country. At the turn of the century, a photograph (right) of the former Conservative leader was unveiled in a new wing opened by the Queen . But she says of Lady Thatcher: ‘I grew fond of her. But it was like going to visit an old headmistress… you were always on your toes. 'She had tremendous gravitas. When I met her, it was all that I could do not to curtsey, and I don’t even know how. ‘But I completely adored her. I was not prepared for how lovely and kind she was… It is easy to demonise people you think have nothing in common with you.’ Painting at the ex-premier’s home in Eaton Square, she produced a portrait 6ft 6in by 6ft 6in. Miss Wadsworth aimed to express Lady . Thatcher’s power through the huge scale: ‘I wanted to paint her . expressively, big brush strokes. There was human frailty there too, and . it was moving to witness that first hand.’ Tribute: The piece has finally been unveiled just under a year after Lady Thatcher's death. Philip Mould, a former works of art adviser to the Commons, said it is 'the boldest prime minister portrait done from life' Lady Thatcher loved the portrait – although she commented that she looked ‘very fierce’. Miss Wadsworth said she wanted to paint a . non-partisan image, but added: ‘If people can’t stand her, they’ll . probably want to throw things at the portrait. 'If they love her, they might not agree with how I have chosen to paint her.’ Private collectors are said to have bought the work through dealer Philip Mould for more than £400,000 – and have loaned it to the nation. Mr Mould, a former works of art adviser to the Commons, said: ‘It’s the boldest prime minister portrait done from life – not least because Thatcher herself was very much involved.’","Piece by Left-wing painter Lorna May Wadsworth to hang in Tory party HQ .

This is the moment two giggling girls danced with death as they peaked over a clifftop amid treacherous gales. The tourists were captured posing for photos and jumping around barely a metre from the crumbling edge of the Birling Gap in East Sussex just days after a neighbouring cliff collapsed into the sea. Coastguards have now closed access to the beach and warned visitors of a significant risk to life. But the women weren't alone as dozens of families were today captured hiking up to the perilous summit despite numerous safety warnings during the stormiest winter since 1969. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stupid? Two tourists creep towards the crumbling edge of the clifftop in East Sussex despite numerous safety warnings from the Met Office and the coastguards . Just along the clifftop - locally dubbed the 'Seven Sisters' for its seven peaks - three semi-detached homes are on the brink of tumbling into the English Channel. Nonetheless, the walkers calmly gazed at the lashing waves below. It is the latest in a number of stunts branded 'idiotic' by the RNLI during the stormiest December since 1969. Floods have left all access roads to Muchelney under 3ft of water for four days, and Dorset residents have been warned imminent floods pose a 'significant risk to life'. Already dangerous: At first the girl posing stands closer to safe ground, clutching the wall behind her on the Birling Gap in East Sussex . Reckless: But then she launches all her weight towards the drop to peer into the mass of white waves below . The Met Office issued a 'be aware' yellow warning for gusts as strong as 70mph set to hit the west and south-west coast of Britain today. On Saturday, the RNLI were called to rescue 21-year-old student Edward Laxton who was trapped on a jetty in Aberystwyth, Wales, after taking photographs of the ferocious waves. An inshore rescue team launched and rescued the first year Aberystwyth University student from the end of the platform. 'Smile': Clutching her bag and bracing herself, one of the girls nervously smiles for the holiday photo perilously close to the edge where on cliff has already collapsed . Pictures show the solitary figure standing at the far end of the pier as the water threatens to engulf him. Video taken by a passer-buy shows the waves have cut the man off from the shore and he is stranded at the end of the jetty. Rescue crews used their dinghy to get close to the him then strapped a lifejacket on him and brought him ashore. According to the coastguards, this collection of houses is on the brink of collapsing into the English Channel despite numerous efforts to support it and delay erosion . Not alone: The girls were followed by numerous country walkers who hiked up to the summit. This group gazes calmly over the blustering wind at a house about to fall . Despite repeated warnings to the public to stay away from the coastline, the man had walked to the end of the wooden jetty got get shots of the waves crashing over him and onto the street. But the fierce weather left him stranded. Police and coastguard teams were unable to reach the man, and the Aberystwyth RNLI 85 Class lifeboat 'Spirit of Friendship' was launched to assist, reaching the man from the sheltered lee of the harbour. A young father and his daughter came perilously close to being swept away this morning as they bounded towards 15ft-high waves on the sea edge in Cornwall. Perranport, near Newquay, has one of the worst-hit parts of Britain this week, with some of the biggest waves in a decade swamping the town. But a breathtaking video captured a young family standing on the sea front as the wind and water raged. Perilous: A man in Perranport, Cornwall, is filmed taking his daughter, aged around six years old, to the seafront as 15ft-high waves crash onto the street . The scene was caught on video by local Mark Thomas who was stunned when he saw a man edging closer to the edge with what appeared to be his daughter aged around six or seven. Another man can be seen standing right on the edge of a slipway as an enormous wall of water over 15ft-high is thrown up just feet away. It is the stormiest winter to hit the UK since 1969 and depression from the Atlantic coupled with 70mph winds has caused mayhem in Cornwall. The pair, with another man, were dressed to brave the waves in the far south west of the UK, where storms have led to numerous emergency rescue missions .

Energy companies are refusing to hand over a £50 cut in bills promised to all households by David Cameron and George Osborne. Five weeks ago, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor announced a change to green levies which they claimed would save bill payers £50. However, only two of the ‘big six’ energy companies, British Gas and SSE, have said they will pass on the full reduction to all their customers. Five weeks ago, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor announced a change to green levies which they claimed would save bill payers £50 . Three companies – Scottish Power, E.on and EDF – have decided that three million customers on fixed-rate tariffs will get a reduction of just £12, or 23p a week. Npower, which recently put up its bills by 10.4 per cent to an average of almost £1,500 a year, has yet to make an announcement. The decisions represent a challenge to the Government’s authority and its ability to deliver on promises to consumers. Price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.com has set up an e-petition asking ministers to force firms to give the £50 cut to all. Only two of the ¿big six¿ energy companies, British Gas and SSE, have said they will pass on the full reduction to all their customers . Spokesman Clare Francis said: ‘While the Government announcement was an attempt to help  struggling households cope with the rising cost of their energy bills, the silence from some suppliers has been deafening. ‘British Gas and SSE have done the right thing and said all customers will benefit from the reduced cost of levies, and British Gas has already introduced its lower prices. ‘We ask the Government to challenge the other energy providers to play fair and help households by passing on the full reduction to all customers. People are fed up with this smoke-and-mirrors mentality from energy firms.’ At the beginning of December, George Osborne said: ‘There’s going to be an average of £50 off people’s bills. ‘We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in.’ Subsequently, a spokesman for the Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, said: ‘We have announced a package that should lead to all households seeing an average saving of around £50 a year. ‘There is no practical bar to these savings being passed on to consumers on fixed tariffs and our expectation is that all consumers will benefit from the £50 discount.’ Scottish Power said yesterday that its variable-tariff customers will receive a 3.3 per cent cut from January 12 . However, this has not happened. Fixed-tariff customers with E.on, EDF and Scottish Power are only getting a reduction of £12, while npower remains silent on the bills issue. Scottish Power said yesterday that its variable-tariff customers will receive a 3.3 per cent cut from January 12, bringing the average bill down to £1,284. It confirmed that around one million fixed-rate customers will only get £12 off. The Spanish-owned firm said that most people on fixed rates are already paying less than those with variable tariffs, and so it is not  necessary to give them the full £50 cut. This is at odds with the policy of British Gas, SSE and Government ministers. A spokesman for Scottish Power said: ‘At present, 97 per cent of customers on fixed-price products already have a lower bill value than these new standard tariffs. ‘These customers were protected from the rising cost of green levies as they were not impacted by our recent price rise.’ Audrey Gallacher, head of energy at the customer body Consumer Futures, said: ‘The message has been that people were going to save £50 on their energy bill, but it seems a fair chunk of people will not get that. 'The right thing to do would be to apply the full reduction across the board. That is the expectation that the Government has created.’ Ann Robinson, of comparison website uSwitch.com, said: ‘The whole intent of the Government’s proposals was to give people much-needed relief.

At the very least, it's one hairy issue less for Jeremy Paxman to discuss as he returns to the airwaves. The veteran BBC Newsnight presenter's beard made headlines when he debuted it on television last year. But, hours after declaring online that 'beards are so 2013', he shunned his facial hair and returned to a clean-shaven look for his first appearance of the year on the show last night. The 63-year-old's beard divided opinion and sparked busy discussions on Twitter when he first appeared with it last August. Before and after: Jeremy Paxman sparked a Twitter storm when he returned from his summer holiday last year sporting a full beard. He is pictured (left) with his 'gravitas adding' facial hair and (right) all smooth again . At the time BBC radio host Danny Baker described him as a 'silly old goat'. The presenter hit back and accused his critics of pogonophobia – an irrational fear of beards. Before going on air last night Mr  Paxman told RadioTimes.com: 'If a chap can't shave on holiday, what can he do? Beards are so 2013.' Paxman's appearance drew a huge response when he grew the beard more than five months ago, when he branded the BBC pogonophobic - having a fear of beards. At the time, he explained his reasons, saying: 'I have grown a beard for the last few summers, and suddenly wondered whether I really needed to shave it off to present Newsnight. 'Unless you're lucky enough to be Uncle Albert on Only Fools And Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza, the BBC is generally as pogonophobic as the late-lamented Albanian dictator, Enver Hoxha.

'I may keep it or I may shave it off, but I think I'll make my own decision.' He later said: 'For a glorious few days I have been a poster boy for a shadowy group called the Beard Liberation Front, which claims that facial hair invites discrimination. 'I'm finding it quite a heavy burden.' The Beard Liberation Front has lamented the decision to go clean-shaven, saying: 'We support people's right to dress and appear as they want so, while we regret Jeremy Paxman's decision to shave off his gravitas adding beard, the choice should be entirely up to him, BBC pogonophobia notwithstanding.'","Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has shunned his facial hair .

This photo taken by passenger Steve Murphy early on Monday shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling of the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 . A Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 superjumbo made an emergency landing in Azerbaijan on Monday due to a loss of cabin pressure, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded for 18 hours at the airport in the capital Baku. The service from London to Singapore landed safely without any injuries to the 467 passengers and 27 crew on board, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. ‘Oxygen masks were deployed and the aircraft landed uneventfully at Baku airport,’ he told AFP by email. ‘We sincerely apologise to affected customers for the inconvenience caused by the diversion and the lengthy delay encountered at the airport in Baku,’ the airline said. Airbus said in a statement it was ‘following up on this issue and providing technical assistance to the airline’. Angry passengers took to social media to complain about being stranded in the Heydar Aliyev International Airport instead of being put up in hotels. ‘We are not going to a hotel but will be flying out tonight after an 18-hour wait around the duty-free area,’ wrote passenger Nic Coulthard on the Singapore Airlines Facebook page. ‘I don't think it is inconsistent for passengers to be grateful for a safe landing whilst disappointed at the lack of communication and facilities provided once on the ground,’ he wrote. Another passenger, Terri Mann, complained that she had to sleep on a ‘cold steel bench’ with her 17-month old child, and that there were no ‘food places’ at the airport. ‘We are all a little hesitant about getting on our next legs of our journeys, just hope the worst is over,’ she wrote. Responding to a flood of posts on Facebook, Singapore Airlines noted that noise was reported from a door during an earlier flight of the same plane. The service from London to Singapore landed safely without any injuries to the 467 passengers and 27 crew on board (file picture) ‘The door was inspected by engineers on the ground in London with no findings, and the aircraft was cleared for continued operation,’ it said. Passenger Matthew G. Johnson had said earlier that a ‘loud air noise was heard from the door five rows in front’ shortly after take-off from Heathrow Airport in London. Upon questioning, a crew member allegedly told him that the door had a ‘mild’ leaking seal, Johnson said in a Facebook posting. A few hours later oxygen masks were deployed and the aircraft began an emergency descent over Afghanistan after the cabin began losing pressure, he said. His posting was accompanied by a photograph of a dimly lit cabin with oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling. Singapore Airlines has a fleet of 19 Airbus A380s with five others on order, according to its website. The planes are used for flights from Singapore to various destinations including Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles.","Passengers endured 18 hours at Baku airport before being flown onwards .

If you're feeling guilty about taking a break from your text books or revision notes to read this article, relax - you're doing the right thing. Research shows learning is much more effective when spread over time than relying on last-minute cramming. The developing skills of hundreds of thousands of people were analysed as they learned how to play a simple online game. Study: Academics found that learning over time was more effective (file picture) Academics concluded it was better to practice for a while and then have a rest compared to continuously playing in the hope of improving. In fact, leaving an entire day between sessions strengthened performance, rather than weakened it. Professor Tom Stafford, a psychologist from the University of Sheffield who helped analyse the data, said: 'The study suggests that learning can be improved. 'You can learn more efficiently or use the same practice time to learn to a higher level.' More than 850,000 people were monitored as they played Axon, which involves rapid decision-making to click on the correct parts of a screen to grow neurons. Players were found to improve faster when they left gaps between sessions because it allows the brain to file away information. Those who played for two hours on two consecutive days generally did better than someone who practised continuously for four hours, for example. Gap: The results showed that resting for a day improved rather than weakened results (file picture) Professor Stafford said the perception that more is learned by cramming is illusory and recommended taking breaks between study sessions. The amount of time spent learning is not as important as how well the studying is structured, he explained. Up to a quarter of students at some leading universities are estimated to have experimented with 'cognitive enhancing drugs' in the hope of boosting grades. A black market in prescription-only medicines such as Modafinil, a stimulant used to treat sleeping disorder narcolepsy, has sprung up. Medical experts are concerned about the long-term effects, which are not known. Short-term effects include vomiting, headaches, irrational behaviour, palpitations and poor sleep patterns. A separate study last year found 61 per cent of students stayed up late the day before an exam and 40 per cent crammed throughout the night. Around two-thirds changed their diet before exams in the hope certain foods would help boost their memory. This included 53 per cent who started eating oily fish and 46 per cent who had more fruit and vegetables. A third even admitted wearing 'good luck underwear' to improve their exam chances. Revision expert Patrick Wilson said at the time that students should stick to proper revision. 'The best way to feel truly confident and help beat that stomach-churning exam angst is to prepare for each exam in advance, making sure you have a dedicated structure for your revision schedule,' he added.","Academics said learning was more effective when spread over time .

The Lib Dem women’s minister Jo Swinson was ridiculed yesterday for  suggesting that mothers should be allowed to bring  their babies into the House of Commons. Respected Channel 4 newsreader Cathy Newman, who is also a working mother, said allowing MPs to bring their ‘bawling’ babies to Parliament would not ‘greatly advance the feminist cause’. In a scathing article entitled ‘Has this MP gone gaga?’, Miss Newman suggested bringing a baby into any office, let alone Parliament, would distract women from the demands of their work because being a mother is a full-time job in itself. Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman (left) warned Lib Dem minister Jo Swinson was not advancing the cause of feminism by complaining about not being able to take her baby to a place of work . ‘Juggling life and work is hard enough . without having a baby in the office competing with your boss for your . time and attention,’ Miss Newman wrote. Miss . Swinson, 33, who is also a business minister, gave birth to her first . child, Andrew, just before Christmas. She is married to Lib Dem MP . Duncan Hames. An MP who is . breastfeeding may bring a baby into her own office, but not into the . House of Commons or House of Lords chambers, or the division lobbies . they pass through to vote. Miss Swinson said: ‘I hardly think it would . be too much of a disruption. You can take a sword through there but you . can’t a baby.’ Miss Newman, . who is married with two children, said while she understood the . minister wanted to ‘bang the drum for working mums’, her policy of . ‘carting’ babies around the workplace  was ill-judged. ‘Don’t . get me wrong, I’m all for mums being encouraged to breastfeed, though . too many are made to feel terribly guilty if they can’t make it work,’ she wrote in a Daily Telegraph blog. ‘I’m . afraid, though, that it doesn’t greatly advance the feminist cause to . allow MPs to cart their bawling babies through the lobby. The Commons is . a workplace unlike any other, but a workplace nevertheless. Family values: Swinson, here pictured with husband, fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames, and baby Andrew . ‘In . my view, women should be able to breastfeed anywhere they need to, but I . draw the line at looking after a baby – itself a full-time job – when . you’re at work.’ Tory MP Sir Gerald Howarth also weighed into the debate, saying Miss Swinson’s suggestion was ‘wholly inappropriate’. The former defence minister, and father of three, said: ‘The voting lobbies of the House of Commons are not a crèche. ‘Of . course mothers will want to look after their young children but I don’t . see the child’s welfare is served by taking them through the lobbies.’ Miss . Newman, 39, who used to be a political correspondent for Channel 4, . conceded that Parliament still had some way to go in becoming more . family-friendly. The . answer, she said, was for politicians to deliver ‘more  flexible, more . affordable childcare’, such as a nanny, childminder or nursery. ‘So I’m . hoping that when Ms Swinson returns to work, she’ll have found loving, . reasonably priced care for baby Andrew, leaving her free to focus on the . tough demands of her day job,’ she said.

Nurses could face checks every three years to prove that they still care about their patients. They may be made to undergo regular assessments which would hinge on the feedback of patients and their relatives. NHS managers would collect up to 20 detailed comments from patients, family members and staff about the attitude of  individual nurses and their level of compassion. The comments would be sent to the Nursing and Midwifery Council – along with assessments on overall ability – and those who fall short could be struck off. Facing checks? File picture of medical staff at Chase Farm Hospital Accident and Emergency Unit, Enfield . The watchdog is considering the checks in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal where some staff were said to have become 'immune to the sound of pain'. Last summer two senior nurses working in the hospital's A&E department were struck off after being accused of conspiring to fiddle figures on waiting times. Sharon Turner, 48, and Tracey White, 52 were accused of ruling the unit 'with fear' by bullying and coercing staff to cover up poor care. The NMC was heavily criticised by an inquiry into the scandal   which warned it was not doing enough to protect patients from poor nurses. There are currently very few checks on nurses. They only have to prove they have completed 450 hours of work and 35 hours of learning every three years. The new assessments – known as revalidation – would involve nurses having to collate between five and 20 pieces of feedback from colleagues, patients, relatives and carers. These would probably be gathered by nurses' managers to prevent them being selective in asking for feedback. An NHS Hospital Accident and emergency department entrance and ambulance . Over the past few years the NHS has instructed universities only to recruit nurses  deemed capable of being compassionate. But there is concern that some nurses who have been working for years have become jaded and do not always make care and kindness a priority. The NMC yesterday launched a consultation on how the test will work and it is likely to announce further details later this year. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Patients deserve to know every nurse is fit to practise in a modern setting and competent for the role they are performing. 'We will be engaging with our members to inform them of the proposals as well as responding formally to the consultation. 'What we need to ensure is that nurses are properly supported to make the revalidation system work, whether through on-going post-registration training or through mentorship and supervision, as they are already experiencing very high workloads.' Last February David Cameron criticised the NMC – and doctors' watchdog the General Medical Council – for failing to protect patients. In a speech to the Commons shortly after the Mid Staffordshire inquiry, he said: 'We expect the professional regulators to strike off the doctors and nurses who seriously breach their professional code. But in Stafford [Hospital] those expectations were badly let down.' The NMC has also been criticised for taking too long to reprimand failing nurses and for being overly bureaucratic. Nurse checks would be similar to those introduced for doctors in 2012. The GMC is appraising all 260,000 GPs registered to practise in England, with the process expected to take three years.","Nursing and Midwifery Council is considering the checks .

A driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree yet is still on the road, damning new figures reveal today. The motorist, from Liverpool, got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding between October 1 2012 and June 20 2013. His total exceeded the previous record of 42 points according to the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) which obtained figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) following a Freedom of Information Act request. A driver has clocked up a record 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine-month offending spree yet is still on the road (stock picture) Drivers who get 12 points within three years can be disqualified. But the new figures show that nine drivers have clocked up 30 points or more. And more than 7,000 have 12 points or more. The new official Government figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system, bringing it ‘into disrepute’. They say the ministers at the Department for Transport and Ministry of Justice must act to clamp down on the scandal which is leaving potentially dangerous drivers unpunished on the nation’s roads. The IAM said poor communication between the Government’s DVLA and the courts - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - and a tendency for courts to take ‘hardship’ stories into account means thousands of drivers are still on the road despite exceeding the 12-point limit. The figures obtained by the IAM showed: . The figures have outraged motoring groups and road safety campaigners who say it makes a mockery of penalty points system . Failing to give the identity of the owner, speeding, and driving uninsured were the most common reasons for points, said the IAM. Normally a driver facing 12 points will be subject to an automatic six-month ban - unless they can prove it would cause exceptional hardship. A court decides if a driver is banned or has special reasons to be allowed to stay behind the wheel. The DVLA said courts can exercise discretion and not disqualify in a small percentage of cases where a driver has accumulated 12 or more points. Some drivers given points for failing to disclose the driver had argued that a series of different people had test-driven their the car ahead of a sale and they didn’t know who was at the wheel at the time of the offence, said the IAM. The figures show nine drivers have clocked up 30-plus points. And more than 7,000 have 12 points or more . The issue of who was driving when an offence is committed is controversial and can escalate. HM Courts & Tribunals Service say the ‘vast majority’ of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving but notes: ‘Magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship, such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant. A fine will still be enforced. Only a very small number of cases are affected by the data-sharing issue and we are working closely with DVLA to improve this.’ A DVLA spokesman said: ‘The DVLA’s role is to record the information provided by the courts. The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver.’","Motorist, from Liverpool, got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding .

When Luke Thompson found himself home alone for a weekend, he wasted little time in contacting a former lover for some company. But the love cheat reckoned without Kelsie Davies contacting his girlfriend on Facebook to admit to their night of passion - even describing the couple’s bed linen to prove it. A court heard how Thompson then ‘dug himself into a hole’ as he attempted to cover up his cheating - and told Amijane Thomas that Miss Davies must have broken in to their home to know what it looked like inside. Luke Thompson (left) took another woman to his home when girlfriend Amijane Thomas (right) was away . Miss Davies, the mother of two of his children, spent five hours in custody being questioned by police - and a month on bail - until officers eventually uncovered Thompson’s deception. The father-of-three is now starting a ten-month prison sentence after admitting perverting the course of justice. The judge was told both women have now washed their hands of the love cheat. Leicester Crown Court heard on Thursday how Thompson decided to two-time Miss Thomas, 18, while she took month-old Logan on a weekend break away with her family, in June. Thompson, 25, arranged to go clubbing with Miss Davies and the couple returned to the terrace home he shared with Miss Thomas in the city. But the court heard a row broke out after Miss Davies discovered Thompson had fathered a son with Miss Thomas. Miss Davies then contacted the teenager on Facebook ‘and revealed she had slept with him and described the inside of his home to prove it,’ prosecutor Victoria Rose said. Thompson 'dug himself into a hole' as he attempted to cover up his cheating with Kelsie Davies . ‘Confronted by his new partner, he said the former one had lied and hadn’t been to the address and if she had it was because she had burgled it.’ Thompson then claimed his BlackBerry and camera had gone missing, so Miss Thomas contacted police to report a burglary. Thompson repeated the claim in a statement to police three days later, also alleging his partner’s hair-straighteners had been damaged. Miss Davies was then arrested and spent a month under suspicion for a crime she had not committed. But Ms Rose told the court: ‘There was something about her account which rang true with the police, which led to (police uncovering) CCTV footage showing them meeting up and both entering his home together. During her (Miss Davies’) interview, she said she damaged the defendant’s partner’s hair-straighteners and received a caution.’ Thompson was arrested and maintained throughout two separate interviews that his former partner had broken in, continuing the lie even after being shown the CCTV footage of them together. Subsequent phone texts showed his ex-partner had asked him to tell the truth, to which he kept replying ‘It’s too late’. Sentencing Thompson, Judge Robert Brown said: ‘He’s lied, lied and lied again. ‘He cheated on his current partner to get back with his former partner and then lied to get the former partner into trouble. ‘An innocent person was at risk of imprisonment for something they hadn’t done.’ Speaking from her parents’ home in Glenfield, Leicester, Miss Thomas described her former boyfriend as a ‘compulsive liar’ who had ‘lied and lied again’. Miss Davies contacted his then girlfriend, Miss Thomas (pictured), to admit to their night of passion . She said: ‘I already knew Kelsie and when she contacted me on Facebook she seemed unrepentant about what happened. ‘She described not just the pattern of our bedlinen but what Logan had in his cot, the colour of our carpets - the whole house. ‘Luke denied it all and said he’d had his phone and driving licence taken. But we found parts of his phone in the back garden, and he never reported his missing licence to the DVLA. ‘He would still be denying this now if the evidence wasn’t so strong.’ Miss Thomas said she met Thompson through his cousin two years ago. The couple started dating shortly after the end of his five-year relationship with Miss Davies. Miss Davies, who is now thought to be in a new relationship, declined to comment.","Luke Thompson , 25, took ex-girlfriend Kelsie Davies back to his home when his then girlfriend, Amijane Thomas, was away for the weekend .

An under-fire ambulance service may have been a major factor in the deaths of almost 60 patients in the past three years, according to shocking new figures. The East of England Ambulance Trust (EEAST) has been accused of a series of alleged failings with critically ill patients left desperately waiting for ambulances. New figures reveal the service has logged 155 serious incidents since April 2010 - with 59 relating to unexpected or avoidable deaths of patients. They include a doubling of serious incidents in a year. The East of England Ambulance Trust has been accused of a series of alleged failings with critically ill patients left waiting for ambulances - sometimes for hours. File picture . An EEAST spokesman yesterday claimed it was 'impossible' to know whether the deaths could have been prevented. In June the trust’s bosses were mauled by MPs in Parliament leading to the resignation of five non-executive directors. The figures come as a grieving family still wait for answers over the death of their son who waited nearly two hours for an ambulance - over four times the target response time. Peter Nelson, 26, died from a brain haemorrhage on November 14 a short time after being eventually taken to hospital in Norwich. His death was one of 25 serious incidents (SI) across the six counties covered by the EEAST between April and December last year. Victims: In August a blunder led to the death of teenager Elouise Keeling, 14, (left) who died from an asthma attack and Peter Nelson, 26, (right) died from a brain haemorrhage . Figures revealed by the NHS trust also show 27 SIs in 2010/11, of which 15 related to the deaths of patients. In the 2011/12 financial year the number of SIs jumped to 51, with 17 relating to the deaths of patients, and there were 52 serious incidents in 2012/13, of which 18 related to patient deaths. In August a blunder led to the death of teenager Elouise Keeling, 14, who died from an asthma attack on an Army Cadets sports day. Paramedics took twice the target response time after they drove to the wrong address and a second ambulance had to be sent. Later that year the service admitted patients were being taken to hospital in police cars because of a serious shortage in ambulances. Between April and October police cars took casualties to A&E 41 times, including a teenager who overdosed on diazepam, a father who had slit his wrists and a woman suffering heart palpitations. Anthony Marsh, chief executive of the West Midlands Ambulance Service, became the new CEO of EEAST last month - on a part-time basis. An EEAST spokesman today said: 'It is important to note that in these cases, patients already had a serious clinical condition and have passed away as a result of deterioration of this condition. 'In the majority of instances the death has occurred in an acute setting after conveyance and handover to hospital, in a number of instances days later. 'It is not possible to determine whether different actions of the trust would have prevented the death of the patient.' Bella Hellings stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in Thetford, Norfolk and died before ambulance crews arrived . Paul Nelson, 26, died from a brain haemorrhage after an ambulance took two hours to reach his home. In November he 26-year-old collapsed in his bathroom in the village of Blakeney in Norfolk, after returning from a shift at a local hotel with a headache. Mr Nelson's parents watched as his condition deteriorated, culminating in him coughing up blood and collapsing on the bathroom floor. His father Sidney Nelson, 59, and stepmother Haylie Wardhaugh, 45, dialled 999 at 11.15pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 1am the next day - taking more than six times longer than targets dictate. By the time he arrived at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nothing could be done to save his life. In September the East of England Ambulance Trust was branded chaotic by a coroner investigating the death of three-month-old Bella Hellings. Bella stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in Thetford, Norfolk and died before ambulance crews arrived. Coroner William Armstrong branded the waiting time of 26 minutes - more than three times longer than national targets dictate - ‘wholly indefensible'. The inquest at Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how an emergency first response car struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not up-to-date and 'there were too many blue doors'. Nora Dennington, who died aged 73. She waited four hours for an ambulance on the day she died . In June an inquiry was opened after a 14-year-old girl died from an asthma attack while an ambulance went to the wrong address. Paramedics were called when Elouise Keeling, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets meeting at an RAF base. But a call handler is said to have sent the ambulance to another base seven miles away. By the time a second ambulance arrived at the correct location, crews were unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene. Nora Dennington, 95, spent her last day alive waiting for an ambulance in agony - for almost four hours. In November 2012, Eric Dennington, 73, said he felt totally helpless as he could do nothing for his dying mother Nora except try to reassure her that paramedics were on their way. Her son Eric Dennington, of Trimley St Mary, near Ipswich, Suffolk, said that when the 999 vehicle finally arrived it was a St John Ambulance. And in a new cruel blow the crew were not able to administer the crucial morphine his mother so desperately needed.","East of England Ambulance Trust under fire over response times .

Peter Watton is accused of raping a woman jogger just 48 hours after he was released early from prison . A convicted kidnapper raped a woman jogger just 48 hours after he was released early from prison, a court has heard. Peter Watton, 38, pounced on the 44-year-old victim while she was out running with her dog close to the Duke of Westminster’s estate, in Chester, a jury was told. The 6ft 3in well-built convict allegedly held the terrified woman captive for nine hours as he repeatedly raped her. He carried out the terrifying attack just two days after he was released on licence halfway through a six-year prison sentence for kidnap and robbery, Chester Crown Court heard. Watton repeatedly raped the woman in woodland alongside Duke’s Drive just outside the centre of Chester, it was alleged, then took her to a ‘hidey hole’ on the edge of a field before attacking her again. He then took her down to the edge of the River Dee where he committed a further rape, holding her captive for a total of nine hours, the jury was told. The jury was told Watton had also attempted to violently abduct another young woman in 1999, putting his hand up her skirt and trying to seize control of her car. Owen Edwards, prosecuting, said Watton’s licence conditions on his release from HMP Risley for the later kidnapping required him to sign on with Chester Probation Service and to live at his mother’s address on the Lache estate in the city. But he said that on June 14 last year at around 3pm he confronted the woman, shoved her into woodland and told her: ‘I’ve been watching you for two weeks. I know where you live. If you say anything to anyone I’ll hurt you and hurt your family.’ ‘He subjected her to the most degrading of sexual attacks,’ said Mr Edwards. ‘He treated her as a sexual plaything.’ Near the end of her ordeal the woman, who had just been forced to perform a sex act on Watton on her knees in the mud near waterworks on the edge of the River Dee, managed to escape around midnight while his jeans were around his ankles, the jury heard. Peter Watton is accused of raping a woman jogger near the River Dee and holding her captive for nine hours . Mr Edwards said she used a local couple’s telephone to call police, telling them her attacker, who had various tattoos, had the name Pete etched on his knuckles. Police went to Watton’s house but found he had fled. A five-day manhunt was triggered and Watton was eventually discovered hiding under a railway bridge in Rossett. He had been spotted by an off-duty special constable as he crossed a railway line between Chester and Wrexham. ‘As the constable looked out of his window he recognised Peter Watton from the pictures released to the police and press,’ said Mr Edwards. ‘Despite the defendant’s best efforts to conceal himself he is 6 feet 3 ins tall and muscle-bound and therefore quite distinctive.’ During the alleged rapes at the first location Watton, who was wearing a hooded top, told the woman he had a knife. After making her crouch on all fours in the mud he tied her hands behind her back with a rope or laces, Mr Edwards said, before raping her then telling her to get dressed and taking her to his ‘hidey hole’ where more abuse took place. ‘He decided to show his knife and thrust it in and out of the ground. ‘They clambered over a fence and he told her they were heading for the river. ‘They approached an area near some waterworks and she was very scared he intended to murder her. ‘Once again she found herself on her knees performing oral sex upon the defendant.’ After making her escape and contacting police, the woman was taken for medical examination. Watton claims the sex was consensual and was a ‘brief passionate encounter,’ Mr Edwards added. The prosecution dismiss this as a ‘preposterous tale.’ ‘If the defendant is right or might be right, the woman has chosen to accuse a man with who she had consensual sex, of violently abducting her against his will,’ said Mr Edwards. ‘The complainant in this case was not to know that by Mr Watton’s own admission in 1999 he had attempted to violently abduct another young woman. ‘He had tried to abduct her in her own car and he had put his hand up her skirt.’ Watton, of Lache, Chester, denies eight counts of rape, two of assault by penetration and one of false imprisonment by ‘unlawfully and injuriously imprisoning and detaining the woman against her will.’ The case continues.","Peter Watton, 38, allegedly pounced on the 44-year-old victim while she was jogging in Chester .

A Russian supermodel who claimed £83,000 seized by police in one of the biggest crackdowns on organised crime was lawfully hers has lost her case at the Old Bailey today. Oxana Zubakova, 37, who has modelled for Armani and Dior, said the cash, which was entirely in 500 euro notes, did not come from her criminal ex-boyfriend Tarik Meghrabi. Meghrabi, 42, is serving five years and nine months after being convicted of a £35million money laundering scam. His father Ziad is doing a 10-year stretch for similar offences. Oxana Zubakova (pictured with the entrepreneur Luca Del Bono) claims money seized from the box by police was lawfully given to her by another man . The Serious Organised Crime Agency . (SOCA) - now known as the National Crime Agency - confiscated the contents . of Ms Zubakova’s safety deposit box, which was opened three weeks after . Ziad Meghrabi was jailed, when they raided more than 6,000 boxes as part of . Operation Rize in June 2008. They said they had ‘reasonable grounds to suspect the money was the proceeds of crime.’ During . the raids they recovered more than £53million in cash, some of which . had been stuffed into supermarket bags, at deposit box centres in . Hampstead, Edgware and Park Lane, as well as jewellery, gold, drugs, . weapons, artworks and fake ID documents. The 37-year-old former model said a wealthy businessman funded her lavish lifestyle after the pair met in Majorca in 2004 . SOCA . were granted an order allowing them to forfeit the cash from Ms . Zubakova’s box, plus a £5,500 Tiffany pendant and an £11,000 Cartier . necklace found inside, which were gifts from her former boyfriend. He was also a co-signatory on the box although there is no evidence he ever accessed it himself. But last week Ms Zubakova appeared via videolink from Moscow to try and claim it back. She . told the court it had come from her own earnings and money given to her . by an elderly ‘friend’- Majorcan millionaire Miguel Buadas, who had . been bankrolling her since she met him in 2004. But a panel of justices headed by Recorder Martyn Levett threw the case out. Judge Levett said: 'We have reached a conclusion and are unanimously of the view that this application should be dismissed.' He added he would give full reasons for the decision on Friday. The . court heard the ex-model, who now runs her own modelling agency OMM, . lived a lavish lifestyle of ‘glamour and luxury travel’ and often had . thousands of euros in cash ‘because that was how she got paid.’ She . was a professional athlete before winning a $250,000 contract with . Elite models after coming first in a modelling competition in Russia . when she was 15. From then . on she travelled the world working for fashion houses Giorgio Armani, . Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Etro among other major . international brands. She . said hotelier Mr Buadas, who made £50million from selling the five star . Hotel Formentor in Majorca in 2006, splashed out on apartments for her . in Moscow and Barcelona and put £250,000 into a Channel Island bank . account for her to spend. He . also subsidised her jet set life by ensuring she had access to . thousands from bank accounts in Russia and Spain, the court was told. Ms Zubakova was able to purchase a £113,000 Mercedes in cash and once withdrew £70,000 in just one week. And she had amassed a personal fortune of over £500,000 in her own bank account in Russia. Her barrister Philip Hackett QC said she was a wealthy Russian in her own right before she even met the Meghrabis. But . lawyers for SOCA said they had reason to believe she was stashing the . cash for Tarik Meghrabi to potentially use at a later date. The . court heard the couple, who dated from 2005 to 2008, lived in a swanky . Mayfair apartment and had shared bank accounts and credit cards, . including a premier American Express card they could book exclusuive . concierge services through. But Ms Zubakova claimed she always paid her way throughout the relationship. The model did not appear in court today but will be notified of the decision through her barrister.

A conman who staged a ‘crash for cash’ prang involving his stepdaughter’s best friend has been jailed for 10 months. Mohammed Khalid, 53, deliberately swerved his Vauxhall Corsa in front of a teenage motorist at a roundabout exit on the A4 near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He then slammed on his brakes to cause an accident, before filing an insurance claim. He persuaded 22-year-old Zanbi Mirza - his stepdaughter's best friend - to take part in the prang so he could blame it on her, Southwark Crown Court heard. Khalib, from Ilford, Essex, has now been imprisoned after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud. The court heard Khalib's white Vauxhall Corsa and a silver vehicle - carrying Mirza and an unknown Asian man - had been travelling around the Thicket Road roundabout at around 9pm. They deliberately swerved in front of a car driven by teenage driver Thomas Griffiths, before suddenly braking - leading to a three-car pile-up. Following the crash in March last year, Khalib handed his insurance details - under the name of Mirza - to Mr Griffiths. He then told his insurance company that his £2,600 vehicle had been 'written off', the court heard. However, police later found Khalib's car parked on the driveway outside his home with 'little damage'. Sally Fudge, prosecuting, said: 'This is a “crash for cash” staged vehicle accident. Scene: Khalid deliberately swerved his Vauxhall Corsa in front of a teenage motorist at the Thicket Roundabout (pictured) on the A4 near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He then slammed on his brakes to cause an accident . ‘As Mr Griffiths got to the roundabout, he allowed two vehicles to come around the roundabout and then he pulled out behind them. 'He left a gap between his car and the white Vauxhall Corsa as they approached the exit for the A4, but at the last moment the cars swerved sharply to the right. ‘The two cars were acting in unison and caused the crash to the innocent third party.' Khalid, who was born in Pakistan, told police that Mirza had planned to stage an accident for money because she was unemployed. However, officers later discovered the fraudster had transferred ownership . of the car and his insurance policy to Mirza just days before the . accident - with a view to blaming her if they were caught. Jailed: The conman is now facing 10 months in jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud at Southwark Crown Court (pictured). Mirza has been handed a 240-hour community order after admitting the same charge . Sentencing Khalib, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told him: 'This was despicable behaviour - not just getting Ms Mirza involved but diminishing your responsibility by blaming her.' He added: ‘This case is a good example of how . this type of offence does cause physical danger - two cars acting in . concert causing a crash. ‘Thankfully, . in this case, nobody was hurt, but it takes little imagination to see . the physical and psychological injury that can be caused by . orchestrating a car accident like this.'

"By . Ray Massey . PUBLISHED: . 11:24 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 6 January 2014 . Nissan has launched a new version of the London black cab, featuring an engine it claims will be far more environmentally friendly than any of its rivals. The new taxi, which comes with a 1.6 litre petrol engine instead of the 2.5 litre diesel one fitted in the majority of the capital's cabs, is designed to mix innovation and tradition - embracing the large round headlights and over-sized grilles that have been synonymous with London taxis for decades. Nissan says the new taxi will be available to any city that wants to embrace the black cab, not just London, and although the Japanese car giant has a large manufacturing plant in Sunderland, the vehicle will instead be built in Barcelona. Green and black: The Nissan taxi promises to be environmentally cleaner than existing cabs, offering 32 miles to the gallon and CO2 emissions of 132g/km. An electric 'zero emission' version is to follow in 2015 . The launch has stoked up a taxi-war among rival manufacturers . Priced at around £30,000, the Nissan cab ditches diesel in favour of a frugal petrol-powered 1.6 litre six-speed automatic taxi which will be launched in December this year. It promises to be cleaner and greener than existing cabs, offering 32 miles to the gallon and CO2 emissions of 132g/km. An electric-powered 'zero emission' version of the Nissan taxi is to follow in 2015. Launching the 'new face' of its taxi for London, a Nissan spokesman said: 'It has been re-designed to make it instantly recognisable as one of the capital’s iconic black cabs.' Nissan's first stab at creating its own version of the famous London Hackney Carriage came in August 2012 when it unveiled a prototype based on its successful multi-purpose NV200 van. But the taxi version didn’t quite hit the mark. The new Nissan taxi will be available to any city that wants to take on the black cab. But despite the car manufacturer having a large plant in Sunderland, the groundbreaking vehicle will be built in Barcelona . The new Nissan taxi has been designed using 'feedback' from a number of sources, including Boris Johnson and Transport for London. Strict guidelines seek to protect not only the safety and efficiency of London taxis, but also the black cab's iconic design. As a result, the new Nissan features large, round headlights and an over-sized grille to ensure it mirrors the traditional black cab look. Elsewhere, the taxi has a 25-foot turning circle - the minimum required by Transport for London, who insist all cabs are able to pick-up and drop-off passengers in the narrow road outside the Savoy Hotel. The Nissan taxi also features a panoramic glass roof designed to appeal to tourists, antibacterial seat covers, and ultra-fast sliding doors which allow passengers to make a swift exit if they are going to be sick. Finally Nissan have removed cup-holders from their taxi as research suggests passengers are more likely to lose their wallets and phones in them than use them for drinks. So in response to 'feedback'  from London Mayor Boris Johnson, Transport for London and other key organisations, Nissan's Paddington design team - who also created the best-selling Qashqai and Juke models - redesigned the vehicle 'to better reflect the iconic nature of the traditional black cab'. This included fitting round headlamps and a re-modelled grille mirroring the traditional black cab 'face', adding LED lighting to improve visibility of the traditional taxi sign, and creating completely new front bumper panels. To be allowed to ply its trade in the capital, the  new Nissan taxi has to the strict Transport for London regulations governing Hackney Carriages, including the required 25-foot turning circle which allows it to pick-up and drop-off outside the narrow confines of the Savoy Hotel. A panoramic glass roof helps sight-seers, but Nissan went further. Nissan's global chief planning officer . and executive vice president Andy Palmer, noted: 'It included fitting antibacterial seat fabric, no cup-holders because passengers leave their . mobile phones in them, and sliding doors that aren’t a hazard to . cyclists.' Most practically he noted: 'They also wanted doors that can open fast in case the passenger wants to be sick.' Expecting the worst: One of the key features of the new Nissan taxi is an ultra-fast door release, allowing passengers to exit the vehicle quickly if they are going to be sick . Nissan stress the taxi will be . available to any other town or city across the UK which wants a new take . on the traditional black cab. But . although Nissan has a big factory at Sunderland, the new taxi will be . built in Barcelona. Engineers at European Nissan Technical Centre in . Cranfield, Bedfordshire have worked on the cab  however, and have been running . real-world trials on the streets of London. Nissan design chief Darryl Scriven, said: 'The main challenges were concerned with making sure customers can easily recognise it as a taxi. Being in London, we were able to go out and talk to cabbies about what was important to them as well as look at the vehicle from a customer’s viewpoint. 'The Mayor’s office and taxi drivers were . very keen that we maintain the character of the Hackney Carriage, . making it something that people in the city can be proud of.' Rivals: Mercedes-Benz has entered the capital’s taxi cab-market with its own Vito cabs (left). The London Taxi Company (right) went into administration in 2012 and was bought by Chinese car-maker Geely for £11 million . Nissan already has link to the London taxi market, with its 2.7-litre TD27 diesel engine fitted to the FX4 ‘Fairway’ and TX1 black cabs during the 1980s and 90s. Nissan dealer Glyn Hopkin has been appointed as the exclusive retailer to sell the Nissan NV200 Taxi for London from a purpose-built showroom at London's Canary Wharf. Long-standing cab-maker London Taxi Company (LTC), which used to be known as LTI, went into administration in October 2012 and was bought by Chinese car-maker Geely for £11million.

The manager of a restaurant in Bali where mother and daughter died on first day of their holiday claims he ate the same fish suspected of poisoning the pair. Noelene Bischoff, 54, and her daughter Yvana, from Queensland, died within hours of arriving on the holiday island to stay at Padang Bai Beach Resort, in Karangasem, on Bali's east coast. They dined at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant attached to the resort on Friday night after checking in that afternoon. Noelene Bischoff, 54, and her daughter Yvana, from Queensland, died within hours of arriving on the holiday island to stay at Padang Bai Beach Resort, in Karangasem, on Bali's east coast . It is understood that at 1.15am on Saturday the daughter begged for help from hotel security, saying she and her mother were ill . But in the early hours of Saturday Yvaana raised the alarm that her and her mother were not well. Mrs Bischoff's brother-in-law, Kevin Bowe, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation last night that a government report suggested mother and daughter had died from eating fish in Ubud. 'On the news this morning they said something different' - a reference to suggestions the couple might have died from an allergy - 'but we've been told it is fish they've eaten. 'We are sticking to that at the moment. That was the report from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).' But the resort's hotel manager Giovanni Bareato denied this claim. 'It's a big fish so we would have eaten the same one,' Mr Mr Bareato told The Australian. 'We haven't fallen ill and I know of no one else who has fallen ill from the food.' He said he did not believe the fish was toxic and a doctor had told him he suspected the mother and daughter had a food allergy. They dined at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant attached to the resort on Friday night after checking in that afternoon . The bill for the meal shows the mother and daughter had juices, lemon tea, chicken, pizza and fish . The resort's hotel manager Giovanni Bareato denied the claim of food poisoning . Today it was revealed that Bali police had been advised not to carry on an autopsy through a letter   from the Australian consulate. 'It didn't detail why they refused the autopsy,' Adnan Pangibu, the criminal investigation chief in Karangasem, said reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Without an autopsy it's going to be very difficult for us to investigate further.' Sydney's Sunday Telegraph said today that it was understood from sources that at 1.15am on Saturday the daughter begged for help from hotel security, saying she and her mother were ill. Arrangements were made to take the mother to a nearby medical clinic, said the paper, and the daughter was taken by ambulance on the road to the Bali International Medical Clinic in the island's capital, Denpasar. But both died in ambulances on the way to the separate clinics, police and clinic staff told the paper. The manager of the restaurant in Ubud where the pair had dinner shortly before falling ill has denied to the ABC that the food served there was to blame for the deaths. Mr Giovanni Bareato told the broadcaster that the restaurant was full of clients eating similar dishes to the ones Mrs Bishcoff and her daughter had ordered and he had not heard of anyone complaining about feeling ill. 'The cause of death could be a food allergy,' he said. There were no immediate reports of anyone else who was staying at the Padang Bai Beach Resort in the Karangasem district falling ill . Mr Bowe said mother and daughter often went on holidays together and had just arrived in Bali for a two week holiday. Mrs Bischoff worked as a nurse at the Caloundra Hospital, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, and she had cared for her elderly mother while raising her daughter as a single parent. 'She'd done a great job, looking after the whole family and made a good living,' said Mr Bowe. 'She relied on no-one else. She did it all on her own. She was quite independent.' The family, he said, had given permission for post mortem examinations to be carried out so the cause of death can be confirmed. The . mother was found to have died in the ambulance on the way to the Penta . Medica Clinic in Karangasem at about 1.30am, said Mr Putu Darsana, the . clinic's manager. The . paper said it had been told by police sources that the two women may . have suffered a 'food allergy' which led to their deaths only hours . after checking in to their hotel. Medicines . from Australia found in their hotel room have been sent to a . laboratory, while post-mortem examinations on mother and daughter have . yet to be carried out to establish the exact cause of death. The autopsies are not expected to be performed until Monday. Resort manager Vanni Bareato told The Sunday Mail the mother and daughter had spent the evening in Ubud before returning to the hotel at 8pm. Five hours later, Yvana was begging security staff for help, saying both she and her mother were ill in their room. The manager followed the teenager to hospital and told her not to worry but when he returned to the resort to collect their passports he received a phone call telling him the mother had died and her daughter had taken a turn for the worse. She died a short time later. 'We run a small resort of 30 people and this has never happened,"" Mr Bareato told the paper. 'You cannot be prepared for something like this. It's unbelievable.' Grasienne Bischoff, Noelene's niece and Yvana's cousin, said the family was in shock and the pair had been very close. Police in Australia said the family had asked for privacy. 'Our condolences are with the family and the family have asked that their privacy be respected during this difficult time,' said a spokesman for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. On its website, the Padang Bai Beach Resort describes itself as the 'ultimate dive resort on the east coast of Bali'. Garden bungalows start from $65 a night. Among the tests that are likely to be carried out in the post mortems will be checks to establish if mother and daughter died of a food allergy, such as from eating peanut-laced foods. Sauces made from peanuts are common throughout Bali. Peanut allergy usually affects children - but adults can be harmed too. Eating the nut, or products of it, can cause severe physical symptoms, the most dangerous effect being anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention to avoid unconsciousness or death. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has estimated that peanut allergy is one of the most common causes of food-related death.","Noelene Bischoff, 54, and her daughter Yvana, were from Queensland .

A . meeting of the Ningxia Communist Party committee on Monday blamed poor . organization and insufficient management for the stampede, according to . Xinhua. Four of the 10 people hospitalized were in critical condition, Xinhua said. In 2012, two people reportedly died in the Ningxia region after fighting broke out between crowds of Muslims and police, after a mosque was ordered to be demolished for being an ‘illegal religious place’. Violence erupted in the town of Hexi after 1,000 officers arrived to help police the knocking down of the building. More than 50 protesters were injured and 100 arrested after several hundred members of China's Muslim Hui minority tried to stop the demolition.

Sources from the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy  said two people died in the clashes. An employee who answered the phone at the town police station confirmed officers had fought with protesters and said 80 people were detained, but denied any deaths. The Communist government closely monitors religious activity and is said to be worried that mosques and other houses of worship might become centres for anti-government agitation. The Hui, who mainly live in Ningxia, are one of several Muslim minority groups in China. They include descendants of Muslim immigrants from Central Asia, members of China's majority Han ethnicity who converted to Islam and several other groups.","The incident occurred Sunday at a mosque in Guyuan in the Ningxia region .

They already have a hit reality TV show, as well as best-selling fashion, beauty and perfume lines in their hometown of America. But clearly not content with their stateside success, the Kardashian sisters seem intent on infiltrating the British high-street with their eponymous product ranges. Kim, Khloe and Kourtney have unveiled the first-ever Kardashian Kollection Jewellery range - for Argos. They're taking over the world! The Kardashian sisters have unveiled their new jewellery range for Argos . Argos, the store where shoppers choose goods from a lamented catalogue and then sit and wait for them to be delivered via a conveyor belt, are the exclusive stockists of the 25-piece collection. The range, which will be available from November 11, has apparently been designed by the Kardashian sisters to reflect a mix of their signature styles, as well as a nod to the SS14 catwalks. Not exactly glamorous: Argos will be stocking the 25-strong collection of jewellery, which features gold chain and gun detailed designs . The collection has three themes: Sleek, Glamour and Modern '80s - and features jewel, chain and gun metal detailing. Featuring nine necklaces, five bracelets, three rings and eight pairs of earrings, the sisters hope that this new line will be a huge hit with fans up and down the country. Alice Rigby, Jewellery Buyer for Argos said: 'The Kardashians are famous for their style and have unparalleled knowledge of the latest trends. Is that where Kanye got the ring from? While Kim's engagement ring is reported to have cost as much as $6m (£3.7m), her range at Argos only goes up to £35 . Geometric heart charm long necklace, £24.99 . Geometric double charm long necklace, £24.99 . KK Sovereign charm necklace, £24.99 . KK sovereign charm bracelet, £19.99 . Pyramid stretch bracelet, £17.99 . KK curb chain necklace, £24.99 . 'This collection reflects their passion for glamour and style with bold shapes and intricate detailing. 'As the only retailer to sell the entire collection in the UK, Argos is proud to be bringing the collection to UK fans.' Keeping in line with Argos' purse-friendly price point, The Kardashian Kollection Jewellery will retail up to £35 - a far cry from the reported cost of Kim's engagement ring from Kayne West, which is rumoured to have cost as much as $6m (£3.75m). The ambitious sisters, who reportedly raked in $250m (£154m) in clothes sales last year alone, already have plans to roll out more jewellery ranges in the store in January, March and May 2014.","Argos have exclusive selling rights to the 25-piece collection .

Electric buggies might be popular on luxurious golf courses among older players, but a new invention is set to make the sport more appealing to the next generation of golfers. Called GolfBoard, it is a cross between a skateboard and a buggy and is fitted with gearboxes similar to those found in cars. Golfers can use the board to 'surf' over the varied terrain of a course at various speeds using a handheld controller, and its 80-year-old designer believes it could one day replace conventional buggies. Scroll down for video . Don Wildman, inventor of the GolfBoard hopes the quirky vehicle will attract younger people to the sport and do for golf what 'snowboarding did for skiing.' Inventor Don Wildman from Miami, told . the Courier Mail: 'It's an old man's sport. I know if I had kids, they . would really like to come out and play golf if they got to ride around . on...an electric skateboard.' He added he hopes the board does for golf what 'snowboarding did for skiing.' The electric board claims to make ‘getting from one shot to the next just as fun as hitting a great drive or approach shot’ as well as speeding up the game. However, coolness comes at a price as each board costs $3,500 (£2,115). The GolfBoard claims to be easy and intuitive to use and feels similar to snowboarding, surfing or skateboarding . It is controlled using a handheld device that controls its speed and braking, while the rider rocks back and forth to steer the board. Riders can select a high or low speed, ranging from 7mph for new users up to the top speed of 11mph, which lets golfers travel at around the same speed as a conventional golf cart. All revved up: Ex-European Tour player Chris van der Velde (right) and 80-year-old Don Wildman ride GolfBoards, which are designed to make golf cool and are controlled by handheld devices as well as riders leaning to steer the boards . It is powered by a 48 volt lithium battery pack built into the base of the board and takes around one-and-a-half hours to charge to provide enough power to navigate 36 holes. The electric board claims to be the first of its kind to be driven by a gearbox that is similar to ones in cars, instead of chains and belts, which can be unreliable and need frequent maintenance. Gearboxes fitted on each end of the board provide power to all four wheels evenly and 'wheel positraction' means the board will not slip on the steepest hills and eliminates ‘spinouts’ on the golf course, which can mark the green, the company said. The pressure on the turf is ‘substantially’ less than that of a golf cart so golfers can ride on fairways without damaging them in wet conditions thanks to tyres that are three-and-a-half inches wide and nine inches tall with specially-designed treads. A flexible ‘spring deck’ works as a shock absorber for a smooth ride, while a ‘bi-directional steering damper’ stops the board from wobbling in transit. The GolfBoard can be ridden in a number of ways depending on the rider's experience. For newer riders, the golf bag can be fixed to the front so that it can also be used as a handle (pictured right), while more experienced riders can use the board like a skateboard, which lets it to move faster . Test drive: A GolfBoard is parked beside a green at the Malibu Golf Club last month. Gearboxes housed on each end of the board provide power to all four wheels evenly so that it won't slip on the steepest hills and stops 'spinouts' on the golf course, which can mark the green . The board measures 50in x 20in x 10in (120cm x 50m x 25cm) so it can be stored in a golf locker or bag. The board is made by SolBoard, which has so far received 2,000 orders for the quirky mode of transportation and begins production next this month. The GolfBoard was on show at a recent charity tournament at Malibu Golf Club and former European Tour player Chris van der Velde was 'surfing the earth' along with Mr Wildman. 'I'm not sure it's a traditional game-changer,' said Mr Van der Velde. 'Some people will push back. Some people won't like it because it's different. They didn't like going from wooden clubs to metal heads. So it'll push people back. But it's pretty cool.' Paul Hodge from SolBoard, said: 'If you really want the industry to grow, and to be accepted by the mass market, you need to kill that stodgy conservative attitude and you need to make it fun...and attract the younger crowds.' Catching a big one: Golfer Van der Velde could almost be surfing as he tries out the GolfBoard in Malibu. He warned that some people will resit the innovation as it's different. 'They didn't like going from wooden clubs to metal heads. So it'll push people back. But it's pretty cool,' he said .","GolfBoard let users ‘surf’ over the varied terrain of a golf course .

The saliva test can show whether a person has smoked within the last three days. The test could be used by doctors who are trying to help their patients give up the habit, as well as by health insurance companies working out their premiums. A test which can tell if a person has smoked a cigarette has been developed by the University of Birmingham . The Saliva SmokeScreen test was created by researchers at the University of Birmingham. It requires the person taking the test to spit into a cup and the person conducting the test can then dip the test into the saliva. It works by detecting cotinine in saliva – this is a breakdown product of nicotine. It cannot establish how many cigarettes a person has smoked, as people smoke different types of cigarettes and in different ways. However, it shows how much nicotine a person has consumed in the last three days. As a result, the test will be positive if a person is using nicotine replacement products, even if they have completely stopped smoking. The test requires a person to spit into a pot and their saliva is then tested for a breakdown product of nicotine . While this could lead to a false positive result for cigarette use, it could also help people establish how much nicotine they need to take to enable them to quit. The test gives a positive or negative result within one minute, but takes six minutes to provide a clear picture of a person’s nicotine consumption. It can pick up passive smoking but the reading would be so insignificant the colour change on the test would not be detectable with the human eye. The results show whether a person has consumed nicotine within the last three days - it can also picked up passive smoking but the colour change would be so small the human eye could not detect it . Dr Graham Cope, honorary senior research fellow at the University of Birmingham, said: ‘Smoking is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases, such as respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. ‘It also causes blood pressure to rise and is linked with high cholesterol levels.’ The Saliva SmokeScreen test is now being used as part of the PruHealth free Vitality Healthcheck programme to verify non-smoking in their policy holders, so they can qualify for relevant incentives. It is also available to any other people or organisations that want to use it.","The Saliva SmokeScreen test requires people to spit into a cup so their saliva can be tested for a breakdown product of nicotine, called cotinine .

Potential cure: Consuming only salad, weight loss shakes and non-starchy vegetables for eight weeks could reverse diabetes, a study has found . A crash diet that has been medically approved could help millions of Britons defeat diabetes. Men and women suffering from the disease were able to throw away their tablets after going on an extreme low-calorie diet for just two months. And 18 months later, some were still free of symptoms and said they were astonished at the dramatic improvement in their health. So far the diet has only been tested on a handful of patients. But a £2.4million trial involving 280 diabetics is about to get under way. These men and women will live on meal replacement shakes and soups. They will be allowed to take in only 800 calories a day – an amount many people will consume in their lunch. Type 2 diabetes, which normally develops in middle age, is the most common form of the condition with 3million sufferers in the UK alone. The disease occurs when the pancreas does not make enough insulin and the insulin that is made does not work properly. Newcastle University’s Professor Roy Taylor believes fat surrounding vital organs could be the key to understanding the condition. This fat is thought to clog up the pancreas and liver, cutting insulin production and stopping insulin from being used properly. But crash dieting plunges the body into starvation mode, the fat is burned off and the vital organs are then freed up. The original trial – involving 11 men and women – found consuming only weight loss shakes, salad and non-starchy vegetables for eight weeks could reverse diabetes. Fat levels in the pancreas returned to normal and the organ was able to pump out insulin without running into any problems. And three months after the end of the diet, seven out of the 11 participants were still diabetes-free. Even 18 months later, at least four of the patients found that they had no signs of diabetes. Gordon Parmley, 69, of Stocksfield in Northumberland, came off his diabetes tablets after taking part in the trial. He said: ‘It’s astonishing really that a diet – hard as it was – could change my health so drastically.’ Disease: Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition with 3million sufferers in the UK alone . And Professor Taylor said: ‘I believe . that this study will lead to a quantum leap forward in our understanding . of how best to manage type 2 diabetes.’ The new, much larger trial, which will be co-led by Glasgow University researcher Mike Lean, will see if the success can be repeated in large numbers of people. It will look at how easy they find it to follow the diet – and see how long they remain healthy after they have started to eat normally again. Professor Lean said: ‘If our analysis shows this approach is both effective and cost-effective, our aim would be to produce a programme that could be implemented in the NHS as soon as possible.’ And Dr Matthew Hobbs from Diabetes UK, which is funding the trial, said: ‘Type 2 diabetes will always be a serious condition. ‘But perhaps it won’t always be seen as a condition that people have to manage for the rest of their lives and one that worsens inevitably over time. ‘If we can do this safely, on a bigger scale as part of routine care, then a low-calorie liquid diet would be a real game changer in terms of reducing people’s risk of devastating health complications such as amputation and blindness.’ However the research has no implications for people with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas is damaged by the body’s own immune system. And the charity has advised people not to embark on the diet themselves, strongly urging anyone determined to try it to speak to their GP first.","Extreme low-calorie diet could help millions of Britons defeat diabetes .

A super-fit father-of-four was diagnosed with breast cancer after feeling a lump in his chest while at the gym. Phil Clarke, 50, was shocked to be diagnosed with the disease which is more than 130 times more common in women than men. Mr Clarke was drying off after his workout when he discovered a lump on his right nipple. Phil Clarke, 50, was diagnosed with breast cancer after finding a lump in his nipple while at the gym . He went to his doctor and was diagnosed with breast cancer – a disease which affects just one in every 100,000 men and only occurs in about 350 men a year in the UK. Mr Clarke said: ‘Men aren’t taught to examine their breasts like women do - it was by complete chance that I found the lump. ‘Having breast cancer was shocking because of the stigma - some men have macho images and only associate breast cancer with women. ‘But I was a keep fit fanatic with a healthy diet and I didn’t smoke but I still got breast cancer. It really can affect anyone.’ Mr Clarke discovered the ‘hard ridge’ in his nipple after showering at his local gym in Cardiff, where he spends nine hours a week working out. The council worker was told that breast cancer is very rare in men - but he went for a mammogram to put his mind at ease. Mr Clarke says he was shocked to learn that he had the disease as he is very fit and has a healthy diet . Only about 350 men a year are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK - around one in every 100,000 . The test found cancer which Mr Clarke claims may have been caused by a faulty gene passed down by his mother, Patricia, who had breast cancer 18 years earlier. Mr Clarke said: ‘I didn’t realise breast cancer could be passed down to men, but it can. ‘I could have ignored it but something in the back of my mind told me to get it checked out and I am so glad I did.’ Mr Clarke had an operation to remove his nipple to get rid of the tumour and is now recovering supported by wife, Jayne, and children Louise, 30, Daryl, 27, and twins Phillip and Sophie, 25. Mr Clarke, who will have to take drug tamoxifen for five years and have regular check-ups, is now trying to raise awareness of male breast cancer. Mr Clarke believes his breast cancer was caused by a faulty gene that he inherited from his mother who also suffered from the disease . Mr Clarke now has to go for regular check-ups and will have to take the drug tamoxifen for five years . He said: ‘I now want to help more men to become aware and not to be afraid or embarrassed to seek treatment - it could save their life. ‘I kept calm but of course I was afraid. I did have some very dark days and in my head I was planning my own funeral. ‘I know I am very lucky to be alive and I appreciate every single day.’ Mr Clarke is set to take part in a charity fashion show for Breast Cancer Care Cymru and will share the catwalk with 23 women who have all been affected by breast cancer. For more info visit www.breastcancercare.org.uk/theshowcardiff . Breast cancer affects about one in every 100,000 men in the UK. About 350 men are diagnosed with the disease each year in the UK. The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. The disease can also cause the nipple to turn in on itself or to give off discharge. The cancer is more common in men who are over the age of 60, who have a family history of the disease and who are obese. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the tumour and then a course of tamoxifen - a drug that blocks the effects of hormones on breast tissue. The outlook for men with breast cancer is not as good as for women with the disease as reduced awareness means it tends to be diagnosed later.

A mother has told of her heartbreak at being diagnosed with breast cancer while she was pregnant with her first child. Gemma Osborn, 31, was diagnosed in June 2010 when she was 30 weeks pregnant with baby Gracie. Ms Osborn, from St Neots, Cambridgeshire, had to have a Caesarean section at 32 weeks so she could begin chemotherapy without her baby being harmed. Gemma Osborn (pictured with her partner, Peter), 31, was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 30 weeks pregnant with their first child, Gracie . Ms Osborn was diagnosed after finding a lump in her breast while rubbing in oil in a bid to prevent stretch marks. Baby Gracie had to be delivered at 32 weeks to allow Ms Osborn to start chemotherapy . She told MailOnline: ‘It was a massive shock. I was only 27 and I had no family history of breast cancer, or of any cancer. ‘The day I was diagnosed was the worst day of my life – it was awful, really awful. ‘I was scared for my life and for my unborn baby’s life.’ Ms Osborn, who lives with her partner, Peter, 29, found a lump in her breast when she was 25 weeks pregnant. She says she believes the pregnancy saved her life as she only found the lump because she was rubbing oil into her breasts in a bid to avoid stretch marks. Ms Osborn told her midwife about the lump and was referred to a GP who believed it was a blocked milk duct. Ms Osborn (pictured with Gracie at her christening) had five months of chemotherapy followed by a double mastectomy and radiotherapy . Gracie only weighed 4lb 1oz when she was born and she had to spend a month in special care. Ms Osborn started chemotherapy nine days after the birth . She was told to return for a check-up three weeks later. When she saw the doctor again, the lump had grown significantly and she was sent for an ultrasound scan and a biopsy. On June 4, 2010 she was told she had breast cancer. She said: ‘When we went to get the results were not really concerned at all – no one thought it was anything. ‘I wasn’t worried at all – we just thought it was the blocked milk duct. ‘When I was told, it was like this massive blow. I just said “I don’t want to die” and the doctor said he’d get me fixed. It was horrendous.’ Ms Osborn (pictured before her illness) said: 'It was a massive shock being diagnosed. I was only 27 and I had no family history of cancer. The day I was diagnosed was the worst day of my life - it was awful, really awful' Ms Osborn says her partner, Peter, was her 'rock' throughout her treatment and that she believes she would not be here today were it not for him . Ms Osborn and her partner had a meeting with their midwives and oncologists and it was agreed that Gracie would be delivered at 32 weeks and then chemotherapy would begin as soon as Ms Osborn had recovered from the Caesarean. Ms Osborn, an admin worker and beauty therapist, said: ‘Waiting without treatment was horrendous. ‘I felt trapped in my body and I thought I could feel the lump growing. ‘All the excitement of the baby was taken away and I felt robbed of the labour and birth.’ Gracie was born on June 16, 2010 weighing just 4lb 1oz and had to spend a month in special care. Nine days after the birth, Ms Osborn started five months of chemotherapy followed by a double mastectomy at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, in Huntingdon. Ms Osborn (pictured with Gracie during her chemotherapy) believed she had been left infertile by her treatment but conceived her second child six months after finishing chemotherapy . In January 2011 she also had a course of radiotherapy at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. She said: ‘The care that I received was just amazing. The NHS was amazing – I couldn’t fault them. ‘All of my treatment has been spot on.’ During Ms Osborn’s treatment, she says she was put on drugs to put her ovaries to sleep and stop them being damaged. As a result, she stopped having periods and believed she was not fertile. Ms Osborn (pictured with Peter and Gracie during her treatment) said: 'When I was told, it was like this massive blow. I just said ""I don't want to die"" and the doctor said he'd get me fixed. It was horrendous' However, in the summer of 2011 she took her daughter to the GP and while she was in the waiting room she noticed a sign showing the symptoms of ovarian cancer. She immediately panicked as she had all of the symptoms and was aware of the link between breast cancer and ovarian cancer. She booked herself an emergency appointment with the GP and explained she had been feeling bloated and needing to urinate more frequently. The doctor carried out a pregnancy test and informed Ms Osborn that she was 17 weeks pregnant. She said: ‘I was so relieved that it was not cancer but I was terrified that I wouldn’t be able to keep the baby – I had been told not to get pregnant until two years after I finished my cancer treatment so my body had time to recover.’ Ms Osborn discussed the pregnancy with her oncologist who worked out she must have conceived about six months after her chemotherapy ended. Ms Osborn believes that having Gracie saved her life and the couple see Finley as their miracle baby . This meant the drugs would have just had time to leave her body meaning her baby should not be harmed by them. As a result, she continued with the pregnancy and Finley was born in January 2012. Ms Osborn said: ‘He is our miracle baby. We feel so blessed. I think Gracie saved my life as I wouldn’t have found the lump if I hadn’t been pregnant and Finley is our miracle. ‘I don’t know how he hid away for so long – he is a little fighter, a total soldier. He just battles through everything.’ Finley had to be delivered by C-section at 36 weeks because Ms Osborn developed pre-eclampsia. He weighed just 4lb 10oz and when he was five weeks old he ended up in intensive care with bronchiolitis – a respiratory tract infection. Ms Osborn has been in remission for three years but will have regular check-ups for another two years . Ms Osborn (pictured before her illness) and Peter are currently planning their wedding which is set to take place in June 2014 . Ms Osborn has now been in remission for three years but will continue to go for check-ups for another two. She said: ‘We just pray every day that it doesn’t come back. There is nothing else we can do. ‘Peter has been amazing. He is my rock. I protected my mum and dad from how I was feeling but Peter was the person I could be honest in front of. ‘He took the brunt of everything – he shaved my head, he saw me at my worst. ‘Without him I wouldn’t be here today. He coped really well even though he was only 25 and had a new baby and a sick girlfriend. Ms Osborn said: 'We just pray every day that it doesn't come back. There is nothing else we can do' The couple are now planning their wedding which is to take place in June 2014. Gracie will be a flower girl and Finley, a page boy. Ms Osborn said: ‘We can’t wait.

Tseng Lien-fa was catching baby eels on a beach in Hualien   county, off the island's east coast early Friday, when he was swept away by a huge freak wave.

'I managed to hold on as the first wave hit me on the chest, but I was overwhelmed by the second and bigger wave,' he told the United Daily News. The 42-year-old managed to hold on to the lid until early Sunday. There was no explanation of why the lid was present in the sea. 'On the lid, I was drifting and drifting ... during that period I hoped I could be picked up by any ships passing by,' he said.

Strong waves eventually swept him onto a beach in the southeastern county of Taitung, 75 kilometres (46 miles) away from where his ordeal began, the reports said. Coastguards mobilised to search for Tseng found him lying on the beach around noon Sunday. Doctors said he had suffered slight dehydration and developed sores on his arms due to seawater immersion. 'Considering the fact that he had not taken in any food or water while drifting at sea for 60 hours and he remained conscious, all I could say about him was that this was a miracle,' said Chen Tien-su, a doctor at Hualien Hospital. Tseng had been catching eels to make extra money since his fiancee is expecting a baby next month. He has now promised her the fishing expeditions will stop.","Tseng Lien-fa, 42, hit by a freak wave as he fished on a beach in Taiwan .

Families have been urged to boost their health in the New Year by abandoning fatty and sugary foods in favour of slimline alternatives. A new Government campaign claims that if the average family replaces fizzy drinks with sugar-free alternatives, it will cut sugar consumption by three quarters of a bag in just a month. And drinking semi-skimmed instead of whole milk can reduce fat intake by the equivalent of a third of a pint. Campaign: Change4Life is issuing new adverts to urge families to switch to healthier food and drink . The Change4Life 'Smart Swaps' campaign, launched to coincide with the start of 2014, also encourages people to use low-fat alternatives to cheese and butter. Breakfast cereal is another target of the initiative, with families urged to cut out sugary treats in the morning and replace them with healthier options. Public Health England, which is behind the campaign, insists that eating healthily need not be more expensive, and is offering vouchers for low-fat and sugar-free foods to encourage families to change their habits. 'Swapping like-for-like food in our diet could help cut out surprising levels of saturated fat, sugar and ultimately calories without having to give up the kinds of food we like,' said Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE. 'We all eat too much saturated fat and sugar which can increase our calorie intake. Together this increases our risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. Shocking: This ad shows how much sugar is in every can and bottle of fizzy drink . 'We're committed to doing as much as possible to support families to make these swaps, which is why I'm pleased to announce that hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of offers will be available to those who sign up to Smart Swaps and in store across hundreds of shops in England.' Public health minister Jane Ellison added: 'We know how difficult it can be to make big changes to your diet which is why this new Change4Life campaign suggests small changes as a step in the right direction. 'With over 60 per cent of adults and a third of 10- and 11-year-olds overweight or obese, it is really important that we keep helping people make better choices about their diet.' However, the fizzy drinks industry has criticised the new campaign, claiming it gives a 'deliberately negative' and distorted picture of their products. 'We are disappointed that for the second year in succession this campaign heavily targets soft drinks which provide just two per cent of the calories in the average adult diet in the UK,' said Gavin Partington of the British Soft Drinks Association.

Miss Oliva, who lives in Purranque, Chile, said that the pain is ‘indescribable’, The Sun reported. Scroll down for video . Yaritza Oliva recently started crying blood and has doctors baffled . The 20-year-old said that the pain in her eyes is 'indescribable' When she visited the doctor no infection was found so she was sent home with eye drops. But, her parents, who cannot afford to send her to an appropriate medical expert, have asked friends and neighbours to help them raise funds for her. Father, Jose, made an appeal on a local news programme. Her family is asking for financial help so she can undergo treatment from appropriate experts . Doctors believe it may be a case of haemolacria, a condition that has only been diagnosed three times before . Haemolacria is the condition that makes sufferers cry tears of blood. The tears can either have a red tinge or appear as though they are entirely made of blood. While the visual impact of haemolacria is powerful and may be very scary, it is not always cause for concern . It is a symptom of many diseases and may be indicative of a tumour in the system that produces tears. It can also be provoked by conjunctivitis, environmental damage or injuries. There have been cases of Haemolacria induced by hormones in grown women. Some researchers suggest that it is connected to extreme stress or psychological upset. The carpenter said: ‘Please put your hands over your hearts, see our situation and help my daughter.’ Some experts have suggested that Miss Oliva has a condition called haemolacria. The rare condition causes sufferers to cry tears of blood. Haemolacria can indicate a more serious illness, such as a tumour and can be caused by high levels of hormones in women. A teenage boy was diagnosed with haemolacria in 2009 after he cried blood three times a day. Calvino Inman, 15, from Tennessee, said that he had no warning when the tears were about to occur. He said that sometimes he could not feel them, and others it was like a burning sensation. He and his mother appeared on television to appeal for help, but they did not find a cure. Very little is known of the condition. the 20-year-old now cries tears of blood several times every day and is in an extreme amount of pain .

Declared dead: The California court allowed Jahi McMath's parents to remove her from hospital and keep her alive elsewhere only after a coroner issued a death certificate . The body of 13-year-old Jahi McMath left brain dead after a tonsil operation was released to her mother last night. Jahi left Oakland's Children’s Hospital & Research Center about 7.50pm in a critical care ambulance to the home of her mom, Latasha Winkfield. The teenager's uncle said the family was 'ecstatic'. 'I was with her when she left the hospital and the family is very grateful for this day,' Omari Sealey said. 'We are pleased she is away from Children's Hospital which has been trying to pull the plug on my niece since December 12th. 'We fought and we fought to make sure she had a chance at recovery. 'She will now be treated like the precious little girl that she is.' Jahi suffered complications following . a routine operation to remove her tonsils at the Oakland hospital on December 9. Her heart stopped, causing brain damage which the . hospital said left her brain dead with no chance . of survival if a respirator was turned off. Three . doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital . applied to turn off her life support machine, with the Alameda County . Coroner issuing a death certificate. However Jahi's family won an injunction preventing the hospital switching off life support . and agreed to a ‘protocol’ with the hospital in which the teenager could . be transferred while on a ventilator. The hospital last night said it wished the family 'closure' over the traumatic affair. 'Our hearts go out to the family as they . grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace,' they said in a statement. Devastated: Jahi's parents arrive at court Friday. They are fighting to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery . Willing and able: New Beginnings Community Center founder Allyson Scerri said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for Jahi . The . news comes after the girl's family yesterday said they had ‘everything . in place’ to move Jahi from the hospital to a long term care facility. Christopher Dolan, the lawyer representing Jahi's family, said his clients had medical staff, transport and a . new home for the teenager and were just about to ‘get it all in motion’. While it is not clear where the girl . will be moved to, a New York facility run by a woman whose father suffered . severe brain trauma in 2007 has offered its services. New Beginnings Community Center founder Allyson Scerri said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for Jahi. 'We . are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open . our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care as an inpatient, . long-term facility for Jahi with the required and appropriate medical . staff that she depends upon,' Scerri said in a letter included in court . documents last week, according to Koco.com. According to the facility's website, Scerri founded the facility after her father, Al Barone, sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007. Seeing . her father, a man of great strength and independence, inadequately . cared for was an unacceptable frustration for Scerri, the website says. The businesswoman told CNN she believes McMath could get better, with appropriate care. 'Her . brain needs time to heal. It's a new injury,' Scerri said. 'We believe . in life after injury, all of us here at New Beginnings have first-hand . experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as . Jahi.' War of words: Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer (right) has accused Christopher Dolan, the lawyer representing Jahi's family (left), of misleading people about Jahi's likely recovery . Oakland's Children's Hospital yesterday insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated. Spokesman Sam Singer yesterday criticized the family's decision to give Jahi 'nutrients' to maintain her brain at optimum efficiency. 'This is a deceased young woman,' Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer told ABC 7. 'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back. 'So . it's really wrong and unethical for Mr. Dolan (the family lawyer) to mislead the family and . the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could . possibly bring back this deceased young woman.' Jahi's family, led by her mother Nailah and uncle Omari Sealey, . have refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance . she could recover. ‘We are in motion,’ Mr Dolan told KPIX 5 yesterday. ‘We . have what we need right now. I have everything in place I just need to . get it moving. I have a medical staff, I have the facilities, we have . the transport, we just need to get it all in motion.’ He said that ‘come hell or high water’ Jahi would be moved before the deadline. Jahi's family has raised more than $47,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. According to the site, more than 1,300 people have donated money in nine days. Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening .","Body of Jahi McMath, 13, released to her mother last night .

Former nanny Louise Woodward has given birth to her first child - 16 years after she was jailed in America for killing a baby in her care. Woodward, now 35, gave birth to a girl last week, close to her due date. The law graduate and husband Anthony Elkes, a businessman, have named their daughter Holly. She was born at the turn of the New Year. Woodward was convicted of shaking eight-month-old Matthew Eappen to death in his home in Boston in 1997 and was jailed for 15 years. She was released after just 279 days when she won an appeal to reduce her conviction to involuntary manslaughter. Woodward, now known as Mrs Elkes, teaches dance classes in a village hall and occasionally bakes celebration cakes for extra cash. She and Mr Elkes, 34, are said to be ‘thrilled’ by their baby’s new arrival but has so far declined to comment on their happy news. It is understood that both mother and child remain in hospital in Shrewsbury but were due to be transferred to a maternity unit closer to Woodward’s home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, imminently. A source said: ‘Mother and baby are both doing well. Louise and Anthony have called the baby Holly. She was born either on New Year’s Eve or maybe New Year’s Day. ‘I’m not sure why they are still in hospital, but Louise had an infection shortly before the birth so the doctors may just be playing it safe because of that. Imprisoned: The birth comes 16 years after the former nanny was jailed in America for killing a baby in her care . Conviction: Woodward was convicted of shaking to death eight-month-old Matthew Eappen, right, in Boston in 1997. She was released after just 279 days when her conviction was reduced to involuntary manslaughter . ‘She was a big baby - over nine pounds. I’m sure they are both delighted - I know Louise couldn’t wait to start a family.’ A man who answered the door at Woodward’s mother Susan’s home in Barnston, Wirral, smiled when asked about the baby, but also declined to comment further. Woodward declined to comment about her pregnancy when approached in the autumn, saying she wished to ‘maintain my privacy’. However she has previously spoken of how she fell in love ‘at first sight’ with her husband Mr Elkes - who runs a truck sales and hire business - at a nightclub in Chester, and said they had been talking about having children within months of getting together in 2006. In love: The law graduate has previously spoken of how she fell in love 'at first sight' with husband Mr Elkes . Speaking to the Daily Mail the following . March, she said: ‘We would love to have a family. We both want that. I . know that it is all very quick, but it just feels right for both of us. ‘Of course, I know that there are some people out there just waiting for me to have a baby so they can say nasty things. ‘That upsets me, but that is not going to stop me leading my life. I am innocent, I have done nothing wrong. I am entitled to enjoy my life, I am not going to apologise for being happy.' Meanwhile, Matthew’s aunt Mary Wong, 52, said Woodward had a ‘right to have a child’, but suggested the woman take parenting classes and learn to control her temper. 'For the sake of her own child I hope she is a better parent,' she said. 'For the sake of her family I hope her parenting skills have come a long way... I think that she needs to have parenting skills and support for her baby. 'I hope no harm comes to the child.' Woodward lived in the Cheshire village of Elton when she flew to the US in 1996 on a gap year following her A-levels. She then landed her dream job as a nanny aged 19 at the Boston home of Debbie and Sunil Eappen. Just 10 weeks later Matthew died of brain injuries. Prosecutors alleged Matthew had shown classic symptoms of shaken baby syndrome, but the defence team argued the death had been caused by an injury the baby sustained weeks before. Despite being jailed for 15 years, a judge downgraded the conviction on appeal and the sentence was reduced to the time Louise had spent on remand. Woodward has always maintained her innocence, and her claims have been backed by various medical experts in recent years. In 2002, she graduated from South Bank University in London with a law degree and later secured a two-year trainee contract with a solicitor’s firm in Oldham, Greater Manchester. She left the firm after a year to go into business with a dance teacher she had begun a relationship with after going to his classes.","Louise Woodward jailed in 1997 for killing eight-month-old Matthew Eappen .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:26 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:14 EST, 6 January 2014 . Footage: The unnamed flight attendant contacted German newspaper Der Spiegel about footage shot of his girlfriend at the spot of Schumacher's crash (pictured) Racing driver Michael Schumacher was skiing at just 12mph when he was thrown into the air and hit his head on a rock, according to a tourist who filmed the accident. A German man who was filming his girlfriend in the ski resort of Meribel has come forward to say the footage includes the moment Michael Schumacher crashed on the slopes. Detectives in France were last night trying to get a copy of the smartphone video after the man, who has not been named, went to German news journal Der Spiegel. Formula One legend Schumacher, 45, who is still in a critical condition in an induced coma, was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow. Der Spiegel said: ‘The man, a 35-year-old flight attendant from Essen, was just a few metres from the accident site on the slopes and was filming his girlfriend. ‘In the background of the film, slightly blurred, a skier can be seen in the unprepared part between the two slopes sliding over the snow. ‘According to the man, who contacted Der Spiegel on Friday, the skier was Schumacher. He is believed to have slowed down to a speed of up to 20kph.’ Police will tomorrow check footage from a tiny digital camera Schumacher wore on his helmet, after his family handed it over. The statement corroborates claims made by Schumacher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm. Earlier this week she denied Schumacher had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 60km/h. She said: 'I think after having spoken with several people who have been with Michael at this moment, Michael and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes. 'Then there is a blue slope and a red slope, and in between there was a part which was deep snow, and Michael went into that. Family support: Yesterday Michael Schumacher's father, Rolf, and brother, Ralf, were seen outside Grenoble Hospital where he remains in an induced coma . 'From everything the people told me, he was not even at high speed, because it seems that he even helped a friend who just had fallen on the piste. 'So he started to ski again, went into this deep snow, and apparently, this is what we guess, has hit a rock which he had not seen when he wanted to do a curve, and he was kind of catapulted into the air and apparently, head down, hitting another rock. 'Which was extreme bad and unfortunate circumstance, and not because he was speeding too much. I have spoken with several people, and also ski teachers, and they tell me it can even happen at 10km/h. It is just very, very unfortunate.' Schumacher has been in a critical condition in intensive care since his accident in the French ski resort of Meribel a week last Sunday. His family has handed police the GoPro camera he wore on his skiing helmet at the time of his accident. Tribute: Crowds have laid tributes on the fence in his home town as hundreds hold silent vigils in Grenoble .

Catholic groups are up in arms with ObamaCare, President Barack Obama's flagship healthcare program, claiming that the government is 'blind' to the full implications of the contraceptive mandate. Catholic groups - led by the Little Sisters of the Poor - are currently challenging the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court. The groups say the ObamaCare requirement for group health plans to provide contraception violates their religious beliefs. Claims: The Little Sisters of the Poor say the US government is 'blind' to the real implications of the contraceptive mandate (library image) On New Year's Eve Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted a temporary injunction which meant the group - and others - can opt out while the challenge continues. However, the government says the injunction should never have been granted as such groups are already exempt through an 'accommodation'. Under an accommodation, religious non-profits sign a form which means contraception is administered - and paid for - through a third party organization. The administration adds the Little Sisters are also part of the Christian Brothers Services - which also exempts them. But Catholics argue they cannot sign away the responsibility to administer contraception to a third party - as they would then be sinning of their behalf. Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer for . the Little Sisters, says the government is 'simply blind to the . religious exercise at issue: the Little Sisters and other applicants . cannot execute the form because they cannot deputize a third party to . sin on their behalf.' In court papers, he says the government’s 'causal dismissal' of that 'religiously . forbidden act as a mere ""stroke of their own pen"" perpetuates their . claim below that the Little Sisters are fighting an ‘invisible dragon.' Another lawyer for the nuns, Kevin C. Walsh of the School of Law University of Richmond writes, 'The . government’s incomplete characterization of the form is that it is a . simple opt-out form that does nothing but signal that the organization . is claiming an exemption.' Refute: The government say Catholic groups are already exempt from administering - and paying for - contraception (library image) However, Professor Michael C. Dorf of Cornell Law School says groups are wrong. Speaking with ABC news, he claims the Little Sisters' emphasis on the form is misguided. 'I would say that even if the consequence of signing the paper were that the employees get contraceptive coverage, that still would not count as a substantial burden under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 'Suppose that a Quaker who is categorically opposed to war gets a draft notice. If the Little Sisters plaintiffs are right, then he is not only entitled to his exemption from the draft; he’s entitled to get his exemption without even signing the piece of paper saying he is entitled to his exemption. Why? Because if he signs that piece of paper, then the government will draft the next person on the list and so he will be 'participating' in the war effort to which he is religiously opposed.' The Little Sisters could be granted to opt out by the Supreme Court at any time.","Catholics challenging contraceptive mandate of Affordable Care Act .

Rioting prisoners barricaded themselves in a wing at Britain's largest G4S-run prison for a staggering nine hours, it has been revealed. Around 20 inmates staged a protest between 5pm yesterday and 2am today at scandal-hit HMP Oakwood in Wolverhampton, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and G4S said. They damaged cells, threatened guards and destroyed property at the £150million super-prison, dubbed 'Jokewood' because of its slack security. Disturbance: Rioting prisoners barricaded themselves in a wing at HMP Oakwood for a staggering nine hours, it has been revealed. Around 20 inmates damaged cells and threatened prison guards during the protest . Scene: The riot took place between 5pm yesterday and 2am today at the jail (pictured) in Wolverhampton . However, no staff were injured during the riot - with only one prisoner being treated for minor injuries. Earlier reports had claimed that up to 40 inmates had taken two guards hostage in D wing, before demanding McDonald's meals were brought to their cells. At the time, one prisoner, who did not wish to be named, revealed: 'There are 40 people who have barricaded themselves in with pool tables. 'They’re making silly demands like wanting McDonald's brought to their cells. They’re just drunk. 'First class': Justice Secretary Chris Grayling recently praised the facilities at HMP Oakwood . 'They’ve taken two prison staff hostage and there are loads of police here trying to get it under control, but they haven’t.' However, G4S and the MoJ have since dismissed the claims as 'completely untrue'. A joint statement read: 'The . disruption, which was confined to one wing of the Category C prison for . male prisoners, began just after 5pm on Sunday as prisoners were out of . their cells on association, and involved around 15-20 prisoners, who . threatened officers and caused damage to cells and prison property. 'A . number of prisoners returned to their cells voluntarily. The Ministry . of Justice was informed immediately, and standard procedures were . initiated to deal with the incident, with rapid response teams deployed. Staffordshire Police were also informed. 'Owing to damage caused to cells, a number of prisoners were moved to other wings and to other prisons in the area. 'The . incident was brought under control just after 2am without injury to any . prison officers, although one prisoner has been treated for minor . injuries. 'Reports of . prison staff being taken hostage are completely untrue. The safety of . our personnel and those prisoners in our care is our top priority, and . we are grateful to our colleagues who were able to help us bring the . incident to a close safely, and effectively. 'Established incident procedures were followed correctly and worked as they were meant to. 'Untrue': Earlier reports claimed that inmates had taken two guards hostage, before demanding McDonald's meals were brought to their cells. However, G4S and the MoJ have since dismissed the claims as false . 'As . an investigation has now commenced into the reasons for this . disruption, as well as a criminal investigation, it would be . inappropriate to comment further at this time.' During the riot, prisoners are believed to have used pool cues to overpower guards. Standard . procedures were initiated to deal with the incident - with rapid response teams and officers from Staffordshire Police deployed to the prison. HMP Oakwood - the largest prison in England and Wales - opened in April 2012 as a training prison next to the existing HMP Featherstone and HMP Brinsford near Wolverhampton. Shock: Tonight former Home Secretary David Blunkett (pictured) called Mr Grayling's comments about HMP Oakwood 'astonishing' It houses more . than 1,600 category C prisoners and was the the scene of a number of rooftop . protests last year. The . disturbance comes weeks after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling defended . Oakwood as a ‘first class facility’ despite a . string of problems, including a damning report from HM Inspectorate of . Prisons. The document, published in October, had reported inexperienced staff and high levels of violence and self-harm at the jail - with chief inspector of . prisons Nick Hardwick warning there were 'real risks if matters were . allowed to drift'. Inspectors also revealed that . hard drugs were 'easily available' inside the prison, that inmates . brewed their own alcohol in their cells and that hardcore pornography . was allowed to be displayed on prison walls. At the time G4S said improvements were being made but admitted launching the prison was a 'complex and challenging operation'. G4S - well-known for its botched handling of its Olympics security contract - has been under review by the Government following revelations it overcharged for criminal-tagging contracts. The government has since announced that electronic monitoring will handed to another firm on an interim basis at the end of the financial year. Tonight . former Home Secretary David Blunkett said the Justice Select Committee . is likely to demand an investigation and called Mr Grayling’s comments . about HMP Oakwood ‘astonishing’. He told the Daily Mail: ‘I know the . Justice Select Committee will want to investigate what has happened, not . least because G4S have been banned from taking on other prison service . contracts that have recently been put out to tender. ‘It’s . astonishing that Chris Grayling should have made his comments less than . eight weeks ago. I think he will be regretting having been so . effusive.’ The Labour . MP, who served as Home Secretary under Tony Blair’s Government, added: . ‘I think that all the signals about HMP Oakwood have been there to . provide sufficient warning that contrary to what the Justice Secretary . believed, management didn’t have a grip on the situation. ‘Sometimes . there are unforeseen eruptions in prisons, often due to overcrowding, . but that is quite clearly not the case at Oakwood. ‘Therefore, . there are some very important questions to be asked as to who has taken . their eye off the ball and who should be held to account for what’s . clearly a danger to prison officers and a breakdown of discipline in . relation to those in prison.'","Rioting prisoners barricaded themselves in a wing for nine hours .

A man arrested last summer for sexual assault has been charged with the savage rape of a 15-year-old girl as she was on her way to school in Belmont Cragin, Chicago. Luis Pantoja, 25, who goes by the name 'silent' was arrested Friday for the brutal attack on December 17 at the 2400 block of North Long Avenue. Police were able to match Pantoja's DNA to a condom wrapper found near where the girl was attacked at around 5:25 am. Pantoja was arrested at his home at the 5500 block of West Wrightwood Avenue and is being charged with attempted first degree murder, aggravated criminal assault, aggravated battery, and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. He was held without bail, reported the Chicago Tribune. Pantoja aka 'Silent' is hearing impaired and therefore needed a sign language interpreter for the hearing. Police seized an Arminius blue-steel,seven-shot handgun from Pantoja's home. However whether or not he had the gun during the attack is unclear, said Sally Daly, a spokesperson for the Cook's County state attorney's office. The 15-year-old victim was discovered in a residents backyard at around 8 a.m. laying in a puddle of blood. She was shoeless and her pants had been forcibly removed. The Chicago Sun Times reports that they initially thought the attack occurred at 6 a.m. but they later found out she was attacked 35 minutes earlier, leading officers to Pantoja as the perpetrator. Pantoja has a criminal record dating back to 2005. He has charges for drugs, theft, and disorderly conduct . In August he was charged with criminal assault exactly three months to the day of the attack on December. 17. He was held on $200,000 bail but his case was later dismissed due to lack of probable cause. The 2400 block of North Long View Avenue where the girl was attacked on her way to school . The Chicago Sun Times reports that it was Pantoja's conviction in 2008 for failure to report an accident that may have been the key to his most recent arrest. The 2008 crime in addition to his previous crimes led to a six year stay in prison that required him to hand over DNA to the federal database. The police were able to match his DNA from the scene of the crime to the DNA in their system. The victim of Pantoja's brutal attack remains at Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition. Last week she improved enough to be able to communicate with police officers. 'Everybody knows she was in really bad shape. She’s doing better. Her and her family are taking it day-by-day, but we can only keep her in our thoughts and hope she improves,' Area North Cmdr. Gary Yamashiroya told reporters Sunday afternoon, adding: 'But she is doing better.' Pantoja lives just blocks from where the attack occurred.","Luis Pantoja, 25, was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl after his DNA was linked to a condom near the scene .

The battle over whether to turn off the life support machine of a 13-year-old girl declared brain dead heads to court Friday after a federal judge ordered the two warring sides to try to reach a settlement. The US District Court Justice Donna Ryu will convene over a meeting of the family of Jahi McMath and representatives of the hospital where she is being treated in order to get them to reach an agreement over her future. The teenager suffered complications on December 9 after routine tonsil surgery causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage. Legal channels: A district court judge is going to mediate a hearing between Jahi McMath's family and her doctors after a continued battle over whether or not her life support can be turned off . Children’s Hospital in Oakland, California, claims the damage is so severe that the child is effectively dead and they want to turn off a respirator keeping her heart pumping. But the family are adamant she can recover and want her moved to a different medical facility where she can receive long term care. The war of words, which has divided public opinion, has become so heated that each side is accusing each other of lying and using the tragedy to further their own ends. Now they have been dragged into Federal Court for a 'mandatory settlement conference' to try to hammer out their differences. The meeting at 11am will bring to a head three weeks of legal wrangling encompassing three courts and two injunctions – the last of which will run out on Tuesday. Grief: Marvin and Nailah Winkfield react as they speak to the Mail Online outside of Children's Hospital in Oakland  on January 1, 2014 . Jahi’s family, citing religious beliefs and the hope that she will pull through, want to continue life support indefinitely. The hospital wants to remove her from the ventilator that has kept her heart beating, saying the brain death diagnosis means there was no hope of recovery. Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo initially ruled that doctors could remove Jahi from the ventilator at 5pm on Monday, but two hours before the deadline gave the family the injunction. The girl's mother wants to transfer her to another facility and to compel the hospital to allow Jahi to be fitted with the breathing and feeding tubes she would need to be moved safely. The family of brain dead Jahi McMath is receiving financial help from the Terri Schiavo foundation . The hospital has refused to perform those procedures because they say it is wrong to operate on a dead body. The legal meeting comes after Jahi's parents received public and financial backing from a foundation started by another family famous for their battle to keep their child on life support. The Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network has been working with Jahi's relatives to get her moved to a care facility. The case of Terri Schiavo became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s when her husband attempted to remove her feeding tube against the wishes of her parents. Terri Schiavo had suffered a heart attack in 1990 after which her husband cared for her, until 1998 when he filed a petition to have her feeding tube removed. Michael Schiavo claimed that it was his wife's wish to 'pull the plug', and after several years fighting her family in court, Terri's feeding tube was removed in 2005. Terri Schiavo's parents set up the foundation in 2001 to fight for Terri's case and now the organisation is devoted to helping families of incapacitated patients facing a loss of life support. Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield, believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator. On New Years Eve, the family won a last-minute injunction to keep Jahi alive until January 7. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever. 'My daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face, in front of my mother’s face, in front of my husband’s face,' she said on a break in the grounds of Children’s Hospital, Oakland, California. 'She was very scared. She knew something was wrong. To see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking. 'But I still have hope. In fact I have . more than hope. I am positive my daughter is going to wake up. I don’t . have a doubt. I talk to her about it all the time.' Tragic: This is Jahi McMath's eight grade photograph (left) and another school photograph is seen (right) - the happy teen suffered brain damage after complications from routine surgery to remove her tonsils in early December . Wedding: This photograph shows Jahi McMath (right) at the wedding of her step-father Marvin Winkfield (2nd right) to her mother Naliah (not pictured) - also in this photograph are Mariana Winkfield (left) and her grandmother Sandra Chatman (2nd left) Mrs Winkworth, 34, a Home Depot worker, was comforted by her husband Marvin, 33, a truck driver, as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since December 9th when the complications occurred. 'I never knew I would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter,' she said. 'I find it unbelievable.  I have not been home since December 9th, I have been sleeping in the waiting room. I cannot leave Jahi.' She said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been 'disgusting'. 'The way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous. It is disrespectful. It is disgusting. 'They don’t even refer to her by name. They refer to her as the deceased, or the body, or the dead and my daughter is not dead. 'They are awful, they have no compassion.' Backing: Terri Schaivo was at the center of a right-to-life debate that captivated the United States for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s, and a foundation set up in her name is supporting Jahi's family . Mrs . Winkfield, who has three other children, said all she wanted to do was . get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her. 'The doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone', she said. 'I want the same thing but I want her out of here alive, they want her out of here dead. 'I . blame the hospital for what happened. They should say ‘hey let’s do . what’s right for this little girl, we messed her up,  we owe her, the . least we can do is let her get out of here’.'","Jahi McMath, 13, has been declared brain-dead after tonsillectomy .

"By . Lucy Crossley . PUBLISHED: . 00:24 EST, 6 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:04 EST, 6 January 2014 . Skills: Minister Matthew Hancock has advised over 50s seeking a career change to undertake apprenticeship schemes . Middle-aged men and women seeking a career change should undertake apprenticeship schemes so they can re-train as lawyers, bankers and accountants, according to a Government minister. Skills minister Matthew Hancock has advised those over 50 to take part in the professional schemes usually carried out by graduates fresh out of university. With the retirement age rising, it is estimated that although many over 50s will remain in good health, they are likely to miss out on job opportunities because of their age. Currently more than 425,000 men and women over 50 are unemployed, with the number set to rise. However, . Tory MP Mr Hancock has stated that older workers, with their . highly-prized skill sets, can play a vital part in economic recovery by . re-training. He said that demand for adult . apprenticeships was increasing as they help workers, including those . over 50, first to gain employment, and then keep skilled jobs. 'Apprenticeships . increasingly help people of all ages get the skills they need to get . the new jobs becoming available, he told the Telegraph. 'Our . priority is to build on the best of the Apprenticeships programme . expanding Apprenticeships where they deliver the greatest benefits for . employers, apprentices and the wider economy.' Government data has revealed that in the last 12 months more than 34,000 over 50s started an apprenticeship, and that one in three of those were rewarded with a job in law, business or administration. Around 5,690 workers gained employment in commercial enterprise or retail, while 11,790 people over 50 started new careers in health, care and public services. Study: Mr Hancock encouraged older people to take part in the professional scheme allowing them to become lawyers, bankers and accountants . Government ministers are seeking to increase the number of apprenticeships offered by companies that can match studying for a degree, either at undergraduate or postgraduate level. Last month the London Professional Apprenticeship Programme, costing £2.3million, was launched to help people find jobs in professional service roles such as accountancy, management consultancy and tax advice.

London was listed as the 10th most popular region for migration, with a growth of 1.4 per cent in ten years. Around 94 per cent of these migrants came from within the UK.
