Military chiefs are urgently reviewing the protection offered by the Army’s heavily-armoured Mastiff vehicles after three British soldiers were killed in one by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. They are the first troops to have died in one of the 23-ton personnel carriers which have withstood hundreds of attacks since they were brought in specifically to combat the threat from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in 2007. Six other soldiers were injured by the Taliban bomb which may have contained up to 440lb of high explosives. Scroll down for video . Corporal William Thomas Savage, left, and Fusiler Samuel Flint, both served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (2 Scots) Private Robert Murray Hetherington, 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (7 Scots) The blast does not appear to have penetrated the £1million Mastiff’s armour. Instead, the casualties were . apparently caused by the vehicle being blown into the air and the force . of the impact when it landed and rolled on to its roof. Yesterday David Cameron confirmed he wanted defence chiefs to look into whether the right equipment was being used. He said: ‘We have done an enormous . amount to improve the quality and quantity of protective vehicles that . our soldiers use out in Afghanistan and, as I understand, it had a . pretty good record of withstanding blasts from IEDs. 'I’m sure we’ll want . to look at that carefully and put in place everything we can to make . sure that our brave men and women have the best protective equipment . they have. ‘The troops have said to me they were . pretty satisfied with what they had, but we must always look at this.’ The Prime Minister added that the UK had paid a ‘very high price’ for . the work to stabilise Afghanistan. General Lord Dannatt, the former head . of the Army, said: ‘The Taliban have found a way of countering the . protective qualities of the Mastiff. It would seem that this was an . extremely large bomb that was so powerful it was able to cause . fatalities within the vehicle itself.’ He warned that Britain must brace . itself for more bloody attacks in Afghanistan before 9,000 combat troops . are pulled out by the end of 2014. Targeted: Three British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when their Mastiff armoured vehicle which was introduced to protect troops was devastated by a huge roadside bomb (file picture) Killed: The soldiers (not pictured) were flown to the military hospital at Camp Bastion but could not be saved . Lord Dannatt said the history of any . campaign showed that ‘often those we are fighting increase their . efforts towards the end to try and play up the fact that they have . driven us out or to increase their hand in bargaining at the negotiating . table’. Two of the soldiers who died in the attack on Tuesday were . Corporal William Savage, 30, and Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, from the . Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland . (2 SCOTS). The third was Private Robert Hetherington, 25, a reservist . with the 51st Highland, 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment Of Scotland (7 . SCOTS), who was deployed with 2 SCOTS. Cpl Savage – nicknamed Sav – who . was born in Irvine, Scotland, was described as a ‘shining example of a . soldier and a rising star’. His wife Lyndsey, who is expecting their . first child, said: ‘I am completely devastated but extremely proud of . Sav. I have lost the love of my life.’ Fusilier Flint, from Blackpool, was . described as a ‘vastly impressive soldier’. His family said they were . ‘completely devastated’. Pte Hetherington had represented . Scotland at lacrosse and was said to have ‘epitomised everything that is . excellent about the reserve forces’. The men and their six comrades were on . a routine patrol in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province when . they were attacked. The deaths take the number of British soldiers . killed in Afghanistan to 444. 'Paying a high price': It is the biggest single loss of life inflicted by a buried bomb since six soldiers died when their Warrior armoured vehicle (above) struck an IED in March last year . The IED, which may have been dug into . the tarred road surface when it softened during the winter, could have . been detonated remotely. The Mastiff carries electronic counter-measures . to jam remote-controlled IEDs, and investigators will check for links . between the massive blast and Iran which is suspected of providing the . Taliban with bomb training as well as equipment and techniques to avoid . jamming devices. Major Chris Hunter, an ex-British Army . bomb disposal operator, said: ‘The Mastiffs are the most . heavily-armoured vehicles we’ve ever used in a counter-insurgency. But . any system can be overcome given sufficient time, money and resources.’ Overdue: The MoD's other main armoured vehicle, the Warrior, was heavily criticised by a coroner five years ago for not having enough protection. Improvements were finally made in June 2011 . Defence source . Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln Jopp, a . former commander of troops in Helmand, said: ‘Whilst you can do . everything possible to try to mitigate the risks, you can’t eradicate . them totally and nothing is indestructible.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘If you have an . explosion that’s big enough to lift a vehicle and roll it, you always . have the possibility that it will lift and soldiers will be killed. You . can never armour a vehicle enough to withstand every kind of blast.’ The attack came three days after the . Taliban launched its ‘spring offensive’ against coalition forces. The . Taliban said they would infiltrate ‘enemy ranks’ to conduct ‘insider . attacks’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers.

A total of 444 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan since Western forces invaded the country in 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks. In addition, more than 2,000 American troops and over 600 soldiers from other countries in the Nato coalition have died as a result of fighting with the Taliban. The latest deaths bring the total of British casualties in 2013 so far to six, all in the dangerous Helmand Province which is often considered a Taliban stronghold. Blown up: The deaths of (top row left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley, Private Anthony Frampton and (bottom row left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford in March last year was the biggest-ever single loss at the hands of insurgents . Sapper Richard Walker was killed in January in a 'blue on green' attack from a rogue member of the Afghan National Army. Kingsman David Shaw died weeks later when his checkpoint came under fire from insurgents - he was airlifted back to the UK for hospital treatment, but did not survive. In March, L/Cpl Jamie Webb, 24, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, died after an attack by Taliban militants in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand. Last year, six British servicemen were killed when a roadside bomb struck their armoured vehicle. The attack was the worst single loss of life for UK troops in Afghanistan since a Nimrod crash killed 14 in 2006. The deaths of Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, and Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, was the biggest-ever loss at the hands of insurgents. While many parts of the country remain unsafe, the rate of British casualties has been slowing as Western troops have gradually pulled out of their operations in Afghanistan. All combat forces are due to leave by the end of next year, when security will be handed over to the Afghan army and police.","Corporal William Thomas Savage and Fusilier Samuel Flint from the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland .

'My life is in tatters': Kay Delany looks at pictures of her children as she tries to piece together her memories after a freak fall made her forget 20 years . The last thing Kay Delaney remembers is tucking her six-year-old son and two-year-old daughter into bed for the night. Two decades on, those children have grown up and graduated  from university – but Miss Delaney cannot recall any of it. After falling at work and hitting her head, more than 20 years have been erased from her memory. She is convinced she is still in her 30s and is stunned every time she sees the face of a 55-year-old staring back at her from the mirror. To her, it is still 1990, when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and mobile phones were the size of bricks. The mother of three cannot even remember the birth of her younger son James, now 19. Before the accident, Miss Delaney worked as a care home manager and was in line for promotion, but she now finds it hard to make a cup of tea because she repeatedly forgets to switch the kettle on. Yet she has shocked her partner by waking up in the middle of the night and reciting an Edith Piaf song in perfect French, despite not speaking the language. Miss Delaney was diagnosed with retrograde amnesia after she slipped on a wet floor while working at Dove Court Care Home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. She was told she had nothing more than a minor concussion and sent home from hospital. However, it soon became clear that she was having problems with both short-term and long-term memory. Since then, she has struggled with simple tasks such as cooking and cleaning, and her partner of four years, Robert, 60, has given up work to look after her. Miss Delaney, who admits that it feels as if she is being hugged by strangers when her children Sandy, 23, Kenny, 27, and James embrace her, said: ‘I remember tucking the children into bed when they were about six and two. 'I have been left without a sense of . motherhood': The last thing Miss Delaney, 55, remembers is putting her . young son and daughter to bed in the early Nineties as a 34-year-old . The woman she still thinks she is: Miss Delaney with her children Sandy and Kenny in 1990 . Miss Delaney's son James, pictured left in 1992 as a newborn, and right last year. Miss Delaney's youngest son, James, pictured this year: She is unable to remember any of his life at all, even giving birth to him . 'Then I woke up and it was 20 years . later. 'I cannot even begin to describe the pain and sense of loss I feel . every day of not being able to remember my children growing up, let . alone not being able to remember my youngest child. Kay Delaney's brain injury has robbed her of the memories of her own life over the last 20 years, and everything that has happened in the wider world. Among the events she can't remember are Nelson Mandela being released in 1990 and end of apartheid in South Africa, the break-up of the USSR in 1991. Nor can she remember the two Gulf Wars, the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994, the death of Princess Diana in 1997, world-wide New Year's Eve celebrations on December 31, 1999, and September 11 in 2001. Since 9/11, Kay can't recall the Boxing Day tsunami that struck parts of Asia in 2004, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the election of America's first black President, Barack Obama, in 2008, and pop singer Michael Jackson's death in June 2009. ‘I have been left without a sense of . motherhood as there is such a huge gap. 'I have no memory of their . progress through childhood and teenage years, their troubles and . triumphs, their friends and the laughter, tears and love that makes up . normal family life. ‘I have no memory of my elder two . children graduating from university. My youngest is a stranger to me. 'I . have been able to develop a relationship of sorts with my elder two but . it is more as friendship than mother and child. 'The results of the accident have left my life in complete tatters. ‘My relationship with my partner is now under a lot of strain as I am almost totally dependent on him.’ Miss Delaney, from Newton, Cambridgeshire, suffered a minor traumatic brain injury when she slipped in July last year. It has caused retrograde amnesia, short-term memory problems, anxiety and concentration issues. She is a qualified nurse with a degree . in psychology and gave university lectures on behavioural psychology . before the fall, but now fears she will never work again. The accident is being investigated and Miss Delaney is considering fighting for compensation. Jeanette Tasker of brain injury . charity Headway said: ‘The severity of a brain injury does not always . relate to the amount of memory loss someone has as a result. Retrograde amnesia can completely change someone’s personality.’ Miss Delaney at her son Kenny's graduation in 2010, left, and right, her daughter Sandy at her graduation party: She has been able to rebuild a relationship with her two older children, but more as a friend than as a mother .","When Kay Delaney's children embrace her, she feels as if she is being hugged by strangers .

Investigation: Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell is fighting to clear his name over the 'Plebgate' row . The Scotland Yard investigation into the 'Plebgate' incident which led to the downfall of former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell has cost nearly £150,000 so far, it has emerged. Operation Alice is looking into claims that policemen who said the Conservative politician swore at them and called them 'plebs' during a row in Downing Street were lying. There are 30 officers involved in the inquiry, which may result in prosecutions for some of those involved in the controversy. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign from the Cabinet over the claims that he was aggressive towards officers when they would not let him take his bicycle through the main gate of Downing Street in September. However, the former International Development Secretary has since fought a fierce rearguard action in an attempt to clear his name, and is expected to return to high office at some point. A Channel 4 investigation cast doubt on the initial police account when it revealed that CCTV footage showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the gate during the row, as was originally claimed. An email supposedly from a witness backing up the police account of events has also been called into question. On his bike: The minister was accused of swearing at police who stopped him riding his bicycle through the main gate of Downing Street and subsequently resigned from his post . Lead investigator Deputy Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan said in a letter to Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, that the police investigation had cost £144,000. 'It remains that I have 30 officers at my disposal and the Operation Alice is estimated to have cost £144,000 to date,' she wrote. 'Four people have been arrested and no individual is currently charged. 'The advice file submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service by the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] has specifically asked for advice and guidance surrounding the future of the investigation in relation to potential criminal charges.' Last week, a letter from the Independent Police Complaints Commission to Mr Mitchell revealed that the CPS is now considering whether anybody should be charged in relation to the incident. Controversy: This CCTV footage has subsequently cast doubt on the claims of the officers involved . Detectives have taken 740 statements, as well as interviewing seven police officers and one member of the public under caution. In total, 133 exhibits and 93 documents will be reviewed by prosecutors before a decision is made. In a short statement, Mr Vaz said: 'We look forward to seeing DAC Gallan when her investigation is completed.' Mr Mitchell is tipped to become the British member of the European Commission when Lady Ashton's term in Brussels expires next year.","30 officers attached to Operation Alice probing claims police lied about row .

British taxpayers are to fund a prison building programme in poor countries such as Nigeria and Jamaica so more foreign inmates languishing in British jails can be sent home, David Cameron announced yesterday. The Prime Minister admitted that too many foreign prisoners remained in this country and said ‘helping to build prisons in their own country’ would ensure more were kicked out. Despite promises to cut the number of foreign inmates behind bars in Britain, the numbers have increased in recent years. David Cameron argued that helping improve prisons abroad could mean that more foreign prisoners in the UK can be sent back home . Ministers have struggled to remove even hardened criminals because jails abroad are overflowing or do not comply with human rights laws. By paying for building new jails or making existing ones more ‘comfortable’ so they approach British standards it is hoped more will be repatriated. But sending money abroad to lock up prisoners there, in addition to the billions spent in foreign aid, while budgets are being cut at home, will prove highly controversial. Mr Cameron made his comments during a ‘Cameron Direct’ event on the local elections campaign trail in Carlisle. He said: ‘When people are sent to prison in the UK we should do everything we can to make sure that if they’re foreign nationals, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence in a foreign prison. ‘And I’m taking action in Government to say look we have strong relationships with all of the countries where these people come from. ‘Many are coming from Jamaica, many from Nigeria, many from other countries in Asia. (Stock image) Prisons in poorer countries can fail to meet human rights standards and can be overcrowded . ‘We should be using all of the influence we have to sign prisoner transfer agreements with those countries. Even if necessary frankly helping them to build prisons in their own country so we can send the prisoners home. ‘I’m going to be setting out a programme of how we do that, country by country by country. Because it is not good enough, the situation we have in Britain today.’ Since 2010 there has been a sharp fall in the number of serious criminals sent home. That year, 5,342 were deported. The following year - the first full 12 months of coalition Government - the figure was down 13 per cent to 4,649. In the first nine months of 2012 some 3,382 were deported - suggesting the annual total would fall even further. There are now 10,861 foreign inmates in British jails, who now make up around 14 per cent of the prison population. Each costs an average of around £40,000 a year to keep inside. Entire prisons have been handed over to the immigration estate to keep inside prolific offenders after the end of their sentence, and every month around 110 are released out on to the streets. More than two years ago Mr Cameron pledged to ‘intervene personally’ in the issue, but there has been little progress. There are more prisoners from Jamaica (pictured) than any other foreign nationality, followed by Poland and Ireland. This week the Mail revealed hundreds of foreign criminals could be given cautions instead of jail if they agree to leave the country for at least five years. Yesterday Mr Cameron hailed a transfer agreement with EU countries designed to send more home. He said that as a result of the deal ‘those prisoners should be sent back to the country of their origin to serve out their sentence in prison therefore taking the cost away from us.’ But the Mail revealed that as of December last year, not a single inmate from another EU country has been sent back to their homeland. Risibly, the two countries with the most inmates in Britain - Poland and Ireland - were given opt-outs by the previous Labour government. And Britain has been sent two prisoners by other countries - meaning the deal has actually increased our ‘United Nations’ prison population. Jamaicans top the nationality table, with 900 last year, followed by Poland on 750, and Ireland 737. There are 594 Nigerians. Britain should be able to say ‘good bye’ to Abu Qatada as a result of a deal with Jordan, David Cameron said yesterday. And the PM did not rule out leaving the European Court of Human Rights to ensure the radical cleric can be removed. He said: ‘He should be in Jordan. We’ve got an agreement with the Jordanians that he’ll be properly treated. ‘We should now be able to say good bye to Abu Qatada.’","Taxpayers will fund prisons in poorer countries such as Nigeria .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 16:08 EST, 24 August 2011 . A distraught truck driver has lost a legal battle with his doctor, who he claimed amputated part of his penis without his consent. A U.S. jury has ruled in favour of Dr John Patterson, who removed part of the organ after finding potentially-deadly cancer during surgery in 2007. Philip Seaton, 64, and his wife, Deborah, were given the verdict by a jury today after filing the lawsuit in Shelby County Circuit Court in Kentucky. 'Loss of service': Phillip Seaton and his wife Deborah were suing a doctor who removed part of his penis without permission during supposedly routine surgery . 'Life saver': Dr. John Patterson, right, talks to his lawyer Clay Robinson during the trial at Shelby County Courthouse in Shelbyville, Kentucky . The jury ruled against claims that Dr . Patterson failed to exercise proper care and Mr Seaton, of Kentucky, had not . consented to the amputation. 'Everyone agrees that Phillip Seaton (has) the right to decide what is going to happen to his penis' Phillip Seaton's lawyer Kevin George . Dr Patterson had gone into the . surgery intending to perform a circumcision but decided to remove part of the organ. Mr Seaton had been seeking up to $16million in damages for ‘loss of service, love and affection’ after his ‘manhood was taken’. ‘Phillip has changed,’ his lawyer Kevin George, said in closing arguments. ‘He was mutilated. His manhood was taken. 'Everyone agrees that Phillip Seaton (has) the right to decide what is going to happen to his penis.' Evidence: Hundreds of medical documents were filed with the court and the jury saw graphic pictures during the case before a verdict was reached . The hospital: But Mr Seaton and his wife have lost their lawsuit with Dr Patterson after he removed part of the trucker's penis . He plans to appeal the decision on . the grounds that a doctor can change consent for surgery only if there . is a danger of imminent death. 'I pulled the dressing down, and I . didn't see nothing. Then I came out of the restroom . and I said: ""I'm getting the hell out of this damn hospital”' Phillip Seaton . ‘There was no emergency, no reason to do it,’ Mr George claimed. Dr Patterson said after the . verdict that he was ‘feeling pretty good’ and his lawyer, Clay Robinson, . said they felt ‘justice was done’. Dr Patterson claimed he saved the . man’s life. 'What I saw was not a penis,' he said . during an earlier hearing. 'What I saw was cancer.' He removed less than an inch of Mr . Seaton's penis, but the rest of the penis was later amputated by another . doctor, the defence told the court. Love lost: Deborah Seaton complained of a loss of 'service and affection' However, Mr Seaton said he was appalled at . the doctor's decision to amputate without consulting him, or giving him . the opportunity to seek a second opinion. In earlier testimony, Mr Seaton described the moments after being told part of his penis had been removed. 'I pulled the dressing down, and I . didn't see nothing,' said Mr Seaton. 'Then I came out of the restroom . and I said: ""I'm getting the hell out of this damn hospital”.’ Dr Patterson testified that the cancer prevented him from inserting a catheter into Mr Seaton's urethra. He was concerned about the possibility of kidney damage from urinary retention. Mrs Seaton testified that if the . doctor had consulted her after finding the cancer, she would have told . him to halt the surgery and wake him up. 'It's his body,' she told the court. 'He should have a say in it.' The jury was shown graphic images and Mr George told them that Mr Seaton 'doesn't feel like a man' anymore.","Phillip Seaton, 64, was in hospital for circumcision op .

An illegal immigrant has been sent to jail and told he must serve his sentence in Britain after he was caught trying to leave the UK and go home to look after his mother. Albi Shabanaj was stopped by border guards as he tried to exit the country through the Channel Tunnel on his way back to Albania. The 24-year-old was found to have fake Greek identification papers which he had bought during time working in the EU before sneaking into the UK. Case: Albi Shabanaj was held by border guards as he tried to leave the country on his way back to Albania, Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard . Jailed: The illegal immigrant tried to leave Britain via the Channel Tunnel but was jailed for a year, which he will serve in a UK jail . Canterbury Crown Court heard how Shabanai had tried to get work in Britain in order to send money home, but was caught as he tried to travel home to Albania on April 16 this year. James Bilsland, prosecuting, told the court than Shabanai, of no fixed address, was caught when he tried to get back to Albania to see his sick mother. Refusal: Britain's attempt to deport Tsai Wang Chen, 39, has failed because of the Human Rights Act . Shabanai told border guards that he was concerned about his mother and that he wanted to be back home in time for her having an operation on April 17. He admitted possession of fake identity documents with improper intention - which he bought for 100 Euros while in Greece last year - and was jailed for a year last week. It came as a Chinese gangster who was jailed for kidnap and blackmail avoided deportation because he has forged a new life in a Christian retreat centre and sending him back would 'devastate' him. Tsai Wang Chen, 39, was told he could stay in Britain after his lawyers used human rights laws to argue it would breach his right to a private life if he was sent back. The convicted criminal lives for free in Ministeracres, near Consett, in Northumberland and spends his days looking after hens, growing vegetables and helping with the cleaning. The Home Office blew thousands of pounds in their failed bid to have him sent back to China. Chen was a 'snakehead' gangster - a group who are paid to smuggle people into the country - who was convicted of kidnap, false imprisonment and blackmail. He was locked up for six years by Judge Paul Clark at Oxford Crown Court in 1997 for the violent crime. But after his release he has created a new life for himself at the sheltered Christian retreat centre.","Albi Shabanaj has been jailed for one year because he had false paperwork .

If you're planning a January diet to shift the extra pounds piled on over Christmas, you had better make sure you can find time in your schedule. A new survey has revealed that more than 50 per cent of British people are too busy to eat properly and instead rely on food eaten on the go. As a result, healthy eating is made harder, with many relying on snacks and sandwiches to get through the day. Too busy to diet: For many of us, lunch is nothing more than a sandwich at eaten at the desk . The research, conducted by the New York Bakery Company and reported in Cosmopolitan, also found that the traditional lunch hour is becoming a thing of the past, with 47 per cent of respondents too busy to do anything more than grab a sandwich at their desk. Breakfast, said by nutritionists to be the healthiest meal of the day and essential for dieters, was also affected by busy schedules, with more than 40 per cent of those polled admitting to spending less than 10 minutes on getting a healthy start to the day. Worse, nearly one in three combined breakfast and lunch, instead consuming a gut-busting brunch to compensate. The brunch, revealed the survey, is usually eaten in less than 20 minutes by just under half of those surveyed. A fifth of respondents said they skipped breakfast and lunch altogether, instead choosing to snack throughout the day. Healthy: Finding time to prepare healthy meals is impossible for almost 50 per cent of Brits . Most of the snackers also revealed that their constant nibbling left them unable to face a proper supper. In more bad news for our bellies, 16 per cent of those asked said that they regularly ate their supper after 8pm - just as the digestive system begins to slow down in preparation for sleep. Londoners were particularly prone to late night dinners, with 14 per cent admitting to eating their final meal of the day after 9pm as a result of working late into the evening. In Yorkshire meanwhile, midnight feasting - another belly-busting habit - proved popular, with 16 per cent of those surveyed in the county admitting to waking up for a snack during the night.","More than 50 per cent of Brits say they are too busy to go on a diet .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 06:44 EST, 16 December 2011 . Questions: ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo has written to the National Transitional Council over Gaddafi's death . The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has said there are 'serious suspicions' that the death of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was a war crime. Luis Moreno Ocampo said he sent a letter to the head of the National Transitional Council asking what the new government's plans are to investigate alleged war crimes by all parties, including the rebels. The uprising against Gaddafi's 42-year rule erupted in February, quickly escalated into civil war, and ended in October with Gaddafi's capture and death in unclear circumstances. Witness accounts and video taken of . the deposed dictator after his capture by rebel fighters show that he . was beaten and abused by his captors, and there were strong indications . he was killed in custody. Mr Moreno Ocampo said.: 'The death of . Muammar Gaddafi is one of the issues to be clarified - what happened - . because there are serious suspicions that it was a war crime.' He said what the ICC does on Gaddafi's . death and other war crimes will depend on what Libya's interim . government does because under the Rome statute that established the war . crimes tribunal, the ICC only steps in if national authorities are . unwilling or unable to act. Mr Moreno Ocampo said his office is working closely with Libyan authorities not only on Gaddafi's case but on those of his son, Saif al-Islam, and former intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senoussi, who were captured and face ICC charges. Libya's new leaders have said they will try al-Islam at home even though they have yet to set up a strong court system. The ICC wants to be certain the government will be capable of putting on a fair trial for al-Islam and al-Senoussi. Footage of the moments before Gaddafi's death showed the blood-covered leader being allegedly sodomised before he was killed . Mr Moreno Ocampo said that the judges at the ICC have asked the National Transitional Council to inform them of their plans before January 10. He said if the government challenges the ICC's jurisdiction, it will be up to the judges to decide where the two accused will be tried. In the meantime, he said, his office is continuing its investigation. 'We are sure there were massive rapes, quite sure,' Mr Moreno Ocampo said. 'We're trying to define who ordered them.' The UN Security Council referred incidents stemming from the Libyan uprising to the ICC and Mr Moreno Ocampo said he promised the council that he would present his strategy for the continuing investigation of possible war crimes in his next report in May. Macabre: The slain leader's body was then put on display in a storage freezer in Misrata after his death . After al-Islam's arrest, Mr Moreno Ocampo flew to the Libyan capital late last month and met government officials. He said the officials offered him the opportunity to meet al-Islam. But he said he declined because Gaddafi's son would have needed to have a lawyer present and he had not asked to see the prosecutor. Mr Moreno Ocampo said the Libyan authorities told him it was 'very important' to prosecute al-Islam themselves for two reasons - he is 'the face of the old regime' and 'they would like to show they can do better than with Muammar' and conduct a proper trial.

But there's always room for one more thing to fret over... The latest area women are concerned about is the upper torso - and one London clinic is targeting our insecurities, offering 'bra strap liposuction' which claims to banish back fat in just three hours. Piqued interest from women hoping to simultaneously tone up arms, underarms and upper back areas all at the same has led to the Private Clinic in Harley Street launching a new microliposuction procedure - costing at least £2,600. There is a new area in particular that more women than ever before are concerned about: the upper torso . The procedure involves . mapping out areas around the upper arms, underneath the arms and around . the patient's upper back where the bra straps sit, in order to pinpoint . tiny pockets where unwanted fat is located. These . areas are then sculpted using Microcannula Tumescent . Liposuction (Microlipo), delivered under local anaesthetic. This process - which lasts between two and three hours and starts from £2,600 - . involves a very diluted local anaesthesia being injected into targeted . areas of fat, and then gently removing the fat using micro cannulas, 3mm . in diameter. Microlipo involves a very diluted local anaesthesia being injected into fat, and then gently removing it . The Private Clinic have clinics nationwide where they offer Mircolipo - especially around the bra strap . The clinic treated twice the number of patients for Microliposuction procedures in 2012 as it did in 2010. In this time, Dr Puneet Gupta, cosmetic doctor at the clinic, has . seen a surge in numbers of women requesting more than one area to be . treated, rather than women simply requesting their arms, back or flanks . to be targeted. By targeting multiple areas of the . upper body at a time, the patient's 'problem areas' are delicately . shaped, reducing overhang and providing women with a more slim-line . upper body shape. The . procedure is delivered by Dr Gupta, the only doctor in Europe trained . in the Microcannula Tumescent Liposuction procure. Dr Gupta said: 'When a patient comes . to me with a desire to target the upper body, it is important that I . take a step back and focus not only on that one specific area, but on . the surrounding areas as well. It is not enough to target solely the . upper arms; instead I take into consideration how a patient's body will . appear when clothed and where the patient's underwear will sit. 'It . is also important that I am able to achieve the desired result without . the patient having to undergo a surgical procedure under general . anaesthetic. Instead, Microliposuction to the bra strap area allows the . patient to depart from treatment and return to their day to day routine . almost immediately.' The £10 Back-Smoothing Bra is sold in 50 Sainsbury's stores nationwide, ranging sizes 34-38 B-DD and 40C-DD . Harley Street clinic LoveLite saw a 240 per cent rise in demand for their new fat freezing treatment as girls try to achieve a thigh gap, MailOnline reported in February. Their treatment Lipoglaze, a non-invasive treatment that targets stubborn areas of fat, has previously been popular for fat reduction on the lower stomach, but since the thigh-gap trend emerged they found a surge in the number of women getting treatment on their inner thighs. It works by attaching a vacuum-like device on the stubborn area of fat - in this case the inner thigh - the head then gently sucks the fat, warms the skin up and then freezes it to minus 10 degrees Celcius. The frozen fat cells then die and pass through the body naturally as waste products. In August 2010 writer Avril Mair had knee lipo with Dr Georges Roma of Harley Street, a 'high-profile cosmetic doctor with a reputation for being able to eliminate cellulite and other supposedly incurable aesthetic misfortunes'. He used his new Ultra Lipolyse machine which works like liposuction to vanquish fat, tightening the skin at the same time and improving its tone and texture. 'It's amazing for treating areas like the knees - and it's not even painful!' he enthuses. 'But you do need to wear a special garment afterwards.' We asked leading plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer to keep a diary for a week in March 2011. He wrote of his work at the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. 'I saw three men with moobs this week alone and it’s on the increase, partly because we are all getting fatter. But I also see them on men who are otherwise fit. 'The best option is liposuction because it doesn’t leave scars.'","Microliposuction is a minimally invasive body-sculpting treatment .

One of the women who won £100,000 in February 2007, last known to be living in London, had just £25 invested in Premium Bonds . More than £44million in Premium Bond prizes have not been claimed since the popular savings product was introduced nearly 60 years ago. National Savings & Investments is urging anybody who have Premium Bonds to check whether or not they have won a prize - but never claimed it. A record 898,000 prizes have not been claimed, with an average amount of £50 although two women have failed to claim an eye-watering £100,000 each. Several other prizes worth £25,000 and £50,000 have also been left abandoned. Unlike the National Lottery, there is no time limit imposed on when you can claim a prize. The National Lottery imposes a 180-day deadline from the day of the draw. NS&I, the Government’s savings arm, said it will hold onto people’s prize money until they step forward to claim it. A spokesman said: ‘Each unclaimed prize is held until the rightful winner can be tracked down.’ The oldest unclaimed prize involves a man, last known to be living in South Yorkshire, who won a prize of £25 in November 1957. One of the women who won £100,000 in February 2007, last known to be living in London, had just £25 invested in Premium Bonds. Many winners are likely to be people who were bought Premium Bonds as children but have completely forgotten about them. Others have moved house but never told NS&I about their new address. Jill Waters, operations manager at . NS&I, said: ‘Prizes often become unclaimed as a result of people . moving house, or forgetting that Bonds have been bought for them as a . child, or executors are unaware the Bonds are held when someone dies.’ Many winners are likely to be people who were bought Premium Bonds as children but have completely forgotten about them . If you think you may be one of the winners, you have two options. The easiest option - if you have your Premium Bond holder’s number - is to use the search facility on the NS&I website. Alternatively, you can write a letter to NS&I to ask whether or not you have any unclaimed prizes. The address to write to is: ‘Premium Bonds, National Savings and Investments, Glasgow, G58 1SB.’ If possible, you should include your Premium Bond numbers, your name, any former names, such as your maiden name, your current address and any previous addresses. If the Premium Bonds were bought for you as a child, NS&I said it would be a good idea to include the address of your childhood home. Premium Bonds, which are tax-free, pay out prize money every month, rather than paying interest. The maximum prize is £1million a month, although all these prizes have been claimed. The largest National Lottery prize which has not been claimed was a Euromillions prize of £63million last year. The amount was donated to good causes. Premium Bonds were launched by the Chancellor Harold Macmillan in his 1956 Budget.","898,000 prizes - worth an average amount of £50 - have not been claimed .

A series of massive volcanic eruptions wiped out half of life on Earth 200 million years ago, according to new research. Scientists examining evidence around the globe from the United States to North Africa say they have linked the abrupt disappearance of half of the world's species 200 million years ago to a precisely dated set of gigantic volcanic eruptions. The mega eruptions may have caused climate changes so sudden that many creatures were unable to adapt - possibly on a pace similar to that of human-influenced climate warming today, according to the researchers. Scroll down for video . A series of massive volcanic eruptions wiped out half of life on Earth 200 million years ago, researcher have claimed. They say the mega eruptions may have caused climate changes so sudden that many creatures were unable to adapt . The extinction opened the way for dinosaurs to evolve and dominate the planet for the next 135 million years, before they, too, were wiped out in a later planetary cataclysm. In recent years, many scientists have suggested that the so-called End-Triassic Extinction (ETE) and at least four other known past die-offs were caused at least in part by mega-volcanism and resulting climate change. However, they were unable to tie deposits left by eruptions to biological crashes closely in time. The Earliest Jurassic plate configuration showing distribution of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province where massive eruptions occured 200m years ago . Now the new study provides the tightest link yet, with a newly precise date for the ETE - 201,564,000 years ago, exactly the same time as a massive outpouring of lava. Co-author Paul Olsen, a geologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who has been investigating the boundary since the 1970s, said: 'This may not quench all the questions about the exact mechanism of the extinction itself. 'However, the coincidence in time with the volcanism is pretty much ironclad,' Lead author Terrence Blackburn used the decay of uranium isotopes to pull exact dates from basalt, a rock left by eruptions. The basalts analyzed in the study all came from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), a series of huge eruptions known to have started around 200 million years ago, when nearly all land was massed into one huge continent. Previous studies have suggested a link between the CAMP eruptions and the extinction, but other researchers' dating of the basalts had a margin of error of one to three million years. In Clifton, New Jersey, a massive basalt flow (black rock on left) from the time of the End Triassic is exposed in a former quarry, now located behind a retirement home. Reddish sedimentary rocks signaling the extinction itself lie to the far right. The new margin of error is only a few thousand years - a blink of the eye, in geological terms. Blackburn and his colleagues showed that the eruption in Morocco was the earliest, with ones in Nova Scotia and New Jersey coming about 3,000 and 13,000 years later, respectively. Fossils show that heat-sensitive plants especially suffered; there is also evidence that the increased CO2 caused chemical reactions that made the oceans more acidic, causing populations of shell-building creatures to collapse. There is also some evidence that a large meteorite hit the earth at the time of the extinction, but that factor seems far less certain. A much stronger case has been made for the extinction of the dinosaurs by a meteorite some 65 million years ago - an event that opened the way for the evolution and dominance of mammals, including man. Along sea cliffs in southern England, geologist Paul Olsen of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory samples rocks from near the 201,564,000-year Triassic extinction boundary. The End Triassic was the fourth known global die-off; the extinction of the dinosaurs was the fifth. Today, some scientists have proposed that we are on the cusp of a sixth, manmade, extinction. Explosive human population growth, industrial activity and exploitation of natural resources are rapidly pushing many species off the map. Burning of fossil fuels in particular has had an effect, raising the air's CO2 level more than 40 per cent in just 200 years - a pace possibly as fast, or faster, than that of the End Triassic. Blackburn said: 'In some ways, the End Triassic Extinction is analogous to today. 'It may have operated on a similar time scale. 'Much insight on the possible future impact of doubling atmospheric CO2 on global temperatures, ocean acidity and life on earth may be gained by studying the geologic record.'","Scientists examining evidence around the globe from the United States to North Africa .

Scientists from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, tested the self esteem of users of the social networking site after they viewed their own profile for five minutes.

Study researcher Catalina Toma said the test group experienced a significant . boost in self-esteem after looking at their own Facebook profile . for just five minutes, Today Tech reports.

'But if you have low self-esteem, the opposite is true.' But she and the team noted that this self esteem burst seemed to make the group less likely to perform well when faced with a maths test immediately after.

Google has picked 8,000 'winners' who will have a chance to wear the company's new internet-connected glasses ahead of the general public. The US winners will each have to pay 1,500 dollars (£995) if they want a test version of the product, called Google Glass and hailed as the latest in 'wearable computing.' They will also have to travel to New York, Los Angeles or the San Francisco Bay area to pick up the device, which is not expected to be available on the mass market until late this year or early next year. Google has picked 8,000 people in the US who will have a chance to wear the company's new internet-connected glasses . The excitement stems from the belief that Google Glass is at the forefront of a new wave of technology known as 'wearable computing'. Google, Apple and several other companies are also working on internet-connected watches, according to reports citing people familiar with the projects. Google Glass is supposed to perform many of the same tasks as smartphones, except the glasses respond to voice commands instead of fingers touching a display screen. The glasses are equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display screen attached to a rim above the right eye. Google co-founder Sergey Brin walks the runway wearing the new product. The winners will each have to pay 1,500 dollars (£995) if they want a test version of the product, called Google Glass . The engineers who have been building Google Glass tout the technology as a way to keep people connected to their email, online social networks and other crucial information without having to frequently gaze down at the small screen on a smartphone. Google is developing a smart watch as well as its Glass wearable computer, it has been revealed. The search giant is set to use its Android software to power the gadget. It will battle against Apple's iWatch and a Samsung gadget the Korean giant revealed this week it is developing. It is believed watch is being built by Google's Android team, which usually works on handsets and tablets, rather than the 'X Lab' which is developing the Google Glass Wearable Computer and the driverless car. The hidden camera is designed to make it easy for people to take hands-free photos or video of whatever they are doing. Privacy watchdogs, though, are already worried that Google Glass will make it even more difficult for people to know when they are on camera. One contest winner promised to take Google Glass to Veteran Administration hospitals so soldiers who fought in the Second World War can see their memorials before they die. Another plans to wear Google Glass during a trip to Japan so she can take video and pictures that she can share with her grandmother, who lives in the US but would like to see her native country again. A zookeeper wants to use Google Glass to show what it is like to feed penguins and another contest winner plans to use the technology to provide maps that will help firefighters in emergencies. Google said the test, or 'Explorer' version of Glass, will help its engineers get a better understanding of how the technology might be used and make any necessary adjustments before the device hits the mass market.

Planning minister Nick Boles will use a speech today to warn homes need to be built on green sites or else only the rich will be able to afford homes . Britain will be dragged back to the 19th century when home ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless homes are built on untouched greenfield land, the planning minister warns. Nick Boles will dramatically raise the stakes over the housing crisis, saying the Government has a ‘moral’ duty to force councils to find land for development to defend Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a ‘property owning democracy’. And he has warned grandparents who oppose new housebuilding risk 'propping up their kids and their grandkids' who cannot afford to buy their home own. He has unveiled plans to bribe local communities with hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash to accept new house building. In future, neighbourhood groups who back plans for estates will be handed money to build community centres, save a pub or re-roof the local church. Mr Boles will also deliver a threat to town hall chiefs, warning those who refuse to find land to build on will be overruled. Ministers have given council bosses until March to come up with land to build 270,000 homes for each of the next five years. Mr Boles has previously sparked controversy by revealing that greenfield land equal to the area of London will have to be built on to solve the housing shortage. In a speech in London to the leading centre-right think tank Policy Exchange, which Mr Boles set up, he said: ‘We can turn a blind eye while Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a property-owning democracy shrivels. ‘We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends. ‘We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents. ‘Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally.’ In a warning shot at green groups and rural campaigners who have opposed the Government’s liberalisation of planning laws, Mr Boles added ‘we simply can’t squeeze much more out of brownfield sites’ which have been built on before. Mr Boles will vow to protect the greenbelt and areas of outstanding natural beauty. But he said people who have been lucky enough to buy a home should not oppose extra houses for the next generation. People had to recognise that 'either . they will spend their retirement propping up their kids and their . grandkids, or they can accept more development so their grandkids don’t . have the problem,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I genuinely think that the single biggest way in . which we are failing to deliver social justice in this country at the . moment is unaffordable housing – more than schools, more than jobs, more . than benefits,' he said. Home ownership in England fell for the first time in 60 years during 2011 from 68 per cent to 63 per cent. Mr Boles has previously sparked controversy by revealing greenfield land equal to the size of London will have to be built on to ease the housing shortage . Mr Boles will starkly detail the way price rises have excluded millions from the housing market over the past 30 years. If the price of food had risen at the same rate as housing over the past 30 years, a supermarket chicken would now cost £47 and a jar of instant coffee £20. He will say: ‘No aspiration is more deeply embedded in the British psyche than the desire to own your own home. ‘But the prospect of doing so has been slipping ever further out of the reach of millions of hard-working people. ‘This is a result of our decades-long failure to build enough houses. And the root cause of this is our decades-long refusal to release enough land for development.’ If the price of food had risen at the same rate as housing over the past 30 years, a supermarket chicken would now cost £47, Mr Boles will say . The policy would allow neighbourhood groups, along with parish councils, to get together and approve development plans to build homes. Local people would be asked to back them in a referendum. Those communities would then receive a slice of a fund called the Community Infrastructure Levy to spend on local improvements – worth around £500,000 to a group of local residents. Mr Boles will say: ‘This Government is determined to persuade communities to accept more house-building by giving them a tangible share of the benefits it brings.’ But councils who fail to help out will be overruled using the Government’s National Policy Planning Framework. Mr Boles will say: ‘They must identify immediately developable sites sufficient to supply all of the new homes that are needed over the next five years. ‘Some are dragging their feet. And a few are looking for ways to evade their responsibilities. That is not acceptable. Councils which do not produce credible plans to meet local housing need will find that the presumption in favour of sustainable development will trump local decisions. ‘The Government will not support those local councils who abdicate their responsibility to meet their fair share of our common housing needs.’ Mr Boles will also take aim at Labour, saying the last government only built 147,000 new homes a year while running an open-door immigration policy which helped increase the population of the UK by 3.8million between 2001 and 2011.","Nick Boles will say Government has 'moral' duty to make councils find land .

These days, it’s more commonly known as Doctor Who’s time-travelling spaceship, the Tardis. But the blue police box could be set for a return to Britain’s streets. An influential think-tank has called for police forces to bring back the boxes, which were phased out in the 1960s. In a major report, Policy Exchange called for the return of the blue boxes to save money and improve the service to the public. It concludes that police stations, though popular with the public, are ‘out of date’ and should be replaced by both boxes and counters in shopping centres, post offices and elsewhere on the high street. The report endorses the ‘possible introduction of a modern version of the Tardis police box, made famous by Doctor Who’. It adds: ‘These would be technologically-enabled police contact points, featuring two-way audio-visual technology so the public could communicate directly with police.’ The boxes were commonplace from the 1920s to the 1960s, before the introduction of police radios. Beat officers would be based around a box, which contained a phone. A light on top of the box would flash to indicate to the officer they should contact the station. Modern versions would allow the public to report crime and anti-social behaviour, get information and even give witness statements, the report said. Crucially, they would allow the members of the public to contact officers even when their local police station had closed. Forces across England and Wales have closed hundreds of counters at stations in recent years in an effort to save millions of pounds. The boxes could operate as a base for neighbourhood beat officers, the report said. Its author, Professor Martin Innes, director of the Police Science Institute at Cardiff University, added: ‘There has been uproar whenever chief constables or PCCs suggest they might want to close some stations. ‘However the truth is most crime is reported by phone, many stations are getting old and increasingly expensive to maintain and are often located in the wrong places, away from key population centres. ‘It might be more productive to engage local people in conversations about replacing out-dated stations with more local offices.’ The blue police box is more commonly known as the time-travel machine in Doctor Who, starring Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman . The report said that use of police station front counters was in decline. In London some have fewer than seven visitors a day. The number of people reporting crimes at counters has fallen by more than 100,000 in six years. About one in five of those who visit a station is asking about lost property, while one in ten is asking for information such as directions. Last year it was revealed chief constables will close 264 public counters over the next three years. The Metropolitan Police and other forces have announced they will put counters in supermarkets and elsewhere to try and stay in touch with the public. The report said saving money on buildings is better than cutting the number of officers available. Of the ‘Tardis’ boxes, it adds: ‘They could be used to report crime, provide witness statements, discuss concerns and priorities and access information.’","Policy Exchange says police stations are out of date and should be replaced .

The woozy cub lost consciousness and tumbled 12ft off a branch onto a net below as a crowd of onlookers stood by. The animal had been roaming through suburban gardens terrifying residents but took refuge up the tree. Wildlife officers in Montclair, New Jersey drugged it and stood by until it was unable to cling on any longer and passed out. Scroll down for video . Good catch: The black bear cub, pictured, perched in a tree in a small Montclair park captivated onlookers for more than three hours Tuesday morning before it was struck by a tranquilizer and fell . The Montclair Patch reported that police were alerted early on Monday as the bear made its way through gardens knocking down bird feeders and eating the food. It is thought to have wandered into the town because it was hungry. Watchung Avenue resident Sue Juliano said the bear was in her backyard at about 6:50 a.m. Tuesday. She told the Montclair Patch that the bear knocked down her bird feeder and ate all their bird food. After that, the cub wandered over to the nearby Wachtung Park, where it climbed a tree and police kept it cornered until 10 a.m. using hammers to make noises to stop it from running away. At that point officers from New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife arrived and shot it with a tranquilizer. He was tagged and tattooed and was to be released in a state reservation, Montclair Det. Lt. Angel Roman said. Noisy: Police used hammers and branches to make noise and contain teh bear to its branch about 12-feet above the ground in a tree in Watchung Park . Crew: Around 9 a.m. a crew from the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife arrived to tranquilize and remove the bear, pictured . A large crowd formed to watch with some putting off going to work so they could see the bear fall, and video the event on their iPhones and iPads. Resident Nancy Arny Pi-Sunyer jokingly compared the incident to Buzz Aldrin's visit two days earlier to Montclair, his hometown. She said: 'I admire both Buzz and bears. They are both very brave and they have both gone up very high.' Roman said the male bear was around 18 months old and weighed some 158lbs. He said the bear was first seen on Monday just after midday. 'Police received several calls . throughout the rest of the day and into the early morning hours as . residents spotted the bear at times,' he said in a release. Dangerous: Watchung Avenue resident Sue Juliano said the bear was in her backyard at about 6:50 a.m. Tuesday . Tumble: The black bear cub, pictured, fell into a net after it was shot with a tranquilizer gun . He said: 'It's probably just scurrying around for food.' Montclair public elementary and middle schools shutdown all outside play and activities on Tuesday after the bear sighting, according to a notice sent to parents from the district superintendent. Roman said he has been working in Montclair for 20 years and has not heard of a bear sighting before.

It's enough to make you want to lie on the sofa with a plate of  biscuits... one of the fattest parts of Britain has now been named the laziest. Sandwell, which already has an obesity epidemic, has come bottom in a national exercise survey. By contrast, those living in the Scilly Isles were found to be the most active. Sandwell, (pictured) in the West Midlands, is the laziest town in the UK according to a new survey . The research by the Department of . Transport appears to show that the residents of Sandwell, near . Birmingham, have been seduced by the sedentary life. Nearly half the locals admitted they could not be bothered to go for a walk, while only one in 20 gets on a bike in any given month. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said they were ‘caught in a lazy rut’, but blamed Sandwell for not being attractive enough to tempt residents out of doors. He added: ‘It’s a woeful situation where so many appear to have completely forsaken doing anything. But it’s little wonder. People who live on the Isle of Scilly, near Cornwall, have been found to be the most active . ‘A fat man might well ask his doctor why he should go out and exercise when all he can see is dreary buildings and all he can smell is the fumes from passing cars. What’s in it for him? ‘Councils must make sure there are areas in every locality which make it interesting to walk and cycle. I was in Sandwell recently and it has nothing. ‘We need places where people, particularly children, feel pleasure getting there and being there; parks and open spaces instead of ugly buildings and graffiti.’ The survey of 166,000 people in 326 council areas discovered that residents in Sandwell walked and cycled less than anyone else. The survey was tracking the lack of fitness in the UK when they connected it to obesity in Sandwell (stock image) Over the space of a month, only 58 per cent said they took a stroll of at least 30 minutes, while a paltry 5 per cent claimed to have  ridden a bike, three times below the national average. At the top of the scale, Scilly islanders led both tables with figures of 86 per cent for walking and 59 per cent for cycling. Sandwell – which includes West Bromwich, Smethwick, Oldbury and Wednesbury – already has one of England’s fattest populations. The NHS says 40 per cent of children there leave primary school overweight or clinically obese.","Sandwell in the West Midlands has come bottom in an exercise survey .

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is calling for all Americans within this age range to be tested - regardless of whether they are considered to be at high risk. They hope this change might help to lift some of the stigma associated with HIV testing. Despite . efforts to reduce cases of HIV infection in the United States in the . past three decades, as many as 50,000 Americans become infected with the . virus each year. All American 15 to 65-year-olds should be tested for HIV according to an influential American panel . The . Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that almost 1.2 million people in the United States are . infected with HIV, yet up to 25 per cent of them do not know it. According . to the CDC, stigma has been a major stumbling block that keeps many . from seeking out testing, and the hope is that the change will make HIV . testing a common part of medical care. The recommendations are based on . evidence showing the benefits and risks of testing and treatment for . HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Recent . studies have shown that HIV treatment can reduce transmission of the . virus to an uninfected partner by as much as 96 per cent. The new . USPSTF guidelines call for screening at least once for all adults, and recommend periodic screening for individuals at higher risk of . infection. But  they do not specify how frequently people at high risk . for infection should be tested. The guidelines also recommend that teens younger than 15 and adults older than . 65 should be screened if they are at increased risk for HIV infection. And it recommends that all pregnant women - including those in labour - . who do not know their HIV status should be tested. High-risk . groups include those who have sex with gay or bisexual men, drug users and economically disadvantaged populations in which HIV rates . are high. It is hoped this might help to lift some of the stigma associated with HIV testing. Image shows conceptual view of HIV within the blood stream . Task force member Dr Douglas Owens, a . medical professor at Stanford University, said: ‘We do hope the fact . that the guidelines are all very similar will provide an impetus for . people to offer screening because it is a very critical public-health . problem.’ Dr Owens . said testing all adults within a certain age range may help reduce any . stigma associated with testing and encourage people to get tested. The new guidelines from the . government-backed panel of doctors and scientists now align with . longstanding recommendations by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and . Prevention. Guidelines issued by the USPSTF in 2005 had recommended HIV screening just for high risk individuals. ‘CDC . believes HIV testing should be as routine as a cholesterol test or a . blood pressure check - but so far fewer than half of Americans have ever . been tested,’ said  Dr Jonathan . Mermin, director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, said in a . statement. [caption . As . with the CDC recommendations, the USPSTF guidelines recommend that all . individuals be offered the test as well as a chance to opt out of . testing. ‘The Task Force's new recommendations . will expand the number of Americans who know their HIV status and can . take action to protect themselves and their partners.' Experts said the change will likely trigger coverage for the tests as a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act. Under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, insurers are required to cover preventive services that are recommended by the task force. Currently, the healthcare law recommends coverage of HIV testing for adolescents and adults who are at high risk of infection. ‘That was based on the 2005 USPSTF recommendations,’ said Dr Jeffrey Lennox, a professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and chief of infectious disease at Grady Memorial Hospital, an inner-city hospital in Atlanta. ‘Now, hopefully they will go back and recategorise that and recommend that it will be covered for every adult.’ Dr Lennox and others said it is too . early to say whether the new guidelines will result in a significant . increase in the number of tests, but the potential for insurance . coverage may help. Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ranks preventive services based on the strength of the scientific evidence documenting their benefits. ‘Preventive services with a grade of A . or B will be covered under these rules. This includes today's HIV . screening recommendations,’ Ms Peters said. For doctors, the new recommendations should help clear up any confusion about testing among some primary-care doctors who have not been offering the test to all their adult patients. ‘Now, everybody agrees it should be done,’ Dr Lennox said. In the UK, about 96,000 people are . thought to be HIV positive and 25 per cent of people with HIV are . believed to be unaware that they are infected. These people are thought to be responsible for 75 per cent of new cases. It . is thought that HIV is spreading in the UK because of falling condom . use and some experts believe condom use has fallen because the . availability of antiretroviral drugs means that people are no longer so . afraid of HIV/AIDS .","U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is calling for everyone to be tested .

Killer: Former U.S. Army soldier Wade Page opened fire with a 9mm handgun at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin on August 5, murdering six . They call it 'rahowa' - short for racial holy war - and they are preparing for it by joining the ranks of the world's fiercest fighting machine, the U.S. military. White supremacists, neo-Nazis and skinhead groups encourage followers to enlist in the Army and Marine Corps to acquire the skills to overthrow what some call the ZOG - the Zionist Occupation Government. Get in, get trained and get out to brace for the coming race war. If this scenario seems like fantasy or bluster, civil rights organizations take it as deadly serious, especially given recent events. Former U.S. Army soldier Wade Page opened fire with a 9mm handgun at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin on August 5, murdering six people and critically wounding three before killing himself during a shootout with police. The U.S. Defense Department as well has stepped up efforts to purge violent racists from its ranks, earning praise from organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has tracked and exposed hate groups since the 1970s. Page, who was 40, was well known in the white supremacist music scene. In the early 2000s he told academic researcher Pete Simi that he became a neo-Nazi after joining the military in 1992. Fred Lucas, who served with him, said Page openly espoused his racist views until 1998, when he was demoted from sergeant to specialist, discharged and barred from re-enlistment. While at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, Page told Simi, he made the acquaintance of James Burmeister, a skinhead paratrooper who in 1995 killed a black Fayetteville couple in a racially motivated shooting. Burmeister was sentenced to life in prison and died in 2007. Shooting spree: Page killed himself after he got into a shootout with a responding police officer . Like-minded: At Fort Bragg, Page became acquainted with paratrooper and fellow white supremacist, James Burmeister . Killer: Burmeister, left, killed a black Fayetteville couple in a racially motivated shooting in 1995 and was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2007 . No one knows how many white supremacists have served since then. A 2008 report commissioned by the Justice Department found half of all right-wing extremists in the United States had military experience. 'We don't really think this is a huge problem, at Bragg, and across the Army,' said Colonel Kevin Arata, a spokesman for Fort Bragg. 'In my 26 years in the Army, I've never seen it,' the former company commander said. Reformed: Former Marine T.J. Leyden, who has since renounced the white power movement, said he joined the Marines to learn how to shoot . Experts have identified the presence of street gang members as a more widespread problem. Even so, the Pentagon has launched three major pushes in recent decades to crack down on racist extremists. The first directive was issued in 1986, when Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger ordered military personnel to reject supremacist organizations. That failed to stop former Marine T.J. Leyden, with two-inch SS bolts tattooed above his collar, from serving from 1988 to 1991 while openly supporting neo-Nazi causes. A member of the Hammerskin Nation, a skinhead group, he said he hung a swastika from his locker, taking it down only when his commander politely asked him to ahead of inspections by the commanding general. 'I went into the Marine Corps for one specific reason: I would learn how shoot,' Leyden told Reuters. 'I also learned how to use C-4 [explosives], blow things up. Leyden, 46, who has since renounced the white power movement and is a consultant for the anti-Nazi Simon Wiesenthal Center, added: 'I took all my military skills and said I could use these to train other people.'RATTLED BY OKLAHOMA BLASTIn 1995, eight months before the Fort Bragg murders, two former Army soldiers bombed the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people. With a growing awareness of the spreading militia movement, the Pentagon in 1996 banned military personnel from participating in supremacist causes and authorized commanders to cashier personnel for rallying, recruiting or training racists. 'What's scary about Page is that he served in the 1990s when putatively this was being treated quite seriously by the military. Bombing: On April 19, 1995, two former Army soldiers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols conspired to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City . There's plenty of other Pages who served during the war on terror, and we don't know what they're going to be doing over the next decade or so,' said Matt Kennard, author of the forthcoming book 'Irregular Army: How the U.S. Military Recruited Neo-Nazis, Gang Members and Criminals to Fight the War on Terror.' Kennard argues the U.S. military was so desperate for troops while fighting simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that it allowed extremists, felons and gang members into the armed forces. The military can grant a 'moral waiver' to allow a convicted criminal or otherwise ineligible person into the armed forces, and the percentage of recruits granted such waivers grew from 16.7 per cent in 2003 to 19.6 per cent in 2006, according to Pentagon data obtained by the Palm Center in a 2007 Freedom of Information Act request. But the Pentagon says no waiver exists for participation in extremist organizations. 'Our standards have not changed; participation in extremist activities has never been tolerated and is punishable under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice,' said Eileen Lainez, a Defense Department spokeswoman. The Pentagon's third directive against white supremacists was issued in 2009 after a Department of Homeland Security report expressed concern that right-wing extremists were recruiting veterans returning from wars overseas. Bombers: Oklahoma City bombing conspirators Terry Nichols, left, and Timothy McVeigh, right, served in the U.S. Army prior to the terrorist act . The Pentagon's 2009 instruction, updated in February 2012, directs commanders to remain alert for signs of racist activity and to intervene when they see it. It bans soldiers from blogging or chatting on racist websites while on duty. 'This is the best we've ever seen,' said Heidi Beirich, leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence project, referring to the Pentagon's attitute. 'It was really disheartening under the Bush administration how lightly they took it, so this is a major advance.' Her group monitors online chatter among self-described active-duty warriors serving overseas and reports it to military officials. It also receives regular calls from military investigators asking about racists in the service. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), another civil rights monitor, have helped train officers on how to spot extremists, although Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the ADL, says the military lacks comprehensive training for recruiters and commanders. He called the military's reaction when alerted to white supremacists 'patchy.' 'We've discovered a great range of response, from getting a phone call the next day saying, 'He's already out,' to not doing anything at all,' Pitcavage said.THE TATTOO MATRIXThe Army showed Reuters a one-hour presentation it says was designed to educate soldiers and Army leaders about its extremism policy and how to respond, including to white supremacy groups. Tale of the tattoo: Army leaders are urged to look out for tattooed symbols of lightning bolts, skulls, swastikas, eagles and Nordic warriors . Penalties for extremist ideology may include being removed from the military, having security clearances yanked or being demoted. 'The standard hateful message has not been replaced, just packaged differently with issues like freedom of speech, anti-gun control themes, tax reform and oppression,' the presentation says, noting that recruitment may be difficult to detect, occurring quietly 'in bars and break areas' on bases. The presentation instructs Army leaders to look out for tattooed symbols of lightning bolts, skulls, swastikas, eagles and Nordic warriors. Skinheads may have tattoos showing barbed wire, hobnailed boots and hammers. In a detailed flowchart called a 'Tattoo Decision Support Matrix,' Army leaders are shown how to respond to various tattoos. At the time of publication, the Army was unable to identify the locations where this course was being taught.SCREENING OUT ROGUES'We're very strict on the tattoo policy here within this recruiting station,' said Sergeant Aaron Iskenderian, head of the Army recruiting office in Fayetteville, the Army town next to Fort Bragg. With the United States withdrawn from Iraq, winding down from Afghanistan and unemployment stuck above 8 per cent, recruiters can be choosy again. Iskenderian cited the example of a young man who came in recently with a tattoo of the Confederate flag. 'We're in the South here. It's considered Southern heritage. It's on the General Lee,' Iskenderian said, referring to the car from the television show The Dukes of Hazzard. '""Is it racist?"" I asked him, ""What does it mean to you?"" and he said, ""Southern pride."" Flag flap: While an image or tattoo of a Confederate flag may raise alarms, some see it as a symbol of 'southern pride' The potential recruit also told Iskenderian he had a black girlfriend. Iskenderian sent the issue up the chain of command, and the young man was rejected. Academics who study white supremacists say proponents of the 'infiltration strategy' of joining the U.S. military have adapted, telling skinheads to deceive military recruiters by letting their hair grow, avoiding or covering tattoos, and suppressing their racist views. 'You have to differentiate between some of the grandiose fantasies of some of the leaders of the movement and what actually is going on,' cautioned the ADL's Pitcavage. For neo-Nazis who get past the screeners, as with the gang members, the military needs a comprehensive strategy, said Carter F. Smith, a former military investigator who is now a professor of criminal justice at Austin Peay State University in Tennessee. 'They are some of the most disciplined soldiers we have. They really want to learn to shoot those weapons,' Smith said. 'The problem wasn't just that we were opening the floodgates to let them in. We let them out after prosecution or when their time was up and we didn't let the police know.'","Recent racially-motivated shootings have involved members of the U.S. armed forces .

The reward programmes are designed to encourage travellers to stick with the same company each time they fly. Poor rewards: 60 per cent of travellers think they need to take too many flights before they can redeem Air Miles. British Airways' rewards scheme is largely used only by business flyers . But with just 40 per cent of people who collect air miles ever redeeming them, airlines are facing calls to overhaul the schemes because they are not working. In total, there are an estimated 14 trillion points which have never been redeemed by flyers. The study also found that 79 per cent of people who travel more than seven times per year want non-travel related rewards. Loyalty programmes have changed beyond recognition since Airmiles was launched in 1988, and many experts believe that the airline industry has failed to build on early gains. Airlines don't allow flyers to redeem their airmiles or points at peak times, they expire after a period of time and they often have to spend a minimum amount. Incremental revenue experts Collinson Latitude surveyed 1,005 British flyers last year.

James Berry, product director, said: 'Traditional rewards programmes are not necessarily designed to accommodate the changing needs of customers as it takes too long to build up enough points. 'Commercial results from reward programmes are increasingly under scrutiny and just doing the same thing will not help drive incremental profitability, nor will it tackle the problem of unused points.' In total, almost half of British adults flew last year, but less than one in four - 23 per cent - said they collected airline loyalty points. Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany, said that airlines need to expand their loyalty schemes. British Airways' loyalty programme is used largely by regular business flyers, while budget airlines like RyanAir and EasyJet don't run rewards programmes. Mr Sorensen told CNN.com: 'The UK is a bit of an enigma in the market, as their three largest airlines don't encourage people to sign up to their programs. 'Air France-KLM are particularly good.

'bully,' on his blog and said that Swartz had been 'driven to the edge' by the . government's aggressive and disproportionate handling of the case. 'Our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed,' Lessig wrote. In the statement, Swartz' loved ones described him as 'extraordinary and irreplaceable.' They said his 'insatiable curiosity, . creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for . selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable' made the world and their lives 'far brighter.' The online activist and co-founder of . the popular social media site Reddit took is life just weeks before . going on trial for the federal hacking charges. Tragic end: Aaron Swartz, a programmer and Internet activist who co-founded a company that would eventually grow into Reddit, committed suicide Friday in New York City . Troubled soul: Swartz had been vocal about his years-long struggle with depression, extensively writing about it and discussing it in public forums . The news of Swartz's untimely death was confirmed to MIT's The Tech by both his uncle and his lawyer on Saturday morning. Swartz's uncle, Michael Wolf, told the New York Times . that the programmer's body was discovered by his girlfriend inside his . home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn at around 9.30am. Police told the New York Daily News that . the 26-year-old ended his life by hanging himself from a belt in his . seventh-floor unit on Sullivan Place. He left no suicide note. Swartz was a gifted programmer who . helped develop the RSS at age 14. He then went on to start a company that would eventually merge with Reddit, as well as . Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against internet censorship. He was arrested . in 2011 for allegedly downloading more than four million academic journals . with intent to distribute them free of charge through file-sharing . sites. He faced up to 35 years in prison if convicted. In the past, Swartz hinted at a battle with depression, according to Gawker. Scene: Police said Swartz ended his life by hanging himself off of a belt inside his seventh-floor apartment at 301 Sullivan Place in Crown Heights, Brooklyn . In a 2007 speech, the internet advocate described himself as being 'miserable' after moving to San Francisco when his company was purchased by the publishing giant Conde Nast. 'I couldn't stand San Francisco. I couldn't stand office life,' he said at the time. 'I took a long Christmas vacation. I got sick. I thought of suicide. I ran from the police. And when I got back on Monday morning, I was asked to resign.' In a blog post from later that year, Swartz went into further detail regarding his bout with depression. 'Your . face falls. Perhaps you cry. You feel worthless. You wonder whether . it's worth going on,' he wrote. 'Everything you think about seems bleak - the things . you've done, the things you hope to do, the people around you. 'You . want to lie in bed and keep the lights off. Depressed mood is like . that, only it doesn't come for any reason and it doesn't go for any . either. Go outside and get some fresh air or cuddle with a loved one and . you don't feel any better, only more upset at being unable to feel the . joy that everyone else seems to feel. Everything gets colored by the . sadness.' Big business: Reddit was later sold to the publishing giant Conde Nast, but in 2011 it became operationally independent again . In September . 2012, Swartz was charged with 13 counts of felony hacking stemming from . his July 2011 arrest and subsequent indictment by the Department of . Justice for allegedly swiping MIT papers from the JSTOR online journal . archive. Two years earlier, Swartz allegedly connected a laptop to MIT's systems through a basement network wiring cupboard. He . registered as a guest under the fictitious name, Gary Host - a hacking . in-joke in which the first initial and last name spell 'ghost.' He . then used a software program to 'rapidly download an extraordinary . volume of articles from JSTOR,' according to the indictment. In . the following months, MIT and JSTOR tried to block the recurring and . massive downloads, on occasion denying all MIT users access to JSTOR. But Swartz allegedly got around it, in part, by disguising the computer source of the demands for data. In . November and December, Swartz is said to have made 2 million downloads . from JSTOR, 100 times the number made during the same period by all . legitimate JSTOR users at MIT. Whiz kid: At age 14, Swartz, right, co-authored an early version of RSS and later he started Infogami, a company that would eventually merge with Reddit . It . is alleged that on Jan. 6, Swartz went to the wiring closet to remove . the laptop, attempting to shield his identity by holding a bike helmet . in front of his face and seeing his way through its ventilation holes. He fled when MIT police tried to question him that day, it is claimed. The 26-year-old Internet wunderkind pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, but spent the next several months struggling to come up with the money to cover legal fees and continue his fight against the Justice Department, the site ZDnet reported. Ironically, Swartz's suicide came just two days after JSTOR announced that ii will be releasing more than 4.5 million articles to the public. 'Our goal is for everyone around the world to be able to use the content we have put online and are preserving,' JSTOR Managing Director Laura Brown said in a statement. On Saturday, Swartz's mother has posted a statement on the site YCombinator: . 'Thank you all for your kind words and thoughts. Aaron has been depressed about his case/upcoming trial, but we had no idea what he was going through was this painful. Legal troubles: In 2011, the Reddit co-founder was arrested and charged with hacking into MIT's JSTOR online journal archive and stealing more than four million academic papers . 'Aaron was a terrific young man. He . contributed a lot to the world in his short life and I regret the loss . of all the things he had yet to accomplish. As you can imagine, we all . miss him dearly. The grief is unfathomable. Swartz's . friend Cory Doctorow, of Boing Boing, published a touching tribute in . his honor early  a tribute early Saturday morning after learning of his . death. 'I'm so sorry for Aaron, and sorry about Aaron. My sincere condolences to his parents, whom I never met, but who loved their brilliant, magnificently weird son and made sure he always had chaperonage when he went abroad on his adventures,' he wrote in part. 'We have all lost someone today who had more work to do, and who made the world a better place when he did it.' In his piece, Doctorow speculated that it is possible that what drove his friend to suicide is the prospect of incarceration, and all that comes with it. 'Imprisonment is one of my most visceral terrors, and it's at least credible that fear of losing his liberty, of being subjected to violence (and perhaps sexual violence) in prison, was what drove Aaron to take this step,' he wrote. Our beloved brother, son, friend, and partner Aaron Swartz hanged himself on Friday in his Brooklyn apartment. We are in shock, and have not yet come to terms with his passing. Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable - these gifts made the world, and our lives, far brighter. We're grateful for our time with him, to those who loved him and stood with him, and to all of those who continue his work for a better world. Aaron's commitment to social justice was profound, and defined his life. He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more. Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney's office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community's most cherished principles. Today, we grieve for the extraordinary and irreplaceable man that we have lost.

Domino effect: Mr Fox, who says he did not give his consent to be splashed on the band's debut cover when he was 12, is now an unemployed chef . Instead it turned Mr Fox's life into a . nightmare. The album sold phenomenally well and reached number five in . the charts. Mr Fox's face was everywhere. 'It was in Virgin, it was in . HMV, it was in Tesco, it was all over the place,' he said. 'I was watching . EastEnders with my mum and I saw one of the billboards by the Tube . station and it had my face on there.' Mr Fox, who had been popular at . school, was teased by his classmates and slowly edged out. 'Nobody . wanted me on their side or anything like . that,' he said. 'Even the teachers used to pull me aside and ask me . about this CD . cover.' In the end the bullying got so bad . that Mr Fox's mother had to drive him home from school every day so he . could avoid the pupils waiting for him at the gates. Not our fault: Placebo's agents, Riverman Management said that Mr Fox's case should be directed against Virgin, the label that put the album out, rather than the band (pictured) themselves . He took a year out and then dropped out completely. Mr Fox then trained as a chef but was made redundant in the recession. He claims the knock-on effect of the . album cover disrupted his whole life and is now using his mother's . savings and scraping together every spare bit of money he has to file a . lawsuit against Placebo next month. The band's agents, Riverman . Management told The Times yesterday that Mr Fox's case should be . directed against Virgin, the label that put the album out, rather than . the band themselves. Placebo went on to release five studio albums and sell more than 10 million records worldwide. Blink . 182, Enema of the State . Janine Lindemulder had been a porn star when she starred on the cover of Blink 182's 1999 album. In 2002 she married Jesse James - who later married and cheated on Sandra Bullock - but was arrested for assaulting him after they split. Later she went to prison for four months for tax evasion and was reportedly in trouble last year for assaulting Jesse again. Vampire Weekend, Contra . The preppy-looking girl on Vampire Weekend's 2010 album is former model Ann Kirsten Kennis in a Polaroid from 1983. The band loved the image but it came as a surprise to Kennis who only discovered her face was being used after her daughter bought the album home. The then 53-year-old who lives in Connecticut, sued photographer Tom Brody and the band for $2million. The band later settled out of court. Led Zeppelin, Houses of the Holy . The six children on the iconic 1973 Zeppelin album shot on Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland, are actually just a collage of two siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates who were five and seven at the time.

A Liberal Democrat councillor has been accused of holding sex parties hosted by a dominatrix at his home. David Fuller is said to have charged guests a £15 entry fee as a contribution to soft drinks and a buffet. The gatherings are supposedly hosted by a Mistress Sarah every month at his three-bedroom detached home in Fareham, Hampshire, and involve scantily-clad women of all ages and men in black leather. David Fuller: The Liberal Democrat councillor has been accused of throwing sex parties at his home in Fareham, Hampshire . The 12-hour parties reportedly begin at around 9pm and include sex games involving ropes, chains and electrical equipment. They are said to have been held for around a year. Potential guests are sent invitations via a social networking site for people who enjoy an ‘alternative lifestyle’. At one party it was claimed that a woman had bubble-wrap taped to her back before being whipped by four men, while a crowd of around 20 looked on. Fareham council is investigating whether the parties have breached licensing or planning regulations. Mr Fuller, the deputy chairman of Portsmouth council’s licensing committee, told the Southern Daily Echo, which carried out the undercover investigation: ‘I don’t do anything illegal, but I’d rather not carry on this conversation.’ When contacted again he said: ‘No mate, I am not talking at the moment, no comment.’ On the council website, Mr Fuller states that he is a freemason and works as the manager of a care home. He adds: ‘I very much enjoy being on the licensing committee, meeting members of the public, and engaging in local issues.’ 'Personal matter': Mr Fuller is a Liberal Democrat member of the city council in Portsmouth . Sean Woodward, the Conservative leader of Fareham, said he would ask his planning and licensing officers to investigate the councillor’s property – but admitted that there had been no complaints. ‘We do not have any such premises [for sex parties] in Fareham, so I would want to see if it is a breach of licensing or planning,’ he said. ‘I will certainly have to investigate now that I know it is out there. ‘If [a sex party venue] exists it needs to be properly licensed, and it could have its licence refused if it is in breach of planning or licensing controls.’ David Williams, Portsmouth council’s chief executive, said: ‘As this is a personal matter, it’s not for us to discuss further. ‘There is a code of conduct councillors are expected to adhere to, but this does not strictly apply to their behaviour in a private capacity. ‘If we do receive a complaint about the conduct of a councillor then it will be investigated by the governance, audit and standards committee.’","David Fuller said to have charged guests £15 entry to parties at his home .

The man accused of pushing Ki Suk Han to his death on a set of New York City subway tracks allegedly confessed to the crime and revealed how he was watching from the platform as the 58-year-old father was crushed to death by the oncoming train. 'He wouldn’t leave me alone, so I pushed him,' suspect Naeem Davis, 30, told police. The confession came the same day as Mr Han's widow Semin and their daughter Ashley battled through tears at a press conference, describing how they are haunted by the fact that no one tried to help save him. Charged: Naeem Davis, 30, was arrested and charged with the murder of Ki-Suk Han, 58, who he allegedly pushed onto the subway tracks when an oncoming car was approaching . Confession: Davis allegedly admitted that he pushed Mr Han onto the tracks after they had an altercation . Victim: Davis admitted that he stayed on the platform and watched as Mr Han (pictured) was crushed to death . News of the confession, reported by The New York Daily News, comes just one day after Davis was arrested and charged with the murder of Mr Han on Monday at the downtown Q platform at the 49th Street platform. 'I saw him get hit by the train,' Davis allegedly told police. There have been varying reports that there was a dispute between Davis and Mr Han in the moments before the tragic turn. Video . shows the alleged attacker shouting: 'Leave me the f**k alone. Take . your m*********ing a** over there, stand in line, wait for the R train, . that's it.' The New York Post quoted 'law-enforcement sources' as saying Mr Han had been trying to calm the man down before being attacked. 'He . went up and tried to calm him down, saying, ‘You’re scaring people, The . emotionally disturbed guy just started screaming and cursing, saying, . ‘You don’t know me! You don’t know who I am!’ Now, it is not the verbal back-and-forth that haunts Mr Han's family but the fact that no one on the platform decided to step in and help once they saw the man trying desperately to get off the tracks. Twenty-year-old Ashley said: ‘It is devastating that he’s no longer here for me. Devastated: Widow Semin Han holds of picture of her husband of 22-years, Ki-Suk Han, who was pushed to his death on the tracks of a New York City subway on Monday . Taken in: Suspect Naeem Davis, pictured, was arrested by NYPD officers Tuesday afternoon in Times Square, blocks away from the 49th Street station . Support: Semin (right) was joined by her 20-year-old daughter Ashley (left) who spoke about their grief . ‘What’s done is done I don’t . want to dwell on what happened but the thought of somebody helping him . up in a matter of seconds...it would have been so great.’ She added: ‘I just really wish I had one last chance to tell my dad how much I loved him’. In . the time since Mr Han’s horrific death, which was caught on camera and . witnessed by dozens of commuters on the busy subway station at 49th . Street, the question has been asked again and again: ‘Why did nobody . help?’ The photo of Mr Han's . last moments, captured by freelance New York Post photographer R. Umar . Abassi, have sparked outrage and prompted criticism of both Mr Abassi . for not helping and the paper for plastering the image on their front . page. According to family . pastor Reverend Woon Tae Chon, ‘The family could not sleep after they . saw these pictures. They have been staying in my house and it has been . very difficult, very difficult to see them (like this).’ Both . Ashley and her mother Serim, who was married to Mr Han for more than 22 . years, bore the physical signs of their bereavement and the tears they . have shed. Grisly death: 58-year-old Ki Suk Han was killed by a subway train after being pushed into its path in Times Square on Monday . Tragedy: Flanked by City Comptroller John Liu (left) and their family Rev. Won Tae Cho (right), Semin read something she wrote about her husband of 22-years . Difficult: Mrs Han has been out of work because of a disability for the past two years and Mr Han was searching for a job ever since his business went sour . Mrs Han read from a statement in Korean, her eyes down, her voice catching with grief.  She held a picture of her husband. Ashley, a junior at Hunter College in Queens, described her father as a man ‘who pursued the American dream’. She said, ‘That’s what everyone said about my dad. He pushed me to pursue my education. ‘He was not the sort of person who would hesitate to help. He was always there for me.’ Neither . woman addressed the reports that had surfaced earlier suggesting that . Mr Han and his wife had argued in the hours before he left home for the . last time. Or that she had called him begging him to come home. What is clear is that Mr Han was a hardworking man who had fallen on difficult times. Mr . Han was a successful businessman in Korean who came to New York 25 . years ago in the hope of providing a better life for his future wife and . child. But two years ago his business foundered and he had been searching for work ever since. 'Nothing he could do': New York Post photographer R Umar Abbasi appeared on the Today show to defend himself and claim he could not have saved Mr Han . Adding to the stress, a disability rendered his wife unable to work, making him more determined to find a job. Rev . Chon recalled: ‘For one year he visited the church and cleaned it . although he was unemployed. He said to me, “I will overcome this . barrier”. Controversial: Tuesday's New York Post cover . ‘Sometimes he was discouraged but just last Sunday after worship he said, “I was encouraged by your sermon.”’ Less than 24 hours later he was killed. Mr . Han was, according to City Comptroller John Liu, on his way to renew . his passport and ‘pursue a business opportunity’ in the hope of being . able to carry on supporting his wife and child. Mr Liu painted a picture of Mr Han as a ‘hardworking immigrant; a New Yorker in every respect’. Mr . Liu said: ‘He worked hard to provide food, shelter and clothing for his . family and in the end his life was taken so senselessly’. There . is some small comfort in the fact that an arrest has been made but, for . the family, their focus falls not on retribution or punishment of the . perpetrator but on the grief that his apparently mindless act has . inflicted. Rev Chon said, ‘We weep over the passing of Mr Han who was a devoted father of Ashley and husband of Serim.’ A . Community fund has been established to assist the family with funeral . costs, medical care and Ashley’s continued study. The family were joined . at their church by community leaders Mr Chang Hyun Han, President of . the Korean Community of Greater New York, Mr Kwang Suk Kim, President of . the Korean Community Services and Rev Jong Hoon Kim President of the .

Montia Marie Parker, 18, of Maple Grove, faces felony charges of sex trafficking and promoting prostitution. She is scheduled to appear in court June 12. Parker was a senior at Hopkins High School when she allegedly set up a Backpage.com ad for a cognitively delayed16-year-old, driving her to an apartment to have oral sex with a man, and taking the $60 the girl made. Former cheerleader Montia Marie Parker, 18, faces felony charges of sex trafficking and promoting prostitution . The 16-year-old received none of the money. Authorities allege Parker and the girl drove to another home the next day, but left after the man refused oral sex. The girl's mother called police after reading text messages between her daughter and Parker on the girl's cellphone, the Star Tribune reported. The 16-year-old had mentioned to others that she was trying to make some money. Parker sent the girl a Facebook message and text message about how she could make money having sex, requesting that the girl send her photos of herself, the charges allege. Parker posted the photos on Backpage.com, listing her phone number as the contact, the charges said. Both girls attended Hopkins High School in Maple Grove . On March 5, the girls left school and went to an apartment building. When the younger girl returned to the car, she gave Parker the $60 and Parker deposited it into her own bank account, according to the complaint. The next day, Parker pretended to be the girl's mother and called the school to get her excused, the charges said. The girls left school and went to a home where the girl was directed to have sex with a man. She refused. 'You'll be fine - I didn't drive up here for nothing, and eventually you will need to have sex,' Parker told the girl, according to the complaint. The girl told the man she wouldn't have intercourse with him but would give him oral sex. The man refused and Parker drove the girl back to Hopkins High School, according to the complaint. The girl's mother checked her daughter's cellphone after noticing changes in her daughter's behavior and hearing that she had an unexcused absence from school. Minneapolis Lt. Kim Lund said authorities have noticed more cases within the last five years involving teen girls using Backpage.com . Minneapolis Lt. Kim Lund, president of the Minnesota Juvenile Officers' Association, said authorities have noticed more cases within the last five years involving teen girls using Backpage.com. However, Lund said, it's unusual to have a case involving a teen prostituting a fellow teen; most human trafficking cases involve adult men or women contacting teens. Parker admitted to police that she had created the ad and told them she received 'a lot of calls' related to it, according to the complaint. She's free on $50,000 bond. Hopkins High School's last day of classes is Thursday, but school officials said they acted immediately after learning of the charges. The school has about 1,800 students. 'In responding to this incident, we followed our discipline and safety policy, which includes permanently removing a student from campus,' the district said in a statement.","Montia Marie Parker, 18 is alleged to have set up a Backpage.com ad for a sixteen-year-old girl at her school .

Matt Lauer has been spotted taking a break - perhaps to forget his low popularity ratings - by enjoying boating lessons on his new yacht, which he has appropriately named 'Resilient'. The Today show host was seen taking a long trip on Sag Harbor Bay in East Hampton, New York behind the wheel of his new Hinckley T38, which costs $1.4 million without added features. Lauer, who was sporting a cap and khakis, was spotted by a New York Daily News photographer on Saturday as he took tips from two instructors aboard the luxury vessel. Escape: Today host Matt Lauer, right, takes lessons from two instructors aboard his yacht in the Hamptons . The morning host and his wife, Annette Roque, have a $15 million mansion in the Hamptons, which is next to a $3.5 million, 30-acrea plot of land they are currently renovating to turn into a horse farm. But the plans have angered residents living in the area, and many have attempted to prevent the construction, claiming it will be too intrusive and could cause traffic problems. The massive estate in Water Mill includes 36 horse stalls, a riding arena and a man-made pond. When completed, the stables will include an indoor arena, paddocks and barns. The day-long boat trip comes amid bad ratings for the once-beloved morning show anchor, who has come under fire since his co-host Ann Curry was ousted from her spot last year. Taking a break: Lauer stands by his yacht in Mill Creek Marina, which is near his $15 million home . Appropriate: The vessel is named 'Resilient', which is apt considering his low ratings on the morning show . He was blamed for her swift departure, even though NBC bosses denied he had a part in it. Yet Lauer seems to be very aware of his poor ratings. At an event honoring Bloomberg Media Group CEO Andrew Lack earlier this month, he told the crowd that was surprised he had been invited to speak. 'If you’ve been following the papers lately, you know it’s been a bit rough for me,' Lauer said. 'These days, I only get asked to host dinners if polio is busy. I have a lower Q rating than polio right now.' In the television industry, a Q score is a highly cited measure of likeability. Lauer's score has fallen by more than half in the last two years. Lavish: Lauer and his Dutch model wife own a $15 million mansion in the Hamptons, pictured . Couple: Lauer and his wife Annette are also building a horse farm nearby, which has upset neighbors . Days earlier, Lauer dug a bit further at himself as he introduced former 'Today' host Katie Couric. 'Katie has a way of making headlines,' he said. 'Who can forget when she was co-host of the ""Today"" show? She got a colonoscopy on TV. Not to be outdone, two weeks ago, I got one in The New York Times.' Lauer could have been referring to any of a myriad of critical articles in the Times that have been written about him recently. But he was likely referring to a story written by media critic Brian Stetler, which fingered Lauer as the reason for the 'Today' show's failing ratings. Under fire: Lauer has been blamed for the swift departure of co-host Ann Curry (second left) last summer. They are pictured with fellow hosts Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford . 'It is clear that the once-popular . host’s relationship with his audience is in peril,' Stetler wrote.

A former British High Commissioner who was ordered home after he was accused of touching the bottom of a politician’s wife is suing the Government for £1million. John Yapp said that despite being cleared by the Foreign Office of the ‘scurrilous’ claim, he found himself sidelined and ‘ostracised’ before he retired after a 40-year career. He was suspended in June 2008 after being accused of behaving ‘inappropriately towards women at official functions’ in Belize. The women were reported to have been Kim Simplis, the common-law wife of prime minister Dean Barrow, or businesswoman Lauren Reardon Smith. John Yapp (right) was accused of acting inappropriately to Kim Simplis (left) the wife of Prime Minister Dean Barrow . But Mrs Reardon Smith later dismissed claims she had been groped, and said that, far from making advances, Mr Yapp had been shocked by the forwardness of Belizean women. Alan Payne, the barrister for the Foreign Office, told the High Court yesterday that Mr Yapp had been accused touching a woman’s bottom during a party game at a social event. But Jane McNeill, Mr Yapp’s QC, said the claims were ‘unfounded and scurrilous’ and that Mr Yapp was ‘shell-shocked’ by the bizarre allegations, which were later wholly rejected by the Foreign Office’s own disciplinary panel. Lauren Reardon-Smith (right), pictured with former US Ambassador Robert J Dieter's wife Gwynneth Dieter, denied that she had been groped by Mr Yapp . Mr Yapp, 61, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said the claims were ‘completely ridiculous, nonsensical and untrue’ and said that his superiors in London had ‘prejudged’ the issue before taking the drastic decision to pull him out of Belize after 37 years of service. He was never re-engaged at ambassadorial level. Miss McNeill said: ‘It is his case that he was presumed guilty before being given an opportunity to comment on the allegations against him – or before the Foreign Office had carried out even the most preliminary investigation to see whether such allegations were worthy of belief.’ She said the Foreign Office had failed to support Mr Yapp as he faced the baseless misconduct claims, despite him having been a ‘loyal and dedicated’ diplomat for almost four decades. She said the department had shown a ‘lack of humanity’ – barring Mr Yapp from contacting friends and colleagues in Belize and delaying the return of his family’s possessions to the UK. She said Mr Yapp was put through an internal disciplinary procedure which ‘broke almost every rule in the fairness book’ as well as ‘resurrecting’ stale bullying claims. In August 2008, the department’s disciplinary panel cleared Mr Yapp of inappropriate behaviour towards women but gave him a final written warning about his overbearing management style. Miss McNeill said: ‘We say the . pursuit of management style and bullying allegations appears to have . been carried out to support the decision that had already been made to . withdraw him from the post.’ Mr Yapp said the department’s failure to support him triggered a major . mental breakdown, leaving him haunted by lingering symptoms of . depression. 'Unfounded': Mr Yapp was a diplomat in Belize until his sudden suspension in June 2008. London's High Court, pictured, heard he was left 'shell-shocked' when his superiors told him of the allegations being levelled against him . In his final years at the Foreign . Office, Mr Yapp said he was sidelined and felt a ‘deep sense of loss’ at . his treatment and he retired in 2011. He said his superiors should have . waited to hear his ‘side of the story’ before he was withdrawn on the . strength of ‘bizarre and outlandish’ accusations. Mr Payne said there was ‘clear . evidence’ that some of Mr Yapp’s staff had felt ‘bullied’ by him. Mr . Yapp accepted that he was ‘not Mr Perfect’, but said: ‘The honest truth . is that I didn’t bully them.’ The Foreign Office denies claims that it failed to support Mr Yapp, . maintaining that the decision to suspend him was reasonable given the . serious accusations.

"By . Ted Thornhill . UPDATED: . 08:19 EST, 8 February 2012 . H5N1 warning: Professor Paul Keim . Details of secret experiments by scientists who have created the most deadly form of bird flu in the lab will inevitably be leaked - potentially into the hands of terrorists - an expert has warned. A furore erupted in December over the decision by the U.S National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) to censor details of the virus being made public, which can be transmitted by coughs and sneezes. But now the head of that board claims they will enter the public domain anyway. Professor Paul Keim has issued a stark warning to governments to begin preparing for an outbreak. ‘We recognise that, in the long term certainly, the information is going to get out, and maybe even in the midterm,’ he told The Independent. ‘But if we can restrict it in the short term and motivate governments to start getting busy in terms of building up the flu-defence infrastructure, then we’ve succeeded at a certain level.’ Chillingly, he added: ‘The infrastructure to stop a pandemic in this area is not there. We just don’t have the capabilities. Even if we spotted it early on, I don’t think we have enough vaccines. The vaccines aren’t good enough, and the drugs are not good enough to stop this emerging and being a pandemic.’ When H5N1 bird flu erupted over seven years ago, out of the 584 people known to have caught it, 335 died. What stopped it from becoming a world-wide killer was its inability to jump from birds to humans easily. However, a mutation of the virus was made by Ron Fouchier and his team at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam in Holland, which was just as deadly and passed easily between ferrets, the animal that best indicates whether humans will catch it. In December, the NSABB asked the journals Nature and Science to censor publication of the study, and similar research conducted by American scientists, setting off a furious debate in the scientific and public health communities. The move followed a voluntary 60-day suspension of a study into the virus by the researchers themselves, who became worried that their work could lead to a pandemic. Fears were raised that the engineered . viruses may escape from the laboratories - not unlike the frightful . scenario in the 1971 science fiction movie The Andromeda Strain - or . possibly be used to create a bioterror weapon. In a letter published in Nature and Science, 39 scientists defended the research as crucial to public health efforts. Deadly: The new H5N1 virus can be transmitted by coughs and sneezes . Among the scientists who signed the letter were leaders of the two teams that have spearheaded the research, at Erasmus Medical College in the Netherlands and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, as well as influenza experts at institutions ranging from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the University of Hong Kong. The letter in full can be read here. The researchers, however, were critical of the NSABB's decision to partially censor their work.","'The infrastructure to stop a pandemic is not there,' says Professor Paul Keim ."

We're hardwired to appreciate good looks - and that's why beautiful people do better, a leading plastic surgeon has revealed. What's more, says Dr Bryan Mendelson, former president of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, pretty people not only get a head start in life, they also tend to have better relationships and earn more money than their less attractive peers. Dr Mendelson's revelations come in the wake of a string of books that make the same point, most controversially in sociologist Catherine Hakim's Erotic Capital, which argued that women should use their looks to get ahead. Being born beautiful can dramatically boost your chances of being a success at work and in relationships . Although Dr Mendelson's new book, In Your Face, doesn't go as far as Hakim's opus, his arguments revisit the idea of 'pulchronomics', a term invented by US economist, Daniel S. Hamermesh to describe the economic value of good looks. In Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People Are More Successful, Harmesh put the economic benefit of being born beautiful at $230,000 (£150,684) spread over a lifetime. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Dr Mendelson said: 'There has been a study on less attractive men and how much their looks cost them. 'Throughout their lives these men have to work harder and perform better than good looking men, but ultimately they are still getting less because they aren’t seen to be so nice. 'We associate people who are attractive as being good people,' he added. 'People who don’t look so nice are constantly being labelled and police target people who look like criminals.' Experience: Dr Mendelson draws on a 25-year career and numerous studies in his new book, In Your Face . The findings revealed by Dr Mendelson in In Your Face are based on academic studies as well as the surgeon's personal and professional experience. A cosmetic surgeon for more than 25 years in his native Australia, his new book looks at the reasons why people go under the knife - as well as the potential for a post-surgery pay-off. Interestingly, he says that 99.9 per cent of clients don't tell their friends and family that they've had anything done. 'People have surgery not to impress others, they do it to impress themselves,' the surgeon reveals. 'For many people, it’s about getting their confidence back. The fact is it’s about self-esteem. They’re doing it for themselves.' Read more at the Huffington Post .","Dr Bryan Mendelson says pretty people earn more .

Youth appeal: Rapper Fazer, a former member of N-Dubz, will be performing at the summer's BBC Proms . It is viewed by music-lovers  as the great annual showcase for the best of classical. But this summer’s Proms has surprised fans by making a desperate bid to gain street cred. For the 2013 programme will feature rap and punk amid the Elgar and Wagner, the BBC revealed yesterday. The revelation led to the corporation being accused of dumbing down the eight-week festival. The inclusion of rap for the first time is an attempt to attract a younger audience. The Urban Classic Prom includes . rappers Maverick Sabre and Fazer, as well as soul singer Laura Mvula, . interspersed with pieces by modernist classical composers. Another of the concerts, a 6 Music . Prom put together by the radio station’s Steve Lamacq, includes . performances from punk veterans The Stranglers and former Catatonia . singer Cerys Matthews. There will also be a Doctor Who Prom, . over two nights, including scenes from the sci-fi show with music . written by its teenage fans. While there are also many classical . concerts in the season, the decision to include rappers and punk acts . has dismayed many who feel the BBC has rendered the event ‘meaningless’ in its desperate attempt for ‘inclusiveness’. New wave: Aging punk rockers The Stranglers, pictured, will feature in this year's Proms line up . Urban: Singer Maverick Sabre is to share a stage with the BBC Symphony Orchestra . Sir Roy Strong, former director of . the Victoria & Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, . warned that the Proms was in danger of ‘lacking focus’. Celebration: Some of Doctor Who's enemies, including the Daleks, will appear at the Royal Albert Hall as a special concert will celebrate the show's anniversary year . He added: ‘It comes out of the cult of accessibility and inclusiveness. ‘Nothing must be too difficult or if . it is it must be altered. It becomes meaningless, doesn’t it. That is . the danger…The thing is redefining its focus, it can end up losing it.’ The BBC website describes the Urban . Classic Prom, which will be shown on BBC3 and broadcast on Radio 3, . Radio 1 and 1 Extra, as ‘a dynamic meeting of musical cultures’ which . will see the BBC Symphony Orchestra and conductor Jules Buckley team up . with  ‘leading performers from the UK’s vibrant urban music scene’. It adds that the ‘experimental . fusion’ of musical styles will allow ‘high-octane orchestral showpieces’ to ‘rub shoulders with rap, R&B and soul’. The concert takes places . on Saturday, August 10 and tickets cost between £7.50 and £36 . Mr Buckley said: ‘It’s a culture . clash. We’re taking artists from different worlds and messing with their . music, putting it in an orchestral context and exploring it in a new . way.’ Rapper Fazer was one third of the . hip-hop group N-Dubz and used to date X Factor judge and former . band-mate Tulisa Contostavlos. Maverick Sabre has been described as an . Irish-English singer-songwriter and rapper. Roger Wright, the BBC’s director of . the Proms, said most of the concerts were still dedicated to the main . classical repertoire. The Proms, which begin on July 12 and . run for two months, include a series of appearances by Nigel Kennedy . and a complete performance of Wagner’s Ring Cycle, over four nights. There will also be gospel choirs, orchestras and soloists from around . the world, music from the big screen and a performance of Stravinsky’s . The Rite Of Spring.

Who knows what David and Samantha Cameron were chatting about as they relaxed on their recent break in Ibiza? But, if former No 10 spin doctor Andy Coulson is to be believed, they should have been discussing the key role she could play in helping her husband win the next election. Mr Coulson claims Samantha is ‘badly needed in the trenches’ to save Mr Cameron’s premiership. Holiday: Samantha and David Cameron are on a half-term break in Ibiza this week but former adviser Andy Coulson urged Mrs Cameron to join the battle now for Tory victory in 2015 . In a damning critique of Tory . prospects, he said the Prime Minister’s wife should make more public . appearances to boost his ‘slim’ chances of winning a majority in 2015. And he called on her to join ‘small select strategy meetings’ because . she is one of the few people around Mr Cameron who gives him good . advice. The Prime Minister may not want to . hear from his former communications director who resigned in January . 2011 and is now facing trial over allegations related to phone-hacking. But Mr Coulson used an article for GQ magazine to deliver a withering . assessment of Downing Street’s performance. He said Mrs Cameron is needed now to . boost the Premier’s appeal to women and prove to voters that the couple . are committed to staying in No 10. He writes: ‘The time has now come for . Sam to play a more public role and take some risks. ‘She only joined the 2010 campaign . once it formally kicked off. She should now be persuaded that the 2015 . campaign is already underway and she’s badly needed in the trenches. Causes: Since moving into Number 10 Mrs Cameron's media appearances have often been linked to charity work, including this visit with Save The Children to a refugee settlement in Lebanon, close to the Syria border in March . Fun: The PM's wife donned a bright red wig in the run-up to Comic Relief's Red Nose Day as she baked cakes in her Downing Street kitchen . Forces: She has also been heavily involved in promoting the Tickets For Troops project to secure entry to major events for military personnel . ‘Sam might also take a more active . part behind the scenes. She is one of the few people able to see . straight to the heart of a matter and offer a clear, sensible view. There are few people in No 10 with a better eye and she could play a key . role in the winning back of female voters.’ Mr Coulson says the Conservatives have . a ‘real chance’ of being the largest party after the next election but . predicts a hung parliament rather than a Tory majority, with the Lib . Dems ‘likely to hold on to the balance of power’. He repeats rumours swirling in . Westminster that No 10 is considering ditching live election TV debates . in the run-up to the poll. But he says Downing Street should make clear . now that the debates ‘are very much on’ and should press for a town . hall-style debate with questions from the public rather than . journalists. Mr Coulson is damning in his criticism . of the way Mr Cameron has run his government over the past two years. Echoing the concerns of many Tories that the Premier’s inner circle is . out of touch, Mr Coulson warned that the public are ‘dangerously . disconnected’ from politicians. ‘Westminster has never been more . detached from the real world and... he and his office must take . responsibility and use the next two years to stop the rot,’ Mr Coulson . writes. He says the Prime Minister delivers ‘turbo charged oratory’ but ‘only when his back is against the wall’. Mr Coulson criticises Mr  Cameron for . failing to keep his MPs on-side and advises: ‘David should be better at . recognising and supporting the talent he has throughout the party . including the lower ranks.’ He also calls for the return of the ‘currently under-employed’ Liam Fox, who resigned as defence secretary two years ago. Popular: In the United States First Lady Michelle Obama has remained much more popular than husband Barack, something Mrs Cameron could replicate here . Tips: Andy Coulson urged his old boss David Cameron to listen to his wife's advice more and rely less on civil servants . The former spin doctor is critical of . Mr Cameron’s reliance on senior civil servants, dismissing Cabinet . Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood as ‘Sir Jeremy Who-Wood’. And in an implied criticism of his . successors, Mr Coulson says Tory high command need to be better at . getting their message across. He concludes that the Tories should . ‘identify a handful of issues that really matter to people and actually . do something about them’. A No 10 source said there were ‘currently no . plans’ to increase Mrs Cameron’s public appearances. Mr Cameron has already hired . strategist Lynton Crosby, who masterminded Boris Johnson’s two London . mayoral election victories, to help run the campaign in 2015. Senior Tories have since suggested . that the party turn to the London Mayor to help woo voters, and say Mr . Johnson has agreed to play a leading role as a ‘frontman’ in the . campaign.

Critical: Cesar Campuzano, pictured, is fighting for his life after he jumped into an Oregon river with his friends despite not knowing how to swim . A 15-year-old boy is fighting for his life after he jumped into an Oregon river with his friends, despite not knowing how to swim, and spent 30 minutes underwater. Cesar Campuzano, a freshman known at Newberg High School for his 'big smile,' disappeared below the surface after his classmates tried to help him get out but couldn't. The group of teens, who had been hanging out on the Willamette River at Rogers Landing called 911 at 6:19 p.m. on Monday to report the potential drowning. But the fire department's rescue team took almost 20 minutes to arrive and it wasn't until 6:47 p.m. that a diver located Cesar underwater and pulled him from the river. Paramedics initiated CPR before he was transported by Life Flight helicopter to Legacy Emanuel Hospital in Portland where he remains in critical condition. 'He just went back under and we just didn't see him again,' one of the girls who witnessed the incident told ABC News. Another young girl said: 'He was flailing his arms, like, we didn't know what was going on. We thought he was just playing around but he wasn't. Both of the boys were freaking out too. They tried getting him but he just kept slipping away.' In some cases, doctors use therapeutic hypothermia on patients who have been underwater for an extended length of time. This slows down the metabolic rate of the body and the brain - by reducing their body temperature - to save a patient's life and limit the risk of brain damage. In Cesar's case, Captain Tim Svenson of the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office believes the teen survived because the temperature of the river was cool, slowing his body temperature in a similar way to keep him alive. It's too early to say whether he will have suffered brain damage.

Svenson said Cesar was on the dock with six or seven other teens when some of the boys jumped into the river to swim. 'Cesar could not swim,' Svenson said. 'The kids he was with didn't think he would (jump in) because everyone knew he didn't know how to swim. 'A couple of kids tried to get him to . the dock, but he was in panic-mode, and started climbing all over . them. They couldn't get him to the dock, and he went under.' The water where the teen was found is 10 to 12 feet deep and the water temperature was 61 degrees, according to Svenson. On Tuesday, the school brought in extra counselors for students and staff who are trying to deal with the accident. Newberg High School Principal Dan Malone said everyone was hoping for the best.

'He's a young man with a big smile,' Malone told Koin.com, 'who hopefully still has a promising future ahead.' Svenson defended the fire department, saying they got to the site as quickly as possible. 'It took 20 minutes for the fire department to get to the station, to get a boat and the appropriate personnel — people equipped to dive,' he told ABC News. He added that the team had to wait for part-time/volunteer members to assemble, because many had just been given off of work or were called in. 'As soon as the fire department heard the call that was the quickest they could get together,' he said. Svenson said after half an hour underwater, Cesar was unresponsive but alive when teams arrived. They immediately started CPR and put Cesar in an ambulance where they hit his chest with the AED in a bid to shock him. Svenson said no foul play is suspected. He said it will take a couple of days to assess how being underwater for such a long time has affected Campuzano's brain function.","Cesar Campuzano, an Oregon freshman known for his 'big smile,' spent half an hour underwater .

When builder Lowson Robinson retired he decided to scale down his activities - quite literally. The 67-year-old, who could claim to be Britain's smallest builder, has created three miniature villages in his garden. He has also created a 12ft high model of Big Ben so he doesn't lose track of time when pottering outdoors. Scroll down for video tour of the site . Creator: Retired builder Lowson Robinson has downsized and has focused his attention on miniature buildings in his own garden . Grandeur: Not content with resting in his retirement he decided to carry on building, but on a smaller scale. The dome on this building was modelled on St Paul's Cathedral, London . Lowson, of Nenthead, Cumbria, said: 'I have been working all my life outside and I cannot just sit in the house and watch the television. 'That's why I decided to build the miniature houses as it gives me something to do. 'So far I have built three different villages on my lawn, all around 15ft in size. 'One of the villages is a miniature version of Nenthead where I live. 'The second village is made using local stone from Keswick and Penrith and is based on houses I've seen in the Lake District. 'The third village is based on nice houses I have seen all over the country.' His phenomenal attention to detail goes into every building, from small cottages like this one, to larger grand buildings that resemble iconic institutions . This is a replica of one of the houses in Lowson's village of Nenthead, which he has recreated in his garden . Retired builder Lowson Robinson has built three villages and towns in his garden . The retired builder's handy-work has now become a big hit with tourists, who stop to take photos. Lowson first began building the villages 22-years-ago as a hobby, using his garage as a workshop. He initially obtained planning permission to build six houses on his land. However after building three, Lowson . decided to use the rest of his land to build a garage and began . producing miniature houses during the evenings and weekends to fill his . garden. Although his first miniature house took him around a month it build, it wasn't long before Lowson developed a mould which allows him to create a house in two days. The buildings, which have plastic windows, are made by filling a square mould with concrete. His latest work involves building a mansion based on Haughton Hall, in Shropshire, and a water feature which operates through a sensor when visitors pass. He takes great care to maintain the village gardens as well as the local pubs, churches, mills and waterways. The grand pillared building to his left was based on Shropshire's Haughton hall . Attention to detail: Lowson devotes his time now to making every inch of his miniature villages as realistic as possible . Practical: Since he doesn't like to wear a watch while working, Lowson decided to build his own Big Ben so he could always check the time while toiling away . Work in progress: Lowson said he has no plans to stop building his miniature villages any time soon . As for his 12ft high Big Ben, Lowson . said: 'I don't like wearing a watch when I am working in the garden so I . built Big Ben so I would know what the time was. 'It has four actual clocks inside and it took me around 12 weeks to make.' Lowson, who also worked as a coal miner in County Durham, admits the villages have become an attraction for visitors. He said: 'I think it makes the garden look nice and it also a bit of an attraction. 'It's a bit of interest for people passing through. 'It is surprising the amount of people who stop and ask questions. 'I get pleasure out of seeing people passing and taking pictures. Running out of space: Sat behind a replica of Nenthead's Crooked House (front left), Lowson said: 'My lawn is not big enough to make any more villages so I am just dotting the houses I make around the garden now.' Tourists stop and gawp at the incredible creations Lowson has built on his lawn, taking photos of his idyllic settlements . Devotion: Lowson spends most of his time in his garage building new homes: 'I think the longer I live the more I will make.' And he has no plans to stop making miniature buildings anytime soon. Lowson said: 'My lawn is not big enough to make any more villages so I am just dotting the houses I make around the garden now. 'They will probably all join together one day. 'I don't know how many I want to make, I think the longer I live the more I will make. 'I will be making them until I drop down dead.'

I get at least four knocks at the door a day from people asking me if they can play with my dinosaur, it's quite odd. The owner says he was given the model as a gift from a friend who used to keep Zach in his bar . The dinosaur is now a useful landmark for people returning from a night out in Bolton .

Vonn, who was wearing a custom-made gown by designer Cynthia Rowley, got the call on her mobile phone as she sat among the fashion elite such as Anna Wintour and Ralph Lauren, according to Page Six . The website quoted a source as saying: 'Lindsay met the IOC at the bathroom. Cynthia stood guard outside, and no one was allowed to enter the bathroom. They were in there for about five minutes.'

They can be tested without any advanced notice, which can occur at any time and any location. U.S. athletes will be notified of their selection for doping control, by a USADA doping control officer  or USADA Chaperone. Those who refuse a test or miss a number of tests can be banned from competing, lose medals or titles or disqualified from an event.

GCSEs could be replaced by a system of ‘I levels’, with grades numbered from 1 to 8, it has been claimed. Ofqual – the examinations regulator for England – is also proposing an end to coursework in all core exams except science, while re-sits would be curtailed. Under the landmark proposals, all end-of-course exams would be sat in the summer – apart from English and maths in November. Pupils would have to wait a full year if they wanted to re-sit them. Exams regulator Ofqual is proposing an end to course work in all core exams except science . The regulator, which is due to launch a consultation shortly, is said to have decided that a new name was needed for GCSEs because the Welsh Assembly had decided to retain the name for its exams, which will continue to feature modules and course work. The Times newspaper said that although the title I level – or Intermediate level – does not appear in the consultation paper, it has been discussed by the regulator. A new grade 8 would replace A* as the highest grade – although fewer would be awarded in order to reflect Education Secretary Michael Gove’s aim of making exams harder while providing greater differentiation between the most able pupils. Having 8 rather than 1 at the top would leave open the option of introducing a grade 9 if it was felt necessary to make it even more challenging. The changes – covering English, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, double science, history and geography – would be introduced in schools from 2015, the newspaper said. Ofqual refused last night to discuss details of the consultation paper, describing the report as ‘speculative’. A spokesman said: ‘We will be consulting shortly.’ The changes - covering English, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, double science, history and geography - would be introduced in schools from 2015, according to reports . According to the newspaper, Ofqual will insist on keeping the A-level brand, because it believes it has international recognition. Many students currently awarded A*s and As in GCSEs would be expected to achieve grades 7 or 6. The regulator does not recommend a ‘pass’ grade but the new system implies this would be a grade 4. The changes are the most radical since the GCSE was introduced in 1986 as a universal qualification, replacing the dual system of O-levels and CSEs aimed at different ability levels . The changes, to be published imminently, apply to new exams in English, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, double science, history and geography, to be introduced in schools from September 2015. The changes mean hundreds of thousands of teenagers will sit a mixture of new exams and old GCSEs in their early stages. The biggest change within schools will be to course work, currently performed under exam conditions in classrooms and assessed by teachers, with monitors checking samples of graded work, which accounts for between 25 and 60 per cent of marks for GCSEs. Critics believe it cuts into valuable teaching time. Course work will be axed entirely for English, maths and history, with a candidate’s speaking and listening skills in English reported separately on their examination certificate. In geography, Ofqual says fieldwork skills, which are critical to the subject, should be assessed by a written external exam at the end of the course. Only in science does it propose an element of course work, saying teachers’ assessments of practical laboratory skills should contribute 10 per cent of overall marks. The changes are the most radical since the GCSE, the General Certificate of Secondary Education, was introduced in 1986 as a universal qualification, replacing the dual system of O-levels and CSEs aimed at different ability levels. The Department for Education will also publish specifications shortly for the subject content of each of the new qualifications, which exam boards will use to design each syllabus. For example, the history specification is shorter and much more general than the lengthy list of topics in its draft national curriculum from five to 14, whereas the science required in the new qualifications is set out in much greater detail.","Ofqual proposing end to course work in all core exams except science .

He also said that he sexually assaulted Mrs Currier before strangling her . FBI Special Agent Jolene Goeden told Good Morning America: 'He liked what he was doing. He talked about the rush he got out of it, the adrenaline and kind of the high from it.' Tristram Coffin, U.S. Attorney in Vermont, said during a news conference on Monday: 'He provided some motivation, but I don't think it's really [possible] to pigeonhole why he did this.' Mr Coffin added: 'It was something that he could control and he liked to do it. Why someone likes to act like that, nobody knows.' Officials say he broke into the Currier's home, tied them up and forced them into their car. He then drove them to an abandoned house in Essex. Authorities say both the Curriers tried to escape. Confessions of a killer: U.S. Attorney Tristram Coffin, pictured, told reporters on Monday that Keyes killed 'because he liked to do it' Keyes then shot Bill Currier with a gun he had stolen from the couple's home and sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier. Their bodies have never been found. He was found dead in his cell Sunday, authorities said at a news conference that included U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler, the FBI, and Anchorage police. Authorities wouldn't say how he killed himself, only that he was alone in his cell. An autopsy will be conducted. Keyes flew from Alaska to Chicago with the intent of kidnapping and killing someone, drove to Vermont and picked the Curriers, a couple in their 50s, at random, officials in Vermont said. Informing the public: Essex Junction Police Chief Brad Larose, left, speaks at a news conference on Monday, where he revealed that Keyes had implicated himself in the Curriers' murder . He told police he broke into their home, went into their bedroom, bound them with zip ties and forced them into their car. He then drove them to an abandoned house and tied Bill to a stool in the basement, while Lorraine Currier tried to escape, Chittenden County state's attorney T.J. Donovan said. Discovering this, Keyes ran out and tackled Lorraine, and Bill then tried to escape. Tragedy: Chittenden County States Attorney T. J. Donovan said that the Curriers showed 'extraordinary bravery and love for each other' He shot Bill Currier with the gun he had stolen from the couple's home, and then sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier, Donovan said, his voice breaking. Their bodies have never been found, and Keyes did not volunteer the information. 'They fought to the end,' Donovan said, adding that they showed 'extraordinary bravery and love for each other.' Keyes could have faced the death penalty for the murder of 18-year-old . Samantha Koenig, a barista who was abducted from the Anchorage coffee kiosk that she worked in last . February. He was later arrested in Texas after using Miss Koenig's debit . card. Keyes also indicated he . killed four others in Washington state and one person in New York state, . but did not give the victims' names, authorities said. The . FBI contends that Keyes killed Miss Koenig less than a day after she was . kidnapped. Keyes was thorough and methodical in disposing victims, authorities said on Sunday. Koenig's . body - which was pulled from an ice-covered lake north of Anchorage in . April - is the only Keyes victim whose remains have been recovered. A . surveillance camera showed an apparently armed man in a hooded sweat . shirt leading Koenig away from the coffee stand. Koenig's friends and . relatives established a reward fund and plastered the city with flyers . with her photo in hopes of finding the young woman alive. Abducted: Keyes was tied to the death of Samantha 'Sammy' Koenig, a barista who vanished in February from her coffee stand workplace . Prosecutors . said Keyes stole the debit card from a vehicle . parked near her home, obtained the personal identification number and . scratched the number into the card. After . killing Koenig, Keyes used her phone to send text messages to conceal . the abduction, according to prosecutors. He flew to Texas and returned . February 17 to Anchorage, where he sent another text message demanding . ransom and directing it to the account connected to the stolen debit . card, according to prosecutors. Keyes made . withdrawals from automated teller machines in Alaska, Arizona, New . Mexico and Texas before his arrest in Texas, according to prosecutors. Stolen: After killing Koenig, police said that Keyes used her phone to fake text messages from her and conceal the abduction . Koenig's family said there was no apparent previous connection between the teen and the suspect. Reached by phone Sunday, Koenig's father, James Koenig declined to comment on Keyes' death.Marilyn Chates, Bill Currier's mother, told The Associated Press that police contacted her some time ago to tell her about Keyes' confession and to tell her that they believed the couple's killing was random. Certificates of presumed death were issued over the summer and a memorial service was held in late summer, she said. Vermont authorities called Chates on Sunday to tell her of Keyes' suicide. 'After some thinking, our family has been saved the long road ahead - trials, possible plea agreements and possible appeals – and perhaps this was the best thing that could have happened,' she said from her home in Florida Sunday evening.","Israel Keyes, 34, was found dead of an apparent suicide on Sunday .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 24 October 2011 . A Texan man killed by a great white shark in Australia was 'living his dream' his family has said as they paid tribute to the 32-year-old. George 'Tom' Wainwright became the latest victim of a shark attack in the country when he sustained 'horrific' injuries as he went scuba diving off Rottnest Island, near Perth. His father said that his family is so upset that they cannot face going to Australia to bring home his body. Scroll down for videos . Catch: George Wainwright, the 32-year-old Texan who was killed by a great white shark in Australia, is pictured displaying red snapper from a fishing trip in the country . George Wainwright Sr said that they . are struggling to cope with the tragedy. 'It's something you're not able . to get your hands around,' he told the Houston Chronicle. His family says George was living his dream while in Australia . Wainwright's uncle said that he had been doing what he loved as he went fishing and diving before the brutal attack. 'He was living the dream and he loved the ocean,' Mr Wainwright told the Syndey Morning Herald. He said that his brother George and his wife Sharon had spoken to their son the night before he died. 'He really enjoyed it and called to say he had spent the night . on the beach and was going for a dive right there on the beach,' Mr . Wainwright said. The first pictures of Wainwright show a keen fisherman posing with his catches. With a red snapper in each hand, he proudly displays his haul in photographs taken during his stay Australia on a work visa. The state government has set tuna-baited hooks off the island in a bid to catch the shark and kill it. Officials said Wainwright and two friends were diving from a 25-foot vessel, 500 yards north west of an area known as Little Armstrong Bay, when the 10-foot great white shark attacked. They did not realise he was missing until bubbles emerged from the water and a short time later the man's body rose to . the surface with what were said by a local fisherman to be 'shocking . injuries'. Big haul: Wainwright, from Houston, had been in Perth on a work visa for six months before the attack yesterday . Diving boat: Wainwright, pictured nearest the camera, had gone scuba diving with two friends in a 25-foot vessel when the shark struck . Wainwright's friends pulled him out of the water and police helped get him to shore, but he did not survive. Wainwright, a recreational diver, was from Houston, but had been living in a beachside suburb of Perth for the last six months or so. He had set his Facebook page to name the city as his location. The shark struck just 11 miles from a . popular Perth city mainland beach where a 64-year-old Australian swimmer is . believed to have been taken by a great white on October 10. That death came six weeks after a bodyboarder was killed by a shark and this latest death is the fourth from a great white shark . in Australia's southwest corner in little over a year. Sharks kill fewer than one swimmer a year in Australia on average. Great white: Government officials are now hunting the shark using bait after three fatal attacks in the area in two months . Close proximity: A great white shark killed the American just 11 miles from another fatal shark attack off Western Australia state only 13 days ago . Idyllic location: Wainwright was killed off the coast of Rottnest Island during a solo dive . Despite fears of a rogue killer shark, experts say different ones are most likely responsible for the attacks. Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett, the leader of the state government, said this shark will be hunted and killed if possible. Fisheries officers have set tuna-baited hooks off the island, the first time authorities have used an emergency legal exemption from the state protection of great whites as an endangered species in the interests of protecting the public. Mr Barnett also said his government would consider shark culls, responding to locals' complaints that shark numbers are increasing off bustling beaches in one of Australia's fastest growing population areas. Referring to the three recent deadly attacks, Western Australia state Fisheries Minister Norman Moore said today: 'This is a unique set of circumstances, and I'm desperately praying this is not the beginning of a new trend and we're going to have these on a regular basis.' Water Police Senior Sergeant Greg Trew said Wainwright had surfaced in 'a flurry of bubbles' with 'horrific' injuries. Hunt begins: Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett, left, said bait would be used to lure the shark and kill it, while Water Police Senior Sergeant Greg Trew, right, described Wainwright's injuries as 'horrific' Expat: Wainwright is believed to be the third person killed by a great white in the state in two months and the fourth in just over a year. Sharks kill fewer than one swimmer a year in Australia on average . Another death: This coastline by Perth is where the 64-year-old swimmer was killed by a shark on October 10 . He was believed to be dead when hauled aboard by his two companions. Mr Trew said the shark was seen by Wainwright's friends as they were leaving the area after retrieving his body. 'It's traumatic for everyone involved, it's a tragic situation,' he added. Authorities cannot say whether he was . killed by the same shark that is believed to have taken Bryn Martin as . he made his regular morning swim from Perth's premier Cottesloe Beach . toward a buoy about 380 yards offshore. But . an analysis of Martin's torn swimming trunks recovered from the seabed . near the buoy pointed to a great white shark being the culprit. No other . trace of Martin has been found. 'It's . a cloudy old day today which is the same as we had the other day with . Cottesloe, and they're the conditions that sharks love,' Western . Australia Police Sergeant Gerry Cassidy. The unnamed American is the fourth person to be killed by a shark off the Western Australian coast in 14 months. Last month, 21-year-old Kyle Burden was taken by a great white shark south of Perth and his lower torso was torn away. In August last year surfer Nicholas Edwards, 31, killed was he was attacked by a great white at a popular surf break near Gracetown. Great whites can grow to more than 20 feet in length and 5,000 pounds in weight. They are protected in Australia, a primary location for the species.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:34 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:30 EST, 5 June 2013 . In a move likely to infuriate Senate Republicans, President Barack Obama's national security adviser Tom Donilon is resigning to be replaced by U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, marking a significant shakeup to the White House foreign policy team. A White House official confirmed the personnel changes Wednesday morning ahead of a planned announcement by the president later at 2.30 p.m. in the Rose Garden. Donilon has been a key foreign policy adviser to Obama since he first took office. But the 58-year-old had been expected to depart sometime this year, with Rice seen as the likely candidate to replace him. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice. Rice is to become President Barack Obama's national security adviser, it was reported today . Rice, a close Obama confidante, came under withering criticism from Republicans as part of the investigations into the deadly terror attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed in the attack, including the U.S. ambassador, Christopher Stevens. She appeared on five Sunday shows . after the September 11th, 2012 attack and claimed the Benghazi consulate . raid was triggered by protests over an anti-Islam film. The . Obama administration later acknowledged there were in fact no protests . at the consulate although they have tried to claim that protests else . that may have excited the situation. Last . month, under massive pressure from the media, the White House released . the infamous 'talking points' that Rice was meant to stick to when . discussing the attack - which led to the death of the U.S. ambassador . Christopher Stevens. The . emails revealed the drafting and radical re-drafting of the . administrations storyline in anticipation of Rice's appearances on . television. The CIA, led at the time by David Petraeus wanted to include references to militant threats from Islamic extremists - but ultimately these were removed after objections from various White House figures. While it is not clear what level of involvement Rice had in the evolution of the 'talking points', officials speaking in her defense said that she was only reiterating the information she was handed. By promoting Rice, President Obama opens himself up to charges of rewarding those associated with the ongoing Benghazi controversy. Outgoing U.N. Ambassador Rice is the second official involved in the incident to receive a promotion. Last month, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was nominated as assistant secretary of state. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon speaks during the daily news briefing at the White House in May - he is being replaced by Susan Rice in July . Last year following his thumping . election victory over Republican Mitt Romney, President Obama had wanted . to pick Rice as his replacement for Hilary Clinton at the State . Department. However, her nomination was denied by . Republican's who felt her role in the Benghazi attack had not be . sufficiently explained - and even suggested that she had not been honest . in her explanations of the talking points. She withdrew herself from . consideration only when it became clear that Senators John McCain and . Linsdey Graham would block her path and instead the post went to John . Kerry. It what could be seen as a thumb in . the face to some Republicans, her new job is arguably more influential . than it would be at the State Department. She will have the ear of the . president on a daily basis and could potentially advise him on issues . that go beyond a foreign policy remit. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice performing her role - it has been announced today that she will take over as President Obama's National Security Advise . The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi came under terror attack on September 11th 2012 which led to the death of the American ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens . Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya died along with three embassy staff on September 11, 2012, as they rushed away from a consulate building in Benghazi . Indeed, what could potentially be . more satisfying for Rice is that unlike the Secretary of State role, the . National Security Adviser does not require Senate approval. Senior Republicans reacted in disgust to the appointment of Susan Rice to the position of National Securirty Adviser. Senator Rand Paul said on Wednesday morning that he couldn't begin to contemplate why she was promoted. 'I can’t imagine, one, that we would be keeping Ambassador Rice in any significant position, much less promoting her to an important position,' Paul (R-Ky.) said on Fox’s 'America’s Newsroom.' 'How will the administration ever have the authority for people to believe what they’re saying, when they’re promoting someone who directly and deliberately misled the public over Benghazi?' Obama will also name Samantha Power, a . human rights expert and former White House adviser, to replace Rice as . the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Power is a respected former journalist who started her career as a 22-year-old freelance reporter in Bosnia - where she developed her staunch opinions on U.S. intervention on moral grounds. An armed man holding his rifle as he stands next to buildings set on fire at the US consulate, in Benghazi, Libya, 11 September 2012 . In 2002, Power wrote and published the Pullitzer Prize winning book, 'A Problem from Hell': America and the Age of Genocide' - which led her to be named two years later as one of Time's 110 most influential people in the world. In 2008 she joined then Senator Obama's office as a foreign policy adviser but had to step down after she called Hilary Clinton 'a monster' in reported comments she made to the Scotsman newspaper. From 2009 until this February she was serving on the president's National Security Council as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director running the Office of Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights. Power's husband is Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein, who is a widely admired intellectual and a good friend of President Obama. The White House official said Donilon is expected to stay on the job until early July, after Obama wraps up overseas trips to Europe and Africa, as well as an unusual summit in California later this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The official insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the personnel changes before they were publicly announced. Samantha Power,  former Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights at the National Security Council and foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, emerges from the West Wing of the White House in Washington . Donilon has overseen a foreign policy agenda at the White House that put increased emphasis on the U.S. relationship with Asia. He's also played a key role in the administration's counterterrorism strategy, including the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden, and in managing the complex U.S. ties with Russia. Rice, who first started working for Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign, has a close relationship with the president and many of his advisers. She's known for being outspoken on human rights issues and also pushed for a more interventionist strategy in Libya.","President Barack Obama's top national security adviser Tom Donilon is resigning and will be replaced by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.

Matthew Bent was enraged when he says Wisconsin police brushed him off when he came to report that his son was body-slammed by a bully at school, so the father decided to take matters into his own hands with the help of Facebook. Last week, the Kaukauna, Wisconsin, resident posted a photo onto his online account in which he and his son are posing with a handwritten sign that reads: 'Bullying needs to stop now. Tell school districts that protecting bullies by turning a blind eye is wrong. Shame on Kaukauna area schools for protecting a bully in their school.’ Bent's desperate Facebook plea and call . to action against bullying has gone viral, with nearly 450,000 'likes' and more than 460,000 'shares' since the photo was uploaded unto . Facebook March 26. Scroll down to watch news conferences on bullying . Online plea: Matthew Bent posted this photo onto his Facebook page in which he and his son are posing with a handwritten sign that takes the local school district to task for failing to protect the boy from bullies . Cartoon with a message: Bent's Facebook call to action against bullying has gone viral, with nearly 450,000 'likes' and more than 460,000 'shares,' and even inspired one of his supporters to create this cartoon . Bent explained on the social media . site that on March 25, his son, a sixth-grader at River View Middle . School, was body-slammed three times by a bully who has been making the . boy’s 'school year a living nightmare.' The father added that the same boy also stole a necklace he had given his son as a special gift to mark his first year in Little League. Following the body-slamming incident that took place during gym class, Bent called police but was told that because his son voluntarily came into the area were his alleged tormentor was, it was ultimately his fault 'for going into the lions [sic] den,' and there was nothing to be done about it. 'When I told the officer that this bully had been bullying my son all year, he said he only takes one issue at a time ad the past was done,' Bent wrote in a post accompanying the photo. Mr Bent then went on the offensive against the Kaukauna School District, accusing education officials of 'protecting bullies and ignoring their victims.’ 'My son has been bullied all school year by this group of thugs, and not 1 teacher, administrator, councilor or officer will do anything to make it stop, they only offer excuses and blame the victims!!!' Bent fumed. 'Please help me in the effort to stop bullying!!!' Father's outrage: Matt Bent said his son, a sixth-grader at River View Middle School, was body-slammed three times during gym class by a bully who has been tormenting him all year . Speaking to the Huffington Post this week, Bent said the response has been surprising. Many commenters on the social media site praised the father's efforts to address the growing epidemic of bullying in a non-violent way, while others shared their own stories of being tormented in school. However, in a recent press conference reported by Fox 11, Kaukauna Police Chief John Manion lambasted the Facebook community for jumping to conclusions about the case of Bent's son without knowing all the facts. Manion acknowledged that the boy had the breath knocked out of him by a classmate, but said that it was the child's own decision to take part in wrestling. On his part, Kaukauna Superintendent Mark Duerwaechter told the station WFRV that counter to what Mr Bent has claimed, his district 'does not protect bullies.' Mr Bent said that last week's incident during gym class started when a bully took his son's shoes. Another student took one of the shoes and threw it at the boy, striking him in the groin and forcing him to the ground in pain. According to Mr Bent, his son's chief tormentor then came over and pretended to offer him a hand to help him get up, but instead body-slammed him three times onto a wrestling mat. Taking action: Bent's son, pictured with his father and brother, told a radio station that he felt he had to tell his father about the ongoing bullying before it is too late . A school police officer spoke to the three boys who allegedly bullied Bent's son, but the entire incident was dismissed as consensual roughhousing, Bent said. To add insult to injury, Matthew Bent said that when he called the school principal to discuss the incident, he was ignored. This proved to be the final straw, and the following day Bent rolled out his anti-bullying campaign on Facebook. Bent has spent the past week posting about bullying incidents in other schools, including one in Australia, and talking about the problem with groups dedicated to this cause. Since assuming his unexpected role as an advocate for victims of bullying, Bent said that local school officials signaled to him that they intend to follow through on his son's case. Speaking on a Philadelphia radio program The Big T and Paul Show over the weekend, Matthew Bent's son said that he knows bullying is wrong, and he felt he had to tell his father about it before it's too late. 'If I would have hit the ground the wrong way and my neck would have snapped, I would have been done,' the boy said.","Matthew Bent's Facebook plea against bullying has gone viral, with nearly 450,000 'likes' and more than 460,000 'shares'

A whistleblower said Mr Clegg's officials reversed plans to axe a £2billion spending project in his constituency . Nick Clegg was last night accused of playing ‘pork barrel’ politics by funnelling taxpayer funds into the constituencies of key Lib Dems. According to claims made by a Coalition whistleblower, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg and his right-hand man, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, have used their influence over public spending decisions to covertly boost the re-election chances of Lib Dem MPs. The source told The Mail on Sunday that: . The source also claimed that public subsidies to reduce water bills in the South West were agreed by Chancellor George Osborne after pressure from Mr Clegg’s officials. Lib Dem MPs are clustered in that part of the country. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This type of pork barrel politics is completely unacceptable and Ministers must give assurances they are spending taxpayers’ money in the public interest and not feathering their own political nests.’ Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘This seems scandalous and underlines why it was a mistake for us to enter into a coalition. It is unacceptable for senior Lib Dems to get special treatment for their pet projects.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander have also been accused of attempting to influence public spending for the good of their constituencies . According to the source, the decisions started after Mr Osborne ordered Ministers to draw up plans for public spending cuts. One of the projects to be axed was a £2 billion scheme to refurbish roads, pavements and bridges in Sheffield – until Mr Clegg, MP for Sheffield Hallam, insisted otherwise. The term ‘pork barrel’ – meaning public spending diverted for local citizens – originates from a pre-American Civil War practice in the Deep South of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout. The Oxford English Dictionary dates its modern usage in a political context back to 1873. ‘Sure enough, it was agreed that a private finance partnership would be forged, which took it off the Government balance sheet,’ said the source. Responsibility for ‘signing off’ on the cuts fell to Mr Alexander, who in 2011 was facing the threat of changes to his constituency boundaries that would have forced him to go head- to-head with former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy. According to the source, Mr Alexander privately insisted that extra funding should go to high-profile projects in his Highlands constituency, which includes the Cairngorms. ‘He presented, as a fait accompli, a proposal for more money for mountain rescue teams, ski-lifts and railways,’ the source said. He received credit in the local newspaper for the ‘perks’. Another Coalition plan, to cut the . number of full-time coastguard stations in Scotland, was abandoned in . 2011 at the behest of Mr Carmichael. Mr . Hammond was called to a meeting by the then Government Chief Whip, . Patrick McLoughlin, and Mr Carmichael to be told to abandon the plans. Danny Alexander has salvaged the state subsidy for the Cairngorm Mountain Railway - which benefits his constituents . The source said: ‘Hammond was told the manning of Shetland’s coastguards was a “Coalition matter” and he should scrap it. He was angry about that.’ The source said hidden in spending decisions were ‘bungs’ to the Lib Dems to ‘keep them quiet’. ‘The 2012 Budget ploughed money into subsidising water bills in the South West where there are loads of Lib Dem MPs. Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman failed to address the ‘pork barrel’ allegations. He said: ‘The biggest financial decisions the Lib Dems have made in Government have been to raise the income tax threshold every year.’ Mr Hammond was unavailable.","Whistleblower claims senior Lib Dems influencing spending decisions .

He was told that stopping the cuts, which would have affected Mr Carmichael’s  Orkney and Shetland constituency, had become a ‘Coalition matter’."

An agoraphobic singer has released her first single after becoming a YouTube sensation - despite not leaving her house for three years. Jemma Pixie Hixon, 21, has become a global star despite suffering from a crippling fear of the outdoors. Largely unknown in the UK, she is a household name in China and the Far East and has attracted nearly 12 million views on the internet. She creates her music in a makeshift studio in her bedroom in Malvern, Worcestershire, where she lives with her parents. Her first single, Never Let Go, was released last week. The instrumental was produced by DJ5parks while Jemma recorded her vocals on a laptop at home. She hopes it will help highlight the plight of others affected by agoraphobia. Jemma said: 'It would be amazing if people bought my single, it does have chart eligibility, so it's up to everyone who's supported me and followed me to help make the single do as well as possible. 'It would be a huge honour if it did well and I hope it would inspire other agoraphobics, or anyone at all for that matter, that you don't have to give up or let anything get in the way of your dreams.' Jemma started suffering panic attacks when she was just six years old and her condition spiralled when she left school at 16 and had no daily routine of leaving the house. She last left her house three years ago and has not gone further than the garden gate ever since. Scroll down for video . YouTube hit: Jemma recorded her vocals on her laptop computer.

Jemma explained: 'When I have an attack I feel really short of breath and it's like my heart is going to explode. I literally feel like I'm going to die. 'It's a strange thing because I know logically I have nothing to worry about walking out of the house but it's a completely different thing when I actually try and do it. 'After I left school I didn't really have any reason to get me out of the house so it was easy for me to stay in. 'I wanted to go to university but couldn't because of my condition. It's had a huge affect on my life.' Star material: Jemma hopes her new single will draw attention to her crippling condition . Jemma - who lives with her property developer mum Tonia, 50, and dad Mark, 49, in their six-bedroom detached house - uses a microphone, webcam and Apple Mac to produce and broadcast her music. She started by uploading cover versions of songs onto YouTube but has since progressed to producing her own material. Jemma is now well-known in China and last year won the coveted 'most viewed' video of the month in the whole of the country. She has seen dozens of psychologists and hypnotherapists but no one has been able to cure her agoraphobia. Creative: Jemma sings her vocals on her laptop before uploading the video on YouTube. She has suffered from a fear of the outdoors since she was six years old . The young star hopes to one day be able to perform outside of her bedroom again, and feels that music is what makes her happiest. She added: 'Music is the thing that helps me escape and makes me happy, whether it's singing, writing or simply listening to it. 'When I'm feeling particularly anxious I like to try to focus on writing a sort of stream of consciousness which I then adapt into lyrics. 'Singing is something that keeps me going and something I have done since I can remember.' The single is available from sites such as iTunes, Amazon and HMV.

Those who are short of stature may be fatter than they thought, according to an Oxford academic. Mathematician Nick Trefethen believes the body mass index formula traditionally used to work out if someone is overweight is flawed – and he has come up with his own. And he found short people are actually more overweight than they think they are, while tall people are not as overweight as they are being told. Professor Trefethen says the existing formula falls down because it underestimates how much natural bulk taller people have. As a result, it overestimates how well-padded short people should be. By his theory, singer Lily Allen, who is just 5ft 2in, is not as slim as she might be led to believe. While his calculations tip the scale in favour of model Sophie Dahl, who stands 5ft 11in. The BMI formula is used by doctors up and down the country to work out if someone is overweight or obese and so at risk of problems from high blood pressure to heart disease. A BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 is normal. Less than 18.5 would see a person classed as underweight, while 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A mark of 30 or above means a person is obese. It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared and tells someone if they are of a healthy weight, underweight, overweight or obese. But under the professor's new version, the weight in kilograms is multiplied by 1.3. The answer is then divided by a person's height to the power of 2.5, rather than height squared. The professor insists his formula is far from simply an academic exercise – as the results could affect millions of people. Roughly speaking, each person 6ft tall would lose a point from their BMI reading. Those who are 5ft, however, would see the new formula add a point – enough to send them from being merely overweight to obese. Experts already question the use of BMI as an indicator of health as it fails to distinguish between muscle and fat and can lead to athletes at peak fitness being deemed obese. Professor Trefethen said it would be wrong for him to push for his formula to be adopted, but he says the NHS should justify its use of the current calculation. He said: 'The NHS relies on the BMI pervasively in all of its public discussions of obesity. We deserve an explanation of what justification they have for using this formula.'","Shorter people fatter and taller people less fat than than previously thought .

Most mothers get their first glimpse of their baby at their initial scan weeks into their pregnancy, but Ruth Carter was able to see her newborn when she was little more than a growing collection of cells. The 42-year-old gave birth to a 'miracle' baby girl by caesarian section today at Liverpool Women's Hospital after becoming the world's first mother to give birth after conceiving with the help of pioneering new technology. Using Eeva - Early Embryo Viability Assessment - scientists were able to use timelapse technology to monitor growth of embryos to predict which was most likely to lead to a successful pregnancy. World-first: Ruth Carter and John Traverse celebrate the birth of their baby girl, who was conceived using Eeva IVF technology, with consultant Dr Leanne Bricker . Technology: Scientists used time-lapse images to see how embryos were growing and predict which would lead to a healthy pregnancy . By capturing images at one minute . intervals scientists were able to see for the first time how different embryos were growing and choose which would be most suitable for IVF. Eeva allows embryos to be observed without removing them from an incubator so similar conditions felt by a baby developing inside the womb can be maintained. Mrs Carter, a clinical psychologist, and her husband John Traverse, 54, had been trying for a family for eight years but sadly suffered several miscarriages. In 2008 they went to the Hewitt Fertility Clinic at the Liverpool Women's Hospital and had their first son Jamie, now two, after a course of IVF treatment. But it wasn't long before the couple, from Warrington, began to feel broody again, so they sought the help of leading fertility expert Professor Charles Kingsland and his team again. Healthy girl: The 5lb 15oz girl has not yet been named but her father described her as a 'miracle' Happy family: The couple have had one son using IVF but had also suffered several miscarriages . The healthy baby girl, who has not yet been given a name, was born weighing 5lb 5oz today. Her father said: 'We are delighted to be the proud parents of a beautiful, healthy baby girl. 'We'd like to thank the staff at Liverpool Women's for helping to make this miracle to come true.' Professor Kingsland, clinical director at the fertility centre, said: 'As a unit, we have never been prouder to be at the forefront of such pioneering technology. 'By investing into research and technology, we have been able to debut Eeva in Europe and lead the way in time-lapse imaging technology. 'Miracle': Scientists studied time-lapse images of embryos to predict which was most likely to develop into a healthy baby . 'We're aware of how devastating . infertility can be for couples but with our implantation rates already . at over 44 per cent for couples under the age of 35 - we're going to . increase this percentage further.' Dr . Leanne Bricker, consultant in Fetal and Maternal Medicine at Liverpool . Women's Hospital, said: 'To watch our hard work in research and . innovation result in a real life healthy baby is the main reason we do . what we do. 'It is why we work so hard to make people's dreams of a family become a reality.' The Liverpool clinic was the first in Europe to be licensed to use the Eeva technology. It has not yet been given clearance for use in the US. Cell by cell: Scientists are able to monitor the growth of embryos using the Eeva techonology . Eeva, or Early Embryo Viability Assessment, consists of a computer, video camera and software package which work together to predict an embryo's chance of becoming a healthy baby. The technology is said to be 85 per cent accurate and can tell whether an embryo is viable - likely to lead to a successful pregnancy - within 48 hours. Experts called it the 'biggest breakthrough in IVF in the last 10 years'. It is hoped the system will reduce the cost for couples trying IVF treatment and make repeat cycles less likely. An Eeva test costs £800. In the past doctors used microscopes to study embryos as they developed. Then the embryoscope, which was introduced four years ago, took pictures every 20 minutes for doctors to study. But Eeva is the first system to take pictures every five minutes and automatically tell which is the strongest embryo. The system also means doctors do not have to remove embryos from incubators to study them. Professor Charles Kingsland, of the Hewitt Fertility Centre at Liverpool Women's Hospital, said: 'You can never predict whether someone will . have a healthy baby, but what it can do is predict with 85 per cent accuracy . which embryo is likely to result in pregnancy without touching it.' The company who made the system, Auxogyn, received approval for use in the EU in July 2012. It has not yet been cleared for use in the US.","Ruth Carter, 42, conceived with the help of technology which monitored the growth of embryos .

The British mother involved in a £1.6million cocaine smuggling plot is back home after spending a year behind bars in a Bali jail. While her co-conspirator, grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, has been left languishing on death row, Rachel Dougall has been reunited with her daughter, Kitty, 7, who has no idea why she vanished for so long. Dougall has been freed after serving a year in the squalid Kerobokan Prison. Speaking yesterday as she left her mother’s flat in Brighton for a break with Kitty, she said her daughter’s welfare was her priority. Free: Rachel Dougall pictured in Brighton yesterday after being released from prison in Bali after a year . Rachel Dougall drank beer on a yacht in Brighton Marina after spending 12 months a Bali prison for drugs offences . Dougall said she wants to wait before speaking about the one year she spent in a Bali jail . She was later seen drinking beers with friends on a yacht on Brighton Marina. Speaking outside her home, Dougall said: . ‘I want to spend a week or so with my daughter before I think about . saying anything about what happened to me in Bali. ‘Naturally I want to keep Kitty out of this. She is the most important person to me.’ At one stage Rachel Dougall feared she . would face the firing squad after Sandiford accused her of being part of . a British ‘gang of four’ involved in a major drug smuggling racket. In contrast to the welcome home balloons that greeted Dougall, Sandiford is still in Kerobokan while her lawyers work on the final appeals against her death penalty. She was one of four Britons arrested last May over a 10.6lb stash of cocaine brought from Bangkok. Dougall, pictured with Ponder after their arrest, has previously said she feared she would be executed for drugs offences but instead received only a 12-month sentence for failing to report a crime . Dougall, pictured in her cell, said she wants to spend time with her daughter before speaking about experience . All four initially faced possible death sentences for trafficking. But while Sandiford, 56, who gave evidence against her co-conspirators after being arrested at Bali airport was put on death row, Dougall got just one year for failing to report a crime. Dougall lived in Bali in a luxury three-bedroom villa with a large swimming pool and marble floors that she shared with her daughter and partner Julian Ponder, 44. British antique dealer Ponder - the syndicate's alleged ringleader - got six years for possession of 23g cocaine that was found in the villa but was cleared of smuggling. Paul Beales, 41, was sentenced to four years for possession. Dougall’s release came as a former fellow inmate claimed that Ponder arranged huge bribes to get himself, Dougall, Beales and Indian national Nanda Gopal off trafficking charges. Dougall's former partner Ponder, pictured leaving his Bali cell, is serving six years for drugs possession . Sandiford was sentenced to death for drug smuggling but prosecutors have appealed against the death penalty . The former inmate claims it was confirmed to him in a conversation in Kerobokan that sums averaging ‘around $350,000 (£231,000) each’ had been paid to have the trafficking charges against the four reduced. No money was apparently paid on behalf of Sandiford, whose death sentence is being challenged in a final appeal before the Supreme Court in Jakarta. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity, the former inmate offering to testify on Sandiford’s behalf said he had come forward because he felt she had been treated unjustly. In an unusual step, prosecutors – who asked for a 15-year jail term for Sandiford at her trial – have also appealed against the death penalty. A decision on the appeal is expected in the next two months. Sandiford sits next to packets of drugs found in her suitcase. An inmate has claimed that Ponder arranged a large bribe to ensure reduced sentences for himself and Dougall but no bribe was paid for Sandiford who is facing execution .","Rachel Dougall has been reunited with her daughter Kitty, 7 .

The rising cost of potatoes is forcing them from the daily menu. They have more than tripled in price from £91-a-tonne in 2012 to £295 this year, meaning schools can no longer afford to fry, roast or mash them. So instead of featuring in every meal, potatoes will be served up just two or three times a week in some schools. Cutbacks: Schoolchildren will be offered rice or noodles as an alternative to potatoes in order to cut costs, Nottingham County Council has said . Rain, snow and ice through one of the . wettest winters and coldest springs on record led to a shortage of . home-grown potatoes, with imports having to make up the shortfall. Nottinghamshire County Council . announced the news yesterday, saying potato dishes in its school dinners . would be replaced by rice and noodles. A spokesman said school cooks had . also noticed a downturn in the quality of potatoes. Kevin McKay, the . council’s head of catering and facilities management, said: ‘The impact . for school meals has been the rising price of potatoes, especially . jackets, where wholesale prices have doubled and the quality is poor. ‘Other potatoes used for mashing and roasting are also sometimes poor and cooks have to be selective in what they can use.’ Off the menu: The rising price of potatoes means Nottingham County Council is cutting back on the number of days they will be served up to schoolchildren in the area . Costly: The authority said the measures were being put in place after the cost of potatoes more than tripled in the space of a year . Mr McKay said the situation had ‘put . pressure on the schools meals service’, which charges £2-a-meal. He said . children had reacted positively to the new recipes which included . braised rice and oriental noodles. Some farmers have been forced to . plant this year’s potato crop a month late because of poor conditions, . placing even more pressure on last year’s stocks. The Potato Council says the yield for . 2012 was about 20 per cent lower than 2011, and with fewer acres under . cultivation the total decrease was about 24 per cent. School dinners are not the only victims of the potato shortage. Cornish pasty makers have warned the rising cost of potatoes may force them to increase the cost of a pasty as well. Some . farmers were also forced to plant this year’s crop a month late because . of the poor conditions, placing even more pressure on 2012’s limited . stocks. Last week . Somerset farmer Philip Vaux told the BBC’s Farming Today programme: . 'This season’s crop is well behind last year’s crop which was bad enough . as it was. 'With the . shortfalls from last year there is bound to be shortages of potatoes, . whether they come from abroad to fill the gap, that’s going to be for . quite a considerable time.' Mr Vaux said he had 'just a few pallets' left at his farm in South Somerset. One Devon food retailer specialising in jacket potatoes said: 'The price of jacket potatoes has gone through the roof in the last two weeks. Price rise: Potatoes cost triple the amount per ton today that they did a year ago . 'I have never seen the price of raw materials rise as fast as we have seen in the last few weeks.' However, the Potato Council disputed the council's claim that quality had suffered. Spokeswoman Caroline Evans said: 'You may notice that potatoes are smaller and have more marks on their skins as a result of growing conditions. 'This should not affect their cooking or eating qualities. We hope that everyone will continue to support the industry in a difficult season.' The National Farming Union spokesperson for the area, Allison Pratt, said it was concerning that the council - a supporter of local food industries - had decided to make the cuts. 'We know that Nottinghamshire County Council is committed to buying local food so we are disappointed to see that commitment is suffering,' she said. 'We of course, understand that schools have budget concerns. 'If the prices come back down, we hope that Notts County Council will return to their proud suppliers.' Daniel Moore, business leader at the Becket School in West Bridgford, Nottingham, negotiates catering contracts for the school. Becket organises its own ingredients budget, and Mr Moore said that the rising price of potatoes had become a concern. He added: 'There has been a noticeable increase in the price of certain products. 'We have been able to maintain our menu without having to increase the price, and we’re conscious that parents need to able to afford school lunches.'","Council said it can't afford to serve potatoes to pupils every day .

'And I mean that in the sense of ""not distinguished; not of superior excellence; ordinary,"" per definition 4 in my Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary: Deluxe Second Edition,' he writes, adding 'I'll stop short of citing definition 7: ""not refined; low; coarse.""' Polo shirt: Tech writer Rob Walker, a reformed Apple-lover, claims the popular smartphone has become 'common' in its six years in existence . In an article in Yahoo Tech, Walker, who recently switched to a HTC One smartphone, said the iPhone, independent of Apple, has become a brand unto itself. '(Switching from Apple has) made it easier for me to recognize that the iPhone is, in fact, a totally bourgeois device: The iPhone has become, in its six short years, the technological equivalent of Polo shirt,' he writes. '(The brand) has long since crossed over from ""cool"" (meaning something embraced by a minority that thinks of itself as having elite taste) to ""acceptable,"" meaning it's a sort of cultural default, like a Polo shirt or Nike sneakers.' He claims that the iPhone is 'the brand for people who don't want to think all that hard about what brand they are buying, and just want whatever everybody else will accept without question.' Walker's observations come after a U.S. trade agency said it is banning imports of Apple's iPhone 4 after finding the device violates a patent held by rival Samsung Electronics. Banned: The iPhone 4, seen here on the right, along with the older model, the 3GS on the left, cannot be imported to the U.S. anymore, a trade panel ruled Tuesday . Because the phone is assembled in China, the import would end Apple's ability to sell new iPhone 4 devices in the U.S. The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington issued a final ruling on Tuesday in Samsung's suit against Apple. The panel issued a limited import ban and . a cease-and-desist order for AT&T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone . 3GS, iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G. The versions targeted are more than a year . old but still solid sellers, Reuters reported. President Obama has 60 days to invalidate the order. Apple can also appeal the ruling. Samsung and Apple are engaged in a global legal battle over their smartphones, with Apple arguing that Samsung and its Android phones copy vital features of the iPhone. Samsung is fighting back with its own complaints. The iPhone 4 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iPhone still being made. It's the second bad court ruling for Apple in as many weeks. Not for sale: The ruling also states the iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G cannot be imported as well because they violate a patent held by Samsung .

Jeffrey Fazio, an attorney representing two of the four representatives of the class action, told ABC News that Apple refused to honor standard warranties and AppleCare Protection Plans if a white indicator strip near the headphone or charging jacks had turned pink or red. But 3M,the company that makes the strip (called 'Liquid Submersion Indicators') said humidity alone could have caused the color of strips to turn pink or even red.

But Vas Felini, manager of Neil’s Fryery in Salford, said: ‘This is ridiculous. Nothing is more healthy than fresh fish. 'And chips cooked the right way are nutritious. It should be down to kids’ parents what they eat.’ Local residents were sceptical about whether the idea would work. Nursery nurse Rebecca Hanlon-Jones, 23, said: 'I don’t think it will work. Obesity starts at home, and it depends much more on what the parents are feeding them the rest of the time. 'The ban would hit grown-up workers too - maybe that’s a good thing as some of them need it.' The plans are not the first time a council has tried to tackle obesity by cracking down on takeaways – in 2011, Oldham council considered bringing in a £1,000 ‘fat tax’ on hot food traders, but the plan was scrapped.","Salford City Council hopes to ban hot food being served by takeaways in the daytime .

It's a twist on a bacon cheeseburger that has foodies excited but health nuts checking the calorie count. Wendy's is set to roll out a pretzel bacon cheeseburger this fall, replacing the traditional hamburger bun with soft pretzel bread. While the popular chain is not giving anything away about the new sandwich ahead of its official release, experts say it could take the fast food world by storm. New: Wendy's latest cheese bacon pretzel burger with a pretzel bun . 'This could be a very, very big deal,' Christopher Muller, professor of . hospitality at Boston University's School of Hospitality Administration, told International Science Times. 'I . don't know why, but there's nothing else on the market quite like it. If it's a . hit, others are guaranteed to follow.' According to Nation's Restaurant News senior editor Mark Brandau, . pretzels are a growing trend in the casual dining food industry. They're already popular in Europe, while sandwich chain . Blimpie first introduced a line of pretzel bread rolls a couple years ago. While it has been reported Wendy's pretzel burger was a hit with test groups, the chain has yet to unveil the official calorie count for its latest sandwich. However according to Daily Burn, a version of the pretzel burger offered by family restaurant chain Friendly's packed a staggering 1420 calories and 79 grams of fat, 190 mg of . cholesterol, 2040 mg of sodium, and a total of 119 grams of carbohydrates. This is much higher than the calories in other Wendy's burgers, including the JBC (Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger) at 310, the Baconator at 970 and Dave's Hot 'N Juicy 3/4 lb triple at 1120. Competitive: Wendy's hopes its new pretzel burger will compete with high end fast food outlets . While the potential high calorie count may please taste buds, Wendy's concoction reflects its strategic direction. Associated Press reports the burger is a sign of the chain's emphasis on offering more premium breads that raise perceptions about . the quality of its food without raising its own costs too much. Specifically, a unique bun is cheaper . than giving customers more meat, particularly at a time when beef . prices have been climbing. The strategy is in line with a push . by Wendy's to cast itself as being on the higher end of the fast food . industry, which it says will allow it to charge higher prices more in . line with Panera and Chipotle. Innovative?: Food experts predict Wendy's new pretzel burger will change the industry and be popular with diners . CEO Emil Brolick and other Wendy's . executives have noted that small adjustments like bread can have a big . impact on how customers perceive the quality and healthfulness of the . chain's food. It's not just the pretzel bun; Wendy's has said it's . looking at a variety of options, including flavored buns and wheat buns. It rolled out a chicken flatbread sandwich earlier this year that is priced on the higher end of the menu. Of course, there's the fun factor for . customers too. Taco Bell's test of a waffle taco with egg has generated . excitement online as well. A spokesman for Wendy's Co., based in Dublin, Ohio, wasn't immediately available for comment.","Wendy's will unveil a new bacon cheeseburger with a soft pretzel bun to take on high end fast food outlets .

It was the moment that America's most controversial and outspoken right- wing voice found himself surrounded by New York's liberal elite. Glenn Beck, 47, fought back tears after a 'public lynching' he suffered with his wife and daughter at an outdoor film when cinemagoers turned on him. But what really happened is still under question, with one witness today claiming it was blown out of proportion and his . family was left alone. Scroll down for video . Family time: Glenn Beck (centre) snapped on Monday in Bryant Park during its Summer Film Festival, which he attended with wife Tania and daughter Hannah . Public insults: Beck said a nearby moviegoer kicked wine on his wife Tania (centre left) shortly after they arrived . The outspoken presenter, whose radio show was streamed on internet channel GBTV, said he was with his wife, Tania, and daughter Hannah. They were watching Alfred Hitchcock’s The 39 . Steps at Bryant Park's Summer Film Festival, where hundreds of moviegoers lay out . for shows. But his security detail was forced to intervene when nearby patrons made a pronounced effort to show he was unwelcome. Mr Beck claimed 'hateful' people kicked wine on his wife and hurled insults. However Lindsey Piscitell, 25, contacted a magazine to say . she was sat with several friends behind Mr Beck and disputed his version of events. She said his family was left 'completely alone, and for the most part he . was too' - adding that the wine glass incident was 'a complete . accident'. But a Twitter account under her name said: 'F*****g #a*****e @glenbeck is siting next to me at Bryant park movie night #getthef**koutofmycity'. Another comment made under her user name on a blog, according to The Blaze, said: 'We were very civilized, apologised for the incident, and gave them some napkins. we were of course VERY happy that it happened'. Sticking it out: The host (bottom right) with his wife and daughter, who sat through the entire movie . Mr Beck recalled: 'We got there about 7:00. And it was a . hostile situation. Somebody kicked a cup of wine . intentionally onto my wife's back. 'As . my daughter and my wife went to go and use the restroom... on the other . end of the park, some guy stood up and and pointed his fingers at them . and said: ""We hate conservatives here!""' 'I was told a lot last night how much New York hates people like me... These people were some of the most hateful people I have ever seen' Glenn Beck . 'I was told a lot last night how much New York hates people like me,' he said, comparing the scene to a public lynching. 'I swear to you I think, if I had . suggested, and I almost did, ""Wow, does anybody have a rope? Because . there’s tree here. 'You could just lynch me."" And I think there would . have been a couple in the crowd that would have.' Mr Beck said his security team was worried the incident could have easily spun out of control, had he not kept calm. 'My security detail was talking this morning that had we reacted poorly the whole thing could have just gone up,' he said. Divisive: Beck said, 'I was told a lot last night how much New York hates people like me' 'These people were some of the most . hateful people I have ever seen,' he said. 'You can take pictures of me and make me into a monster; say whatever you want but please leave my family out of it' Glenn Beck . 'All I wanted to do was go . out on a blanket with my family and have dinner in the afternoon sun and . sit around.' He refused to leave despite the public taunts, but made a swift exit just . before the credits rolled, prompting the crowd to break out in applause. 'When the movie was just . about over my wife and I got out because it was hussle,' he said. 'We . didn't leave... because I have a right to watch a movie and enjoy a . movie with my family in the park.' But he was most distraught by the public taunts directed as his daughter and wife. Distraught: Beck took to the airwaves on Tuesday for an emotional re-telling of the incident . 'People were taking pictures of my family,' he said of images that later circulated online. 'His family was left completely alone, and for the most part he was too' Lindsey Piscitell, sitting behind Mr Beck . 'You can take pictures of me and make me into a monster; say whatever you want but please leave my family out of it,' he said. Ms Piscitell contacted New York Magazine to say his family was left 'completely alone, and for the most part he . was too' - adding that the wine glass spilling incident was 'a complete . accident'. She told New York Magazine: 'It was his security detail that seemed to . be unnecessarily prickly with the crowd, scolding myself and my friends . for acrobatics and other harmless activities taking place.' A Bryant Park spokesman told AM New York he heard of no incident report filed regarding Mr Beck and the 20-year-old event is 'usually civil'.

For those of us struggling to tone and trim our unyielding  winter bodies in time for hitting the beach this summer, ice cream may seem firmly off the menu. But a new type of ice cream has hit the shelves which promises to allow those looking to shed the pounds to still indulge in the frozen dessert. Despite its low sugar and high protein content though, some nutritionists warn that, though a healthier option than the original, it should still be enjoyedas an occasional treat. Available in chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavours the Wheyhey ice cream is higher in protein than normal ice-cream . WheyHey, from Holland & Barrett, contains no sugar and has as much protein as a 70 gram chicken breast. With just 123 calories in each tub, its makers claim it is a much healthier alternative to similar products. The whey protein - which gives each 150ml tub its name – is said to help build lean muscle and is perfect for those wanting to tone-up their bodies in time for their holidays. Priced at £2.69, it is available in the traditional ice cream flavours - strawberry, chocolate and vanilla.The product, which is already on sale, is set to be one of the stores biggest selling products this summer. While the ice cream may be a healthier alternative to normal ice-cream, nutritionists warn it should still be viewed as a treat . A spokesman for Holland & Barrett said: ‘WheyHey received huge interest in a small trial recently and quickly sold out. The stock we’ve ordered is enough to fill more than 1,000 ice cream vans so we hope to be able to meet customer demand, especially now the sunny weather is finally here.’ Nutritionist Kate Butler said the product provides very high levels of protein for what is normally a ‘treat’ food, although urged caution that it was not the sole-solution to weight loss or muscle building. She added: ‘The reason there is no sugar in each tub is due to a natural sweetener called Xylitol. This combined with the protein content is what makes WheyHey a much healthier alternative to other ice creams –and is why the 123 calories in each tub are derived mainly from the protein content rather than empty sugars and fats. ‘You would however need to combine a tub of WheyHey with hours in the gym and eat it as part of an overall balanced diet if you want to see the ultimate results.’ WheyHey, founded last year, is a favourite among celebrities, including former Dancing On Ice contestant Chloe Madeley and professional sportspeople including Rugby Player Jake Haskall and TV presenter Jake Humphries. Nutritional experts were sceptical of the product. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum said: Trying to portray an ice cream as being healthy cuts no ice with me and it shouldn’t with anyone. ‘An ice cream is an indulgence, pure and simple and this fad treat should be consumed sparingly and with some caution. ‘When even the sales spiel recommends caution – and suggests that hours of work-out are needed to work off a tub -  look for a ‘cooler’ way of rewarding yourself or your children. A glass of water, for instance, will do the trick and certainly be better. ‘ .","Wheyhey ice-cream contains as much protein as a 70g chicken breast .

FARMBloomington, in Bloomington, Indiana, listed an astonishing 44 requirements for a new line chef on the website Craigslist. The demands include that candidates never call in sick, never complain and happily work several double shifts in a row without a day off. While the position certainly isn't an easy one, with its long hours and low pay, this restaurant's long list of required skills makes it sound like a job in a real-life Hell's Kitchen. The advert: FARMbloomington placed this job advert for a new line chef on Craigslist with a rather long list of the duties involved - and this is only half of it . Describing its ideal applicant, the advert read: 'You always show up for work, even if you're sick as a dog. Let the chef see you're really sick and send you home. 'You are able to work double shifts for many days without days off. 'You never complain - especially about things the chef can't control like customer requests, the hours the restaurant is open, how busy or slow it is, etc. 'You cook your dishes exactly as the chef taught you, the same every time.' On top of these demands, the posting adds that employees can only respond to the head chef with 'yes, chef!' or 'oui, chef!'. Welcome to Hell's Kitchen: FARMbloomington said the advert was posted by a sous chef who didn't read it through properly but admitted it is company policy that managers decide whether staff are fit enough to work . It claims this 'is the only proper response in a traditional kitchen', adding: 'All questions to cooks will be phrased such that “Yes, chef!” is the correct and only response. If it sounds militaristic, that’s where it came from.' General manager at FARMbloomington, Harry Shafer, said a sous chef put up the job posting without reading it thoroughly. He told FoxNews.com: 'It was taken down as soon as we were aware of the negatives listed.  I promise that the ad does not reflect the kind of business we run.' While the advert was only posted on Craigslist for a few minutes, FARMBloomington admitted that it is company policy that manages decide whether staff are unfit to work. Mr Shafer continued: '""Sick"" associates are most often just hungover, so it is our policy that the managers decide if they cannot work.' But he added that FARMbloomington pays its hourly staff time-and-a-half if they work over 40 hours and they receive gift cards as bonuses. Mr Shafer said: 'Although we do run a tight ship and a very professional kitchen, I promise you our staff enjoys themselves while they are here (at least as much as someone can while working).'","FARMBloomington, in Bloomington, Indiana, placed the advert on Craigslist .

Tesco will monitor the shopping habits of customers who want to slim and advise them on how to eat more healthily. The system will work by using Clubcard data to check whether shoppers are loading up on doughnuts, chocolate and pizzas. The supermarket giant said it wanted to play its part in battling the growing obesity epidemic. Data: Tesco are t use their Clubcard technology to evaluate what everyone is eating . Tesco boss Phil Clarke said he would draw on the vast database of customer information held in Tesco’s Clubcard loyalty scheme, which has around 16million members. Tesco hasn’t decided how it will use the information, but options include offering vouchers for healthier products and promoting a better diet via suggested recipes. ‘The information provided by Clubcard is invaluable,’ said Mr Clarke. ‘Our customers have told us they’d like help in choosing healthy options, so on an individual level, we want to see whether customers would welcome tailored suggestions for how they could shop more healthily.’ Mr Clarke promised that customers would need to ‘opt in’, rather than being bombarded by unwanted suggestions from the supermarket. ‘We won’t encourage healthier lifestyles by editing choices, but we can influence choice by making healthier options,’ he said. Unhealthy: They want to find out how many people are eating bad food such as pizzas, doughnuts and chocolate . Mr Clarke told The Grocer magazine that the scheme ‘could be a really innovative way of highlighting those healthier options’. The supermarket’s technology experts have built an online tool - dubbed the ‘healthy little differences tracker’ - that will measure how customers’ habits change as a result of the healthy eating drive. It is also expected to contribute data on customers’ eating habits to government research into obesity. Only anonymous data will be passed to health research organisations, unless customers volunteer to submit their details and waive their right to anonymity. Tesco, which has already teamed up with charity Diabetes UK to research diet patterns, said that some 65 per cent of its customers said their lifestyle isn’t as healthy as they would like. One other major supermarket, which asked not to be named because the plans are at an early stage, said it was conducting trials of new store layouts to encourage healthier eating. A source at the supermarket said it had drafted in behavioural psychologists to come up with ‘nudge tactics’ to coax shoppers into the fruit and vegetable aisle. Tesco’s plan to use Clubcard information to target obesity is part of its Tesco and Society campaign, a broader effort to show that the supermarket is contributing to British life. Britain’s largest supermarket has already met one of its targets by reducing the number of calories sold in its own-brand soft drinks last year by one billion. And Mr Clarke said that Tesco would also put pressure on food producers to follow suit. Campaign: Tesco want to encourage shoppers to eat a more healthy and balanced diet.They have suggested that they might offer deals on better food . ‘We want to take others with us, including suppliers,’ he said. Tesco has also thrown its weight behind government plans to introduce a universal label on the front of packaging, informing buyers of how much fat, sugar and salt they contain. And the supermarket has also stepped up efforts to reduce the amount of food that is wasted every day in Britain. Mr Clarke said last week that the average British family was wasting £700 of food a year. He said Tesco would help by cutting down on promotions that encourage customers to buy large amounts of food that has only a very short shelf life. Tesco’s campaigns on food waste and obesity come with the reputation of supermarkets at a low ebb, after horsemeat was found in food sold by a string of major retailers.","The system will use Clubcard data to check what shoppers are eating .

The San Jose Mercury News reports that counsel for Nanette Kinkade and his girlfriend Amy Pinto announced the settlement but wouldn't provide further details, leaving it unclear who will inherit Kinkade's San Francisco Bay area mansion and his warehouse of paintings. In a statement, they said the women kept Kinkade's message of 'love, spirituality and optimism' in their amicable resolution. Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, took her late husband's girlfriend to court to keep her from getting a share of Kinkade's estate . Mistress: Amy Pinto, who began dating Kinkade six months after his marriage of 28 years imploded, said the man Kinkade wrote two notes bequeathing her his mansion and $10 million . The famous artist Thomas Kinkade's signature has been appearing on new paintings, despite his death last year . The dispute went public after the 54-year-old artist died on April 6 from an accidental overdose of alcohol and prescription tranquilizers. Pinto, who began dating Kinkade six months after his marriage of 28 years imploded, claimed Kinkade wrote two notes bequeathing her his mansion and $10 million to establish a museum of his paintings. The barely legible note read: ‘I, Thomas Kinkade, being . of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to Amy Pinto $10,000,000 . in cash from my corporate policy.’ He . also wrote that Pinto should have his two properties on . Ridgecrest Avenue ‘for her security'. It is signed and dated November . 18, 2011. Nanette . Kinkade disputed those claims and sought full control of the . estate. His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is . the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court . seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto. Will and testament: The will was written on notepaper and is barely legible . In April, lawyers portrayed Mr . Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who was out to 'tear down' the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family. Lawyers for Pinto filed court papers stating that she and Kinkade had planned to marry as soon as his divorce went through. But despite the acrimonious battle of the summer, the two parties said they have put their differences aside in honor of the memory of Kinkade. 'Putting Mr. Kinkade's message of love, spirituality, and optimism at the forefront, the parties are pleased that they have honored Mr. Kinkade by resolving their differences amicably,' they said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives . Kinkade, the self-described 'Painter of Light,' was known for sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes.

Ransacked: Smashed plates and debris can be seen all over the kitchen floor as the primates run amok in the house . The video was captured by neighbour Howard James Fyvie and his friends who watched as the primates climbed through an upstairs window. The group watched through a downstairs window and witnessed the baboons ransacking cupboards and running amok looking for food. After a few moments, James and his friends fetch a ladder and go into the house to chase off the creatures before they cause anymore damage. They are seen chasing the animals around the house with a broom and yelling at the baboons to leave. Most of them run away terrified as soon as they spot the group, but one final stubborn baboon remains in an upstairs bathroom trying to open a cabinet. The cameraman yells 'Get Out of here, here's the door', while brandishing the broom, but soon bids a hasty retreat when the angry animal barks at him.

Smash and grab: One of the cheeky raiders is pictured climbing inside one of the kitchen cupboards . Eventually, the final primate is chased away and seen escaping over the garden wall. The footage was shot in the small tourist town of Betty's Bay on the Western cape of South Africa. Baboon break ins are becoming increasingly common across South Africa and have been attributed to the animals losing their natural habitat through erosion or urban sprawl. The creatures are often forced to break into cars or homes in a bid to try and steal food. Some parts of South Africa have even been forced to hire 'Baboon Monitors' to chase the animals away from urban areas. Baboons that are known to persistently steal from humans have been put down in the past despite the species being protected in the country. Visitors are strongly discouraged from feeding the animals, because baboons associate humans, homes and cars with food, but it does not prevent tourists indulging them.

The BBC is facing an angry backlash over its decision not to screen the unveiling of the RAF Bomber ­Command Memorial on its flagship channel next week. While the Queen will be honouring the 55,000 Bomber Boys who gave their lives for the ­country, BBC1 will be showing repeats of Cash In The Attic and Bargain Hunt. The family of the late Bee Gee Robin Gibb, who led the campaign to raise £6million for the largest memorial to be built in London for 200 years, said: 'This is a disgrace.' The BBC’s decision comes just two weeks after it came under fire for its coverage of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Thames river pageant. Under fire: The Bomber Command Association is surprised by the BBC's decision not to show the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial on BBC1 . The corporation will show live coverage of the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial on digital channel BBC News, instead of on BBC1 or BBC2, which will be showing live tennis from Wimbledon during the 35-minute service. Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, told the Sunday Express: 'I am lost for words. 'We are living in a fool’s paradise if we forget, or worse, ignore, the courage and sacrifice of 55,000 of the best and bravest of their generation. 'The BBC should question their real motives.' Defence minister Gerald Howarth said: 'It would be extremely disappointing if there wasn’t full and comprehensive media coverage of this national event.' Concerned: Defence minister Gerald Howarth said it would be 'extremely disappointing' if the ceremony did not receive 'full and comprehensive media coverage' The BBC claimed the Bomber Command Association was happy with its plans. However, the association’s financial director Jim Dooley said: 'This is a real surprise. 'We were told it was going to be broadcast live and it is a huge disappointment to discover that this does not mean the BBC’s main channel but rather a news channel usually watched by far fewer people. 'This is an active choice by the BBC for reasons which I dare not speculate about.' The family of Robin Gibb also also angry. Mr Gibb, who died from cancer last month, said his involvement with the project was his 'proudest achievement'. His son RJ Gibb told the Sunday Express: 'This is a disgrace. 'My whole family is astounded, my mother thinks it’s an outrage. Anger: The family of the late Bee Gee, Robin Gibb, who led the campaign to raise £6 million for the memorial said he would be 'very sad' at the BBC's decision were he alive . 'The corporation has really reached a new low. 'The 55,000 men who paid the ultimate sacrifice fighting Hitler’s war machine were all volunteers. 'The spirit should live not only in the hearts and minds of those who lost them personally but also in the hearts and minds of the rest of us, who are still benefiting from the freedom from tyranny they helped to ensure. 'My father would be very sad indeed today if he were alive to hear this news. 'We urge the BBC to amend its plans and give this important event the respect it deserves by airing it live on its main channel, BBC1.' The unveiling will take place in Green Park, London, at midday on June 28. Seven thousand veterans and their partners, many of whom are in their 90s and infirm will be travelling to the ceremony, some from as far afield as Australia. The Queen and eight members of the Royal Family will also be present at the event, which will feature a fly-over by one of the world’s two remaining . Lancaster bombers. A BBC spokesman told the newspaper: 'We are aware of the significance of this story, both for the ­veterans and for our audiences. 'The midday service is being filmed for later inclusion in a special programme Bomber Command: A Tribute on BBC2 at 5pm. 'The BBC News Channel is also currently planning to carry the service live at midday.

But there's no stopping Christian Grey and the book has become a hit anyway after being translated into Chinese for the Taiwan market and the smuggled across to the mainland. Best-seller: It may have sold over 70 million copies worldwide, but one Chinese e-tailer is selling knock-off copies of E.L. James's Fifty Shades Of Grey . Whilst one of E.L.

'There has been no publicity, so it is only a cult book at the moment. 'Most of the feedback we get is that it is very repetitive.' Whilst sales are high, Chinese social media is awash with mixed reviews and rated the novel 5.3 out of 10 because of its 'tedious style'. One such user gave her opinion of the book, writing: 'Who would have thought that such a vulgar novel would be so popular all over the world, even breaking Harry Potter's record? 'I suppose nothing can compete with sex.' Spot the difference: They may look exactly the same as the originals, but these copies are actually printed in Guangzhou from smuggled editions . In early 2012, it was announced that there was professional interest in a film production of the Fifty Shades trilogy, which is hotly anticipated and still underway. The Social Network producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti, who were hand-pick by E.L.

Natal teeth - which happen . in just one in every 2,000 babies - are teeth that are present when the baby is born and are . usually baby teeth which have come through early.

Mother Stacey Lewis said: 'As soon as Imogen was born, the midwives put her on my chest and I spotted them straight away. 'They're pretty noticeable- and I certainly wasn't expecting my baby to be born with teeth! I don't think the midwives knew what to say - they had never seen anything like it before.' Mother Stacey Lewis, 24, from South Wales was left baffled as when she noticed the pair of natal teeth . Midwives would not let the new family leave the hospital until they had . spoken to a specialist pediatrician. When they confirmed the teeth were . secure they were told they could go home. Father Scott Elliott, 27, said: 'We were worried the teeth might be loose, but she was checked out by a specialist who said she was fine.' Ms Lewis added: 'All these different midwives kept popping in and asking to see 'the baby with the teeth', it was funny. 'Our family were really shocked - they had never even heard of it before. That's when we realised how rare it is.

Delhi Police chief Neeraj Kumar says he has incontrovertible evidence linking the sordid saga to its D-company masters in Pakistan and Dubai. He told Mail Today: ""We have extensive details of phone numbers based abroad in Karachi and Dubai highlighting the network and apparatus. ""We are very clear that this is organised crime and that the entire operation was run by the underworld syndicate as a triangulated play: Mumbai-Pakistan-Dubai."" All roads lead to Dawood: Delhi Police believe infamous gangster Dawood Ibrahim (left) and his longstanding aide Chhota Shakeel (right) have been running a spot-fixing network through their underworld contacts in several countries . On Tuesday, the Delhi Police named underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim and his close aide Chota Shakeel as co-accused in the case, saying fixing was done at their behest. Ironically, the dramatic move came on a day that saw Chennai Super Kings principal Gurunath Meiyappan, actor Vindoo Randhawa and seven other accused in a parallel betting probe being granted bail by a Mumbai court. The Delhi Police said that the command for spot-fixing originated from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's outfit. Asserting that the main bookies Ramesh Vyas, Tinku Mandi and even the cricketers were in direct touch with the fugitive don, the police invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against disgraced cricketer S. Sreesanth and 22 others in the case. That there was mafia-style muscle-flexing involved has been made clear by Delhi's top cop. Delhi Police have invoked the stringent MCOCA against cricketers S. Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan . ""We have intercepts of top bookie Sunil Bhatia threatening cricketers and anybody else who needed to be threatened, saying clearly that the underworld wants this done or you are imperiled. The size and scale of the operation is humungous. Let me tell you that the extent of the malfeasance is widespread and the rot has set in deep. Money running into thousands of crores is changing hands with the hawala route back in our crosshairs,"" he said. Shakeel on Tuesday confirmed Kumar's assertion. In an exclusive telephonic interview with Aaj Tak, Shakeel said: ""Yes, we threaten bookies, cricketers and filmstars. We threaten them when it is required. But this doesn't means that we are involved in spot-fixing."" Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said of the IPL scam: ""The malfeasance is widespread and the rot has set in deep"" Kumar explained that bail is going to be that much more difficult since the offences are now in the domain of organised crime. ""And anyone who partakes in this conspiracy becomes an accused,"" he said. What MCOCA does is give Delhi Police that much more time to interrogate all the accused and take every lead to its logical culmination. ""We want to file the chargesheet as early as possible. We are also examining the role of another team and three other players by connecting the dots,"" Kumar added. A senior police official associated with the probe said they had enough call intercepts to showed the bookies had made calls to Dubai, Karachi and other cities of Pakistan to fix and alter betting rates. ""Efforts are also underway to nab a Hyderabad-based person who could lead to the door of another cricket team whose players were allegedly involved in spot-fixing. The person was named by bookie Mohammed Yahya, arrested in Hyderabad, during his questioning,"" the official added. Explaining its MCOCA move, the police said: ""Since the accused persons were acting on command of people based abroad like Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and Chota Shakeel who have a continuous past record of organised crimes, provisions of MCOCA have been invoked against the accused."" Detailing Dawood's role in the fixing scandal, the police said that Dawood's syndicate controlled gambling in India through hawala channels and also fixed the rates of gambling. ""This organised crime syndicate besides controlling illegal betting was indulging in fixing performance of players and rates of betting,"" the police said. By Sudhanshu Mishra in Jaipur . Bollywood actor Vindoo Dara Singh, arrested in the IPL spot-fixing scam, was till recently a director in the Jaipur's leading jewellery firm - Motisons Jewellers - which belongs to the two absconding bookie-brothers Sanjay Chhabra alias Sanjay Jaipur and Sandeep Chhabra alias Pawan Jaipur. IT department during a massive raid conducted last year on Motisons' premises had unearthed unaccounted money to the tune of about Rs 100 crore plus assets and gold worth around Rs 2 crore. At that time, the department failed to comprehend the significance of Vindoo's connection with the Motisons Jewellers. Vindoo was arrested after the investigators traced his calls to the two brothers. Invocation of MCOCA against accused in the spot-fixing case might appear to be a fillip for the Delhi Police in strengthening its case, but its sustainability is questionable in the court of law, according to legal experts. Lawyers feel MCOCA has been slapped in this case only for the purpose of denying bail to the accused. According to legal luminaries, slapping of MCOCA against the accused is not relevant in this case and it will be a Herculean task for police to justify the invocation of this harsh act before the court after filing of the charge-sheet. Senior advocate Aman Lekhi explained: ""For MCOCA to be attracted against anybody, elements of violence, coercion and intimidation should be there. But it seems to be absolutely missing in the case. It will be very difficult for police to justify MCOCA in this case."" By Sana Shakil . Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's close aide Chhota Shakeel revealed that many cricketers and bookies were in touch with D-company and were threatened. In an exclusive telephone interview with Aaj Tak, Shakeel said: ""Yes we threaten bookies, cricketers and film-stars. We threaten them when it is required. But this doesn't mean that we are involved in spot-fixing."" When asked that under pressure of D-company many cricketers were forced to execute deals relating to spot-fixing, Shakeel said D-company is close to many bookies. ""We speak to many players but we do not want to take their names. Will it be fair if I reveal that I have given money to some players,"" he added. On charges of operating one of the biggest cricket-betting syndicate in South Asia, Shakeel said: ""Is betting a crime? Lot of people bet in the world. Should it be brought under MCOCA?"" Shakeel was of the view that Chhota Rajan should also be put under the scanner in the betting case.","Delhi Police chief Neeraj Kumar says 'humungous' fixing operation started with Dawood .

The latest rankings on Britain’s higher education institutions reveal that the University of Roehampton is the UK’s most amorous campus. Roehampton, in south-west London, romped to victory – with students getting intimate with an average of 6.32 partners since starting their courses, the survey showed. A survey by a student website found the University of Roehampton was Britain's most amorous seat of learning . The result means a meteoric rise for the university which has jumped from 99th last year to 1st in this year's rankings. Many students at Roehampton have been asking what or who is responsible for the dramatic surge. Ciaran North, a student at the . university, said: 'A large amount of it is already being attributed to . this year’s freshers. This is a fair argument. 'If you are looking purely at the . stats, you have to accept that something must have changed since last . year, and why not blame it all on the freshers. 'After all, they are paying all that extra money to go to university, so why would they not make the absolute most of it? Top of the table: The University of Roehampton's Froebel College Campus, in south-west London . 'But there are alternatives. Maybe it took our second years a bit of time to settle in to their rhythm?' Another theory is that with a ratio of one man to three women, the male students have been making hay while the sun shines. Hot on the heels of Roehampton was . Liverpool Hope (6.06), the Open University (5.91), the University of . Dundee (5.55) and Edge Hill (5.53). Coming last were the hard working . students of Salford, who have only slept with an average of 1.35 people . during their university careers so far. Bangor, who topped the table last year, failed to live up to their name this year and slipped to a underwhelming 39th place. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the more successful students from the 'red brick' universities did not fare too well in the sex table. Oxford came in 33rd place with a score of 4.17, Cambridge came 44th with 3.92 and LSE came 18th with 4.68. Studentbeans.com interviewed 6,653 .

He described the last few months of his wife’s life as 'a misery', saying that she worried constantly about her benefit payments and worried that she would be seen as 'a scrounger'. She was formerly granted less than £110 a week in employment and support allowance, but following the ruling, was told that it was being stopped as she lay dying in hospital. Mrs Wootton, who lived in Rayleigh, Essex, had her first heart and lung transplant in 1985 and returned to work, but her body began to reject the transplanted organs. She had a second heart and lung transplant four years later, but complications meant that she was in surgery for 31 hours. Following the second transplant, she was unable to return to work and began to receive benefit payments while her husband worked. Mr Wootton said his wife was not fit to work as she was 'listless', would faint regularly and was frequently in and out of the Harefield Hospital in Middlesex, where she was seen by heart and lung specialists. In February, her employment support allowance was withdrawn as the Coalition Government promised to 'get tougher' on welfare. She . then had to be assessed by Atos assessors in Southend, but despite her . regular blackouts and medical history her husband was not allowed to be . present. Mrs Wootton, 49, was on 10 different prescription medications a day following complications with a major operation 28 years ago . Mrs Wootton was questioned for 20 minutes and assessors found she was fit to work and subsequently stopped her employment support allowance and disability living allowance. She appealed, but the Department for Work and Pensions rejected it. Mrs Wootton died in hospital on April 24 with her husband by her side. He now wants to expose the ordeal his wife went through. Mr Wootton said: . 'I do not know how, or if, it will change the system, but at least we . can show the population what people like Linda have to go through at the . hands of these people.' Some of the questions Mrs Wootton is likely to have been asked by Atos: . Do you read the paper? Do you live alone or with someone? Do you have children? Do you watch TV? How did you get here today? Do you do your own shopping? How often do you see a doctor? How often do you see a nurse? What time do you get up? Can you get washed? Can you get dressed? Do you cook? Do you have hallucinations? Have you ever hurt yourself? What is 100 minus 25? Can you spell 'world'? What is 96 minus 7? Can you name the current Prime Minister? Can you name the President of the U.S.? Do you drink alcohol? How is your temper? Do you listen to music? Do you have a mobile phone? A spokesman for the DWP said: 'A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment, and after consideration of all supporting medical evidence.' Atos Healthcare were granted a £400million five-year contract in April to carry out tests to determine whether people who currently claim incapacity benefits are fit for work. Atos interviewed and assessed over 20,000 people a week last year with Conservative party chairman, Grant Shapps, saying the assessments 'demonstrate why welfare reforms are so important'. However, almost 40 per cent of those that appealed against their rulings had them overturned. Earlier this year, the executive in charge of the medical assessments for benefit claimants, made a public apology to those that Atos Healthcare had incorrectly assessed as being 'fit for work' Mrs Wootton had appealed against the decision that she was fit for work, but the appeal was rejected by the firm, despite her medical history. A statement on the Atos website says: 'The assessments look at how conditions affect an individual in undertaking activities and tasks of daily living, rather than focusing on the diagnosis of the medical condition or its treatment. 'They focus on what the person does in a typical day, how this is achieved and how it varies or fluctuates. We then combine information from the assessment with their own observations and medical knowledge to provide an independent report to the DWP.' The Government ordered fresh assessments on thousands of people claiming incapacity benefits back in 2010. DWP statistics show 41 per cent of claimants have appealed against decisions on their benefits after the tests, with 38 per cent having previous decisions overturned. Factoring in these successful appeals would significantly lower the number of people found 'fit for work'. But charities have voiced concern that the the Work Capability Assessment is unfair. In November last year it was revealed a heart patient was told he was fit for work - just a day after a double heart bypass operation. Danny . Shurmer, 60, received the letter from a healthcare firm working on . behalf of the Government as he recovered in the intensive care unit of . Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital. Mr Shurmer's employment and support . allowance - a benefit which has replaced incapacity benefit - was . later stopped. It was only restarted after he went to a tribunal.","Linda Wootton, 49, was on 10 prescription medications a day .

Nearly four million British adults have never had any form of paid work in their lives - more people than the population of Wales. Figures show the scale of the problem facing British welfare system, which has been criticised for allowing jobless people to be better off than those in work. More than a quarter of those who have never earned a living are aged between 25 to 64, and 205,000 over 65s had never worked before becoming pensioners. The number of British people who have never worked in their lives was 3.9 million . But the worst affected group are young people, with more than a third aged between 18 and 24 having never done paid work. More than one million 16 and 17-year-olds have left education and not found employment, or are still studying but have never had a Saturday job. The Office for National Statistics figures, which include disabled people who cannot work, show London is the city worst affected by lifelong joblessness, with 737,000 in the capital having never worked. Birmingham has the next highest number of adults who have never seen a payday, at 144,000. But most of the top ten workless locations are in the North of the country. Glasgow and Edinburgh have a combined total of 96,000 people who have never been wage-earners, while Leeds has 72,000. Manchester has 71,000 who have never been in work and Liverpool has 52,000. Bradford is next with 50,000, then Sheffield on 46,000, Tower Hamlets has 42,000 and Cardiff 41,000. TaxPayers’ Alliance boss Matthew Sinclair told The Sun: 'These are truly shocking figures which underline the importance of reforming the welfare system in order to make work pay once and for all. 'Leaving millions to languish on benefits for life is not fair on those individuals or taxpayers. 'But the Government also has a duty to create an environment in which it is easier for businesses to take people on, which means less red tape and lower taxes.' Earlier this year it was revealed that Britain had one of the worst workless rates in Europe, with joblessness particularly affecting single mothers in the UK.","Ten British cities with worst lifelong joblessness mostly in the north .

Horse racing pundit John McCririck at Central London Employment Tribunal is suing Channel 4 for age discrimination . And they’re off! The two front-runners in a high-profile legal derby left the starting gate yesterday on the first leg of a £3million compensation dispute. Out of the trap came flamboyant horse-racing pundit John McCririck, wind in his whiskers, sun glinting off the horse-brass round his neck. The trademark deerstalker hat was in place, of course, and his colours for this off-the-track event were royal blue (his suit) and scarlet (his pocket handkerchief). Coming rapidly up the outside were representatives of Channel 4 and IMG Sports Media, whom the ex-TV presenter and former Celebrity Big Brother contestant is suing for alleged age discrimination in what could become the latest in a series of milestone cases. McCririck, 73, claims he was sacked  without explanation from Channel 4  Racing because they wanted to hire someone younger. The widely-known tipster maintains the decision to put him out to pasture, so to speak, was based on his age as opposed to his ability to do the job. Channel 4 and IMG, which took over production of the broadcaster’s racing coverage from the start of this year, robustly reject allegations of ageism and say they will ‘vigorously’ refute the claim. Thus, in the unlikely setting of a central London employment tribunal, McCririck sat side by side – or neck and neck, as an observer described it – with some of the keenest legal minds in the land. McCririck is seeking £2.5million in punitive damages and another £500,000 compensation for what he calculates is a loss of future  earnings, career damage, public humiliation, stress and mental anguish. Claims: John McCririck and his wife Jenny McCririck at Central London Employment Tribunal today . Yesterday the Harrow-educated tipster, sporting a triple-horseshoe buckle on his belt and a selection of gold jewellery, insisted he had launched the case not just for himself, but for oldies everywhere. ‘I am so angry,’ he said outside court. ‘I am saying I was sacked because I was old – I was 72 at the time. But this is a far bigger issue that just me. ‘There are people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who dread that a younger person will come in and take them out of a job. They are in fear of it. ‘That is why I am claiming £3million in total, so that no-one will ever be sacked because they are trying to get a younger person. On merit and ability – fine; but not because they are younger.’ The ‘suits and skirts’, as he called his ex-bosses, were ‘never answerable to anybody’. He added: ‘They make their decisions, they can destroy people’s lives and careers, and they are never made answerable. Now they are going to be answerable...’ McCririck arrived at the tribunal with his wife Jenny at his side, his partner for more than 40 years. He affectionately calls her ‘The Booby’, a reference to a gannet-like seabird, apparently. In contrast to her husband’s outlandish appearance, she blended easily into the busy London street as he spoke to reporters. Mr McCririck was originally a racing journalist with The Sporting Life and also sub-editor for Grandstand . McCririck is reported to have engaged . lawyers on a no win no fee basis, and to have pledged part of any . damages to charities fighting prejudice in the workplace. The ex-Sporting Life journalist made . his debut as Channel 4’s reporter in the betting ring three decades ago . and went on to achieve so-called celebrity on reality TV shows, . including Wife Swap, in which he was partnered with ex-Cabinet minister . Edwina Currie. His legal battle is one of a  growing . number of such cases to reach employment tribunals since age . discrimination was added to the list of eligible claims in 2006. Two years ago BBC Countryfile . front-woman Miriam O’Reilly won a widely-publicised case against the . corporation after she was replaced by younger presenters. Former newsreader and broadcaster . Selina Scott reached a  settlement with Channel 5 over  an ageism claim . in 2008, when she was 57. Last night the McCririck dispute . still had the potential to fall at the first fence, however. The . tribunal has yet to decide whether a full hearing should take place. The case continues.","Horse racing pundit appeared at Central London Employment Tribunal .

New mothers 'obsessed' with getting a size zero figure soon after giving birth should concentrate more on looking after their babies, the women's minister has said. MP Jo Swinson says she wants women to bond with their newborn and get away from the idea that they have to shed their baby weight quickly. She points out that there is a lot of pressure for new mothers to get back to their pre-baby shape in the same way as Victoria Beckham who lost all her weight within six weeks of giving birth to Harper Seven.

It is proposed that health visitors on routine checks after births will be trained to spot mothers who appear to be depressed about their body shape or who are trying to squeeze into skinny jeans overnight. Ms Swinson told The Times she was increasingly concerned with how parents are relaying messages about body image to their children.

Ms Swinson said it is important in the months after the baby’s birth to get mothers involved in baby-bonding time rather than wondering how they can get back into a pair of jeans. She warned obsessing about image could influence small children's . perceptions of their image when they get older and also potentially harm the mother's bond with her baby. Ms Swinson added that another important issue was how fathers related to their daughters and the impact that this could have on eating-related disorders. She cited research showing that daughters who had a poor relationship with their fathers were more likely to develop eating disorders. 'If fathers start looking at women or talking about attractive women in front of their daughters, that can have an impact,' she said.","Women's Minister Jo Swinson said a pilot study will be launched .

The gang members, including Adebola Alimi (pictured) were cycling through the streets of Hackney, east London, when the incident took place . Miles then tried to fire again, but the weapon jammed and he pointed it threateningly at officers as they sped off. They abandoned their bikes and threw away the weapon before fleeing over a footbridge on January 10 last year. Miles, from Enfield, Ikumelo, from Islington and Alimi, from Hackney,  are facing years behind bars after they were convicted of possessing a colt calibre . revolver with the intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition and . possessing a knife after a trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

PC Richard Gilbert spotted the group . acting suspiciously at around 11.30pm and approached them in the . unmarked police care with another officer in the passenger seat. 'They were all fiddling with their waists, and I assumed they were going to drop something, or hide something, which is often the case,' he said. 'As they were doing that the male in the white produced a handgun and fired a shot towards us into the ground. There was a loud bang, a flash and then sparks just in front of the car where we were.

He also repeated being unaware of . having ever met the second alleged attacker Michael Adebowale, 22, who . is now being questioned by police for the first time about the horrific . murder. Choudary said: 'I'm not concerned about anything. It was a lone wolf attack.' Anjem Choudary described suspect Michael Adebolajo as a man of 'impeccable character' in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News last week . The connection initially came to light after Adebolajo and Adebowale were arrested on suspicion of hacking Drummer Rigby to death in broad daylight after he was run down with a car last Wednesday. Choudary, who led Islamist group Al . Muhajiroun - the banned forerunner to Islam4UK where Adebolajo often . appeared with other radical protesters - last week said he recognised Adebolajo from TV footage at the scene. Choudary said last week: 'I went to the same primary school as him in Woolwich, Mulgrave, . and grew up in the same area and he came to the local mosque - it was a . peaceful community with lots of Muslim people from Somalia and Pakistan. I didn’t know him that well so I can’t say where his family was from. 'He converted around 2003 to Islam, before I met him and I knew him as his convert name ""Mujaheed"" when he used to attend our demonstrations and lectures. I last saw him in 2011, he was a very nice man with impeccable character and nothing unusual about him.' He added: 'What he did was unusual and it’s not the kind of view that I propagate and I do not condone the use of violence, but those views are out there. Some members of the Muslim community struggle to express themselves and he is making his voice heard in blood.' Choudary suggested that it was possible the attack was motivated by British government foreign policy in the Muslim world, and that this may not have been an isolated incident. He said: 'We are a very politicised community. Some people are angered by draconian measures such as ""stop and search"" and restrictions on free speech.

Four members of a family have been jailed after a former boxer beat his sister’s ex-boyfriend to a pulp and then left him for dead. Joe Bath, 26, from Margate, Kent, was so badly beaten that his mother didn’t even recognise him when he lay on the verge of death in his hospital bed. He was targeted by the family of his ex-girlfriend, Jade Cekic, 22, after she headbutted him in a heated row at a nightclub in Margate last August. Joe Bath (left) was left with life-threatening injuries after he was beaten by former boxer Lee Cekic (right). Mr Bath was targeted by his ex-girlfriend's brother after she headbutted him in a row in a Margate nightclub . Soon after the fight Jade’s brother, Lee Cekic, 24, arrived at the club to talk to Mr Bath and managed to persuade him to get into his car. Cekic, from Broadstairs, Kent, took him on a terror ride and, when Mr Bath tried to kick himself out of the vehicle, the former boxer unleashed a merciless attack on the father of his sister’s child. Mr Bath was left bloodied and beaten after being repeatedly punched and kicked by Cekic, who held a key in his fist during the attack. The victim was taken out of the car twice and beaten to the point that he was on the verge of death. He was twice knocked unconscious and left with a fractured skull before eventually managing to flee to a nearby house in a bid to call for help. The injuries were later described by doctors as life-threatening. Mr Bath's mother Deborah Bath (pictured) said she didn't recognise her son when she first saw him in hospital following the attack . He suffered stab wounds to his head, two bleeds on the brain, a fractured skull and significant bruising all over his body. As Mr Bath lay on the verge of death in his hospital bed, his girlfriend’s family begun a cover up that would soon see them all behind bars. Lee immediately took his car to the Herne Bay sea front and torched it in a bid to hide evidence - believing he had killed Mr Bath. 'It was a sickening and violent attack which left the victim with horrendous injuries and he will be scarred for life' - Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham . His father Negovan Cekic, 52, arrived in his Mercedes to pick up the attacker before they sped from the scene of the crime. They were stopped by police with Lee Cekic still reeking from the petrol he had used to destroy his car. He was taken in for questioning by Kent Police and soon a tale of lies began to unfold. Jade Cekic lied to police about what she had been wearing at the club and her mother, Paula Cekic, 43, deleted incriminating telephone texts and lied about knowing where her husband had gone. But the family were soon uncovered . when detectives taped prison conversations between Cekic and his mother in . which he said: 'They got me bang to rights on everything.' An . investigation uncovered mobile phone conversations between Cekic and . his parents as they attempted to assist their children cover up the . attack. DCI Paul Fotheringham (pictured) said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that Lee Cekic intended to seriously hurt Mr Bath and subjected him to a terrifying and horrific ordeal' And in another chat with his sister, the attacker said: 'He had to go at the end of the day didn’t he? If I didn’t do it then no one else would, would they?' And he also revealed to a friend: 'I lost it. I just saw red and lost it. Just went mad mate and lost the plot.' A spiral of lies quickly emerged and the family were left with little choice but to admit to their cover-up. Lee was jailed yesterday at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and false imprisonment. Sentencing him to a 10-year custodial sentence with five more years on licence Judge Adele Williams said he would only be released when the authorities thought it safe for him to return to society. Judge Williams added that Cekic had . beaten his victim 'to a pulp' with a car key found by police that was . 'encrusted with Mr Bath’s blood'. The judge also commended police officers for their 'excellent' work on the case.

Connolly, prosecuting, said: 'This incident all centres around the . former relationship between Joe Bath and Jade Cekic who were in a . relationship which ended two years ago but have a daughter. 'There . was an argument in which Mr Bath claims he was headbutted and punched . by her. As a result she was ejected from the club.

I thought he was going to die' - Deborah Bath . 'He was then asked to follow the car down to an area where there was no CCTV. He did so and then got into the car voluntarily, which was then driven out of Margate. He was then lunged at by Lee and was hit by something sharp - a key. 'He was then forced out of the car . and subjected to a beating, which included punching and kicking to the . head, face and back. He lost consciousness. And when he was examined at . hospital he was unable to open his eyes because they were so swollen and . had dried blood covering his face and scalp. A scan later revealed a . fracture to his skull.' After . the hearing, Mr Bath’s mother Deborah Bath said: 'When I first saw my . son in hospital I didn’t recognise him. I almost walked past him. I . thought he was going to die.' She also revealed that since the attack, her son had become 'very quiet'. Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard Mr Bath was twice knocked unconscious and left with a fractured skull before eventually managing to flee to a nearby house in a bid to call for help . Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that Lee Cekic intended to seriously hurt Mr Bath and subjected him to a terrifying and horrific ordeal. 'It was a sickening and violent attack which left the victim with horrendous injuries and he will be scarred for life. 'The offender’s parents and his sister then assisted Lee in attempting to cover up this crime giving false statements to the police and trying to shift the blame elsewhere. 'Mr Bath has shown great courage and bravery by standing up to his attacker in providing evidence and I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the officers who carried out thorough and painstaking investigations and uncovered the full extent of the assault despite attempts to cover it up.'","Joe Bath was beaten to a pulp by his ex-girlfriend's brother Lee Cekic .

A British adventurer bidding to row across the North Pacific Ocean has told of the terrifying moment her boat capsized in the dark, bringing back awful memories of her failed attempt the previous year. Sarah Outen, 28, has spent the last six days stuck in her tiny cabin, often strapped to her bed in case her rowing boat capsizes again. She is attempting, for the second time, to become the first person to row single handed the 4,500 nautical miles across the North Pacific Ocean from Japan to Canada. Her attempt last year was cut short after it was hit by the Tropical Storm Mawar. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

If she completes the challenge she will become the . first person to row single handed from Japan to Canada . Sarah shaved her hair for the trip and suffered seasickness early on. She trained for months for the voyage . Speaking from her cabin in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, Sarah, from Oakham, Rutland, told MailOnline she was hoping the weather would change today to allow her to resurface from her cabin and continue rowing. She said: 'It's been a challenge so . far. I always knew it would be a challenge to come back, both . emotionally and also physically. 'This ocean is a big, rough old ocean and I have certainly had my fair share of rough water so far.' The audacious attempt is in fact part of an even bigger challenge to loop the planet, using human power only, in her London2London: Via the World expedition. She embarked on the challenge in April 2011 and the first year saw her cycle and kayak more than 11,000 miles from London to Choshi, Japan. But last year her attempt to row solo across the North Pacific Ocean had to be abandoned after her boat Gulliver was badly damaged after being battered by 15 metre high waves and 80mph winds in the tropical storm.

Phoning in: She can keep in touch using a satellite phone from her cabin where she stores her food and sleeps . The 28-year-old is the first woman and the youngest person to row solo across the Indian Ocean which she completed in 2009 . She then spent nine months back home preparing to take on the challenge again and on April 27 she set off from Japan in her second bid to complete the six-month journey. Sarah, from Oakham, Rutland, said she had rowed 1,100 miles east of Japan in just over a month at sea in her new boat, Happy Socks. She still has about 3,200 miles to go before she reaches Canada, but has already capsized twice. She said: 'The first time was a bit of a relief actually because I was very nervous about it. 'Last year I capsized 20 times and it was really a frightening experience to be in the cabin with the water coming in, so I was quite nervous about it.'

But while she may have been 'relieved' to survive the first capsizing, it was a much more frightening experience when her boat overturned for a second time this week. She said: 'Two nights ago I capsized in the dark and that really shook me up and brought back lots of memories of last year. 'This last week has been really quite rough weather and the wind has been blowing from the east, so it means it's both dangerous and I can't row in the direction I want to, so it's been pushing me back to Japan, which means I have been consigned to the cabin for the last six days. 'And when it's rough, in case you capsize, you have to strap yourself to the bed, so I have literally been laid down for six days, strapped to my bed which has been really quite uncomfortable.' Rescue: . Sarah first attempted the row in May last year, but the challenge was . cut short when she hit a typhoon several hundred miles off the coast of . Japan.

Rescuers help Sarah to safety after her boat capsized more than 20 times and suffered irreparable damage . But she was hoping to be able to start rowing again today as the weather was due to change. She said: 'That is the good thing about being out here, it's a really good reminder that nothing lasts forever - you get some weather coming in but it will change after a few days.

The bank holiday weekend may have been awash with glorious sunshine, but the rest of the half term looks like its going to be more of a wash out. Much of Britain has been hit with torrential downpours today, dampening the spirits of those going back to work after enjoying the bank holiday sun and delaying the start of the last day of the second test at Headingley between England and New Zealand. And for those who were looking forward to a sunny half term, the outlook does not look great, with forecasters predicting showers and longer spells of rain for large parts of the country throughout the week.

Mounted guards from the Household Cavalry (left) brave the rain while a woman carries an umbrella which has been blown inside (right) out on Westminster Bridge, London . Meteogroup forecaster John Lee said the heaviest rain had fallen over central and southern parts of England, while 10mm of rain had fallen in parts of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire overnight. He said: 'It's looking fairly cloudy and wet today and also quite a few degrees colder than it has been over the bank holiday weekend, so in general it is much more unsettled today with rain for many areas. 'It is probably central and southern England and parts of the Midlands which have seen the most rain. 'Looking ahead at the rest of the day, it's quite windy across the Midlands and the south which could see a further ten to 15mms of rain. 'It's not quite so wet elsewhere, I think northern Scotland and Northern Ireland are getting away with a mostly dry day today and in terms of sunshine, it's probably quite bright up there as well.' The Met Office however has predicted a further 20mm of rain could fall in the Midlands and parts of Wales, while East Anglia, Lincolnshire and the north east of England could see up to 25mm of rain tonight.

Mr Lee said: 'Tomorrow is a fairly similar prospect with more rain in places. The actual position of the rain is fairly uncertain at the moment, but in general it looks like eastern areas will be having the heaviest of the rain. 'Yet again, north west Scotland and northern Ireland are looking mostly dry.' There could also be the odd rumble of thunder in among any of the heavy showers.

Meanwhile, scientists at the Marine Conservation Society have said one of the most eagerly awaited visitors to the British shores may have been deterred by the long, chilly spring.

Jean-Luc Solandt, the organisation’s senior bio- diversity officer, said he believed it was because the water temperature is lower than usual for the time of year. Despite the fact that the gentle giants of the sea can grow to the size of a double decker bus, they are still prone to feel the cold and even a few degrees can make a difference to their habits, he said. 'Divers are telling us that the water temperature is 10 or 11 degrees centigrade. But at this time of the year it should be nearer 13 degrees,' said Dr Solandt. 'This means that the plankton, which is the basking sharks favourite food and the reason they come to our waters, are not blooming in the usual quantities so basking sharks are staying in warmer seas to feed.'

He was one of the most prolific and wanted criminals of the Victorian age whose infamy was recorded in newspapers from Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands. Now, the life of Charles Peace, prolific cat burglar, escape artist, murderer and master of disguise, has been laid bare by researchers, using crime records as well as the numerous newspaper stories about him at the time. Over 25-years Charles Peace, the son of a one-legged lion tamer, carried out a series of burglaries across Sheffield, Manchester and London, shot at several police officers, killing one, as well as a neighbour. He also managed to escape from prison. The execution of Peace: Charles Peace was hanged on February 25, 1879, at Leeds after becoming one of Victorian Britain's most wanted men . He is believed to have avoided detection for many years with an ability to alter the shape of his face. He also used a fake arm to hide the fact he had a missing finger. By the time the law finally caught up with him in 1879, when he was hanged at Armley Goal in Leeds, there was a reward of £100 on his head – the equivalent of around £8,785 today. Peace was first arrested for house breaking in 1854. Over the next 20 years he was arrested and convicted several times. After one prison stint he moved to Manchester but, in August 1859, was caught in the act of committing a burglary and arrested, though not before shooting and nearly killing his arresting officer. He was sentenced to six years' penal servitude. Having served his sentence at various prisons across the country he went straight back to his bad ways and shortly after his release in 1866 was again caught in the act of burglary. He was given a sentence of eight years penal servitude at Manchester Assizes on December 3, 1866. But while at Wakefield Prison he made a daring escape bid. Entrusted with repair work, he smuggled a small ladder into his cell and made a hole in his cell’s ceiling with a hand-made tin saw. The night before: A newspaper illustration depicting the artist's impression of the dreams Peace had on the night before his execution (left). The artworks come from The Illustrated Police News . He was spotted climbing onto the roof and he then ran along the wall of the prison before slipping into the governor's house, where he changed his clothes and waited for 90 minutes for an opportunity to escape. He was finally recaptured hiding in the governor's bedroom. Following his release, Peace moved back to Sheffield and became infatuated with Katherine Dyson, the wife of his neighbour Arthur Dyson. The couple moved to get away from Peace, but he followed them and began a campaign of intimidation and harassment that came to a head on November 27, 1876. That night, Peace was watching the Dysons' house and when Mrs Dyson opened the door to come out, she was confronted by him, holding a revolver. 'Speak', he said, 'or I will fire.' Infamous: Peace was one of the most prolific and wanted criminals of the Victorian age whose infamy was recorded in newspapers from Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands . She fled in terror and Mr Dyson, hearing the disturbance, began to chase Peace who continually fired at him as he ran, eventually hitting him in the head and killing him. Peace ran straight to his wife and when two detectives arrived at his home she told them she had not seen her husband for months. As she kept them talking, Peace climbed onto an adjoining roof and hid behind a chimney-stack until detectives had finished an exhaustive search of the property. There was a price of £100 on his head and a description of him was circulated, but Peace shaved his beard, dyed his hair, put on a pair of spectacles and used a strange ability to contort his features in such a way as to change the shape of his face. He also wore a fake arm to conceal a missing finger that had been shot off. Peace went on the run and eventually settled in Peckham, south east London, using the name Thompson. He drove his pony and trap by day and burgled houses by night. He conducted a series of daring burglaries in the affluent suburb of Blackheath. At 2am on October 10, 1878, Peace was disturbed while burgling a house by PC Edward Robinson and jumped out of a window. The officer gave chase and, despite being shot at five times and badly wounded, he gallantly held on to Peace until help arrived. Peace gave his name as John Ward and was convicted at the Old Bailey on November 10, 1878, of attempting to murder PC Robinson. He was sentenced to a life of penal servitude and PC Robinson was given a £25 reward on the recommendation of the jury. Living in Peckham with Peace had been a 'Mrs Thompson', his widowed mistress Susan, who eventually admitted John Ward’s true identity. Peace was taken from Pentonville prison to Sheffield, where he stood trial for the murder of Arthur Dyson, but not before engaging in a violent struggle with his guards and throwing himself from a train in an unsuccessful bid to escape justice. On February 4, 1879, Peace's trial began at Leeds Assizes, the jury convicted him after deliberating for 12 minutes, and he was sentenced to death. Master of disguise: Peace is believed to have been able to avoid detection for many years with an ability to alter the shape of his face. He also used a fake arm to hide the fact he had a missing finger . Before his execution on February 25, 1879, however, Peace made a confession to a priest and admitted the shooting of another police officer, PC Nicholas Cock in Manchester in 1876, who had also disturbed him during a burglary. William Habron, 18, had been convicted and sentenced to death for this murder. Peace had even attended the trial but had said nothing. Peace was defiant to the end and was sure of his place in heaven.  His execution was carried out by the famous hangman William Marwood. Debra Chatfield, a family historian at findmypast.co.uk said: 'Charles Peace’s story is one of real fascination and he is without doubt one of the nastiest and most interesting villains from Victorian Britain. 'We’ve brought his total disregard for human life and law and order to light through our crime records and the thousands of pages of newspaper articles available to search online at findmypast.co.uk.'","Charles Peace's life chronicled using crime records and newspaper cuttings .

Prosecutors have admitted they 'failed' to charge a man for an attack two months before he killed his pregnant ex-fiancée and their unborn child. Unemployed alcoholic Tony McLernon, 24, lured Eystna Blunnie to her horrific end with a text saying 'Got a surprise for you, hope you like it'. The jobless computer game addict, high on cannabis, then forced the mother-to-be to the ground where he repeatedly stamped on her head and kicked her. Lured: Eystna Blunnie, left, was found dying in the street after being attacked by her ex-boyfriend Tony McLernon, right . Jailed: Tony McLernon, of Harlow, Essex, was found guilty of murder . A review by the CPS has found McLernon should have been prosecuted for an earlier assault on Miss Blunnie. The 20-year-old catering student suffered massive facial and head injuries in the murder on a housing estate in Harlow, Essex. Her unborn daughter Rose - who was due just three days later - was also killed in the savage onslaught in June 2012. McLernon had been arrested two months before the attack for strangling Miss Blunnie but the Crown Prosecution Service failed to recommend he be charged. Grace Ononiwu, chief crown prosecutor for the East of England, said the 'rational decision' would have been 'to authorise a charge' based on the CPS domestic violence policy. She said: 'For this failure to authorise a charge in relation to the April 2012 incident, I have unreservedly apologised to Mr and Mrs Blunnie in person and in writing for the distress caused by this decision.' Chilling: A CCTV image shows Eystna Blunnie walking down the street on her way to meet Tony McLernon . McLernon was jailed for at least 27 years in March when he was found guilty of murder and child destruction following a trial lasting just over two weeks at Chelmsford Crown Court. The trial heard he lured Eystna Blunnie, 20, to her death in July last year after telling friends she was trying to ruin his new relationship. When they met near her home in Harlow he jumped on her, kicked her and left her to die in a pool of blood. 'For this failure to authorise a charge . in relation to the April 2012 incident, I have unreservedly apologised . to Mr and Mrs Blunnie in person and in writing for the distress caused . by this decision' - Grace Ononiwu, chief crown prosecutor for the East of England . Ordering a minimum tariff of 27 years of a life sentence, Mr Justice Fulford said: 'It is undoubtedly the case that he brutally and repeatedly attacked Eystna Blunnie during the course of their relationship. 'He told friends he wanted her significantly harmed or killed. In April he strangled her, causing the baby distress. 'This killing was not the result of an unthinking moment of anger but instead he had contemplated the attack over a long period of time. 'The killing was truly terrible. The horrific screams heard by those nearby show the suffering and pain she suffered and for some period of time she would have been aware of the fatal consequences for herself and her child. 'He has shown not the slightest shred of remorse.' McLernon showed no emotion as he was led from the dock. When questioned by police McLernon claimed she had been attacked by two men and he had been unable to defend her. But the jury took just two hours to find him guilty of both murder and child destruction. Investigation: Police outside the home of Tony McLernon last year . McLernon had earlier told the court how he had been drinking more than 20 litres of cider and Lambrini a day and was addicted to the computer game Guitar Hero at the time of the attack. He described how he would rarely leave his bedroom, instead spending hours on end playing the Xbox game. Giving evidence, McLernon said he had been 'over the moon' about the impending birth adding that, in the days leading up to Miss Blunnie’s death, they had been getting on well. He said that his drinking and gaming habits put a strain on his relationship with Miss Blunnie. Distraught: People lay flowers on the side of a main road in Harlow near to where Eystna Blunnie and her unborn baby were brutally beaten to death . CCTV footage captured a heavily-pregnant Eystna Blunnie, a catering student and barmaid, walking through the Harlow estate to meet McLernon talking on her mobile phone. Asked if the text message was part of a scheme to tempt her to meet him, he said 'absolutely not' adding the surprise was that he had brought his dog, Alan, to see her. McLernon, who said he had suffered from depression and was prone to self-harm, denied claims he had physically abused her and previous partners.","Tony McLernon  jailed for 27 years for killing his ex-fiancée and unborn child .

His father sobbed as he recalled the moment police found his son floating in the canal at the inquest at Northampton County Hall yesterday. The dad-of-four said: 'It was a normal Saturday. The neighbours' children went to play with Giovani. 'I told the older ones to look after him, that I was coming back out. I was only in the house for two-and-a-half minutes.

A frantic search was sparked after Jehovah's father returned and found his son's bike upturned in the road . Although doctors managed to restart Giovani's heart, his major organs had already failed. Pathologist Dr Roger Malcomson told the inquest he could not be sure whether Giovani had drowned, as he also had hypothermia. 'I saw a little boy coming towards me. He said he had found Giovani. A policeman was there trying to give him mouth-to mouth. The policeman was crying, we cried together' - Fernando Kutati . Giovani was initially treated at Northampton General Hospital, before being transferred to Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) for a process called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which provides oxygen to blood in patients with failing hearts and lungs. Dr Raghu Ramajah, who treated Giovani at the LRI, told the inquest: 'His heart started beating again, but his organs had already failed. 'We had treated him for almost every organ you could think of.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Anne Pember said: 'I would say that he was playing near his home and wandered off and sadly he was found face down in the nearby canal.'

The messaging service is hugely popular among users, with more than 60 million active monthly users. The BBM messaging service will arrive on the iPhone and Android in the summer with the messaging and groups features. BBM voice, screen sharing, video and channels will be rolled out later, allowing the firm to compete with Google Talk and Apple's iMessage.

The messaging service is hugely popular among users, with more than 60 million active monthly users. CEO Thorsten Heins said the time is right to offer BBM on rival devices. 'It's time to bring BBM to a greater audience,' Heins said. 'I cannot wait for the day when all of our BlackBerry fans can send BBM invites to all their friends on other platforms. 'They have asked us for this for years.' The new lower cost handset was also unveiled. The Q5 will be available in red, black, white and pink. It has a physical QWERTY keyboard as well as a 3.1inch touchscreen. The Q5 has a metal casing, which is a break away from previous BlackBerry handsets which were predominantly made of plastic. The phone will run BlackBerry's latest operating system, BlackBerry 10. It will be the third handset to be released running this version. 'BlackBerry is excited to bring the new BlackBerry Q5 smartphone to our customers in selected markets around world,' said Heins. 'The BlackBerry Q5 gives you the best . of everything with its cutting-edge BlackBerry 10 functionality and a . physical QWERTY keyboard. Grammy Award-winning singer Alicia Keys, who was named BlackBerry's global creative director in January, announced the company's new BlackBerry Scholars Program. The new initiative will begin this year and provide scholarships in science-based studies for students around the globe. 'It is for youthful fans that are . passionate, confident and bold, and it makes it easy for them to have . fun, create, share and stay connected.' He said the 'slim, sleek' device will be available in red, black, white and pink. 'I know it's going to be a big hit,' Heins said. 'I think you're really gonna like it.' BlackBerry 10 comes with Instant Action shortcuts that let you flick words up and down while typing, to make writing messages and emails quicker. You can easily switch, or 'flow' between apps using the sidebar navigation and task manager. The Q5 will also come with BlackBerry Time Shift Mode and Story Maker and you can switch your BlackBerry Messenger chat to a BBM Video conversation, plus share your screen with friends with BlackBerry 10. The BlackBerry Q5 will be available across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America, with from July. Heins said the Q5 is designed to appeal to 'emerging markets', suggesting the handset will be a low-cost option. Heins, who became RIM's CEO in January 2012, said the company has made a lot of progress in a short period of time, by moving a diverse collection of people into leadership positions. He restated BlackBerry's committed to 'mobile first' and took a subtle jab at industry predictions that he might not make it to this year's conference as CEO because of the competitive mobile landscape. 'I'm happy to say they were wrong,' Heins said. The Q5 is expected to be aimed at emerging markets and those who cannot afford a higher end smartphone . 'We are not only still here. We are firing on all cylinders as a company.' RIM's iconic BlackBerry device, introduced in 1999, was the dominant smartphone for on-the-go business people and consumers before the iPhone debuted in 2007. The device showed that phones could handle much more than email and calls. Though RIM continues to do well in many overseas markets, the company faced numerous delays modernizing its operating system in an effort to compete with the iPhone and smartphones running Google's Android operating system. RIM's stock fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $15.58 in morning trading Tuesday. Heins said that RIM is 'definitely in the race' and that he is excited about its outlook. 'The most successful year for BlackBerry is well under way,"" he said. Grammy Award-winning singer Alicia Keys, who was named BlackBerry's global creative director in January, announced the company's new BlackBerry Scholars Program. The new initiative will begin this year and provide scholarships in science-based studies for students around the globe. 'I was inspired. I wanted to take this journey with BlackBerry,' Keys said. The scholarship program hopes to attract women, who Keys said make up more than half of mobile users. 'It's the beginning for a powerful network of women and a profound change in our culture,' she said. The firm also launched a range of celebrity endorsements and channels, including a Mercedes channel launched by Lewis Hamilton (pictured) It's expected to cost around £130 ($200) although no official announcement on the price has been announced. Adam Leach, principal device and platforms analyst at Ovum said: 'The Q5 could be a very significant device for the company, as there is a significant opportunity for high-quality low-cost smartphones. 'Emerging markets accounted for roughly 17% of the nearly 450 million smartphone shipments globally in 2011 and Ovum projects that emerging markets will account for nearly 40% of the 1.7 billion smartphone devices shipped globally in 2017. 'Blackberry is clearly aiming to replicate the success of the Blackberry Curve in emerging markets, doing so will help the company establish the Blackberry 10 platform in the market. However, Blackberry has significant competition in this area with a number of handset manufacturers championing an array of low-cost Android devices as well as Nokia’s Asha 501. 'The crucial aspect of the Q5 launch will be its price and if  Blackberry can address the sub-$100 smartphone opportunity.'","Firm set to launch its BBM messaging service on iOS and Android for the first time .

Rachel Hobbs, 23, fell to just 84 pounds before she unexpectedly fell pregnant five years ago but said the birth of her son changed her life for the better. The mother, of Guildford, Surrey, who is now a model, started training after having Finnley, now four, to raise her body confidence and promote positive self-image. Bodybuilder: Rachel Hobbs, 23, started training after giving birth to her son Finnley, now four . Her weight fell to six stone when she was 16 because of 'stress and worry' because her twin sister Nicola was suffering from anorexia. Rachel, a Surrey University graduate, now follows a strict training regime and competed in the bodybuilding Miami Pro World Championships in St Albans, Hertfordshire, for the first time this year. The single mother was initially planning on entering one event but she has gone on to compete in three more contests and has qualified for the UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation National Championships in October. She has now put on more than two stone. Rachel said: 'I saw ladies up on stage at Body Power Expo last year and it made me want the confidence in my body to get up there and do it.

I got a mixed response when I first told my family and friends. Many people are ignorant when you tell them about it.

Blessing Adebolajo, 32, was led from her property yesterday morning just hours after her brother Michael, 28, was filmed ranting with blood on his hands yards from the body of the murdered soldier in Woolwich. Blessing was carrying a bag full of clothes as she got into an unmarked police vehicle outside her flat in Romford, Essex, at 8.10am. Suspect's sister: Blessing Adebolajo, 32, smiles as she gets into an unmarked police car outside her home in Romford, Essex, yesterday morning . It is understood she was not arrested, but police will undoubtedly want to question her about her brother who neighbours said was seen regularly at the house. A woman purporting to be Adebolajo's sister told the Romford Recorder newspaper yesterday: 'We didn't know he was going to do this.' Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, 22, have been identified as the men suspected of murdering Drummer Lee Rigby. Blessing - who has also gone by the surname Daniels - lives on the top floor of the property and used to share the home with her terror suspect brother, neighbours told The Times. Graham Wells, 30, claimed that Adebolajo smoked drugs when he was staying there. Led away: Blessing Adebolajo gets into the vehicle yesterday and was taken away. She has not been arrested . 'He liked to smoke a bit of green (marijuana). We played football, a kick-about on the courts. He was a big lad, not the sort of guy you'd want to cross,' he told the newspaper. 'He used to be a normal bloke. he always had a big smile on his face. he'd say ""All right Wellsy, all right boy, what's happening?"".' Police also raided a home in Saxilby, Lincolnshire, yesterday which is believed to belong to the terror suspect's father Anthony, 56. In a chilling rant captured on camera the other side of the road from where drummer Lee Rigby, 25, lay dead, the suspect named as Adebolajo declared: 'The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers.' Search: Police and forensic officers enter the top floor flat in Romford, Essex, where Adebolajo's sister Blessing lives. Neighbours said he used to live at the property . Former schoolfriends of Adebolajo . said yesterday he was a 'bright and witty' boy who came from a devoutly . Christian family. However, he is understood to have converted to Islam . in around 2003. His mother . and father are hard-working Nigerian immigrants from an academic family . in West Africa who settled in London in the early 1980s.

A dog owner hit with a £7,500 bill to save his sick pet turned to drug smuggling to raise money to clear his debts, a court heard. Newly-married Ceri Morgan, 38, was forced to cancel his Las Vegas honeymoon last year to help pay to treat his bulldog Teeto who had cancer. He then tried to import £25,000 of the drug 'meow meow' to fund his dog's expensive treatment, Swansea Crown Court heard. Beloved dog: Ceri Morgan, 38, turned to drug dealing to help clear his debts after spending £7,500 to treat his bulldog Teeto who had cancer . But Morgan, from Morriston, South Wales, who married his wife Claire, 26, last year, was caught and was jailed for 18 months for importing the illegal substance. He was tracked down after a one kilogram package of drugs was stopped by customs officials in East Midlands Airport on August 2. Cancer: The dog had to have its front right leg removed after undergoing chemotherapy treatment . It had been sent from a company called 'Shanghai Trading Company' to a made-up recipient called Dean Cook. The Class B drugs package would have cost around £2,500 to buy but had a street value of up to £25,000. Prosecutor Frank Phillips said: 'The package was addressed to a house in Morriston in Swansea but police found Morgan's phone number on a invoice inside.' Police raided Morgan's home at Clase, Swansea, and found his iPhone and computer hard drive had been used to try track the package and to search for the Shanghai Trading Company. Mr Phillips said: 'A text message was also found where police believed Morgan had referenced that he had ""only gone and got"" a kilo of the drug.' Before his arrest for drug smuggling, garage worker Ceri, 36, said he had no hesitation in cancelling his honeymoon to pay his vet bills. He said: 'We were looking forward to our dream honeymoon but Teeto had to come first. 'He's such a special dog, we had no hesitation. We had to use the money for his vets bills.' Poorly Teeto had his right leg amputated and underwent a course of chemotherapy to fight the cancer in his right shoulder. Bride Clare, 26, said at the time: 'We told the vet that it didn't matter about the money, just do whatever it takes to make him better.' Dog lovers: Ceri with his new wife Clare Morgan at home in Swansea. They cancelled their Las Vegas' honeymoon to pay for the dog's treatment. Now he has been jailed for 18 months for importing drugs . Morgan admitted importing the drug and a second charge of attempting to supply it. He had no previous convictions for drugs offences. Robin Rouch, for Morgan, said his client was working with someone else and said it was 'not difficult' to import drugs from the Far East. He said he had been driven to commit the offence because of financial problems which stemmed from the illness of the family pet. Judge Peter Heywood said: 'Meow meow use in Swansea was becoming an acute problem and was reaching epidemic proportions. 'It's become very much the drug of choice in this city, hardly a week goes by when reference to meow meow isn't appearing in these courts.'","Ceri Morgan, 38, cancelled his Las Vegas honeymoon to pay his vet bills .

In 2011, the Legislature authorized . the study of what would happen if a quake and tsunami such as the one . that devastated Japan hit the Pacific Northwest. The . Cascadia Subduction Zone, just off the regional coastline, produced a . mega-quake in the year 1700. Seismic experts say another monster quake . and tsunami are overdue. 'This earthquake will . hit us again,' Kent Yu, an engineer and chairman of the commission, . told lawmakers. 'It's just a matter of how soon.'

Just six per cent of army uniforms were made in Britain last year under manufacturing contracts worth £5million while £75million worth of production was outsourced to India, China and Eastern Europe. Struggling defence companies in the UK have been forced to lay off staff and open factories overseas in a drive to cut costs or risk losing contracts. Senior Tory MP Patrick Mercer - a former Army colonel and former security spokesman - claimed there was a security risk involved with making the kit abroad and said 'every soldier should have a uniform made in Britain'. The staggering figures were released by the Ministry of Defence under a Freedom of Information Act request by Mail Online. Military kit: Just six per cent of army uniforms were made in Britain last year with the work being outsourced to India, China and Eastern Europe . In total, the Ministry of Defence . spent £80.6million on kit last year. £42.5million of this was spent . across the European Union, £5million on the Indian sub-continent, . £1.5million in north Africa and £27million in the Far East - with most . of that money going to China. In contrast, in the US, the law states military uniforms must be made in the United States by US firms. Last year, a £12million contract to make new camouflage uniforms was handed to the Chinese in a huge snub for UK firms. Junior defence equipment minister Peter Luff confirmed that the multi-terrain pattern uniforms were being supplied by a British company who had subcontracted the work to China. Contracts to manufacture specialist badges, buttons and ceremonial uniforms are kept in the UK, in deals worth £2.5million, according to MoD figures. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said they could not confirm exactly where their uniforms are manufactured because they simply don't know. The department has handed out contracts to supply uniform to 30 companies in Britain over the last year and western Europe and they in turn outsource production around the globe. Uniforms: The Ministry of Defence spent £80.6million on kit for all of the armed forces last year . Not made in Britain: While army uniforms are being manufactured around the world, in the US all kit has to be made by American companies. Prince Harry can be seen (centre) marking with these troops. Try and Lilly, which was established in 1864, make military headwear and have axed half of their staff in the last 10 years and outsourced manufacturing to stay afloat. The Liverpool company still manufacture a small number of bespoke handmade hats for the armed forces on Merseyside but larger orders are made in Eastern Europe to cut costs. Emma Graham, business development and marketing manager for the company, said: 'We never used to manufacture outside the UK until about 10 years ago when price competition came in. 'In order to keep competing we had to outsource to Eastern Europe. Over time you see contracts drifting away and a change had to be made. 'It is taking jobs away from the UK - our workforce has roughly halved in the last ten years and we have gone from around 30 workers to just 15.' Dwindling: The majority of large uniform orders are now made outside Britain, a freedom of information request revealed . In contrast, many weapons used by the British army are made by UK defence firms. For example, the SA80 small arms and the L115A3 long-range 'sniper' rifle are manufactured in Britain. However, other arms such as the Heckler & Koch 40mm Grenade Machine Gun, which is used by armies around the world, is manufactured in Germany. Military aircraft are also frequently manufactured overseas. For example, the Eurofighter Typhoon was made by a consortium of Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom defence companies. The Panavia Tornado was also jointly made and manufactured with Germany and Italy. The Ministry of Defence said that the majority of large uniform orders are made outside Britain. A spokesman said: 'Most volume production is sub-contracted by the companies to the major volume production areas of the world; notably the Far East. 'However, some volume production also takes place in Eastern Europe and North Africa. Provided certain environmental and labour standards, which are defined in the contracts, are achieved the Ministry of Defence does not restrict unreasonably where such sub-contracted work is carried out.' Mr Mercer said: 'I completely understand the need to find the cheapest contracts but you would think the uniforms of our armed forces should be made in the UK. 'If only for security reasons, every soldier should have a uniform that is made in Britain.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'More than half the clothing manufacturing contracts are awarded to companies based in the EU but items may be produced in more than one country. 'Prime contractors are contractually obliged to carry out regular inspections of factories or facilities used by their supply chain to ensure they meet minimum industry standards.'","£80.6million spent on military kit last year with just £5million spent in Britain .

A speeding driver who killed a young bride-to-be in a horrific head-on crash on a country road has been jailed for 16 months. Luke Anderson, 23, lost control on a dangerous bend while travelling at speeds of up to 81mph, and killed Hannah Seeley, 23, who was coming in the opposite direction. Miss Seeley, a midwife, was buried in the wedding dress she never had a chance to wear down the aisle. She had been for a fitting session with her proud parents just three days before she was killed. Grief: Hannah Seeley, 23, with her fiance Mark Wade, 27, who she was due to marry just months after she was killed in the car crash in Pakenham, Suffolk . Hannah's father Kevin, 50, said in an emotionally-charged statement directed at the killer driver: 'A wedding . dress in a coffin, Luke, a wedding dress in a coffin.' The midwife was due to marry her fiance Mark Wade, 27, on September 15 last year, five months after the fatal crash which happened in Pakenham, Suffolk. Killer driver: Luke Anderson, 23, was jailed for 16 months for causing the death of Hannah Seeley after crashing at speeds of up to 81mph . Anderson, who was nicknamed 'The Stig' by friends after the Top Gear racing driver, crossed the middle of the road as he rounded the corner. He collided head on with the Miss Seeley's Ford Fiesta and sent it crashing into a field, Ipswich Crown Court heard. The young woman, who was driving home to Stanton from a shift at West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, when the accident happened, was declared dead at the scene. In the days after her death, her heartbroken fiance Mark placed a wedding ring on her finger before her coffin was closed. The devoted couple had got engaged in Paris in 2010 and had planned to go on a US honeymoon to New York and Las Vegas. Anderson, of Barningham, Norfolk, admitted causing her death by careless driving on April 22. Judge John Devaux said he had been driving too fast to negotiate the bend on the 60mph limit road in the wet conditions at about 9.20pm on the night of the crash. Anderson, who wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was injured, was travelling between 71mph and 81mph when he lost control of his Volkswagen Golf. Judge Devaux said there had been a sign warning motorists to reduce speed on the approach to the bend, the word 'slow' had been painted in the road and there were also a series of chevron boards on the bend. He told the defendant: 'You were driving a VW Golf southbound on the A143 at Pakefield. The road surface has been described as wet or damp and was subject to the 60 mph national speed limit. 'While you were attempting to negotiate a right hand bend you lost control of your car, crossing central white solid lines into the path of Miss Seeley who had no time to take avoiding action. 'A high speed collision between the two cars occurred and she suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene' 'I have no reason to doubt you have feelings of genuine remorse'. 'Your speed was in excess of the speed limit and was too high for you to safely negotiate the bend ' Tragic death: Miss Seeley, 23, a midwife, was driving home from her shift at West Norfolk Hospital when she was killed in Pakenham, Suffolk . Crash victim: Hannah had got engaged to her boyfriend Mark in Paris in 2010 and had planned to go on a US honeymoon to New York and Las Vegas . Miss Seeley's family did not speak to the media after the sentencing hearing yesterday. However, a heartbreaking impact statement from her father Kevin describing the family's grief was read to the court at the last hearing, . He . said: 'On Monday, April 23, 2012, Karen, Hannah's mother, Kirsty, her . sister, Mark, her fiance and myself, visited Hannah in the chapel of . rest. 'Her eyes were half open as if she was waking up. If only that was true, rather than closed for eternity.' 'When I kissed her forehead she was so cold.

From their childhood bedroom to their first day at work and even their wedding day, these identical twin sisters have shared a lifetime. So Christine and Carol Coxe, who wore matching wedding gowns to marry their husbands in a double celebration on the same day in 1963, were determined their golden wedding anniversary celebrations should be no different - even though Carol was tragically widowed in 2011. Christine, from Mountain Ash in Wales, and her husband Ken Williams marked the milestone anniversary with a holiday along with Christine's sister - just as the inseparable foursome would have done when Carol's husband Robert was alive. Sharing a life: Twin sisters Carol (on left with her husband Robert House) and Christine (right with her husband Ken Williams) married in a joint wedding on the same day in 1963 . Support: Christine (left) and Ken, seen with Carol (right) on what was both couples' golden wedding anniversary, have been supporting Carol since she lost her husband Robert 18 months ago . After marrying on the same day in Treharris, south Wales, the twins went on to have their first children within a week of each other. When the sisters reached 50, they both decided to take early retirement and the foursome began travelling the world together. Mrs Williams, 69, said she was determined to be there for her sister when Robert passed away 18 months ago, and she and her husband have taken twin Carol on a string of trips to mark their joint 50th wedding anniversary. 'We’ve done everything together - grew up, got married, . worked together and had children all at the same time,' she said. 'We are as close as sisters could be. We have hardly spent a day apart in our lives. 'Holidays were very special for us as couples - we’ve been around the world together as the four of us. 'When we reached our 50th birthday we both retired early and decided the four of us would do lots of travelling. Inseparable: Christine, Carol, Ken and Robert (pictured left to right), travelled the world together as a foursome . Sisterly love: Carol and Christine, pictured left with their mother Mary and right as toddlers in matching dresses, got married on the same day and gave birth to their first children within a week of one another . 'We have been to so many lovely places together - Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Majorca, Turkey, Tenerfife, Australia, Canada and Singapore. 'We have so many beautiful memories of happy times. 'We’ve absolutely no regrets about anything - we’ve both had great lives with two wonderful husbands. Beautiful memories: The sisters, seen as schoolgirls with their mother, each say they know what the other is thinking . 'It was so heartbreaking when Carol lost Robert. 'For the first time in our lives there was a big difference in our lives. 'She misses him so much. So when it was our golden wedding it was sad Robert was not here with us - and we had to make sure my sister was still sharing our lives. 'So we’ve all been on holiday together five times to our holiday caravan in West Wales in the last year. It’s been fabulous. 'Carol and I don’t spend a lot of time apart - in fact lots of our family live on the same street,' Mrs Williams said. The sisters said it was their father’s 'proudest moment' as he walked down the aisle with a teenage daughter on each arm on their wedding day in 1963. Christine had been due to get married earlier after Ken proposed when they were 17. But they decided to wait so her father Ninian Coxe could walk both sisters down the aisle on the same day. Robert popped the question to Carol soon after - and they shared their dream double wedding at St Mathias Church in Treharris, South Wales. Christine said: 'Our wedding day was the proudest day of our father’s life. He always wished he could walk us both down the aisle.' They wore matching knee-length white gowns and veils, and carried the same red rose andcarnation bouquets. And the girls' husbands quickly became firm friends. 'Great lives': Identical twins Carol and Christine wore matching knee length white gowns and veils on the day of their double wedding 50 years ago . Happy day: Family photo albums are filled with photographs of the happy occasions the twins have shared side by side .

A year later, the sisters gave birth to their first children just a week apart. Fun in the sun: Christine and Ken, left, with Carol and Robert, right, on a sunshine break in Mallorca . Christine said: 'As children you couldn’t tell who was who. We can’t even tell when we look at pictures of ourselves. 'We . almost know what the other one is thinking. One day we went shopping . separately and came home with exactly the same coat in different . colours. 'Carol comes on holiday with me and Ken. In the last year we’ve been away five times together. 'Our family has always been very close. Our children and grandchildren feel the same, too,' she said. Carol and Christine also worked side-by-side for much of their lives. They both worked at a factory before opening a shop, and today they still run a weekly coffee morning at their local community centre. Carol said: 'We have lived our lives side by side and done everything together. 'Falling in love, our wedding, our babies - we’ve done them all at the same time. So we had to share our golden wedding anniversary with some lovely holidays away. 'Robert was a big part of our lives. The four of us were always together wherever we went. 'We’ve always been on holidays together - in Australia and Canada. They were our most memorable times together. 'Now we are planning to have a trip just the two of us in Benidorm or London. 'It’s going to be our 70th birthday this year so that will be another celebration. 'I miss Robert so much but it makes it so much easier to share my time with my sister and her husband.'

Hearty diets, medical advancement and evolution have caused men to grow bigger and bigger (and bigger) than ever before. So burgeoning are their waistlines and so sky-scraping their heads, in fact, that department store Debenhams has released a new mega-size of colossal clothing to cope with demand. The XXXXXL size, found in their increasingly popular Big And Tall section, is the chain's largest ever, an enormous three-X leap from the former top dog, XXL. Hearty diets, medical advancements and evolution are causing men to grow bigger and bigger and bigger than ever before . Demand for outsized clothing has rocketed by 126 per cent in recent months, and looks set to climb even faster in the year ahead, says the fashion retailer. The maximum size of trouser waistlines available in store is also increasing from 40 inches to 48 inches, to cater for the nation's burgeoning girth. Says Lizzie Singleton, spokesperson for Debenhams: 'Many of these men are Lawrence Dallaglio lookalikes - big and strong rather than overweight. 'We're seeing the emergence of a new generation of super tall, big, British hunks - and they're having a considerable impact upon the world of fashion.' The maximum size of trouser waistlines available in store is also increasing from 40 inches to 48 inches, to cater for the nation's burgeoning girth .

A devoted son who wanted to pay tribute to his mother found her the perfect Mother's Day gift - a new home. Michael Luangrath described his hard-working mother as his 'hero', and revealed his torment at watching her battle cancer and then lose her house during the recession. So he devoted months to finding her the perfect new home, and on Sunday handed over his mother's surprise present. Scroll down for video . Devoted: Michael Luangrath, left, bought his mother, right, a house to thank her for her hard work . Family: The blogger pictured with his mother, who says she has not had a vacation for 30 years . The blogger chronicled the process of buying the house in a touching video which has been uploaded to YouTube. Mr Luangrath spoke of his heartbreak at seeing his mother diagnosed to cervical cancer in 2002, forcing him to give up work to care for her. 'I slowly saw her deteriorate, I saw her become a shell of the person she once was,' he said. Although she recovered from the illness, she was left with hefty medical bills and forced to work non-stop at the shop and restaurant she owns in Las Vegas. The Nevada city was particularly badly hit by the financial crisis and recession, forcing the hard-working mother to sell her home and move into a cramped apartment. Tight squeeze: Mrs Luangrath moved into this tiny apartment after losing her home in the recession . Shop: Mr Luangrath went to his mother's business to pick her up on Mother's Day . 'When I walk through where she stays, I can't help but tear up,' Mr Luangrath said in the video before he found her new house. His mother talked in the clip - which she thought was going to be an advert for her business - about the struggles she had endured since falling ill. 'I work every day, seven days a week, I never get a day off,' she said. 'For 30 years, I never got a vacation.' Mr Luangrath decided to buy her a new house, even though he does not own his own home. The sale finally went through on Friday - two days before Mother's Day. Tearful: Mr Luangrath with his mother after he told her he had bought her a house . Roomy: The main room of the house in Las Vegas where Mrs Luangrath will now be living . The loving son picked up his mother from her business, and pretended that he had to go and pick up a friend. But when they drew up outside the house, Mr Luangrath delivered a tearful speech paying tribute to her as he handed over a small box containing the keys. Relatives gasped in shock when he finally revealed that he had bought his mother a house. When he posted the video of the gift on YouTube, Mr Luangrath wrote: 'This is the first house I ever purchased and I wanted to give my mother a home before myself because she deserves it the most. 'This was in honour of all the mothers out there that work their hearts out. Your children see that and will reward you dearly for everything you have done.'","Blogger Michael Luangrath had to witness mother stricken with cancer .

If you've ever wondered what's going on inside your child's mind when they're scribbling a story - and if they're writing the same sort of creative tales as their peers - you might be about to find out. A children's writing competition run by BBC Radio 2 for youngsters up to the age of 13 has revealed some of the literary habits of British children - and they include lots of heroes called Jack and Lucy, a penchant for writing more about mothers than fathers, a fondness for the London Olympic Games, girls using more similes than boys and an overall leaning towards dogs rather than cats. The young winners of the 500 Words competition, launched by Chris Evans on his breakfast show in 2011, were announced at today's Hay Festival. Meanwhile he Oxford University Press has been running all 90,000 entries (that's 40 million words) through a database to pull out interesting trends. The most popular names for characters were Jack and Lucy, and the most frequently used two-word nouns were time machine, space ship and tree house . The most common word written was 'mum' and its variations, with a total of 115,627 mentions, according to the BBC. 'Dad', meanwhile, just made the top 15 most common words, boasting only half the mentions of 'mum'. Dogs were more popular additions to stories than monsters, vampires or dragons, with the word 'dog' cropping up 25,000 times in the tales. Jamaica's Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt and England footballer Wayne Rooney, meanwhile, were the athletes with the most mentions. Other Olympians who performed in London in 2012 - such as Tom Daley and Jessica Ennis - also featured prominently in many of the short stories.

Dogs were more popular additions to . stories than monsters, vampires or dragons, with the word 'dog' cropping . up 25,000 times in the tales . Girls used more similes than boys, while boys described cars in much more vivid detail. And popular new 'slang' words included 'totes', 'yolo' (you only live once), 'amazeballs' and 'rofl' (rolling on the floor laughing). Fantastical, made-up words proved popular, with children inventing words such as fabdabidabulous and creatures such as the lumbagain (a ghost who makes people . dull and boring, obviously) and the dulbodogfragonaffe (a very big animal with the . head of a duck and the mane of a lion, plus the neck of a giraffe and . the body of a horse). There were also gadgets such as the shrinkinganator and places . like Mirangodangowangolopitis. The longest word - 36 . letters - was hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. A genuinely real word that means fear of long words. CBBC and Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond, award-winning novelist and screen writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce, along with leading authors Dame Jaqueline Wilson, Charlie Higson and Malorie Blackman judged the competition. They picked their favourite six stories, drawn from two age groups: children aged 9 and under, and those aged between 10 and 13. Chris Evans said: 'Best 500 Words so far. Absolutely stellar. The stories always really come alive on the day of the final and this year was off the charts. 'I was staggered to find out we'd . received over 90,000 entries for this year's competition. The . creativity of these awesome authors knows no bounds - we have dragons, . monsters, wizards, space-ships - and some of these super story-tellers . are even inventing new words.

'The Oxford University Press use powerful technology and, together with teams of language experts, track and analyse children's language, and the message we are getting from the BBC's 500 WORDS is very clear - language is evolving, and children are real language innovators.

A new Samsung TV television advert is outraging rights groups for both women and men, being slammed as sexist from both sides. The commercial - which advertises the brand's Evolution Kit, which turns any Samsung TV into an internet-ready Smart TV - portrays men as useless, loutish neanderthals... and women as pushovers who put up with such behaviour. Slammed by critics as 'offensive', 'man-hating', and 'feminist porn', the Evolutionary Husband? advert, released on American networks, has still had almost 10 million views on Samsung's YouTube channel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Samsung TV advert shows men to be grunting, filthy, dead-eyed neanderthals... and women as the type to put up with such behaviour . The advert shows a wife plugging an Evolution Kit into her Samsung TV, then imagining how such a piece of equipment might turn her filthy, lazy, chicken drumstick-gnawing layabout of a husband into a high-functioning human. She envisages her husband making breakfast while doing the ironing, cleaning the kitchen, looking after the baby, baking cakes, playing the flute and plaiting her hair while serving a romantic candlelit dinner, to the upbeat jazzy tones of Come And Get It by Eli Paperboy Reed, with the lyrics: 'If you want the love of a real good man, come and get it'. When the downtrodden wife flickers out . of her merry daydream she finds her gassy partner back on the sofa, dead . eyes locked on TV, turning their living room into a stinking cesspit of . crumbs and idiocy. She just sighs. Twitter users have been appalled, and a men's rights forum on Reddit features comments about the 'blatantly sexist' bent of the advert. A user called Femdelusion writes: 'That's probably one of the most vile adverts I've ever seen. This isn't the normal IV drip of laughing at men; this is simply mainlining outright contempt. Another, AmiroZ, complains: 'I find this advert quite sexist. The idea of an 'evolved man' is basically making him the stereotype of a woman. This isn't evolution rather than devolution. 'If this advert had the women being attached to some machine to make her better equipped to clean/cook/look after children/make her loving to her spouse/partner, there would be an outcry from feminists about equality.' After being plugged into the Evolution Kit, the husband is an all-singing, all-domesticated 'perfect' man, capable of cooking, cleaning and caring for the children at the same time . While some YouTube comments beneath the video say 'people can't take a joke', other viewers are swearing off Samsung products, labelling the commercial 'offensive' and 'feminist porn'. But it isn't only men who are upset by the advert, which portrays women as downtrodden mugs who put up with men who behave like this. On Jezebel, one comment reads: 'Yeah, it sucks that men are presented as useless lumps of farting meat who can't do anything in their families. They're not. 'It also sucks that women are routinely presented as f***ing putting up with it as if it's a given that a man would be a manchild whom you'd have to clean up after and do everything for. It's almost like an excuse for men to be useless.' Samsung had yet to comment at time of publication.

A man who stole a truck and crashed it on a busy freeway while apparently fleeing from 'zombies' has pleaded guilty to assault, theft and hit and run. Jerimiah Hartline injured seven people in the six-car pile-up last month, and blamed the accident on supernatural forces. But yesterday he admitted stealing the vehicle full of strawberries and causing the accident in Temecula, California. The homeless 19-year-old from Tennessee was travelling as a passenger in the three-axle truck as it was delivering fruit to San Diego on April 6. When the driver, Daniel Martinez, stopped to make adjustments to the vehicle, Hartline jumped into the driving seat and headed off on the I-15. He quickly started driving erratically and weaving around the road, until the 18-wheeler slammed into a car, causing a crash involving five other vehicles. Two people had to be taken to hospital with serious injuries, while another five had minor injuries. The truck's load of strawberries spilled all over the road, causing the closure of the freeway for seven hours. Hartline tried to flee the scene by stealing a white van which had stopped nearby, but was detained by the driver until police came to arrest him. Horde: Hartline claimed he was being pursued by zombies and was trying to shake them off his tail . After his arrest, the criminal told police he was trying to escape a horde of pursuing zombies. 'Hartline thought that zombies were chasing him and clinging to the truck,' a police spokesman said at the time. 'Hartline swerved the truck side to side to shake the zombies off.' Officers also said that the driver was in an 'altered' state and may have taken narcotics of some kind. Yesterday he pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, hit and run causing death or injury, and vehicle theft, according to U-T San Diego. Four other charges were dropped, while the sentence he faces has been reduced from 12 years to five years as part of a plea deal.","Jerimiah Hartline, 19, stole massive truck and drove erratically on freeway .

Barack Obama last night blamed right-wing Republicans for the political gridlock which has paralysed Washington - and suggested that many congressmen were too scared of Rush Limbaugh to compromise with their rivals. Speaking to an audience of super-rich Democrats including Justin Timberlake, the President said he thought his re-election would 'break the fever' of partisanship, but admitted that he was still unable to carry out his agenda. However, Mr Obama said he hoped to capitalise on the spirit of co-operation seen following recent disasters to make progress on political issues such as immigration reform. Don't blame me: Barack Obama last night said that Rush Limbaugh was at fault for political gridlock . Villain? Mr Obama said many Republican politicians were scared of Mr Limbaugh's influence . The President, currently under pressure over issues such as Benghazi and the IRS, addressed three Democratic fund-raising events in New York City last night. At a dinner party for 60 donors at the West Village home of producer Harvey Weinstein, Mr Obama revealed how he had been repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to find common ground with Republicans in Congress. 'What's blocking us right now is sort of hyper-partisanship in Washington that, frankly, I was hoping to overcome in 2008,' he said. 'And in the midst of crisis, I think the other party reacted, rather than saying now is the time for us all to join together, decided to take a different path. 'My thinking was after we beat them in 2012, well, that might break the fever, and it's not quite broken yet. 'But I am persistent. And I am staying at it. And I genuinely believe that there are actually Republicans out there who would like to work with us but they're fearful of their base and they're concerned about what Rush Limbaugh might say about them.' Glitzy: The President addressing an audience of Democratic donors at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York . Mr Limbaugh, one of the country's leading radio DJs, is believed to be highly influential within the GOP, and has been known to target Republican politicians who he believes are insufficiently conservative. The President told guests, who had paid up to $20,000 each to attend, that recent tragedies had helped bring people together and break down political barriers. 'What I will be striving for over the next three-and-a-half years is to see if that spirit we saw in Boston and West, Texas, if we can institutionalise that,' Mr Obama said. 'If we can create a framework where everybody’s working together and moving this country forward.' Campaign: Mr Obama's limousine leaves an event in the West Village raising funds for the 2014 election . At a second intimate event nearby, the President said he expected a deal on immigration to come at some point this year, and added he believed that there was still a chance to secure peace between Israelis and Palestinians. A third fundraiser, for the House and Senate Democratic campaign committees, was held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and is expected to raise up to $4.5million for next year's congressional election campaign. The party has also not yet paid off all its debts from the general elections last year. Mr Obama has committed himself to a relatively heavy schedule of campaigning for the 2014 mid-terms, as he believes his political legacy is dependent on ensuring a sympathetic hearing from a Democratic-controlled Congress.","President admits he hasn't 'broken the fever' of political division .

But the victim's father Ralph says that Jon Venables must not be given parole, insisting he still poses a danger to children. Mr Bulger has apparently even suggested that the killer should never be let out of jail in the light of his horrifying crimes. Appeal: Jon Venables, left, is hoping to be released on parole, but Ralph Bulger, right, has spoken out against it . Venables and Robert Thompson were 10 years old when they abducted two-year-old James from a Merseyside shopping centre before torturing and killing him in 1993. The pair were released on licence in 2001, but three years ago Venables was found to have downloaded child pornography and was sent back to prison. He applied for parole in 2011, but was turned down, and is now eligible to apply again. Venables will appear in front of a judge at Liverpool Crown Court via video link later this month, according to The Sun.

Ralph Bulger and his brother Jimmy have written an impact statement urging the court to reject the killer's parole application. Mr Bulger, 46, has told friends: 'Venables is a murdering and violent sexual predator, from a boy to a man, and nothing has changed.' He added: 'He deserves to spend the rest of his days behind bars,' according to The Sun. James's two killers are both living under assumed identities owing to the risk of vigilante attacks. Venables has had to be given a number of new identities after repeatedly blowing his cover, but Thompson has kept out of legal trouble.","Murderer seeks release three years after being sent to jail for child porn .

Stuart Hazell today pleaded guilty to murdering Tia Sharp after months of lying about her final movements. During the week-long hunt for the then missing schoolgirl, Hazell, 37, a convicted drug dealer, denied abducting her, saying she was 'like my own daughter'. At the time Hazell was the partner of Tia's grandmother Christine Bicknell. He said at the time: 'My previous has got nothing to do with it. Everyone's got a shady past. Did I do anything to Tia? No I bloody didn't. I'd never think of that.' Scroll down for video . Lies: Stuart Hazell pretended to be devoted to Tia Sharp after murdering her and hiding her body . He described 12-year-old Tia as 'a happy-go-lucky golden angel' and said there had been no problems at her 'loving home' before she vanished. Hazell said he and Tia had been alone at the home he shared with Ms Bicknell in South London on the Thursday night and Friday morning when she disappeared. Victim: Hazell murdered Tia at his home in South London last August . On the Friday, he said, she left the house at 12.10pm, having previously told him she wanted to buy some new shoes. She did not take her mobile phone, which was charging, or a travel card and had no bag when she left. Hazell broke down as he spoke, supported by Tia's uncle David Sharp. Both wore white 'Find Tia' T-shirts and a large picture of the schoolgirl was pinned to the wall behind them. Hazell said he felt people were 'pointing the finger' at him because he had been the last person to see her. He added: 'I know deep down in my heart that Tia walked out of my house. 'I know she was seen walking down the pathway, she made her way down that track. What happened after that. I don't know.' Evidence: CCTV footage showed Hazell shopping with the 12-year-old hours before her death . Pretence: Hazell pictured in court today, having finally admitted responsibility for Tia's death . He even cooked dinner for her the evening after she disappeared, saying he would save it for when she returned in an effort to convince Ms Bicknell that he was trying to find her rather than being responsible for her disappearance. After Hazell was arrested, he eventually admitted he had stashed Tia's body in the attic of the house where he was living in New Addington, South London, but insisted she had broken her neck after falling down the stairs. He continued to protest his innocence in a series of discussions with prison officers, but at one point started inquiring into the possibility of pleading guilty to manslaughter. It was not until today that the truth was finally revealed - that he had sexually assaulted the schoolgirl while her grandmother was away, then apparently suffocated her and hid her body to avoid being found out.","Killer paid tribute to 12-year-old after she went missing in August .

Police unsuccessfully searched the loft where Tia Sharp’s body was hidden twice but only discovered her on the third attempt. The officer in charge of the hunt today apologised for his force's incompetence and admitted that the first two searches were 'really just a look round'. Tia’s body was found wrapped in a sheet and layers of plastic in the loft of her grandmother’s home on August 10 last year, a week after she went missing. It was only when detectives noticed a . smell of decomposition in the upstairs of Christine Bicknell’s house . that Tia was finally found. Killer: Stuart Hazell, pictured being arrested in August, hid Tia Sharp's body in the loft of his house . Hunt: Police outside the house where Tia's body was found after it had been missing for a week . A total of 80 officers were involved in the search effort, and were given access to more than 800 hours of CCTV footage. 'The early searches were really just a look round, they were not deep searches,' Detective Chief Inspector Nick Scola said outside the Old Bailey today after Stuart Hazell pleaded guilty to Tia's murder. He apologised for not finding the 12-year-old's body earlier, but said that if she had been discovered it 'would not have made any difference' to her fate. Hazell is due to be sentenced tomorrow, having changed his plea after months of protesting his innocence. Unsuccessful: Police used sniffer dogs to comb the woods near New Addington but did not find Tia . Searching: Officers rifled through bins outside the house where Tia's body was hidden all along . A police constable first went into the loft on August 4, climbing up on a stool balanced on a chair. He said: 'I was searching for a missing . girl and from what I could see the loft seemed very clear. I thought, . ""She is not hiding in here.""' The following day a specialist team came in, and one officer said he would have recognised the smell of a decomposing body if it had been apparent. His colleague said he took about 25 minutes to search the loft, including moving around black bags which the team believed were too light to contain anything significant. Apology: Detective Chief Inspector Nick Scola, pictured outside the Old Bailey, admitted the Met's mistakes . Victim: Hazell murdered Tia at his home in South London last August . Later, a search dog was brought to the . house in New Addington, South London, and indicated that there was . something above one of the bedrooms, but the animal was too large to . take into the loft so the officers ignored the warning. On August 10 a detective noticed the smell of decomposition in the house, which Ms Bicknell mistakenly thought was cat faeces. Another dog also indicated that something might be in the loft of the house, and Tia's body was found during a more thorough search. Detective Constable Daniel Chatfield, who found Tia’s body as he and a crime scene manager searched the loft, said: 'The loft was extremely confined, it was very hot and quite chaotic, so there were a lot of boxes and bags around the hatch entrances which needed to be moved in order to search further into the loft. 'After about 10 minutes my colleague Mr Langley had alerted me to what he believed to be the body of Tia.' In the wake of Tia’s death, Scotland Yard apologised to her family that it had taken so long to find her.","Loft where 12-year-old's body was hidden searched by police three times .

Fraudster: Juliet Clarke swindled two boyfriends out of thousands of pounds by pretending to suffer from serious illnesses . A fraudster tricked two boyfriends out of thousands of pounds by making up elaborate lies about her personal life. Juliet Clarke told one man she was terminally ill in an attempt to make him give her money, and later pretended she had died after they broke up. She pretended to another lover, a serving soldier, that she was suffering from cancer, borrowed money for a fictional uncle's funeral and told him she had had his children. Clarke, 31, pleaded guilty to fraud at Plymouth Magistrates' Court in Devon yesterday. Magistrates heard that Clarke dated her first victim for six months in 2011. She convinced him she was terminally ill, and said that she was about to inherit £250,000 from her grandmother. But after the couple split up, he noticed that she had taken more than £1,800 from his bank account - including £259 that she spent on a holiday. When he tried to contact her, she sent him a string of messages pretending to be her father and claiming she had died. Clarke met her second victim over the internet when he was serving with the military in Afghanistan. She said she was suffering from both ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, and asked to borrow money for the funeral of an uncle who never existed. Lies: Plymouth Magistrates' Court, pictured, heard that Clarke had even pretended to be dead . When he broke up with her, she tried to get money from him by saying she was pregnant with twins. She took a picture out of a pregnancy guide and pretended it showed her swollen stomach. When her ex-boyfriend started to grow suspicious, she claimed to have had their children prematurely and sent him updates on their condition as well as photographs of them. However, it later emerged that Clarke had never been pregnant at all - and had in fact been sterilised years before. 'This is confidence fraud characterised by a degree of planning,' prosecutor Jenny Cater said. Clarke admitted three counts of fraud by false representation, and will return to court next month for sentencing.","Juliet Clarke told first boyfriend she was dead after they broke up .

The grandmother of murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharp today spoke of her 'relief' after Stuart Hazell admitted murdering her and hiding her body. Angie Niles, whose son David was the 12-year-old's stepfather, revealed how Hazell had torn her family apart and called on a judge to 'lock him up forever and throw away the key'. Hazell today pleaded guilty to Tia's murder after months of pleading his innocence and insisting the girl's death was a tragic accident. Her body was found in the attic of the home in New Addington, South London that Hazell shared with Tia's biological grandmother Christine Bicknell, a week after the girl went missing in August last year. Birthday: Tia Sharp being presented with a celebratory cake by her mother in a family photograph . Mrs Niles, 69, said: 'Obviously it's a . very emotional time for all of the family who are sitting here around . the TV, but in a strange way we also feel relief. 'It . says a lot about the man - just when you thought he couldn't do anymore . to our family, he's dragged this out over months insisting he was . innocent and only now at the very last moment has he put his hands up . and admitted what he has done. 'In . a strange way I feel like it had to happen this way - maybe it's good . that a judge and members of the public have had the chance to hear . exactly what this sick man has done. 'Maybe it's good for all of us to have heard the truth in court so that none of this was buried, none of this remains secret.

He doesn't deserve any more than that.' Although . Tia was not biologically related to Mrs Niles, the pair became . 'extremely close' after her mother Natalie entered a relationship with . David Niles. Mrs Niles, whom Tia called 'Nangie', . added: 'We all have so many happy times in our minds from years gone by . and everywhere you look there are little reminders. 'I . have a pair of small Christmas trees which Tia picked for me two or . three years ago, she made me buy them because they were pink and that . was her favourite colour. 'Since . we lost Tia I don't really go into clothes shops where they sell . teenagers' fashion, it just reminds me of her. It's a nightmare. 'She . was a real girly-girl, it was all about the clothes and the hair and . the nails for Tia, so it is very upsetting when I have to walk past . those things knowing I could have been buying them for her. 'You just have to think about the good times which we were lucky enough to have and not dwell on it too much.' Tragic: Tia was killed in August last year by Stuart Hazell, right, who today pleaded guilty to murder . In an interview in September before Hazell's trial, Tia's mother Natalie Sharp revealed the horror she felt when police found her daughter's body. Seven days after Tia was reported missing, Ms Sharp was at a friend's house when she received a call from a detective breaking the news they had found a corpse in the loft. She said: 'I just hit the floor, I looked up and there were eyes everywhere just . looking down at me. Those sorrowful eyes were all around just staring. 'I just felt sick. Physically sick, I was vomiting every time I . thought about (the body being in the loft). To know that she was there that whole time. 'You hate the police for missing her, you hate yourself for not finding . her, you hate everyone who has been in the house, everyone who has been . near the house. 'I hated everybody.' Her partner David Niles, Tia's stepfather, refused to believe what the police had said. He said: 'I couldn’t believe it when they told me, I refused to believe it, I wanted there to have been some mistake. 'We were praying they would tell us a body had been there for thirty odd . years - we were desperate. I remember asking them, ""are you sure it’s . not a cat or a dog?""' Adorable: Tia pictured as a child; her family has today been paying tribute to the schoolgirl . Friendly: Tia's step-grandmother has opened up about her relationship with the 12-year-old . The couple revealed they had received prank calls about Tia in the days she was missing. Mr Niles said: 'I got a sick prank call to my mobile phone from someone after she’d been missing for around three days. 'They’d just seen my mobile number on the t-shirts we wore for the TV appeals. 'They were saying “we’ve got her and we’ll tell you where and when you can have her. We didn’t know them, they were Scottish. 'It was just some sick drunken joke. The police traced the call and went through their front door somewhere in Scotland. 'Apparently they found a couple of lads sitting around drunk making prank calls. I went mad.' Ms Sharp added: 'It wasn’t the only time, we had lots of pranks, or at least false messages. 'There were people calling saying they had seen her at a bus stop, someone said they has spotted her asleep on a park bench. 'We had people running around everywhere chasing up messages. For people . to be sitting there having fun at that time, it just makes you so . angry. 'I’m still angry now.' Toddler: Tia disappeared from her grandmother's home in New Addington, South London . She explained how she felt when police were still searching for Tia. 'As the days passed, the range of . emotions we went through was like nothing I can describe,' she said. 'I’ve tried to tell people, to put my finger on it, but I can’t. 'You feel empty, like you’re being twisted from the inside. All the way from your stomach to your throat. 'You can’t eat, you can’t sleep. It’s horrible, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 'All we could do was wait and waiting . is the hardest part, because what else can you do?

'It’s the last thing you think about . when you go to bed at night and the first thing you think about when you . wake up. It’s still that way now. 'I remember, every day she was . missing I’d wake up, and open my eyes and things felt normal for a . second or maybe two.

Couple: Tia's mother Natalie with her partner David Niles, whose mother Angie has spoken out today . She added that her daughter was 'a fighter' who was mature and independent for her age. She said: 'Once, you accept what has . happened and you try to come to terms with that, you just want to be . able to grieve for your child. But we haven’t been able to mourn. 'There’s so much I don’t know, and as a parent I’m supposed to know. 'I don’t know if she was scared, I . don’t know if she suffered - I don’t know if my baby suffered before she . died. That’s the worst. 'If I know one thing now though, it’s . this: Tia was a fighter. Whatever happened to her, it wouldn’t have . happened without a struggle. She could look after herself.

It's the ideal present for the Apple diehard in your life - coffee with tech boss Tim Cook, a chance to get the inside track on the next generation of hot gadgets. But this meeting of minds doesn't come cheap - the chance to meet Steve Jobs's successor is being auctioned for charity, and its price currently stands at $605,000 (£395,000). The identity of the highest bidder is unknown, but is likely to be from a tech professional hoping to pitch an idea to Mr Cook or solicit business advice from him. Meeting: Coffee with Apple CEO Tim Cook is being auctioned off for at least $605,000 (£395,000) The auction is being run online by Charitybuzz, and its proceeds will go to a leading human rights charity. However, the runaway popularity of the unique opportunity appears to have taken organisers by surprise - they predicted Mr Cook would fetch just $50,000. The winner of the auction will be invited to the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they will share a drink with the company's CEO. The encounter, which must take place in the next year, will last between 30 minutes and an hour. Winners will be banned from taking photographs of the event or revealing any details to the press, thanks to Apple's notorious secrecy policies. Venue: The meeting will take place at Apple's hi-tech headquarters in Cupertino, California . The auction price has now spiralled so high that Charitybuzz is only accepting bids from buyers who are authenticated by a bank. The profit will go to the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. As of this morning, the highest bidder was a high roller known only as 'J********n', who will discover whether or not he has won when the auction closes at 3pm PDT (10pm GMT) today. Many of the other people who have bid on the coffee morning are entrepreneurs who planned to pitch their start-ups to Mr Cook in the hope of receiving funding, inside information or even just advice. Among the bidders have been firms which make accessories for Apple devices, as well as the maker of a free Bible app. Succession: Mr Cook took over from Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs in 2011 . Rakesh Kumar, founder of Drbluetooth.com, has roped in a group of generous friends and relatives to subsidise his bid for the meeting with Mr Cook, who took over at Apple after Steve Jobs resigned shortly before his death in 2011. 'It would give us a chance to showcase the whole concept of what we're doing to him,' he told the Guardian. Mr Kumar predicts that if he wins the high-profile meeting, his firm will quickly become one of Silicon Valley's hottest tickets and attract the attention of investors. At $605,000, the auction is tantalisingly close to being the most expensive Charitybuzz has ever hosted - in March, it auctioned off a top-of-the-range Lamborghini for $610,000. A meeting with Bill Clinton brought in just $255,000 - two and a half times cheaper than coffee with Mr Cook. Tech fans keen to meet a high-powered businessman for a slightly more affordable price might like to bid on lunch with Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, currently available for $15,600.","Chance to meet Apple CEO auctioned off for human rights charity .

One in four of the crimes ‘solved’ by Britain’s largest police force last year involved the offender accepting a ‘slap on the wrist’, it emerged last night. Nearly 30,000 cautions were handed to criminals in London for offences including robbery, drug smuggling and even rape. They made up a quarter of the 118,000 crimes counted as solved by police in the capital during those 12 months. Lenient: Hundreds of serious crimes are punished by nothing more than a warning from police in London . Critics said the public and police are being short-changed by a rampant ‘cautions culture’ which lets off serious criminals. The figures, revealed by a Freedom of . Information request, showed the Metropolitan Police issued 28,998 . cautions and youth warnings last year. Among the cautions were 5,843 for . violent attacks, 165 for sexual offences and, astonishingly, five for . rape. A total of 180 offenders were . cautioned for grievous bodily harm or wounding, 131 for robbery and 318 . for drug trafficking. Police handed out 205,700 cautions nationwide in . the 12 months ending in September 2012, according to the Ministry of . Justice. Among them were 40,148 for drug offences, 13,466 for violent assaults, 2,726 for burglary and 1,422 for sex attacks. The figures represented a 12 per cent . decrease compared with the previous 12 months, and a 44 per cent fall . from 2007 when cautions peaked at 367,300. Cautions: Metropolitan Police officers handed out a slap on the wrist for a quarter of all crimes (file photo) Last month, Policing Minister Damian . Green announced a review of guidelines for issuing police cautions as . part of a wider crackdown. Mr Green said the Government’s goal was to . see the use of cautions restricted to ensure serious criminals would . never escape punishment. The review, due to report next month, . will examine whether cautions should  be banned for some offences. There  are fears that victims of violent and even sexual crimes are . subject to a postcode lottery where attackers in some areas  are more . than twice as likely to escape with a caution. Ministers are also concerned at the way repeat offenders receive cautions for multiple crimes. Crackdown: Ministers are hoping to discourage the use of cautions by Scotland Yard and other police forces . Tony Arbour, a Tory politician in . London who uncovered the data, said justice was not being done and those . who receive cautions ‘escape punishment’. A Met spokesman said the force follows . national guidance and cautions are issued only in the case of serious . offences after discussions with prosecutors.

A promising young British soldier was accidentally shot dead when his colleagues took a barrel off a machine gun as it pointed directly at him on a live firing exercise, a court martial heard today. Fusilier James Wilkinson, 21, of Bury, Greater Manchester, from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was allegedly killed by the negligence of his own men in Nanyuki, Kenya. His Section Commander, Corporal Colin Bell, had taken the barrel off a machine gun to inspect a stoppage when it fired off a round at the British Army Training Unit, shooting him in the neck. Court hearing: Fusilier James Wilkinson (pictured with his wife Sarah on their wedding day), from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was allegedly killed by the negligence of his own men in Kenya . The married father-to-be was killed on the firing range. He and a colleague were manning a general purpose machine gun in the mock battle for more than 100 troops in hot terrain, the court heard. To their right, Fusilier Aaron Davenport, a gunner, and Fusilier Renaldo Nelson, a controller, also from 2RRF, were operating another, watched by their safety supervisor Cpl Bell. This gun jammed and would not fire - known in military terms as a ‘hard cock’ - making it impossible to check if the firearm was unloaded, Bulford Military Court Centre in Wiltshire heard. But instead of following safety procedure and calling in an armourer to fix it, Cpl Bell allegedly got Fusilier Davenport and Fusilier  Nelson to remove the weapon from its position and he took it apart. Cpl Bell placed the gun on the ground, pointing directly at the gun team, and removed the barrel. Troops were alerted to Fusilier Wilkinson, hailed as a very fit soldier with ‘long term potential’ by the Ministry of Defence, being down by someone shouting ‘Stop! Stop! Stop!’. Now three of his comrades - Fusilier Davenport, Fusilier Nelson and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price are on trial for negligently performing a duty. Cpl Bell is also accused of negligently performing a duty. Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Callum Cowx told the jury: ‘Each of these men failed to do what they were required to do and they each in their own way led to the tragic outcome. ‘The crown’s case is about basic principles, about basic common sense, which we say are commonly understood by anyone wearing this Army uniform. Laid to rest: Fusilier Wilkinson's funeral took place in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, in December 2011 . ‘It is about basic duties expected of a . safety supervisor on live firing exercises. I ask you to keep in mind . these principles and common sense in the judgement of the facts.’ ‘Each defendant owed a duty of care to James Wilkinson. They owed him a duty that he was not put in danger. Each neglected this and the consequences were catastrophic.’ 'They owed him a duty that he was not put in danger. Each neglected this and the consequences were catastrophic' Prosecutor Lt Col Callum Cowx . Fusilier Wilkinson’s distraught widow Sarah wept in court as she heard details of the fatal incident on November 26 2011, less than five months after their wedding. She was seven months’ pregnant with the couple’s first child at the time, and has since given birth to a healthy daughter. Lt Col Cowx said: ‘Cpl Bell, clearly anxious to get one of his guns back in action, demanded to know what was happening and was told it was a hard cock. Hearing this, he ordered for it to be brought to him. The prosecution case is that that gun should not have been moved. Grief: Fusilier Wilkinson's wife Sarah left the church after the funeral in 2011 dressed all in black . ‘But Davenport and Nelson brought the gun over to him, and Bell asked if it was cleared or was it unloaded. Fusilier Nelson responded that yes, it was, it was clear. ‘This, of course, was incorrect - there was a live round in the weapon. They should have realised this. They were experienced infantry soldiers used to handling machine guns.’ Captain Kye Raynard, a range conducting officer, was around 25 metres away from WIlkinson when tragedy struck during the ‘fast moving’ exercise. He said a safety supervisor should call in an armourer to deal with a stoppage, adding: ‘You cannot remove the round, so the round will be stuck in the weapons system. ‘So the safest way of removing it would be to get an armourer onto the range and make sure the weapon is pointing in a safe direction while you wait.’ Manchester United FC fan Fusilier Wilkinson was born into a serving Army family in Germany. He joined the Army in May 2011 and trained at Catterick, North Yorkshire, before being deployed to Kenya on his first Battalion level exercise, Ex Askari Thunder. The MoD described Fusilier Wilkinson as an ‘exceptionally fit’ soldier who was ‘happy, enthusiastic and immensely popular across all ranks’ and had ‘obvious long term potential’. Fusilier Davenport and Fusilier Nelson deny negligence performing a duty in misinforming Cpl Bell as to the safety state of the gun and failing to prevent the discharge of a round. Staff Sgt Price denies negligence performing a duty by failing to prevent the unintentional discharge of a round from the gun. The court martial continues tomorrow.

The company behind a banned advert for a payday lender featuring troubled star Kerry Katona has re-launched its campaign featuring the formerly bankrupt singer again. The promotion for Cash Lady was banned by the Advertising Standards Agency because it appeared to suggest that it was possible to afford a popstar's lifestyle by using the lender's services. But after a gap of just four days, Ms Katona is once more appearing on TV in a similar but slightly different version of the Cash Lady ad, using the same colour scheme and graphic designs. Campaigners have criticised payday lenders for using 'glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements' to glamourise their loans, which tend to come with very high interest rates. Spot the difference: A Cash Lady ad, left, featuring Kerry Katona has been banned; but the singer still features in publicity for the payday lender, right . Controversy: The star appears on their website, pictured, even though one of her adverts has been banned . Ms Katona, 32, who first rose to fame as a member of the recently reunited Atomic Kitten, has run into well-documented personal and financial troubles, and was declared bankrupt in 2008. The Cash Lady television ads played on the star's notoriety, and featured her saying: 'We've all had money troubles at some point, I know I have. 'You could see your bank and fill in loads of forms, but is there an easier way to get a loan.' The company, which is registered under the name PDB UK Ltd, offers loans of up to £300 a month with an annual percentage rate of 2,760 per cent. It tends to charge £29 interest per month for every £100 borrowed. Glitzy: The firm was censured for making payday loans appear glamorous by using the star's image . Payday loans are designed to provide short-term assistance to people who need cash in an emergency, and should not be used as a routine source of income due to their high interest rates. After 29 people complained about the advert, the ASA ruled that it was 'irresponsible' and potentially misleading. The agency said that the ad made 'no reference to the fact that these loans were intended for short-term stop gaps between pay day and were not intended as a more immediate solution for more serious financial problems'. It also 'had the potential to encourage vulnerable viewers with financial problems and/or restricted credit from seeking to resolve them through the payday loan service', according to the ASA. The agency also criticised Cash Lady for not displaying the sky-high APR prominently enough, and for using Ms Katona's personal history to attract customers who are struggling financially. Reunion: Ms Katona with her Atomic Kitten bandmates Natasha Hamilton and Liz McClarnon earlier this month . Gillian Guy, chief executive of . Citizens Advice, said that advertising like that produced by Cash Lady . was misleading and potentially exploitative. 'Glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements cover up the harsh reality of life in debt,' she said. 'Behind the glamorous marketing lie extortionate interest rates and charges and the misery of multiple rollover loans. 'Payday loans firms need to do much . more to make sure that they treat their customers fairly. New evidence . from Citizens Advice found 65 per cent of lenders do not check if . borrowers can afford to pay back the loan and many don't offer to freeze . interest or charges if people are struggling to keep up repayments. 'It's time that high-cost lenders face up to their responsibilities and tell their customers the truth.' The new ad is entirely legal because . it has been tweaked slightly to make it different to the banned version. It could, however, be banned in the future if viewers complain to the . ASA and the complaints are upheld. Troubled: The singer was filmed talking incoherently and slurring her words on This Morning in 2008 . The company today defended its use of Ms Katona and insisted it had complied with the ASA's instructions. 'The version of the advert which is currently being aired does not refer to Kerry's financial history or compare payday loan applications to high street bank loans, which were the issues that the ASA criticised,' a spokesman said. 'The ASA did not have issue with Kerry being part of the campaign - it was what was said in that specific advert. We are looking forward to continuing working with Kerry, and we are planning on filming an all-new advert soon. 'We strive to be as compliant as possible and be a responsible part of the payday loans industry.' The case is similar to a number of controversies involving budget airline Ryanair, which has repeatedly had its adverts banned only to release similarly controversial publicity materials only days later. 'It is not our role to ban entire sectors, including payday loans, from advertising or to outlaw the use of celebrities in ads,' the agency told the Independent. Ms Katona joined Atomic Kitten, whose hits included Whole Again and Eternal Flame, at the age of just 18, but left the band after becoming pregnant by Westlife star Brian McFadden. The mother of four appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! among a number of reality TV shows, and is also known for her works in adverts for Iceland. In 2008, she was declared bankrupt after failing to pay her taxes properly, and the next year was dropped by some of her employers when pictures were published which allegedly showed her taking cocaine.","Former Atomic Kitten star appeared in ad for payday lender Cash Lady .

Amanda Knox has spoken out against the 'bad vibes' the notorious photo of her kissing former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito created in the days following the death of her housemate Mereditch Kercher. The image was taken as police searched the flat that she had shared with the British university student, who was found with 47 wounds, including a fatal slash across her throat, at their Perugia home in November 2007. Sollecito had been dating Knox in Italy for just one week when the couple came under investigation for her murder. Scroll down for video . The moment that Miss Knox said created 'bad vibes' for her and her boyfriend, whose sex life and drug habits made headlines throughout their trial . She went on to serve four years for . her murder before being acquitted in an appeals court in . 2011 due to insufficient evidence. Then two months ago, Italy’s highest court overturned that decision and ordered a new trial to begin within the next year - raising the prospect that she could be jailed once more. Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found . all over the crime scene, is currently serving a 16-year prison sentence for the murder. Knox, 25, said told The Times that the infamous kiss - caught on camera by the press - created 'bad vibes' for her. She said: 'That video [outside the house] was cut . and repeated so that all you see is a loop of me and Raffaele kissing . over and over again.' The photograph was held up as proof of her alleged sinister sexual nature. In . fact, Knox has revealed that the kiss . was an act of comfort in the face of fear and uncertainty. She said: 'I just felt incredibly lost and I was . sad and I was trying to understand, and Raffaele kissed me to console me . because our language barrier prevented us from really being able to . console each other with words.' Amanda Knox and her then-boyfirend Raffaele Sollecito were pictured kissing outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in Perugia, Italy . Miss Knox is on a media tour to promote her memoir Waiting to be Heard. She spoke to the Times about the public perception of her as a sinister woman . Amanda Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito has released his own memoir of his experience in jail. Italian prosecutors accused Sollecito and Knox of killing Kercher in a sexual escapade that went awry . Knox's behaviour during the police search, in which she didn't cry and was said to hug and kiss her boyfriend, was pursued by the media as a reason to suspect the 20-year-old of murder. Knox's memoir, Waiting to be Heard, has not been published in the UK but has reignited a media storm around the Kercher case. Knox received a grilling from various U.S. media outlets following the release of the book on April 30. Earlier this month she told CNN's Chris Cuomo that despite her characterization in the Italian media as a sexual deviant, she has not experimented with any sort of sex games. Knox was adamant as she told Cuomo: 'I've never taken part in an orgy - ever.' She said she was shocked during the trial, when lawyers for the prosecution were calling her a 'whore' and a 'deviant.' She says that Italian prosecutors made up allegations that she was a sex and drug-crazed party girl to bolster their case. Knox said that her book is aimed at debunking those criticisms. She said: 'In the book I talk about all my sexual experiences... I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip.' Knox added: 'No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, no witnesses have ever come out saying things like that.' She also told Cuomo that now that she's home in Washington, she doesn't go to parties - and no longer smokes cannabis.","Amanda Knox slams portrayal of her and boyfriend from photo of them kissing at murder scene .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 12:57 EST, 18 January 2012 . The mother of Moeed Abdul Salam tried to teach her son about religious tolerance and infaith harmony as he grew up in their well-off Texas household. Salam certainly didn't descend into radical Islam for lack of other options. His mother Hasna Shaheen Salam ensured he attended a pricey boarding school and graduated from one of the state's most respected universities. She and her husband and the generation before them had spent years promoting interfaith harmony and combating Muslim stereotypes in their hometown and even on national television. But somewhere along the way, Salam rejected his relatives' moderate faith and comfortable life, choosing instead a path that led him to work for al Qaeda. Hasna Shaheen Salam, centre, said of her son's death: 'There are things that we don't want to happen but we have to accept, things that we don't want to know but we have to learn, and a loved one we can't live without but have to let go' The dead body of Moeed Abdul Salam, 37, who killed himself with a grenade during a paramilitary raid on his apartment on November 19,, is is carried by volunteers in Karachi, Pakistan . The home where Moeed Abdul Salam, 37, spent formative years with his parents in the Dallas suburb of Plano, Texas. The family, originally from Pakistan, immigrated to the U.S. decades ago and gained citizenship . His odyssey ended late last year in a middle-of-the-night explosion in Pakistan. The 37-year-old father-of-four was dead after paramilitary troops stormed his apartment. His November 19 death went largely unnoticed in the U.S. and rated only limited attention in Pakistan. But the circumstances threatened to overshadow the work of an American family devoted to religious understanding. And his mysterious evolution presented a reminder of the attraction Pakistan still holds for Islamic militants, especially well-educated Westerners whose Internet and language skills make them useful converts for jihad. 'There are things that we don't want to happen but we have to accept, things that we don't want to know but we have to learn, and a loved one we can't live without but have to let go,' Salam's mother, Hasna, wrote last month on her Facebook page. The violence didn't stop after Salam died. Weeks after his death, fellow militants killed three soldiers with a roadside bomb to avenge the raid. It is not clear to what extent . Salam's family knew of his radicalism, but on his Facebook page the . month before he died, he posted an image of Anwar al-Awalki, the . American al Qaeda leader who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen, . beside a burning American flag. He . had also recently linked to a document praising al-Awalki's martyrdom . and to a message urging Muslims to rejoice 'in this time when you see . the mujahideen all over the world victorious'. After . his death, the Global Islamic Media Forum, a propaganda group for al . Qaeda and its allies, hailed Salam as a martyr, explaining in an online . posting that he had overseen a unit that produced propaganda in Urdu and . other South Asian languages. A . senior U.S. counterterrorism official said Salam's role had expanded . over the years beyond propaganda to being an operative. The official . spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the . information. The body of Salam - father of four kids - is taken away in this jeep. He rejected his relatives' moderate faith and comfortable life, choosing instead a path that led him to work for al Qaeda . The family, originally from Pakistan, . immigrated to the U.S. decades ago. Salam's father was a pilot for a . Saudi airline, and the family eventually settled in the Dallas suburb of . Plano. Their cream-colored brick home, assessed at nearly $400,000, stands on a corner lot in a quiet, upper-class neighborhood. The . family obtained American citizenship in 1986. Salam attended Suffield . Academy in Connecticut, a private high school where tuition and board . currently run $46,500. He graduated in 1992. A . classmate, Wadiya Wynn, of Laurel, Maryland, recalled that Salam played . varsity golf, sang in an a cappella group and in the chamber choir, and . that he hung out with a small group of 'hippie-ish' friends. She thought he was a mediocre student, but noted that just being admitted to Suffield was highly competitive. Salam . went on to study history at the University of Texas at Austin and . graduated in 1996. His Facebook profile indicated he moved to Saudi . Arabia by 2003 and began working as a translator, writer and editor for . websites about Islam. 'Anyone . can pick up a gun, but there aren't as many people who can code html . and understand the use of proxies,' said Evan Kohlmann, a senior partner . a Flashpoint Global Partners, which tracks radical Muslim propaganda. A man peers into a sealed apartment of Moeed Abdul Salam where he killed himself with a grenade during a paramilitary raid on his apartment in Karachi, Pakistan . Salam, who had apparently been active in militant circles for as long as nine years, arrived three years ago in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, and became an important link between al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremists groups, according to an al Qaeda operative in Karachi who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is wanted by authorities. Salam traveled to the tribal areas close to the Afghan border three or four times for meetings with senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, the operative said. He would handle money and logistics in the city and deliver instructions from other members of the network. Back in the United States, Salam's mother is a prominent resident of Plano, where she is co-chairwoman of a city advisory group called the Plano Multicultural Outreach Roundtable, as well as a former president of the Texas Muslim Women's Foundation. The founder of the latter group, Hind Jarrah, said Shaheen and her husband are too upset to speak with anyone. 'She's a committed American citizen. She's a hard worker,' Jarrah said, calling her 'one of the nicest, most committed, most open-minded' women she had ever met. Salam's brother, Monem Salam, has traveled the country speaking about Islam, seeking to correct misconceptions following the 9/11 attacks. On Salam's Facebook page the month before he died, he posted an image of Anwar al-Awalki, pictured, the American al Qaeda leader who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen, beside a burning American flag . He works for Saturna Capital, where he manages funds that invest according to Islamic principles — for example, in companies that do not profit from alcohol or pork. He recently moved from the company's Bellingham, Washington, headquarters to head its office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. After the 2001 attacks, he and his wife made a public-television documentary about his efforts as a Muslim man to obtain a pilot's license. They also wrote a column for The Bellingham Herald newspaper that answered readers' questions about Islam. Both Salam's parents and his brother declined numerous interview requests from The Associated Press. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, dozens of U.S. citizens have been accused of participating in terrorism activities, including several prominent al-Qaida propagandists, such as al-Awalaki and Samir Khan, who was killed alongside him. Perhaps best known is Adam Gadahn, an al Qaeda spokesman believed to be in Pakistan. Of 46 cases of 'homegrown terrorism' in the U.S. since 2001, 16 have a connection to Pakistan, according to a recent RAND Corporation study. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, dozens of U.S. citizens have been accused of participating in terrorism activities - best known is Adam Gadahn, pictured . Salam's background as college-educated and from a prosperous family isn't unusual among them. He divorced his wife in October, but was contesting custody of their three sons and one daughter. The children were staying with him in the third-floor apartment when a squad of paramilitary troops known as Rangers arrived around 3:30 a.m. Officers said they pushed through the flimsy door, and Salam killed himself with a grenade when he realized he was surrounded. The Islamic media group and the al Qaeda contact in Karachi disputed that account, saying Salam was killed by the troops. Through the windows, blood splatter and shrapnel marks were visible on the wall close to the dining table. There were boxes of unpacked luggage, a treadmill and two large stereo speakers. Residents said Moeed had only been living there for five days. Neighbor Syed Mohammad Farooq was woken by an explosion. Minutes later, one of the troops asked him to go inside the apartment and see what had happened, he said. 'He was lying on the floor with blood pooling around him. One of his arms had been blown off. I couldn't look for long. He was moaning and seemed to be reciting verses from the Koran,' he said. 'I could hear the children crying, but I couldn't see them.' Hours later, Salam's wife and father-in-law, a lawyer in the city, came to collect the children from the apartment in Gulistane Jauhar, a middle-class area of Karachi, Farooq said. On the night he died, Salam led evening prayers at the small mosque on the ground floor of the apartment building. 'His Koranic recitation was very good,' said Karim Baloch, who prayed behind him that night. 'It was like that of an Arab.'","Salam's mother, Hasna Shaheen Salam, tried to teach her son interfaith harmony and religious tolerance .

Hezbollah guerrillas fought a deadly battle with Syrian rebels inside Lebanon yesterday, as the civil war inexorably takes in both countries. Sources said at least 12 rebels were killed in the fighting east of the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, and that one Hezbollah fighter had also died. It was the worst clash on Lebanese territory since the outbreak of the conflict more than two years ago. Hezbollah is fighting to drive rebels from the Syria border town of Qusair, which has been subject to airstrikes such as this bombing last month . Syria’s two-year-old conflict has increasingly sucked in its smaller neighbour, with deadly fighting shaking the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli and rockets hitting the Bekaa Valley and southern Beirut. Shi’ite Muslim Hezbollah, which supports President Bashar al-Assad, is fighting alongside his army to drive rebels from the Syrian border town of Qusair, while Lebanese Sunni Muslim fighters have joined the anti-Assad revolt. Tensions between Hezbollah and the Syrian rebels have risen sharply since the Lebanese militia stepped up its armed support for President al-Assad's regime last month. Tensions between Hezbollah and the Syrian rebels have risen sharply since the Lebanese militia stepped up its armed support for President Bashar al-Assad, pictured . The growing tensions between . Hezbollah and rebels trying to oust al-Assad are linked to a regime . offensive against the rebel-held town of Qusair in western Syria. Hezbollah's involvement in the battle . for control of the strategic town has exposed its growing role in the . Syria conflict, prompting rebel threats to target Hezbollah's bases in . Lebanon. The latest fighting took place near Ain el-Jaouze in a strip of Lebanese territory which extends into Syria, the sources said, and the rebels may have been ambushed as they set up rockets to fire into Shi’ite areas of the Bekaa Valley. Rebels have said they will carry out attacks inside Lebanon in response to Hezbollah’s support for Assad’s assault on Qusair, a strategic town for rebel weapons supplies and fighters coming into Syria from Lebanon. The United Nations said on Saturday that up to 1,500 wounded people might be trapped inside Qusair and U.N. officials called for an immediate ceasefire to allow them to receive treatment. The International Committee of the Red Cross asked for access, saying it was ready to enter Qusair immediately to deliver aid. However, Syrian state television said Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by telephone on Sunday that the Red Cross would have to wait until military operations in the area were complete. Moualem also expressed surprise at international concern over the fighting around Qusair, saying the world had been silent when rebels took over the town 18 months ago and that Syria was now clearing it of 'terrorism', the television said. Meanwhile, low-flying Israeli warplanes again violated Lebanese airspace, overflying the capital Beirut, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the city of Baalbek, Lebanese security officials and the state-run news agency said. Israeli warplanes regularly enter Lebanese airspace. A security official confirmed the overflights and said they were among the most intense recently. There was no immediate comment from Israel. A woman walks past Lebanese soldiers standing guard with an armoured personnel carrier in the Lebanese city of Tripoli . The flights come amid heightened regional tensions because of the civil war in Syria. Israel is believed to have carried out three airstrikes inside Syria this year, said to be aimed at weapons meant for Hezbollah. Also today, a car bomb killed at least three people in Jobar, a suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus, said a Syrian government official. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition group, said the blast targeted a police station and killed nine Syrian soldiers. It said the al Qaida-linked group Jabhat al-Nusra carried out the attack. Syria's state agency SANA blamed the blast on a suicide bomber, saying he blew up his explosive-packed car which was parked in the residential area. The Observatory and SANA said the explosion took place amid heavy fighting. Jobar is a scene of frequent clashes, with rebels trying to push from there toward the capital. The army has been conducting massive sweeps through opposition strongholds around Damascus, including Jobar.","Clash was worst on Lebanese territory since outbreak of conflict .

"By . Peter Lloyd . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:21 EST, 4 June 2013 . Michael Douglas has revealed his cancer was caused by HPV . Yesterday, Hollywood actor Michael Douglas announced that his battle with throat cancer was caused by oral sex - or more specifically, the HPV virus frequently contracted through oral sex. The 68 year-old, who fought a six month battle with the disease from August 2010 until January 2011, initially blamed an indulgent lifestyle of cigarettes and alcohol. But, in a rare example of modern male candour, the veteran performer revealed that his cancer was actually caused by the Human Papilloma Virus - a symptom-free bacteria that lives in the lining of the body's cavities and can be passed on through sex or even the briefest physical touch. 'Without wanting to get too specific, this particular cancer is caused by HPV, which comes from cunnilingus,' he said. However, in the same breath that Angelina Jolie has been lionised for her public honesty, Douglas has been criticised for it. Namely, because it may embarrass his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Yet, given the fact that Britain's men are living with a ticking HPV time-bomb - and, unlike girls, aren't immunised against it - her pride shouldn't even be a consideration. Especially as they both have a son. A son who, like every boy in this country, will be ignored when it comes to HPV. Currently, girls aged 12 and 13 are routinely vaccinated against the virus because of its link to cervical cancer. They also receive a top-up injection at 18. Great stuff. But for men, there's no approved screening test and no immunisation. Recently, medical bible The Lancet . published a study which revealed that 50% of the world's male population . are carrying the virus. The research, conducted by scientists at the . Cancer Centre and Research Institute in Florida analysed 1,159 men aged . 18-70 from the USA, Brazil and Mexico. It found that those with a total . of fifty or more sexual partners were 2.4 more likely to develop cancer . than those with just one. For gay or bisexual men who had three or more male partners, the risk was 2.6 times higher than those with none. Thanks to a lack of immunisation, they're also 17 times more likely to develop anal cancer than exclusively straight men. To put all this into perspective, it . means that 2 million men contract the cancer-causing strand of HPV every . year - and, currently, nobody's doing anything about it. Even . if a man walks into a clinic and demands to get tested, he can't be . helped. In fact, he won't know he's infected until a lesion shows up on . his penis, mouth or anus. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones held hands at an event in New York City in April . That's not all: oral cancer - a tumour which is frequently caused by HPV - has risen by 50% among UK men since 1989 and now accounts for almost 2,000 deaths per year. Worryingly, the figure is rising. HPV infections also remain common in men as they get older, whereas it tends to become less prevalent in their female counterparts. This may be because men are less likely than women to develop immunity, even after repeated exposure. Together, this begs one very important question: why does the Health Protection Agency think we deserve less care than women? After all, this is just one example . of inequality for men's health. Aside from the life expectancy gap, men . are four times more likely to develop and die from cancer than women, . yet - despite this - far more money is routinely pumped into female . cancer programmes. Of the top fifteen leading causes of death, men lead in 12 categories, are tied in two and trail in one. Michael in November 2010, when he was battling cancer . Infant boys are routinely circumcised, risking death, infection and a latter sense of violation, without a single eyebrow being raised. Meanwhile, female genital mutilation is the current hot topic in mainstream feminism. So while the world is busy demanding a female quota for street names (no, seriously! This was trending on Twitter yesterday), the world is allowing our young men to suffer because it's politically incorrect to intervene. In other words, we've taken the women-and-children-first philosophy of Titantic-era Britain and transplanted it into the NHS. National Health Service? More like national health disservice. Funny how women like Caitlin Moran fail to mention these issues in their criticisms of the so-called patriarchy. Fortunately, grassroots organisation T Cell - a group which demands fairer health services around HPV and HIV - is at the forefront of calls to change the system. 'Essentially, we find the current program sexist,' their manifesto reads. 'Previously, the UK government committed to a vaccination service for girls which used a product called Cervarix.' T Cell's beef was that most other countries used Gardasil, which does exactly the same job, but also has several preventative properties to protect men. So why did it take so long for the UK to catch on? According to Terrence Higgins Trust's head of policy, Lisa Power, Britain's flat-out refusal to use Gardasil was a big mistake: 'The decision was made on a cost benefit analysis, but I don't think they took all the costs into account,' she said. 'Notoriously, the minister at the time . sad 'You die of cervical cancer, you don't die of HPV', but HPV can . lead  to other things that you die of, and that's a serious issue. Every . other western European country took the decision to use Gardisil. The . UK didn't. The majority isn't always right, but when you have ten . different countries doing cost benefit analysis and only one goes in . another direction, you have to ask: who was doing the maths?' My own research proved similar . inconsistencies. When I contacted the Department of Health, I was given . very short shrift. 'The aim of the [HPV immunisation programme] is to . prevent cervical cancer in women,' they said. 'The vaccination of boys . was not recommended because once 80% of women are treated, it's not . necessary to vaccinate boys...to prevent cervical cancer.' Err, except we're not just talking about cervical cancer! We're also talking about every other manifestation. You know, the cancers which affect both genders. Even now, the UK's biggest cancer fundraiser - Cancer Research UK's Race for Life - bans men and boys from participating. The reason? According to spokesperson Luke Brand, it's all about 'sisterhood'. Silly me for thinking it was about charity. 'Three . years ago, we seriously investigated the possibility of including men . in Race for Life,' he said. 'However our research showed that our . supporters would strongly prefer to keep it a female-only event as it's a . unique opportunity for women to come together in a non-competitive . activity within an atmosphere of sisterhood.' Charming! So forget that men are universally dying from cancer more frequently . than women - instead we should be  worrying about women's feelings when . they're running around a field. It's absurd. 'In the same breath that Angelina Jolie has been lionised for her public honesty (about her preventative double mastectomy), Douglas has been criticised for it' Which is precisely why men like Michael Douglas should be up there with Angelina Jolie in the hero stakes. If cancer can nearly kill someone like him, with all his money and private medicine, what will it do to your average man who's relying on the NHS? Let's face it, it could be me one day. Both of my parents have had - and thankfully survived - cancer, so I'm perfectly qualified to know exactly how difficult it can be. That's a battle I'm willing to take on - and win, if necessary. But my odds shouldn't be slashed because being male isn't politically fashionable. That's a terminal cancer in itself. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is spread through sexual contact and is more usually associated with cervical cancer in women. It is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. HPV can be passed between men and women by genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. It may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. It can be passed on between straight and same-sex partners—even when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. The cervical cancer jab given to 12 and 13-year-old schoolgirls aims to cut their odds of the cancer by protecting them against the virus. Although most mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking and smoking an increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils and back of the tongue are due to HPV. Although the cancer is not contagious, the virus is. In the US, HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the tonsils and the back of the tongue, which experts say could be due to increasing popularity of oral sex. The typical patient is described as an otherwise healthy man in his late 40s or early 50s who has never smoked or smoked very little. In Britain, the number of mouth and throat cancers have increased by 40 per cent in just a decade, to 6,200 cases a year. Cancer Research UK says the HPV virus may be key to the ‘rapid rise’. Symptoms include persistent mouth ulcers, pain, discoloured patches and difficulty chewing and swallowing. Men are advised to check their neck for lumps when shaving and both sexes to look at the back of their throat while brushing their teeth. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are often more successful in mouth and throat cancers caused by the virus than those caused by tobacco and alcohol. Although mouth cancer can be caused by HPV passed on by oral sex, doctors say Michael Douglas’s claim that oral sex is also a cure doesn’t make any medical sense.

This is the last picture of Rolf Harris out in public before it was revealed he had been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. The 83-year-old entertainer was spotted in London's Soho last month before news emerged of his arrest under Operation Yewtree. Harris has not been seen in public since and has kept silent over the allegations. He was yesterday outed as the ‘mystery’ celebrity detained by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal – despite desperate efforts by his lawyers to suppress news of his arrest. Harris – a favourite of the Queen – had been the only high-profile Operation Yewtree suspect not to have been identified by the mainstream media. It emerged last night that in an attempt to stop details of his arrest becoming widely known, his lawyers at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis had sent threatening letters to newspapers. They cited Lord Justice Leveson’s controversial proposal that the public should be prevented from knowing the names of arrested suspects in all but ‘exceptional’ circumstances. One publisher was told there was ‘no public interest’ in revealing his identity, it was claimed. Yesterday Harris kept silent after The Sun revealed that he had been arrested over historic sex abuse allegations. The artist, singer and children’s TV star – the biggest name to be arrested so far by Yewtree officers – was first interviewed over the claims five months ago. The development was the subject of widespread internet gossip but for legal reasons his identity was not revealed in the mainstream media. Three weeks ago there was a further torrent of web speculation about Australian-born Harris after he was formally arrested over the allegations for the first time. But his identity was not disclosed by the mainstream media because although he had been arrested, police did not reveal his identity and his representatives declined to comment. Yesterday, however, he was identified by The Sun as having been arrested by Yewtree officers. The aggressive tactics used by his lawyers, who declined to comment yesterday, deepened the row over ‘secret arrests’. The tersely written letters from Harbottle & Lewis were sent amid mounting concern in the media about plans to ban the public from knowing the names of police suspects who have been arrested but not yet charged. Scroll down for video . Detectives are planning to travel to Australia to interview potential witnesses into the Harris allegations . The allegations do not involve disgraced Savile, who last year – following his death – was revealed to be Britain’s worst paedophile. Harris’s accuser is a woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager. Published: The Sun produced a 'dummy' front page before later printing details of Harris's arrest (pictured) Although he vehemently denies the allegations, he declined to issue a formal statement yesterday. The only official comment came from Channel 5, which said it was pulling his programmes pending the outcome of the police investigation. ‘While this legal matter involving Rolf Harris is on-going we have removed Olive the Ostrich and the repeats of Rolf’s Animal Clinic from the schedule,’ a spokesman said. Harris’s wife is the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, They met while they were both art students, marrying in March 1958. They have one daughter, Bindi, an artist. At last summer’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris famously led the crowd – including Princess Anne – in an impromptu rendition of Two Little Boys, his 1969 Christmas No 1 hit. He is also famed for his 1957 song Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport. Prior to yesterday, Harris had been the only celebrity Yewtree suspect not to have been identified by the mainstream media. His detention follows the arrests of pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson. Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson have all publicly denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests. Passion: Rolf Harris pictured officially unveiling his oil portrait of Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in 2005 - and he is turning to art in difficult times, it has emerged . Marriage: Rolf Harris and his wife Alwen, who says her husband of 55 years has been painting every day since his arrest . Critics say Yewtree, set up in the aftermath of the Savile scandal, has turned into a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’ and police are arresting suspects on flimsy evidence. The reason for Harris’s silence was the subject of speculation last night, with some pundits claiming it might be part of a carefully crafted strategy designed not to inflame the situation. Police searched his large, gated home in Bray, Berkshire, on November 24 while he was out of the country and took away computer equipment and other items. Harris was first interviewed under caution – but not arrested – over alleged sex offences on November 29 after attending a police station by appointment. On March 28 police took the decision to formally arrest him over the allegations. In February, he made a rare stage appearance at London’s Southbank Centre. Prior to his show, there had been claims that he had suffered psychiatric problems over the sex allegations, but there was no evidence he was suffering from stress or off colour. Yesterday there was no answer at Harris’s home. PR guru Max Clifford, left, and comedian Jim Davidson, right, are among those arrested in the Operation . Flying the flag: Harris at the Diamond Jubilee . Millions across the globe had known for weeks about Rolf Harris’s arrest over alleged sex offences after he was widely named on Twitter. Mark Williams-Thomas, a former Surrey Police detective who helped expose Jimmy Savile’s crimes in a TV documentary, first identified the entertainer on the website almost five months ago. His post was quickly retweeted and Harris’s name circulated by thousands of people on the internet. But newspapers and broadcasters held off from naming him until yesterday amid heavy-handed legal threats from Harris’s lawyers. Those who named him online included Russell Brand, who has more than 6.4million followers on Twitter. After Harris’ arrest on March 28, he tweeted: ‘Oh rolferoo not you too. #canyoutellwhatitisyet’. Blogger Guido Fawkes, real name Paul Staines, also reported the arrest. After Harris’s first police interview, his lawyers from Harbottle & Lewis told one publication: ‘There is no public interest in publishing such content as is entirely self-evident following the publication of the Leveson report.’ One publisher was even warned it could be hit with an expensive damages bill, even if it correctly named a police suspect, in line with a proposal the lawyers said had been recommended by two high court judges. Bob Satchwell, of the Society of Editors, has warned there is ‘a very small but dangerous step between the media being banned from naming people arrested to the police arresting people secretly’.

When Chinese shopkeeper Lu Sun saw a shoplifter shoving clothes into her bag she decided she'd teach her a lesson. In an unusual example of vigilante justice, the retailer, whose store had been hit by a spate of thefts over the previous two weeks, pinned shoplifter Li Wu to the ground, took a pair of scissors and hacked off her long dark hair. Lu Sun, 32, had lost hundreds of pounds worth of goods from thefts at her store at a shopping centre in Wenzhou, China, so decided to keep a close watch on Li Wu when she saw her acting suspiciously. She said: 'I watch so many people everyday, so I can tell thieves from others easily. 'When I noticed the woman sneaking around in the shopping mall, I knew she was up to no good. 'So, when she came into my shop, I was alert and finally caught her in the act.' Miss Sun was helped by a neighbouring shop owner who held Wi Lun down while she cut off chunks of her hair. The pair then called the police and had the shoplifter arrested. Miss Sun added: 'I decided to do it to teach her a lesson and to send a message to other thieves in the area to stay away from my shop.'

Now The Alamo Drafthouse, which last year released a Princess Bride tribute wine called The Bottle of Wits, has released The Cannibal Chianti and the Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio - a nod to the Buffalo Bill character in the movie. The Alamo Drafthouse has released The Cannibal Chianti and the Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio in tribute to The Silence of the Lambs, which features Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter . Alamo founder Tim League said: 'Even before we launched the “Bottle of Wits” series last year, we knew we had to reference what is in my opinion the most iconic wine moment in movie history, Hannibal Lecter’s now famous food pairing advice.' The Italian-grown Cannibal Chianti comes from a vineyard situated between Florence and Sienna. It is a blend of 85 per cent Sangiovese balanced with smaller contributions of Canaiolo and Malvasia del Chianti. The producers say the nose is loaded with a dark berry fruit with bass notes of allspice and baked quince. It is a medium-bodied wine with savory plum and tobacco leaf notes and a 'slight sandalwood finish'.

He had spent three months locked up with ‘murderers, drug dealers and rapists’ as a result of a bitter £400million divorce wrangle. So Scot Young, who claims to have lost more than a stone in weight while inside, was clearly keen to make up for lost time. The day after he left Pentonville Prison, cigarette in hand and Louis Vuitton designer bag slung over his shoulder, the former property tycoon was back on the society party circuit with girlfriend Noelle Reno. Scot Free: Young, the former business tycoon accused of hiding £400million by his wife Michelle Young, leaves Pentonville Prison (left). Young with Noelle Reno on Tuesday (right) Young, 51, who served three months of a six-month sentence for failing to reveal his financial secrets to his ex-wife, was sporting newly cropped hair – and the same battered leather jacket – as he attended an art exhibition in Soho with the 29-year-old model. A former fixer to the super-rich, he has been locked in a bitter legal battle with his ex-wife Michelle over her divorce settlement following their separation in 2006. Mrs Young, 48, a former model, insists her ex-husband is still worth up to £400million but has hidden his fortune to avoid his ‘obligations’ to her and their two children. He is adamant that he was left penniless by a disastrous Moscow property deal, but was jailed in January after a High Court judge ruled he had refused to reveal how £400million had apparently vanished overnight. Furious: Ex-wife Michelle Young who accuses him of pretending to have lost his fortune to avoid paying her the £48,000-a-month maintenance she is seeking . Mr Justice Moor jailed him for ‘flagrant and deliberate’ contempt of court. His release on Monday infuriated his ex-wife, who insisted he should have been kept in jail. Mrs Young told the Daily Mail: ‘He’s still in contempt of court. How can the justice system let him take one step out of prison without him disclosing the whereabouts of the £400million? He should have stayed in there until he purged his contempt. It’s outrageous that he’s out celebrating.’ She has accused her ex-husband of continuing to enjoy a lavish lifestyle while owing more than £1million in maintenance for her and their daughters Scarlet, 20, and Sasha, 18. Mrs Young’s lawyers allege a forensic accountant has found ‘significant evidence’ to show Young was not insolvent, as he has claimed. They are studying documents that reportedly claim he constructed a secret network of offshore companies to hold his assets. Mrs Young obtained a High Court order in 2007 which forbids him from selling or moving any disputed assets. She alleges that associates including the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, found hanged at his Ascot mansion last month, helped him to hide the money. Young has accused her of pursuing him in court out of spite, and described the decision to jail him as ‘ridiculous’. Speaking earlier this year, he said: ‘I can’t believe I’m locked up with murderers, drug dealers and rapists for 22 hours a day over a matrimonial matter.’ The couple married in 1995 and lived in a £14million Oxfordshire mansion. Young once bought her a Range Rover filled with couture dresses and gave her £1million in Graff diamond jewellery for her 40th birthday. Their legal battle will resume later this year, with Young facing possible further action for contempt if he fails to reveal details of his finances.","Scot Young was jailed for 'not revealing where his £400m went'

The 66-year-old, who even has a beard, had lived his entire life as a man but was told by doctors in Hong Kong that his enlarged abdomen was caused by an ovarian cyst. Tests revealed the patient suffered two rare genetic disorders that had gone undiagnosed. The man discovered he was a woman after going to see doctors in Hong Kong suffering a swollen stomach . They showed the patient had Turner Syndrome, a genetic condition that affects about one in 2,000 baby girls, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which increases male hormones. The Hong Kong Medical Journal, which published the information yesterday, said only six cases of people with both disorders had ever been reported in medical literature. Turner Syndrome usually results from a problem with the chromosomes and can leave women infertile and shorter than normal. Women with the syndrome are missing one or part of their second X chromosome. Hong Kong doctors found the patient was suffering from two rare genetic conditions. Pictured: Queen Mary Hospital, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong . Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of inherited disorders of the adrenal gland that causes more male sex hormone to be produced. The condition affects one in around 15,000 births and there is no cure. Girls with CAH tend to have normal female reproductive organs but genitals that look male. They may also have deeper voices, facial hair and may fail to menstruate. All patients with the condition are tall as children but short as adults. Girls with male-looking genitals will usually have surgery between ages 1 month and 3 months to correct the abnormal appearance. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia affects one in around 15,000 births and causes male characteristics to appear early or inappropriately. The patient had grown up an orphan and stopped growing after puberty at the age of 10 and was just 4.5ft tall. The patient also had no testes and a 'micro-penis', according to the report. Girls with the disorder have normal female reproductive organs but can suffer with fertility problems. Seven doctors, writing in the medical journal, said the Vietnam-born patient would continue to live as a man and may be treated with testosterone replacement. They said: 'Were it not due to the huge ovarian . cyst, his intriguing medical condition might never have been exposed', according to AFP.","Doctors told him he suffered from two rare genetic conditions .

Aged 15, tipping the scales at just 7st 10lb at 5ft 1"" tall, Emma Stewart had the sort of slim figure that many young women would envy. But it wasn't enough for her and under pressure to slim for a holiday, the sensitive teenager's body worries spiralled out of control. A battle with anorexia blighted her life for the next eight years and at one point the damaged girl weighed a terrifying 4st 7lb. But 10 years on, Emma, who hails from Elgin in Scotland, is healthy and happy again, and puts the turnaround down to her 'miracle' daughter, two-year-old Kacy. Happy and healthy: A now recovered Emma credits her two-year-old daughter Kacy with saving her life . Trigger: Emma on the Greek holiday that kickstarted her descent into eight years of anorexic hell . 'I feel so lucky to be alive and to have such a beautiful little girl,' the mother-of-one told the Daily Mirror. 'I've lost friends to this illness [anorexia] and while I know I'll never be free of those anorexic feelings, I only have to look at Kacy and I feel strong. She helped me more than any doctor could.' At her lowest point Emma's weight plummeted to just 4st 7lb while she eked out an existence on a single apple and 150 laxatives a day. Even when warned by a doctor that she was ruining her health and could die, she still couldn't see sense and had to be referred to an eating disorders unit. She admits that she didn't listen to the doctors because all she cared about was being skinny. She had always wanted to to be a mother but the thought of getting pregnant and putting on weight was terrifying. It wasn't until she realised that her friends and family truly thought she wouldn't survive that she started to pull back from the brink. Recovery: Emma thought that her illness could have left her infertile and was thrilled to find she was pregnant . Transformation: Emma today (right) is a far cry from the skinny figure she cut while at her sickest . Spurred on by friends and her worried parents, she slowly put on weight, eventually tipping the scales at a healthy 8st. After moving into her own flat, she met a roofer named David, now 26, who gave her the confidence to end the occasional bouts of bingeing and purging that still plagued her. 'I was still having bad days,' she says. 'But David made me more accepting of my body. We were so happy and moved in together. The only thing missing was a baby.' But Emma feared that having a child might never be a possibility for her, thanks to the damage caused by years of living with an eating disorder. 'I'd been taking 150 laxatives a day at one point,' she adds. 'It was obvious that my body couldn't cope with a baby.' Happily, fate had a wonderful surprise in store and just months later, Emma discovered that she was pregnant. But her old fears still plagued her, and she admits that she was terrified of putting on weight. She still made herself sick on some days but with David supporting her every step of the way Emma managed to take control of her demons and by the time daughter Kacy was born, Emma weighed a normal 11st 7lbs. Suddenly Kacy was her priority, rather then her body, as she focused on being a good mother. And two years on, she adds: 'Whenever I get tempted not to eat, I look at Kacy and the longing to purge or starve myself goes. Kacy truly has saved my life.' Read more at mirror.co.uk .

A heartbroken husband has revealed his young wife cried 'My love, we're going to die!' before she and their 17-day-old son were killed in the Oklahoma City tornado last week. Maria Pol Martin, 26, uttered her final words to  Miguel Chicoj seconds before  the EF5 tornado ripped her and her son, Rey Chicoj Pol, from the family's minivan along Interstate 40 on Friday evening. Her husband and their two other children, five-year-old Juan Chicoj Pol and one-year-old Tomasa Chicoj Pol, were injured but survived when their vehicle was thrown into a field. As he recounted his devastation to The Oklahoman, Chicoj revealed that he accidentally had driven his family into the deadly tornado's path. Tragic: Maria Pol Martin, pictured with her husband Miguel Chicoj, was killed in the Oklahoma tornadoes . The family left their home near Hinton to go to Oklahoma City to check on insurance coverage he needed for hand surgery, and began returning home at around 6pm. Chicoj said he had misheard a radio broadcast and believed the tornado was going to hit at 2am, rather than 2pm. 'He thought he had plenty of time to make it home before anything happened,' Chicoj, who is originally from Guatemala, told the Oklahoman through an interpreter. They continued to drive on Interstate 40 as the storm worsened. And after his wife unbuckled her seat belt so she could comfort the baby, they saw the storm head their way. Victim: Their son, 17-day-old Rey Chicoj Pol, was also killed when the tornado threw their van into the air . Chicoj said he considered turning around but it was too late and, as the tornado rattled through, their car began to spin in the road before being swept into the air. When the minivan landed, Chicoj awoke to hear his children crying but was devastated to see no sign of his wife or their youngest son. He was able to escape the crushed vehicle. Another driver stopped to help him retrieve his children. The three survivors were hospitalized. Tomasa suffered a broken leg and head trauma but they have all since been released. Maria and baby Rey were found soon after, and an Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper said the baby was still alive - yet the child passed away in his arms before help arrived. Scene: The mother and her baby were killed near this section of I-40 as they drove from El Reno to Hinton . Destruction: A person looks at cars damaged by the powerful tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma last Friday . Devastation: Eight people were killed by the tornadoes and 11 people drowned in subsequent flooding . They both died from multiple blunt force head trauma, the medical examiner's office said. Chicoj, who works at a hog farm in Hindon, said he has no plans to return to Guatemala as he believes his two surviving children will have a better life in Oklahoma. Maria and Miguel were among the eight victims who lost their lives in the tornadoes on Friday; eleven more died from flooding afterwards. Among the deaths were four storm chasers and a family of seven. The tornado that struck El Reno on Friday night is believed to be the widest on record in the United States at 2.6 miles across, the National Weather Service reported on Tuesday.

Isaak Wolfe, an 18-year-old high school senior living in York, Pennsylvania, has been denied the right to graduate with his male name, and instead will be identified as Sierra Stambaugh, his birth name. The school board is allowing Wolfe to wear the boy's black graduation gown, but won't be able to go by Isaak Wolfe, since it's not his legal name. Board solicitor Ben Pratt told WHTM that since the diploma is a legal document, the recipient's legal name must be on it. Molly Tack-Hooper, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, told the Associated Press that Wolfe is in the process of changing his name but hasn't had time to complete the process. Hard times at Red Lion High: Isaak Wolfe is fighting with the school's administrators to go by his male name at graduation . Wolfe has been living as a male for three years now, after realizing that she was different and not 'like the other kids,' Wolfe told the York Daily News. She finally realized the answer to her isolation: 'It was that I identified as a male.' So in his junior year, he changed his name to Isaak Wolfe from Sierra Stambaugh - with the full support of his parents. Wolfe says that though he faced some skepticism at school at first, for the most part, everyone has started calling him Isaak. Support: Friends and community members wore stickers that read 'His name is Isaak' at a recent school board meeting where Isaak argued against going by his female name at graduation . It was in the final stretch of his senior year that the school's administration began giving him a hard time for his gender identity. Wolfe told his girlfriend Taylor Thomas earlier in the year that he wanted to run for prom king. After he submitted his application he found out - without warning - that his name had been entered as Sierra Stambaugh on the prom queen side of the ballots. Not a queen: Wolfe with his date and girlfriend Taylor Thomas. Thomas was almost banned from the prom after she started an online campaign to have Isaak's male name spoken at graduation . 'For a transgendered person, it is degrading to have that, and I wasn't even warned.' According to Wolfe's father, WIlliam Stambaugh, the school's principal 'said the king was always a male and the queen was always a female. And he feels that's the way it should be.' The school even threatened to ban Thomas, a 2011 Red Lion graduate, from attending the Prom as Wolfe's date after she started an online petition criticizing the principal for not allowing Wolfe to be addressed by his male name at graduation. The principal, Mark Shue, described the language in Thomas's petition as 'dangerous.' Shue continued to pressure Wolfe to stop Thomas' campaign and release a scripted press statement, until Wolfe finally called the ACLU. The organization is now representing Wolfe. 'Isaak is accepted by his family, teachers, and peers for who he is,' said Reggie Shuford, executive director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania. 'He had no reason to expect to be treated differently by school officials, and Shue's efforts to silence Isaak and Taylor and suppress their First Amendment rights are completely inappropriate and unconstitutional.' That's not my name: The school board is unlikely to budge on using Isaak's female name. According to a board member, the diploma is a legal document and Isaak is not yet his legal name .","18-year-old Isaak Wolfe to be called Sierra Stambaugh at graduation, even though he has identified as a male for past three years .

Phil Bryant, pictured with his wife Deborah, has caused a debate over children's education and women returning to work . A Mississippi governor has ignited a heated debate by claiming that standards in education have declined in line with women returning to the workplace. Speaking during a televised panel discussion, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant quickly realised his controversial remarks would cause a backlash from those who oppose his views, but he stood by his claims. He pointed out however that he was not trying to blame working women for children's declining education. In response to a question asking why American children's test results had become 'so mediocre', he told the panel, hosted by the Washington Post: 'Both parents started working, and the mom is in the work place. That's not a bad thing. I'm going to get in trouble. I can just see - I can see the emails tomorrow. But now, both parents are working. They're pursuing careers. It's a great American story now - that women are in the work place.' He went on to say that he didn't believe it was the mother's place to teach children to read, but said that before women started working, there was a 'loving, nurturing opportunity' and both parents had a more time to devote to the family. Equal opportunities for women began notably in the 1950s and 60s. The struggle for women to be accepted as equal in the workplace is epitomised in the successful TV series Mad Men, set during this period. Prior to this the traditional role for women was to act as the matriarch, to be the mother and home-maker, cook and cleaner and to keep the house in order. In more rural parts of the country, such as Mississippi, women have always toiled in much the same way as men, according to Mississippi Democratic Party chairman Rickey Cole. Calling Bryant, 'the goofiest governor in America,' Cole said throughout the state's 200-year history, most mothers have had to work to earn money for their families. Janis Lane,  right, president of the Central Mississippi Tea Party, said she was proof children could be the focus of the home and still work. Mississippi Democratic Party chairman Rickey Cole, left, described Bryant as 'goofy' saying most women in Mississippi had always worked in some way . He said in a statement: 'Whether that work took place in the fields, in the logwoods, as domestic workers, as teachers, as nurses, as factory workers, in food service, in retail or in many other fields of arduous work, the mothers of Mississippi have been bringing home the bacon since Mississippi began.' He added:  'The 1950s `Father Knows Best,' picket fence, middle-class family myth has never been an option for most Mississippians.' Bryant's remarks were also criticised by Democratic state Senator Deborah Dawkins, of Pass Christian. The frequent critique of Bryant, who said she worked as a physician's assistant while raising three children, described Bryant as being out 'out of touch' with the challenges facing parents to afford child care, particularly in the poorest states. 1950s wife: Equal opportunities for women began notably in the 1950s and 60s; they were traditionally mothers and home makers . Housewife: Mississippi Democratic Party chairman Rickey Cole said: 'The 1950s `Father Knows Best,' picket fence, middle-class family myth has never been an option for most Mississippians.' Speaking to Associated Press, she said he 'surrounds himself with Tea Party people who want to home-school their children'. The president of Central Mississippi's Tea Party, Janis Lane, said she believes Bryant meant nothing derogatory. Lane, who worked while raising two sons, said having both parents working takes some of the focus away from home life, but said she was proof that it was possible to build your life around your children and still work.",Republican Gov.

An Indiana mother says she fears for her son's life after one of his high school classmates made a video threatening to murder the teen. Christina Horn says cyber-bullying at Goshen High School has been out of control, with teens using Twitter, Facebook and text messages to harass and intimidate one another. But according to the mother, she did not grasp the scope of the problem until her son, John, received a video recording from a classmate threatening to kill him. Parent's nightmare: Christina Horn (left) says her son (right) was left fearing for his life after being targeted by bullies harassing him on Facebook, making threatening phone calls and sending intimidating text messages . Menacing message: This video recorded in the school cafeteria shows a teen saying on camera that he plan to 'murder John's face,' referring to Christina Horn's son . The video was recorded a week earlier in the cafeteria of the high school. In the clip, one teen could be heard asking another off camera: 'Hey, what are you gonna do this Saturday, to John?' Another teen seen in the shot replies: 'I'm gonna murder John's face.' The mother became alarmed after watching the clip and immediately contacted the school, according to the TV station ABC57. 'That’s my child they are talking about in that video,' Horn said. 'So it really made me scared, scared for my son’s life.' Officials at Goshen High School responded to Horn’s concerns by suspending the two teens involved, one to three days and the other to five. However, the punishment apparently did little to stop the bullying. According to Horn, her son continued receiving threatening phone calls, texts messages and Facebook posts, leaving him afraid to go to school. Official response: Administrators at Goshen High School suspended the two students involved in the making of the video, one of them to five days and the other to three . The mother told the station that when she brought her concerns to school officials, saying that her son was still being threatened, she was told that it was a 'he said, she said' situation, and that the administration could do nothing about it. On Monday, Goshen Schools Superintendent Diane Woodworth said that the matter had been addressed. 'We absolutely want every student to feel safe at Goshen High School and all of our schools,' she said. Woodworth added that she has been unsuccessfully trying to reach Horn to resolve the situation with her son. Taking action: Horn (left) has removed her son from school, changed his phone number and is pressing charges against the suspected bullies . Unsatisfied with the official response to the threats, the mother decided to remove her son from Goshen High School, saying that the boy should feel safe and focus on getting an education rather than spend his days fearing for his life.

The son of UKIP leader Nigel Farage is facing court over a drunk and disorderly charge, it was revealed yesterday. City trader Thomas Farage, 21, was arrested at 3am in a London street earlier this month. He did not appear for his first hearing at City of London Magistrates’ Court yesterday and his lawyers have asked prosecutors to deal with the case away from court. The allegations are embarrassing for UK  Independence Party leader Mr Farage ahead of the May 2 county council elections, in which UKIP hopes to make record gains. But the hearing was yesterday adjourned until May 10. There is no suggestion the case was deliberately delayed until after the elections. Farage was arrested at 3am in St Martin’s Le Grand, a street in the Square Mile near St Paul’s Cathedral. His lawyers asked the Crown Prosecution Service to consider medical evidence in the case, although no further details were given. Prosecutor Catherine Baccas told magistrates: ‘There are discussions between the parties as to a more appropriate outcome.’ CPS guidelines state that low-level crimes by first-time offenders can be dealt with out of court using cautions, fines or community service if it is deemed appropriate. A spokesman said: ‘In this particular case, the defence has asked that we take into consideration medical evidence concerning the defendant before proceeding with this prosecution. ‘It is only sensible that potentially relevant evidence should be taken into account, so we have asked the court to adjourn this case until we have received and reviewed the evidence.’ Thomas Farage did not appear for his first hearing at City of London Magistrates' Court yesterday and his lawyers have asked prosecutors to deal with the case away from court .

Half of all whiplash claims from car crashes are fraudulent, insurance experts have told MPs.About 50 per cent – and possibly as many as 60 per cent – of whiplash cases are bogus because the symptoms are ‘too easy to fake’, they say. Insurance firms are also being exploited by a ‘claims manufacturing industry’ that has ‘gone into overdrive’ to entice drivers into making easy claims. The claims are typically worth £2,500 a time and earn fees for claims firms and lawyers. Yet the medical and legal tests to weed out fakers are not sufficiently stringent and the threshold for settling a claim is ‘too low’, MPs were told. Brass neck: Insurers have told politicians that more than half of all whiplash claims are fraudulent. File picture . If correct, it means that at least half the estimated £2billion a year paid out in 550,000 whiplash claims is fraudulent, making it a £1billion-a-year scam. The disclosure confirms the UK’s dubious reputation as the ‘whiplash capital of the world’. One reason for the ‘whiplash epidemic’ is that it is cheaper to settle than to fight cases suspected to be fraudulent, say experts. Fraudsters are also landing insurance payouts with ‘cash for crash’ scams, where they stage car crashes and then submit false claims for personal injury and damage to their vehicles. Insurance experts already calculate that whiplash claims boosted by ‘no-win, no-fee’ claims firms are adding £90 to the average car insurance policy. Whiplash injuries are hard to disprove as the symptoms can be easily faked. File picture . The scale of the scandal in England and Wales is much greater than in countries such as Germany, where lawyers’ fees are limited. The damning evidence came in testimony to the Commons transport select committee from David Brown, of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and David Powell, of the Lloyd’s insurance market association. Mr Brown said whiplash fraud is a ‘huge problem’, which has rocketed since 2007. He added: ‘It is highly likely that the UK is the whiplash capital of the world.’ Claims have soared, despite a fall in accidents, because people are ‘motivated’ by the ease of claiming in financially tough times, he said. Between 10 and 60 per cent of whiplash claims were ‘exaggerated, misrepresented or fraudulent’. Pressed on the figures by MPs, Mr Brown said the most likely total was near the upper level – or about 50 per cent of claims being fraudulent. Victim: Baljinder Gill . Mr Powell agreed the 50 per cent figure for bogus claims is ‘plausible’. He said members of his association ‘suspect a lot of claims are exaggerated or fraudulent but they are not able to prove it’.

Doctors in Sweden yesterday said PIP breast implants are dangerous and must be removed. Tests showed some of the French-made implants contain a type of silicone that irritates tissue, according to the Swedish Medical Products Agency. Last month, a Europe-wide consumer group warned the chemical may harm babies in the womb. Removal: Swedish authorities have recommended that the 4,000 women in Sweden with French PIP breast implants should have them removed as a preventative measure . Dr Vendela Schnittger, who led the latest tests, said they raised concerns about long-term safety. Warning: Women with faulty PIP breast implants are at risk of chemical exposure that causes damage to unborn babies, experts have warned . She added: ‘This is a very young group of people who have been subjected to this health risk. ‘We have no idea of the long-term effects the implants could have.’ The Swedish guidelines contrast with . Department of Health advice that while PIP implants are more likely to . split, they do not pose a long-term risk. Other countries to recommend . routine removal include France, Germany and the Czech Republic. Rajiv Grover, president of the British . Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said more tests must be . carried out ‘as a matter of urgency’ on the cheap implants, used by . 50,000 UK women. A Department of Health spokesman said: . ‘The UK regulator keeps all evidence under review and will speak to the . Swedish health authorities to explore the basis for their advice. ‘We expect private clinics to care for patients but, if they refuse, the NHS will look after them.’ The cost of removal in Sweden will have to be met by the women or by their private clinics. Questions: Lucy Petagine with her daughter, Luna, who lost her battle with cancer last year . When Luna Petagine was diagnosed with . cancer aged just 18 months, her mother, Lucy, was plagued with doubts. Had the disease been brought on by something she’d done - or hadn’t . done? Was it a phone . mast or car fumes? Was it something in her genes? What could have caused . her perfect, precious baby girl to be struck down by this vile disease? Not . for a moment did she consider the answer could lie in an act of vanity, . carried out long before she had children. Twelve years ago, Lucy, 40, . from Watford, Hertfordshire, paid £3,500 for a breast enlargement . operation, taking her from a B cup to a D. Tragically, little Luna succumbed to a . brain tumour last August aged five-and-a-half. Understandably, it has . left Lucy tortured by guilt, with questions she almost can’t bear to . have answered. ‘It’s my worst fear,’ she says. ‘If it turned out that I had, through my own vanity, caused my daughter’s death, I would die.’ Lucy, whose husband Mario runs a . double glazing company, was initially happy with the results of her . operation. She had been a flat-chested teenager and very slim, and her . new figure gave her more confidence. However, . she noticed something wrong with her breasts soon after Luna arrived in . 2007. They’d been fine for years and she’d had no problems . breastfeeding her eldest son Aldo, now eight. ‘But . soon after Luna was born, I’d noticed one of my breasts looked lumpy,’ she says. ‘My GP referred me for an ultrasound which showed one of my . implants had ruptured. But the consultant at the breast screening clinic . said there was absolutely no harm in breastfeeding. He said I should . come back once I’d finished breastfeeding Luna, to have them removed and . replaced, but I fell pregnant with my third child, Enza, before I . could.’ Five weeks . after Enza was born in 2008, Luna became tired and lethargic. At first, . Lucy and Mario thought it was simply a virus, but then they noticed . their little girl was sleeping with her head cocked back in a very . unnatural way. After several weeks of A&E visits and tests, Lucy and . Mario were told that Luna had a brain tumour. ‘For the next year, we spent our lives in hospitals and my breasts were not even thought about,’ says Lucy. Then . the PIP scandal broke at the beginning of last year. Lucy contacted her . surgeon as soon as she heard the news. He said it was very likely that . her implants were PIP. ‘I . thought: “Oh my God”,’ she says quietly. She immediately had her . implants removed and replaced, but at the forefront of her mind was . Luna’s health. Luna bravely endured chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and four . lots of brain surgery to shrink the tumour. But last summer she began . to deteriorate. Scans showed the tumour had grown again and was now . inoperable. Five short weeks later, she died at home with her parents by . her side. ‘People say . time is a great healer, but unfortunately that’s not true,’ says Lucy. ‘We have learned to function, but we are never going to be all right.’ ‘Cancer can happen to anyone and we . don’t know if there is a link,’ she says. ‘But I know I had this toxic . stuff they were pumping into mattresses inside me, and I know it was . leaking. Could it have passed to Luna through my breast milk? If it does . turn out to cause cancer, I just don’t know what I’ll do.’","Faulty PIP implants may pose pregnancy risk, according to experts .

Knightsbridge is known for Arab boy racers weaving their way through one of Britain's most exclusive areas throughout the summer in their expensive sports cars. But residents of Knightsbridge - which has an average house price of £3.6million and is home to Harrods - say the drivers from the Gulf region are ‘a manifestation of too much-ness’. The petrol-heads and their motors are cheered on by camera-carrying youngsters, known as the Carparrazzi, but are hated by a number of furious residents who claim their lives are being ruined. Their behaviour was revealed in a recent Channel 4 documentary which has followed the rich youngsters as they prepared to leave the Gulf for the UK and spend three months in London.

For a man with such a daunting in-tray as new boss of the BBC, it was a bizarre performance to say the least. As he took over as director general yesterday, Tony Hall was about to be confronted by a report into Jimmy Savile’s sex abuse, a review into bullying and harassment within the corporation, on-going industrial disputes and tough financial cuts. The 62-year-old nevertheless decided it was the perfect time to fool around for the cameras. Scroll down for video . Tony Hall, former chief Executive of the Royal . Opera House, made sure everyone was watching as he began his role as the . Director General at the BBC . The Lord seemed in high spirits as he larked about in front of new Broadcasting House on his first day . Lord Hall posed for the media at the entrance of the BBC’s new Broadcasting House yesterday morning. As photographers called out his name, . requesting him to stand in different positions, he dithered over which . direction to go and ended up apparently playing the clown – almost . appearing to dance. During his tour of TV news studios, . the man charged with mending the corporation’s battered reputation . denied the BBC was a ‘Left of centre’ organisation and said audience . trust in the broadcaster was ‘climbing back’. A former chief executive of the Royal . Opera House, who began as a BBC trainee 40 years ago, Lord Hall said he . had known ‘absolutely nothing’ about Savile’s activities when he used . to work at the corporation, in its news division. He singled out current shows for praise including Doctor Who, The Voice and the Bach ‘marathon’ on Radio 3. Eccentric entrance: Clearly the BBC's new Director General is eager to start his new job . This way, colleagues! Tony Hall introduces himself as people enter the BBC's huge London offices . The new DG sent an encouraging email to staff, telling them he believed the BBC's best days 'lay ahead' All smiles: Tony Hall has a mammoth task ahead of him . One of his first actions in the . £450,000-a-year job yesterday was to send an email to all of the . corporation’s staff in which he suggested ‘the BBC’s best days lie ahead . of us’. His arrival comes after predecessor . George Entwistle lasted just 54 days in the role, after he became . embroiled first in the Jimmy Savile controversy and then the bungled . Newsnight report into Lord McAlpine, which wrongly linked the peer to . historic sex abuse claims. The Savile crisis was hugely damaging . for the corporation’s reputation and, alongside on-going cuts, has left . a legacy of low morale at the broadcaster. Yesterday the new director general . warned staff he took a ‘very dim view’ of anything that got in the way . of team-work and was ‘intolerant’ of anything that stopped it making . ‘great programmes’. While his response about team-work . came to a question about the bullying and harassment review, it is . understood he has also told top bosses at the broadcaster they must talk . to each other. Lord Hall will now be faced with the difficult task of leading the BBC as it seeks to restore its reputation . One of the key criticisms about the . BBC during the Savile crisis was that executives worked in ‘silos’ and . did not properly inform each other of what was going on at the . corporation. Vile Jimmy Savile prompted a huge scandal at the BBC . Lord Hall was challenged by Sky News . presenter Adam Boulton about the recent appointment of former Labour . minister James Purnell to a senior role at the BBC and asked if the . corporation was a ‘Left of centre’ organisation. The director general said ‘no’ before . saying he had brought in Mr Purnell, who used to work at the . broadcaster, to ‘shape the strategy for the BBC going forward’. When he was asked if the BBC needed . more money when charter renewal comes in a few years, the BBC boss . added: ‘At the moment I don’t know the answer to that. ‘What I do know is that it would be a . mistake to try to reopen any negotiations about money at the moment, . because of the economy and people out there are going through some very, . very hard times.’ He said that the Savile crisis had . been ‘a tough time for the BBC’ but ‘an even tougher time for those . directly affected by what happened’. Lord Hall also declared himself a fan . of a wide range of BBC shows, claiming he had enjoyed seeing Matt get . picked to go through in Saturday’s opening episode of The Voice and . praised the ‘wonderful sharp form’ of Doctor Who. The BBC's image has been tarnished by a string of incidents in the past year. Last week, the BBC was hit by unions protesting at the Delivering Quality First (DQF) programme which will lead to 2,000 job losses at the corporation. A strike by journalists and technical staff in a row over jobs, workload and claims of bullying caused well-known shows to be dropped on Good Friday. The strike, from 12pm until midnight, led to the cancellation of BBC 2's Newsnight, Radio 4's PM and the World Tonight. Since October, more than 850 BBC employees have come forward to raise concerns about bullying and sexual harassment at the corporation. The staff members have contacted private consultants brought in by the BBC as part of an internal inquiry set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Rose Review, overseen by human rights lawyer Dinah Rose QC, was launched last year following a wave of damaging claims from female presenters who said they were routinely groped while working for the BBC. In December 2011 the BBC dropped a Newsnight investigation into Savile's years of sex attacks. Last year it was revealed that hundreds of people came forward alleging that they had been abused by Savile and other high-profile figures. The Pollard Review, an inquiry into how the BBC handled the Savile affair, reveals better leadership could have prevented 'chaos and confusion' at BBC over the DJ scandal scandal. Another low-key entrance: Alan Yentob, the BBC Creative Director, seen arriving at Broadcasting House, certainly knows how to catch the eye on his blue bicycle .","Tony Hall charged with repairing BBC's battered reputation .

For Lady Harriet Brocket news that Angelina Jolie had had a double mastectomy gave rise to mixed feelings because just months earlier, she had made exactly the same decision. The 38-year-old photographer wife of former I'm A Celebrity contestant, Lord Brocket has revealed that she had the surgery after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year. Although she was given the option of a lumpectomy, which would have removed the cancer alone, Lady Brocket plumped for a double mastectomy to give herself a better chance of staying cancer free. Brave: Lady Harriet Brocket has revealed that she underwent a double mastectomy earlier this year . Happy: Lady Brocket, pictured with her with her TV personality husband, Lord Charles Brocket, before cancer . 'The options were a lumpectomy or a mastectomy,' she revealed. 'If you have both breasts removed, there's a much better chance of ensuring that the cancer will not return and reconstruction gives better results if you have the treatment on both sides.' she told Hello! magazine. According to experts, a double mastectomy can reduce the risk of breast cancer to almost nothing - in Jolie's case, from an 87 per cent chance to five. Although Lady Brocket doesn't carry the same BRCA1 faulty gene that the Hollywood actress does, she sympathised with the star's decision. 'It doesn't matter who you are, if you don't have your health, nothing else is important,' she added. 'I feel very lucky to have had an early diagnosis and to have been able to make the right choice to give me the best chance of staying alive for my children.' Once the decision to go ahead with the surgery had been made, Lady Brocket faced a battery of uncomfortable - and often painful - tests, a miserable experience compounded by the fact her mother had just been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time. Reality star: Lord Brocket shot to fame after appearing on ITV show, I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here . Survivor: Lady Brocket talks Angelina Jolie and beating breast cancer in an interview with Hello! magazine . She too was given the opportunity to have both breasts removed and in a strange twist of fate, mother and daughter were booked in to go under the knife in the same hospital on the same day, around the same time that actress Angelina was having her surgery in secret. The operation itself took a gruelling seven hours and Lady Brocket was confined to a hospital bed for five days, only able to speak to her daughters, Amelia, three, and Iona, one, via Skype. Today, she's still recovering and having to deal with the side effects of hormone treatment aimed at preventing the cancer from recurring. But despite the trauma, she remains upbeat about her situation. 'It's a brave decision to have your breasts removed, but it's not the end of the world, which it could be if you don't have them checked. My strong message is please go and get checked - it may save your life.'

British workers have swapped the hard work of factories and farms for an easier life sitting behind a desk, new research reveals. In the last 170 years the number of people working in agriculture and manufacturing has slumped, while millions more now work in offices, shops and . More people now work for the state in government, schools and the NHS than actually making things in factories. Change: Since millions went to work in factories in the 1930s (left) economic and social changes mean far fewer people make things and instead spend their day sitting at a desk . Growth in banking, out-of-town shopping centres and demand for flexible working have led to a boom in the so-called service industries, with manufacturing jobs outsourced overseas to take advantage of cheaper labour. A study by the Office for National Statistics revealed the number of people working in farming and manufacturing has fallen below one in 100 for the first time. In 1841 the figure was more than one in five. Researchers said a combination of mechanical inventions and cheap foreign food imports meant that far fewer Britons are now needed to feed the nation. Industry: In the last 170 years the number of people working in manufacturing and farming has collapsed, while there has been a huge boom in the service industries . Manufacturing was as important as the service industry to the economy until the mid-1960s. But large-scale factory closures and outsourcing meant that by the 2011 Census 80 per cent of people worked in the services, compared to just 8.9 per cent working in manufacturing. Statistician Jamie Jenkins told MailOnline: ‘We are less reliant on making things within the country, partly through increased globalisation. We do now rely on imported manufacturing. ‘We have moved towards desk work from manufacturing. The service sector tends to be lower average hour, it is more flexible working. ‘It used to be the High Street where all the shops were, now we have all these big shopping centres.’ Desk jockeys: Social and economic change means millions more people now work in offices . Census: Data taken in the Census every 10 years shows how the jobs we work in have dramatically changes . Service industries include distribution, hotels, restaurants, transport, banking, government, education and health. Women . in particular are more likely to work in services than men. In 2011, 92 . per cent of women in work were within the service sector compared with . just 71 per cent of men. A . new ONS study on 170 Years of Industry reveals that in 1841, 22 per cent . of people worked in agriculture and farming, but by 2011 this had . fallen to less than on per cent. Mr . Jenkins said: ‘In every Census since 1841 the number of people working . in agriculture has fallen. ‘We have got tractors and ploughs and . inventions which mean it is less labour intensive . ‘But . also over the last 100 years we built the railways, and we took the . railways to the rest of the world, so now we can import food. ‘We rely a lot more now on food from the rest of the world than we ever have.’ Gender: Women are more likely to work in service industries while nine out of 10 people in construction are men . Regions: The data showed wide variation in different parts of the country, with rural areas more reliant on farming . The study revealed a wide regional variation in the industries which dominate different parts of the country. Around eight per cent of people in Powys in Wales, Eden in Cumbria and Torridge in Devon work in agriculture, compared to the national average of 0.9 per cent. Hackney topped the league table for people working int the arts and entertainment (8.3 per cent) while almost a quarter (23 per cent) of people on the Isles of Scilly working in tourism-related accommodation and food services. Corby relies most on manufacturing, with 24 per cent of people working in the industry, followed by Pendle (21 per cent) and Barrow-in-Furness (21 per cent).","Social and economic change laid bare by Office for National Statistics .

Accused: PC Kayley Newman (pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court) set up a night of passion in a hotel with her lover despite knowing 'full well' that he was wanted for questioning, a trial heard . A police officer set up a secret night of passion with her boyfriend while he was wanted for questioning, a court heard today. PC Kayley Newman, 25, failed to arrest Dominic Diop, 23, after arranging an illicit rendezvous at the Hotel Ibis London Docklands in east London, Southwark Crown Court was told. Newman, who was based at Harrow Police Station in north-west London, allegedly knew 'full well' police had been trying to track down her lover since October 25 2011. She messaged Diop on Facebook to arrange the 'clandestine' tryst before meeting him on November 13 2011, the court heard. But Diop was not arrested until November 21 when he was recalled to prison to complete an earlier sentence. He was clocked driving dangerously without a licence or insurance while he was at large. Newman and her lover have admitted exchanging scores of illegal calls and text messages while he was being held at HMP Pentonville in north London between November 21 2011 and January 28 2012. In one letter to her boyfriend, unearthed after his cell was searched, she wrote: 'It's always fun staying in hotels with you, I get lots of kisses and cuddles and I wear you out', jurors heard. She penned another note saying: 'I can't believe someone told the police where you were. It makes you not trust anyone doesn't it or trust people you thought were your friends. 'Have you p***** anyone off? It's well bad, someone must not want you around.' Police wanted to speak to Diop after he was arrested in August 2011 for possession of cannabis while on licence, Claire Howell, prosecuting, said. A further arrest warrant was issued after he failed to turn up at a hearing at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London on November 2 in relation to the drug allegations. Location: The illicit rendezvous was arranged at the Hotel Ibis (above) in east London, jurors were told . Diop was also wanted in relation to two burglaries committed days later on November 4 and 7, jurors heard. 'In November 2011, Kayley Newman arranged a clandestine meeting in a hotel with her then boyfriend,' Ms Howell said. 'The reason she is here is because she was a police officer and he at the time was a wanted criminal. 'She left the hotel and went straight . back to work that morning and she said not a word to any of her . colleagues about where she was. 'She knew Dominic Diop and telephone . evidence makes it clear they were certainly in regular phone contact . with each other and it is accepted they were in a relationship. In the dock: Newman has admitted exchanging scores of illegal calls and text messages while he was being held in prison after his arrest . 'Certainly they were contacting each other regularly from August 2011.' The pair arrived at the Hotel Ibis . separately after Newman booked the suite in her own name, to avoid . Diop's name being on the hotel records, Ms Howell said. Newman left the hotel around 6am and . went straight to a shift at Harrow Police Station at around 8am, while . Diop checked out at about 9.20am. 'Did she tell any of her colleagues she knew exactly where this man was? No', said Ms Howell. 'Had she done, they would probably . have been able to go to the hotel and arrest him then and there. The . prosecution do not need to prove how Kayley Newman knew Dominic Diop was . wanted. 'The prosecution say it's really obvious she knew, in fact, he probably told her and that's how she knew.' The messages posted by Newman on Facebook demonstrated she was 'well aware' Diop was wanted, Ms Howell said. 'She was loyal to her boyfriend but as . a police officer, Kayley Newman has a responsibility to members of the . public and she didn't fulfil her responsibility in this case. 'The prosecution say what she did was . serious, this man was wanted. He went on to commit criminal offences . because she didn't do her job properly.' Newman, who has since been sacked, was . arrested on January 31 last year. In a prepared statement, she accepted . spending time with Diop but insisted she didn't know he was wanted at . the time. 'All the evidence in this case is she knew full well he was a wanted man', added Ms Howell. Giving evidence, Newman insisted she . did not know that Diop was wanted by police and claimed he too was . unaware officers were searching for him. 'It's always fun staying in hotels with you, I get lots of kisses and cuddles and I wear you out' What Kayley Newman allegedly wrote to Dominic Diop in a letter . She told how her job 'meant a lot to her' and she wouldn't 'throw it away' to meet a wanted suspect. Smartly dressed in a dark suit, Newman . told the jury: 'I don't believe he knew, I don't think he would meet me . if he knew he was wanted, knowing how much my job means to me. 'I don't think he would have risked coming to meet me.' But the court heard Diop had arranged for his friends to 'scope out' the hotel prior to their arrival on November 13 2011. Newman claimed a message to her . friend, Terri, which said: 'Dom's boys went to the hotel before me to . check I hadn't told the feds', was nothing more than a joke. 'Dominic likes to think he is a bit of . a gangster and the police want to know everything he is doing,' she . said. ‘He likes to think he is something special but from my point of . view I know it's rubbish.' Newman insisted she was being . 'sarcastic' when questioned about a love letter she wrote to Diop in . prison, saying: 'I can't believe someone told the police where you were. It makes you not trust anyone doesn't it, or trust people you thought . were your friends.' She told the court: 'He always said his friends were like family and I was saying you can't trust them.' But the jury heard the letter also . said: ‘I miss you so bad, I just want you here. I promise I will wait . for you and make you happy, as long as you promise to be good in there . and write to me every day.' Newman and Diop exchanged more than . 1,000 calls and text messages after he was recalled to prison to . complete an earlier sentence for robbery, jurors heard. 'I miss you so bad, I just want you here. I promise I will wait for you and make you happy' What Newman allegedly told Diop . Cross examining Newman, prosecutor Claire Howell told her: 'You felt loyalty to him (Diop), didn't you?' Newman replied: 'Not as far as my job . was concerned. My job means a lot to me, more than to throw my job away . to meet someone who was wanted.' She insisted she would have alerted her supervisor had she been aware Diop was being hunted. Newman also claimed she was unaware . that she was committing a crime by having conversations with Diop on an . illicit mobile phone while he was behind bars. Ms Howell said: 'You pleaded guilty to . having over 1,000 calls with Mr Diop while he was in prison using a . mobile phone, which was a criminal offence. She replied: 'I was not aware calling . Dominic back on his mobile phone was illegal. I was aware you are not . allowed to have a mobile phone in prison and that's why I pleaded guilty . to that offence.' But Ms Howell told Newman: 'If your . job means so much to you, you would not have been calling a prisoner on . an illegal mobile phone more than 1,000 times.' Newman, of Barnet, north London, . denies misconduct in a public office. She and Diop, of East Ham, east . London, have admitted conspiracy to cause the transmission of an image . or sound from prison. The trial continues.

Nearly two thirds of people now do not think there is a stigma attached to ending a marriage as attitudes towards divorce have become more relaxed. Only 4 per cent of British people questioned said they strongly agreed that divorce is a social taboo. But who gets which half? Nearly two thirds of people now do not think there is a stigma attached to ending a marriage as attitudes towards divorce have become more relaxed, a new survey has shown . The research into the changing attitudes towards marriage found that it is young people who are now mostly likely to believe that divorce is socially acceptable. Only 56 per cent of people aged 18 to 24 said that divorce was taboo, compared to 67 per cent of 24- to 54-year-olds. The poll of 2,000 people by YouGov for the DVD release of film I Give It A Year found that the words people most associated with marriage were commitment (37 per cent) and love (20 per cent). Only 4 per cent of people said that the word they most associated with marriage was divorce. The study further found that 28 is considered the best age to get married. Relationship expert and Relate . counsellor Christine Northam said: ‘Divorce has become much more . familiar in modern life; it’s not the hushed secret it was years ago. 'Most . of us have been affected by divorce, whether we’ve gone through it, . know someone who has, or have been affected by our parents’ divorce, so . the taboo status has lost much of its power. ‘The . generational difference in attitude could be put down to the young . couples’ proximity to parental divorce, and an unwillingness to repeat . the same mistakes. 'Perhaps we don't put the value on it that we did': Actress Alison Steadman recently said that the stigma of divorce is now a thing of the past . 'I see a lot of younger couples anxious to try fix a relationship, but there are still vast numbers of couples who give up on marriage too quickly before seeking professional help. ‘It’s a common myth that marriage is losing its sense of importance in society, in fact it stills means an awful lot to many, many people, hence, the huge fuss which is made around weddings. 'There is no such thing as a painless divorce; we are just getting better adjusted to it as a part of modern Britain.’ The findings come after TV actress Alison Steadman said that the stigma of divorce is now a thing of the past. The 66-year old said: ‘I can remember when I was at school there was one girl in my whole class, her parents were divorced and it was shocking, we as kids felt really sorry for her ... her mother had married again and it felt really odd. ‘I think now it seems to be the norm for kids that their parents don't stay together, sadly. ‘But times change and hopefully, maybe my sons' generation, there will be a switch again, maybe they will think again. ‘Because divorce is so easy now and it wasn't years ago and you had to go through all sorts of hoops. It was incredibly complicated, now it's just a question of saying “that's it”. ‘Perhaps we don't put the value on it that we did, I don't know.’ The actress married Mike Leigh in 1973 and split up with him in 1995 when she left him for actor Michael Elwyn.","Only 4 per cent of Britons surveyed strongly agreed that divorce is taboo .

Richard Driscoll roped a string of Hollywood stars into making a B movie using £1.5million fleeced from taxpayers is today facing jail . A film producer who roped a string of Hollywood stars into making a film using £1.5million fleeced from taxpayers is today facing jail. Richard Driscoll, 54, submitted bogus VAT repayment claims to boost funding for horror-comedy Eldorado, which starred Peter O'Toole, Kill Bill actors Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen and the late David Carradine. The scam boosted the budget for the film, along with two other projects, Watchmen Hellgate and Back2Hell, from £1m to £2.5m, Southwark Crown Court heard. The film was written and directed by Driscoll at his film studios in Cornwall, with O'Toole narrating, the court was told. Brigitte Nielsen, Kerry Washington, Jeff Fahey, Steve Guttenberg and Bill Mosley also starred in the movie. The VAT repayment claims were made between January 2009 and September 2011 on the basis of false or imaginary invoices, said prosecutor Dominic Connolly. 'Of the £2.5m actually available to fund the three films, approximately £1.5m came from VAT payments. 'Substantial funds were obtained from . HMRC by making claims for the repayment of VAT based on purported . trading between associated companies that was either non-existent or . grossly inflated.' Driscoll claimed he simply signed the VAT returns but did not prepare them. But . he was caught out through a series of damning emails which exposed his . 'knowledge and participation in the use of false invoices to distort the . VAT position'. A jury of . four women and seven men found Driscoll guilty of conspiracy to be . knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of tax after deliberating . for nearly 27 hours. But . the jury cleared Driscoll and three co-defendants of a second scam to . 'grossly inflate' the costs of Eldorado in order to fradulently obtain a . further £1.7m in tax relief. Driscoll, . together with solicitor Terry Marsh, 45, accounts manager Richard . Pearce, 65, and acting agency director Darren Moore, 42, were accused of . claiming they had spent more than £9million on the film, in a bid to . claw back 25 per cent through the Film Tax Credit scheme. Among the stars roped into the film were Peter O'Toole (left)  and Kill Bill actress Daryl Hannah (right) Michael Madsen (left) and the late David Carradine (right) also starred in the horror-comedy - which is yet to be released . The incentive was introduced by the Government to boost the film industry. They were said to have 'grossly inflated' the project's costs by forging a string of invoices for 'expenses' - including Driscoll's hair transplant surgery. A fifth alleged conspirator, Keith Howell, has since died. All . had denied conspiracy to do acts tending to prejudice Her Majesty the . Queen and the Public Revenue with intent to defraud her Majesty the . Queen. They also denied conspiracy to be knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of tax.

Patients face being charged up to £42-a-week to watch television in hospital while prisoners pay just £1, it emerged today. David Cameron said he was ‘frustrated’ by the situation but admitted the government is powerless to stop health trusts from hitting inpatients with big levies to enjoy TV from their beds. But the Prime Minister faced claims the difference in charges was ‘unjustifiable’ despite a crackdown on perks for inmates. Disparity: Patients in hospital face being charged up to £42-a-week to watch television from their bed, the Commons was told while criminals in jail are charged just £1 . Tory MP Philip Davies told the Commons he was appalled at the high cost of watching beside TV in hospitals. He said: ‘I recently visited my brother in hospital in Doncaster only to find that using the television stationed above his bed would cost him £6 a day.’ He called on Mr Cameron to ‘justify why it costs hospital patients £42 a week to watch the television when it costs prisoners only £1 a week to do so’. The Prime Minister said he had ‘spent a . lot of time in hospitals’ and shared Mr Davie’s ‘frustrations’ about a . situation created by Labour. Mr Cameron added: ‘It was the last Government who introduced these charges on televisions in hospital in the year 2000. ‘I . have spent many an hour battling with that very complicated telephone . and credit card system that people have to try and make work. I am . afraid, though, that these are devolved decisions that local hospitals . can now make for themselves.’ Unjustifiable: Tory MP Philip Davies said the high costs were the result of government departments not communicating . However, Mr Cameron said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is acting to crackdown on excessive perks in prisons. ‘He is taking the unacceptable situation that he inherited from the Labour party, whereby people could take out a Sky subscription when they were in prison, and saying that they cannot do that any more. ‘He is also making sure that prisoners pay if they use the television.’ A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman confirmed prisoners pay  £1 a week to watch television. She added:  ‘That comes at no cost to taxpayers as prisoners pay for it themselves.’ But Mr Davies later told MailOnline that the situation could not be defended. ‘The fact is that anybody – and I suspect the Prime Minister is included – cannot justify the fact that hospital patients pay £42 and prisoners pay £1. ‘When government departments work in isolation you end up with these kind of perverse outcomes. ‘It is why government need to look overall to make sure you don’t end up with this sort of situation.’ The Patients Association has argued that patients should not have the ‘stress of a big bill on top of their bad health’. From the end of next month, 18-rated DVDs will join extreme video games in being banned in all jails. Sky Sports and other subscription channels, which are permitted in private prisons, will be switched off permanently during the summer. In April prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: 'We just don’t think it’s right that prisoners should have access to subscription TV channels. 'We don’t think it’s right because there are plenty of my constituents who struggle to afford those things and they don’t see, and I don’t see, why prisoners should get them.'","Tory MP Philip Davies hits out at costs after visiting brother in hospital .

The ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’ is being crippled as soaring numbers of children are reliant on their parents to buy their first home, the Council of Mortgage Lenders warned yesterday. Millions of parents are ‘unable or unwilling’ to help their children, a crisis being made worse by banks demanding massive deposits, it said. In a hard-hitting report, the CML said the demand for a deposit is a major worry for parents, many of whom simply cannot afford to help out their children. Cash in hand: Millions of parents are 'unable or unwilling' to help their children - a crisis being made worse by banks demanding massive deposits, the CMT warned. A still from the BBC show Bank of Mum & Dad is pictured . The report said: ‘There are material limits to how much parental help can deliver, both in terms of how many parents are in a position where they can offer help and the depth of their pockets.’ In 2006, shortly before the credit crunch struck, 67 per cent of first-time buyers managed to get onto the housing ladder without any financial assistance from their parents. Last year, the number had collapsed to just 36 per cent. In an extraordinary change underway in Britain, this means the majority of young people are reliant on their parents to buy their first home. Many parents can afford to lend a small amount of money, but the record deposits required by banks or building societies to get the cheapest loans means that far more money is needed. The size of the average deposit put down by a first-time buyer has jumped, as the number of ‘unassisted’ first-time buyers has collapsed. In 2006, the average deposit put down by a first-time buyer was 10 per cent. Last year, it was 20 per cent. In London, where the average asking price is £510,000, this is equal to £102,000. The CML said: ‘Many parents, or other . family members or friends, may be unable or unwilling to help at all, or . not able to help as much as would be needed.’ Big purchase: The majority of young people in Britain are reliant on their parents to buy their first home . Its research reveals ‘an increased reliance on the Bank of Mum and Dad’ in recent years, which has also - not coincidentally - gone ‘hand in hand with sharply reduced numbers.’ In 2006, there were 402,800 first-time buyers. Last year, there were just 217,800. Duncan Stott, from the first-time buyer campaign group Priced Out, said: ‘With first-time buyer numbers still far below the levels seen a decade ago, we must seriously question whether house prices are placing too greater burden on young adults.’ 'There are material limits to how much parental help can deliver, both in terms of how many parents are in a position where they can offer help and the depth of their pockets' Council of Mortgage Lenders report . At a conference in London last month, Planning Minister Nick Boles said it is wrong that couples are beginning to feel it is ‘an unrealistic ambition’ to buy a house. He said: ‘We can’t surely believe that it is right that we are saying to two partners who are both working that it is an unrealistic ambition for them to want to be able to own a little house with a bit of garden for when they have a couple of kids. ‘It was a reasonable ambition for most people for most of the last 40 years. So are we really willing to say that we are going to go backwards? Homeownership will become something that only people either on very high salaries or with wealthy parents are able to access. I don’t think we should.’ Around three million parents still have their grown-up children living with them at home, according to a recent report by Saga, the old age experts. The average age of the children, dubbed ‘failed fledglings’, is 27 although some are over the age of 41, with many forced to live at home while they save for a deposit. The Government’s ‘Help to Buy’ scheme is aimed at helping young people to buy, by allowing them to put down a deposit of only five per cent.","Millions of parents 'unable or unwilling' to help their children, CML says .

Campaigners have hit out at Facebook for removing images of women who have undergone mastectomies because they are classified as 'pornography'. Photographs posted online by The SCAR Project, which aims to raise awareness of breast cancer, show women proudly displaying the scars from having invasive surgery on their breasts. But a number of them were removed by the social media giant, which has a policy banning sexually explicit images on the site. The project's founder, photographer . David Jay, was kicked off Facebook for a month over the images, and . called for the site to educate its staff properly to avoid a repeat of . the incident. Controversial: Some of these images were banned from Facebook for their allegedly explicit content . Moving: The images by David Jay feature breast cancer survivors displaying their mastectomy scars . Inspiring: The photographs are intended to remove the stigma currently surrounding breast cancer . For several years, The SCAR Project has been encouraging women to share picture of their mastectomy scars in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding breast cancer. The striking images show women who have had their breasts removed, leaving them with highly visible surgery scars. Last month, Mr Jay added a new set of photographs to the project's Facebook page in the wake of Angelina Jolie's revelation that she had undergone a double mastectomy in an attempt to avoid contracting cancer. However, the social network soon removed many of the images and handed the photographer a 30-day ban for allegedly violating its terms of service. He told NBC News: 'I can't imagine anyone finding anything pornographic or sexualised or even offensive in any way.' Outrage: Campaigners have started a petition urging Facebook to change its policies on pictures like these . Apology: Facebook has now reinstated the images and vowed to clarify its photography policies . Defiant: Many breast cancer sufferers derive strength from the bravery of those featured in the images . In response, one breast cancer patient started a petition on Change.org in an attempt to persuade Facebook to clarify its policy on photographs of mastectomies. She wrote: 'They document the physical and emotional toll of women and men who have undergone mastectomies. 'They raise awareness of the disease and reinforce the need for early intervention and research toward a cure.' A Facebook spokesman has apologised for censoring the image, saying that the site has 'long allowed mastectomy photos to be shared on Facebook, as well as educational and scientific photos of the human body and photos of women breastfeeding'. Project: David Jay began the series years ago but was recently inspired by Angelina Jolie's courage . Policy: Facebook insists it is a supporter of the campaign and will work with photographers in the future . Mr Jay spoke to representatives of the company yesterday in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the incident. 'They've had a policy in place allowing mastectomy photos, and they made it clear during our conference call that obviously mistakes had been made,' he told NBC. 'I think it's not lost on Facebook how important this issue is to so many people, and perhaps they'll spend some time internally educating their staff about the types of images The SCAR Project has.' Facebook's official policy on pictures of nudity currently reads: 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. 'We aspire to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.'","Images from The SCAR Project banned from Facebook for 'explicit content'

One of the men accused of killing Lee Rigby said today: ‘I'm a man, I'm a soldier, I'm a British citizen.’ Michael Adebolajo, 28, of Romford, Essex, interrupted proceedings at the Old Bailey on several occasions during a bail hearing, telling judge Mr Justice Sweeney via videolink: ‘It's not about you.’ Adebolajo, whose left arm was in a plaster cast after allegedly murdering the soldier in Woolwich, south-east London, on May 22, added: ‘This whole trial is about more than that. It's not about me.’ 'I'm a soldier': Michael Adebolajo (pictured on Monday at Westminster Magistrates' Court), 28, of Romford, Essex, interrupted proceedings at the Old Bailey on several occasions during a bail hearing . He went on: ‘Really and truly it's about the good, honest, decent, hardworking British members of society, whether they be Muslim or non-Muslim. They are the ones that have suffered the most.’ Adebolajo added: ‘It's possible throughout life that people may sometimes smother you and say things about you that are false. But as a regular citizen and human being, we have to get over it. ‘I believe that the British people are decent. From my experience growing up in my country, only a fraction will wish to slander and lie against me. But the rest would prefer to know the truth.’ Adebolajo is also accused of the attempted murder of two police officers and possession of a firearm - a 9.4mm KNIL model 91 revolver - with intent to cause others to believe violence would be used. Death: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was killed on May 22 in Woolwich, south-east London . He was reprimanded by the judge for . interrupting several times and eventually the videolink was switched . off. The defendant was listed as Mujaahid Abu Hamza AKA Adebolajo by the . court. Adebolajo had asked to be referred to by the name when he appeared before magistrates on Monday, and was addressed as Mr Hamza today. He was charged with the four counts on Saturday, after being discharged from hospital on Friday having spent just over a week there being treated for his injuries after being shot by police. The court heard Adebolajo had been seen by psychiatrists three times while in hospital and at least twice since he had been discharged and in custody, and had been declared fit for interview in all. While this was discussed the defendant interjected with: ‘I'm not familiar with this legal jargon. I'm a soldier, not a lawyer.’ The start of the hearing had been delayed after Adebolajo complained about having to be handcuffed in the video-link room at Belmarsh Prison. He was eventually allowed to have them removed on the understanding that two prison officers sat beside him during the hearing. Wearing a burgundy top with a pink jumper that was only over one arm due to his cast, Adebolajo also complained that his privacy had been violated. Hearing: The defendant was listed as Mujaahid Abu Hamza AKA Adebolajo by the Old Bailey (pictured) He claimed he had been made to have his genitals examined twice ahead of his appearance on Wednesday. ‘I'm a man, I'm a soldier, I'm a British citizen,’ he said. ‘And you can't see my privates.’ Describing the prison officer who had asked to examine him as a ‘jobsworth’, he added that after the experience: ‘I cried like a baby, you know, into my sleeve.’ He said he had let him look at him as he had said ‘please’ when he asked, adding that he appreciated his politeness. 'I'm a man, I'm a soldier, I'm a British citizen' Michael Adebolajo . The packed courtroom listened as he likened the situation to when someone says ‘please’ when they ask to get past him when shopping for margarine in a supermarket. ‘It could be Flora or Utterly Butterly, you find it hard not to move,’ he said. When reprimanded by the judge for interrupting, the defendant said: ‘Stop trying to stifle the truth. Wouldn't want the truth to get out, would we? Wouldn't want that.’ But he later praised Mr Justice Sweeney after he let him have his handcuffs removed, saying ‘May Allah bless you’ three times. ‘That man who is wearing the white wig and the red robe. May Allah bless that man because he has had the courage to do something that many wouldn't have had the courage to do so.’ Adebolajo will appear at the court alongside co-defendant Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, for a preliminary hearing on June 28.

Parents are too obsessed by their children doing brilliantly in exams and are over-looking the importance of them getting a job, according to the Government-backed Women’s Business Council. When they are young, it is also extremely useful for a child to get a part-time job, such as working in a local shop on a Saturday, it said. Sue O’Brien, from the Women’s Business Council, who is also chief executive of the recruitment company Norman Broadbent, said there has been a ‘huge change’ over the last decade. Obsession: The Women's Business Council said a generation of children were leaving school with little or no real experience of the workplace . It used to be commonplace for children to do part-time jobs while they were at school, but this trend has now been overtaken by many parents’ obsession with academic excellence. As a result, a generation of children are leaving school or university with little or no real experience of the workplace, which leaves them totally unprepared for working life. Mrs O’Brien said parents should think twice before pressurising their children to achieve top grades to the exclusion of anything else. She said: ‘I think it is the pressure that we are putting children under to excel and exceed in academic life. ‘It means that they then don’t get the practical work experience of: ""This is what it is going to be like to find a job when I leave school"".' Saturday job: A spokeswoman for the council said part-time work helped to teach children how to multi-task and boosted their employability . She added: ‘There are an awful lot of . graduates leaving university at the moment who literally have got no . work experience at all. It is a huge deficit.’ She . raised fears some schools are discouraging pupils from getting a . part-time job because they worry it will disrupt their academic studies . and consequently hit the school’s performance in league tables. Mrs . O’Brien said: ‘I think they [schools] can often advise children: ""Don’t . get a Saturday job. Focus on your education"", particularly because they . want to improve their performance on tables. ‘You need to have employable young people leaving our education system. That is not just about their academic ability.’ Her own career was shaped by getting a job at the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s when she was a 16-year-old school girl. Warnings: Maria Miller recently emphasised the importance of flexible working opportunities for women with young children . She worked every Thursday night from 5pm-8pm and for seven hours every Saturday, and went onto to work for Sainsbury’s for 12 years rising rapidly up the career ladder. But too many modern parents want their children ‘to focus purely on the academic route’, she said, which does not help their long-term job prospects. By getting a job while they are a school, it helps children to learn the crucial skill of ‘multi-tasking’, such as finishing their homework, revising for exams and holding down a job. The warning comes as Maria Miller, the Women’s Minister, said women’s career opportunities are being hurt by ‘a workplace designed by men for men.’ She said working flexibly is absolutely crucial for a woman to be able to succeed, particularly when her children are young. Mrs Miller, who has three children, said: ‘The evidence is clear. Speaking as an employer myself I know that if you can offer employees that flexibility, you can keep the best for longer.’ She said it is wrong that so many women’s careers ‘stall at the nursery gate’, and that they ‘simply disappear off the radar when it comes to more senior executive positions.’ Mrs Miller pointed out that this year is the 100th anniversary of the death of Emily Davison, the suffragette who died after stepping in front of the King’s horse at the Epsom derby. She said it was ‘remarkable’ that women in the workplace ‘remains an issue’, adding: ‘You would have thought we would have dealt with that by now, but we haven’t.’ One of Britain’s top female bosses, Ruby McGregor-Smith, chairman of the Women’s Business Council, urged working mothers to share their experiences with one another. The mother-of-two who is chief executive of the outsourcing giant Mitie said: ‘Actually saying: do you know it is really tough. It is OK for it to be tough. ‘We are not expecting everyone to find sleepless nights and board meetings the next day an easy option.’ Laura Perrins, from the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter and a full-time mother of two young children, said: ‘I couldn’t agree more that the macho culture at the heart of many companies needs to be changed. ‘Women who are in work shouldn’t face discrimination on account of their sex.’","Said too many children leaving school with no experience of the workplace .

Sex pest policeman: PC Christopher Robb, 30, started messaging the 19-year-old hours after she had given him a statement . A married police officer sent sleazy texts to a teenage girl hours after she had given him a statement about an alleged case of vandalism. When the 19-year-old rejected Constable Christopher Robb's advances, he later sent her a message saying: 'You're missing out on the ride of your life.' Robb, 30, who was stationed in Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, admitted sending a string of messages begging the young woman for sex. He was fined at Falkirk Sheriff Court and now faces being sacked from his job with Police Scotland. The court was told that Robb started pestering the victim via text just hours after he took the statement from her. The first message he sent said: 'Hey gorgeous, how's you? You're so sexy, by the way.' Four others followed the next day. They included: 'You horny?' And on the next day he texted: 'You sound hot.' Graham McLachlan, prosecuting, told . the court that Robb was a serving officer with the former Central . Scotland Police force, now part of Police Scotland. The depute fiscal said: 'He had to attend at the home of a witness to make inquiries about an allegation of vandalism. 'He took a statement from the witness and got access to her personal detail including her mobile telephone number.' Mr McLachlan said when the young woman made it clear she wasn't interested, Robb texted her: 'Oh well. It's your loss.' This was followed by: 'You're missing out on the ride of your life.' This caused some people in the packed . public benches to burst out laughing. Mr McLachlan said the matter was . 'brought to the attention of police.' Robb, of Dunfermline, Fife, admitted sending messages which were grossly offensive in February last year but denied a further charge of illegally accessing the police computer. His not guilty plea to this second charge was accepted by the prosecution. Facing the sack: PC Robb, who was based at Grangemouth Police Station (pictured), now faces being axed from his job after admitting the offence . Defence solicitor David Hunter said . Robb, who has not committed an offence before, had been suspended from . the force for over a year. He said the texts had been sent when the officer 'was having problems at home, and was at a low ebb.' He said Robb's marriage had suffered through his behaviour, which, he said, had been a 'one-off'. Mr Hunter added: 'Matters have progressed and the couple are reconciled now.' He said the officer was 'most . apologetic to the complainer' and was now likely to lose his job, where . he earned £1,200 after tax each month. Sheriff John Mundy told Robb: 'Clearly this is a gross breach of trust and a significant failure by you in your duty.' He fined Robb £1,000, reduced from £1,200 for pleading guilty and saving witnesses the ordeal of a trial. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland's Forth Valley Division said: 'We are aware of the outcome of this case and the matter will now be subject to an internal misconduct process.'

A former Coronation Street actor accused of sexually abusing a child 'dabbled with homosexuality' but never had sexual relations with minors, a court heard today. Andrew Lancel, 42, was charged last November with six counts of indecent assault of a child under the age of 16. The charges relate to one male victim and the offending allegedly took place between 1993 and 1994 when he was aged 14 and 15. The actor, from Gateacre in Liverpool, is best known for his role as Frank Foster in the ITV soap. Andrew Lancel leaves court with his wife, after denying the allegations made about him . Lancel, charged under his real name Andrew Watkinson,  has pleaded not guilty and is on trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Today the jury heard extracts from Lancel's police interviews in which he denied any wrongdoing. Lancel, who is married with a son, told police he was heterosexual but said he had had 'experiences other than with a female' when he was younger. He told police that it was when he was 'drunk at parties, sitting around. It was a bit of show-and-tell, you know'. The court heard that the actor told police: 'I got my c*** out, for want of a better word, on many many occasions. Maybe I shouldn’t have.' He said: 'I have been around for a long time, you know. I’m 42 so I’m not going to lie and say I haven’t dabbled.' The actor, from Gateacre in Liverpool, is best known for his role as Frank Foster in the ITV soap . But he went on to tell police that he has a wife and he is not gay. He said: 'It's nothing. I’ve not broken any laws. I have been to parties, heavy parties. 'I’ve not broken any laws...I've never had a relationship with a man. 'I've never had sexual intercourse with a man and if I had I would tell you.' Police asked if he had ever masturbated a man and the actor said: 'Nothing with minors or children.' Asked about oral sex, he replied: 'I can categorically say I have not had oral sex with a man or masturbated with minors or a child...It’s just like, you know, nothing like that.' The actor said he remembered meeting the complainant in Southport and said he became good friends with his accuser, who was part of a 'gang of friends'. Lancel said that when his accuser was older and began studying and working in London he stayed at the flats he rented on numerous occasions. But the defendant said he has not seen a great deal of him 'over the last couple of years'. He told police he was 'very proud of what (the complainant) has achieved through his career and admits he takes credit for discovering him.' The actor said his mother's house in Southport - where the sexual abuse is alleged to have begun - was a 'party pad that lots of people visited.' He said he was 'probably aware' of the complainant at the time in 1993/1994 but that he 'did not actually know him' and that he was probably away from Southport in 1993 working in Scotland. He said: 'My memory of (him) at the age of 14 is not strong. My memory of knowing him as a young man in London is very strong.' 'I don’t deny I definitely knew him. I knew lots of people. He added: 'I’m not denying I knew him. I am denying what he is saying.' Lancel, charged under his real name Andrew Watkinson, has pleaded not guilty and is on trial at Liverpool Crown Court . The prosecution claim the defendant used his 'status' as an actor to flatter and gain the trust of the boy, whom he knew was under the age of consent. But in his police interviews Lancel denied that any inappropriate sexual activity took place. He told the police that his accuser owed him money after he failed to pay him rent on the last occasion he let him stay at his London flat. But he said he was a 'forgiving Christian' and that he was 'very fond' of him. Police asked Lancel about text messages he received from his accuser which called him 'vile' and said he 'didn’t deserve what he had' and that what he had done was 'massively illegal'. Lancel said: 'I remember thinking what’s that all about?' He told police that he thought the man might be 'jealous' or 'p***** off' thinking that Lancel had told people that he owed him money or that it could have something to do with his 'profile'. It was around the time that his Coronation Street character Frank Foster was about to be killed off. He said: 'I was on the cover of every magazine. I’m not bragging. That’s what was happening.” Referring to the texts he said: 'I just remember thinking what the f*** is that? I remember thinking s*** I hope he is all right. 'I remember thinking, is this to do with my job?' Lancel told police that at first he was not sure if the texts were genuine and that they may have come from someone else. 'I thought it might not be him. He might have been set up or something. 'I thought it might be drugs. I thought it might be something like that.' Lancel said that his accuser had never brought the allegations up with him in all the years they were 'mates'. The jury was sent home for the day and the trial will resume tomorrow at 10am when it is thought Lancel will give evidence. The trial continues.

Fraudster: Lee Tyers was jailed for two weeks by Teesside magistrates after planting his own pubic hair to avoid paying a restaurant bill . A fraudster has been jailed after planting his own pubic hair in a restaurant meal to try and getaway with not paying. Lee Tyers, 40, ate his entire curry dinner before telling staff he found a hair in his food and wouldn't pay the £39.55 bill. But staff at Jamal's Indian restaurant in Middlesbrough knew Tyers was lying and caught him on CCTV putting his hand down his trousers before he made the false claim. Tyers denied the charge of fraud by false representation but was found guilty by Teesside magistrates and jailed for two weeks. Eatery owner Jamal Chowdhury told the court that Tyers had been a customer for around 18 years and already owed him £110 for previous unpaid meals. But Mr Chowdhury told Tyers he would ignore the debt so long as he paid for that evening's meal. Tyers assured the owner he had the cash to pay, before he and a friend ordered two lamb bhunas plus pilau rice, naan bread, drinks, a chapati and a shish . kebab. The pair ate their meals - then Tyers called over a waiter to complain about the hair in his food. After some discussion, the pair left the restaurant without paying. Mr Chowdhury said: 'I told him all the staff have black hair and this is brown - it's not our hair. 'I told him if you pay for the meal now I will look at the CCTV video and if I find there's something wrong I will pay him back. 'I told him ""If you don't pay, I'll call the police"". I said ""You're trying to ruin my business"".' Evidence: Staff at Jamal's restaurant in Middlesbrough, where Tyers already owed £110 in unpaid food bills, caught the defendant putting his hands down his trousers at the table . Speaking to the court as a witness in his own defence, Tyers, from Yarm, claimed his friend was the one paying the bill that night, and that Mr Chowdhury would not accept the payment and was insisting on the full amount owed from Tyers' previous visits. He denied the incident over the hair took place. Tyers' friend, also giving evidence to the court, backed up his claim, saying he 'tried to pay three times' but it was declined. He said: 'He (Mr Chowdhury) said he wanted a-hundred-and-something pounds, and I said ""that's nowt to do with me"".' Alex Bousfield, defending, said there was no physical evidence of the hair as the plate was not kept for police. Following his arrest two days after the incident, Tyers answered all the questions put to him by police with 'no response'. Prosecutor David Ward said Mr Chowdhury was a 'nice man' whose good nature had been taken advantage of. He added: 'If Mr Chowdhury was offered £39.55, why wouldn't he take it? There's nothing on the CCTV that shows anybody trying to pay.' Tyers was sentenced to two weeks' in jail and was ordered to pay £39.55 compensation.","Lee Tyers claimed he found hair during meal at Jamal's Indian restaurant .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 13:51 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:51 EST, 5 June 2013 . A bankrupt businessman shot a solicitor dead after blaming him for the break-up of his relationship and the repossession of his home, a court heard today. Michael Chudley, 63, calmly walked into the office of James Ward, 58, in July last year and shot him in the head once with a sawn-off shotgun. Mr Ward, a father of three who ran MGW Law in Devizes, Wiltshire, suffered catastrophic head injuries and died almost three weeks later in hospital, Salisbury Crown Court heard. Michael Chudley (left) is accused of shooting James Ward (right) after allegedly blaming him for the repossession of his home and the break-up of his relationship . Chudley, of no fixed address and formerly of Rowde, near Devizes, denies charges of murder, possession of a sawn-off shotgun with intent, possession of a firearm with intent to provoke fear of violence and making a threat to kill. However, he has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - a plea not accepted by the prosecution. William Mousley QC, prosecuting, told the jury that in order for Chudley to kill Mr Ward, he had to threaten to shoot the law firm's receptionist Daphne Courtney, who worked on the ground floor, if she did not take him to Mr Ward's first floor office. 'She had really no way of stopping him carrying out his deadly act,' he said. 'When Michael Chudley was arrested 30 minutes later by police he told them ""I shot him because he made our lives a misery"". Michael Chudley has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - a plea not accepted by the prosecution . 'When he was subsequently interviewed he made no comment but in a written statement after he was charged he admitted shooting James Ward claiming that he didn’t intend to kill and was - to use his words - on autopilot. 'He said he had planned the shooting and having decided to shoot Mr Ward he would kill himself but gave up on that idea.' The court heard that Chudley was arrested at his former home, Kingfisher House in Rowde, by armed police officers. The house, which Chudley shared with his partner Francine Whale, had been repossessed. Chudley, who ran a firm called Kingfisher Builders with Ms Whale, had also split from her the previous April and was either renting rooms in local pubs or sleeping in his Ford Fiesta car. Mr Mousley went on to explain that Chudley held Mr Ward responsible for his recent business difficulties and the ending of his relationship. The solicitor had been instructed in 2009 by a man called Christopher Sear over a building dispute he had with Michael Chudley,' Mr Mousley said. There was a protracted court case and Chudley had unsuccessfully sued Mr Sear, who in return had successfully sued Michael Chudley.' Mr Mousley said that in June last year the respective parties had been informed that a court date had been fixed for July 23 to discuss legal costs. 'There is evidence of a number of sources to show that Michael Chudley blamed James Ward for the outcome of the proceedings,' the prosecutor said. 'He had made threats to him, including threats to kill during 2012.' The prosecution said: 'Notes found at the Royal Oak (one of the pubs where Chudley was renting a room) make reference to James Ward and there having been a conspiracy against Michael Chudley. 'Michael Chudley also blamed James Ward for the house being repossessed and for the separation from Francine Whale.' Mr Mousley said Chudley told people in the Royal Oak they would not see him again. The gunman 'had to threaten to shoot the law firm's receptionist Daphne Courtney, who worked on the ground floor, if she did not take him to Mr Ward's first floor office', the court heard . The court heard that on the day of the killing, Chudley parked outside MGW Law and after threatening receptionist Daphne Courtney, was taken to Mr Ward and shot him once. Mr Mousley said Mr Ward's wife, Nicola Morris, a partner in MGW Law, ran outside to raise the alarm. The court heard that the force of the shotgun blast at Mr Ward - who at this point had stood up from his chair - blew out a window of his first floor office. 'Michael Chudley was seen to come out of the building, walk to his car, apparently calmly, carrying the shotgun, and to drive away, apparently normally,' Mr Mousley said. Witnesses described seeing Mr Ward lying on the floor behind his desk with a massive head injury. The victim was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol and placed in a medically induced coma, but deteriorated and died on July 22. After the shooting, Chudley drove to his former home in the village of Rowde. Two workmen at the house saw him carrying the sawn-off shotgun and thought he appeared 'on edge' and 'confused'. They locked themselves inside the house and called police. Before the police arrived, Chudley called his ex-partner. The court heard that the force of the shotgun blast at Mr Ward - who at this point had stood up from his chair - blew out a window of his first floor office . 'He called her on his phone and he said to her, ""I’ve shot Ward and it’s all your fault"",' Mr Mousley told jurors. When officers arrived, Chudley told them: 'I shot him because he made our lives a misery.' Mr Mousley said: 'He also told the officers he had acquired the gun 15 years earlier from a builder and had been a champion shot.' On the way to Melksham police station, Chudley asked: 'Which jail will I go to, Oxford?' He also told police he had written to newspapers and then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke. 'He asked how the officers had found him so quickly and if the car was bugged,' Mr Mousley said. Later, Chudley told police: 'That’s what this is about. This solicitor strung this court case out for four years and we can’t pay the mortgage. 'I shall never see the light again - attempted murder, unlicensed shotgun - and to be honest I don’t want to.' After Chudley was charged on July 4 with attempted murder, he told police that he blamed Mr Ward for making him bankrupt and for 'dishonestly' conducting the court case against him. Mr Mousley explained that a psychiatrist instructed by the defence would give evidence to say that Chudley was suffering from a personality disorder that affected his mind at the time Mr Ward died and therefore was guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. 'However, another psychiatrist, Dr John Sandford, has provided a second opinion which contradicts that,' Mr Mousley said. 'He agrees Mr Chudley has a personality disorder but this was not of a type that would prevent him from understanding what he was doing or from acting in a rational way or from exercising self-control.' When officers arrived to arrest him, Chudley told them: 'I shot him because he made our lives a misery.' Mr Mousley added: 'At the time of the shooting his actions were planned, premeditated and he continued to act in such a way after the shooting - even explaining to officers why he shot James Ward. 'It is Dr Sandford’s opinion that this killing was simply revenge, rooted in anger and resentment and not as a result of mental illness or malfunction, so there is no lesser responsibility for this killing. 'The prosecution say that on July 2 both before and after the shooting he knew exactly what he was doing. 'The prosecution case is that this is a clear and obvious case of murder and nothing else.' Giving evidence, Mr Ward’s wife told jurors that she first became aware of Chudley in the office when she heard a voice saying: 'Anyone uses the phone, I’ll shoot.' Ms Morris said she came out of her office and walked into reception, telling jurors: 'It just shook me instantly. It was said in a way that drew my attention - that sucked me in. 'I just knew who it was. It all happened quite fast and he seemed very purposeful.' Ms Morris said that she went outside to raise the alarm, hoping Chudley had not noticed. 'I heard the shot and I heard the breaking of the Georgian glass and pieces cascading down to the right side of me,' she said. She said Chudley walked out of the office holding the sawn-off shotgun. Ms Morris said she went up to her husband’s office and shouted out of a window for help, which drew the attention of the off-duty paramedic. She added that her husband had told her of problems with Chudley in the past, including calling him 'Mr Ward' in court, in what she described as a 'threatening' way. The trial, before Mr Justice Bean, was adjourned until tomorrow.

Police have paid an undisclosed out-of-court settlement to a mother who was arrested on suspicion of murder after her three-year-old son died of natural causes. Abby Podmore, from Quinton, Birmingham, was held in police custody overnight in February 2011 by officers investigating the death of Alfie Podmore. Ms Podmore, a dental nurse, has already received a five-figure out-of-court settlement from Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust after it admitted failings in medical care prior to her son's death. Police have paid Abby Podmore an undisclosed out-of-court settlement after she was arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of her three-year-old son Alfie, who died of natural causes . An inquest held in September 2011 heard the toddler died of a chest infection after being misdiagnosed by hospital staff. In a statement issued today by law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represented Ms Podmore, she expressed relief that legal proceedings against the hospital and police had been concluded. She said: 'Alfie was adored by his family and everyone whose lives he touched during his short time with us and he will never be forgotten. 'I'm just relieved the legal battles with both the NHS Trust and police are now over as we can finally look to begin rebuilding our lives.' An inquest held in September 2011 heard that Alfie died of a chest infection after being misdiagnosed by hospital staff . Tom Riis-Bristow, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell's Birmingham office, who led the legal action, said: 'The consequences of losing Alfie so suddenly and in such tragic circumstances have had a long-lasting psychological effect on Abby. 'The out-of-court settlements will be used to help fund the ongoing psychiatric care she needs and will also provide the couple with funds to help them move house, as their present home has so many painful memories which they have understandably found extremely hard to deal with. 'Following our investigations, the hospital has assured Abby that the internal investigation carried out after Alfie's death has led to important lessons being learnt and a number of changes to procedures have since been made which will hopefully mean that no other family has to suffer the same heartbreak.' In a statement to Alfie's inquest, Ms Podmore described her arrest as a 'horrifying' event which had robbed her of the chance to grieve. The inquest heard that antibiotics may have saved Alfie, but he was instead given antacid medication and died at his home on February 6, 2011. West Midlands Police made the payment to Ms Podmore without admitting any wrongdoing on behalf of the force. Chief Inspector Garry Billing, from Birmingham Police's Child Protection Unit, said: 'A payment has been made to Abby Podmore; she's accepted it is a full and final settlement and without any admission from West Midlands Police. 'Ms Podmore was arrested following her son's death as it was deemed in the best interest of the investigation at that stage; she's since recognised that police were acting on information available to them at the time and needed to fully investigate matters. 'It became apparent, however, the case should not be treated as a murder inquiry and she was quickly dismissed as a suspect. 'This is a truly tragic case and no amount of money can ever compensate for the death of a child.'

Melbourne-based The Janoskians have faced widespread criticism over the video which features members of the group masturbating in public and shows one member telling a six-week-old child's mother that her 'baby is sexy'. Among those to criticise the controversial video is Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas who took to Twitter today to condemn the group as 'school bullies'. Controversial: The Janoskians, pictured arriving at Heathrow Airport earlier this year, have been criticised for their 'repulsive new video prank . Bad taste: The prank sees the group pretending to masturbate in public with one scene featuring one member of the group telling a mother that her six month old baby is 'sexy' He posted: 'The social purpose of comedy, as well as being entertainment, is to push the envelope and test boundaries. 'When an established act like me publicly criticises a new act, it can look like sour grapes. But I don't care. I think someone needs to say something.' He added: 'Am I too old to ""get it""?

Dzhokhar's voice is calm and quiet as he tells his mother that he has 'plenty of money', claiming  supporters opened a bank account in his name and deposited $1,000. The bombing suspect's mother played a recording of the telephone conversation with her teenage son to Channel Four News. In the clip, she tearfully asks if he is in pain, to which he responds: 'No of course not. I'm already eating and have been for a long time.' Zubeidat Tsarnaeva then tells her son that 'we all love you, Muslims and non-Muslims love you'. She later claimed that Dzhokhar told her on the phone that one supporter had opened a bank account for him where $1,000 had been deposited. Tsarnaev, 19, is accused of carrying out the attack in Boston almost two months ago and has been charged in federal court with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.

A 'free Dzhokhar' website has also been set up which draws support from around the world. Elder brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded. Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects' father, said last week that he believed his sons to be innocent and that the justice system had failed. He told the AP: 'All I can do is pray to God and hope that one day fairness will win out, our children will be cleared, and we will at least get Dzhokhar back, crippled, but at least alive.'

Victim: A murder investigation has been launched after a mother, believed to be Krishnamaya Mabo (above), was strangled and dumped in a field in Arborfield, near Reading, on Sunday . A soldier's wife was ambushed, dragged into a field and murdered by a stranger as she walked down a country lane just 500 yards from her home, it emerged today. The 39-year-old's body was found lying next to a copse at the edge of a field after apparently being choked to death. It is thought she could have been dead for up to 18 hours before she was discovered. The victim, believed to be Nepalese national Krishnamaya Mabo, lived in Army married quarters on a garrison estate in Arborfield a quarter of a mile away. A letter issued by Garrison Commander . Colonel Ian Gibson warned residents not to 'venture out alone, . especially at night' in the wake of the killing. Sources believe Krishnamaya was attacked by a stranger as she made the most of the sunny weather at around 6pm on Sunday evening. Her killer is thought to have followed her up a country lane and pounced when they were out of sight of passing traffic and walkers. Today, detectives were continuing to question a 30-year-old man on suspicion of her murder after he was arrested in Reading, around three miles from the scene of the attack. Magistrates this afternoon granted investigators a further 36 hours to keep him in custody. Police were called in to help search for Krishnamaya after she was reporting missing from her family's terraced home in Arborfield Garrison in the early hours of Monday morning. A police helicopter and uniformed officers initially failed to find any trace of her. But during a renewed search on Monday afternoon, a police officer stumbled across the body in a field as he walked up the country lane. A spokesman for the MOD said Krishnamaya's husband was serving with the Military Provost Guard Service (MpGS). He said: 'It is with deep sadness that the community of Arborfield Garrison learned of the tragic loss of Krishnamaya Mabo, the wife of a Ministry of Defence employee serving within the garrison.'Naturally our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends at this difficult time.' Investigation: Police examine the scene where the body was found in a field near a country lane .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:10 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:56 EST, 3 June 2013 . The Supreme Court has ruled that police can collect DNA from anyone they arrest, equating a DNA cheek swab to common jailhouse procedures like take fingerprints and mug shots. Civil liberties groups condemned Monday's decision - saying it amounts to creating a 'gaping new exception to the Fourth Amendment' by allowing authorities to collect a person's DNA and add it to national criminal databases without a warrant - no matter whether they are convicted or not. The split 5-4 decision saw conservative Justice Antonin Scalia join three liberal colleagues, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in opposing the ruling. Collected: The Supreme Court ruling paves the way for allowing states to collect DNA evidence from anyone arrested by police . Should police be allowed to keep DNA collected from anyone they arrest on national database – even if they are not convicted of a crime? 'Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be . taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, . rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason,' Scalia said in a sharp dissent, which he read aloud in the . courtroom. 'This will solve some extra crimes, to be sure. But so would . taking your DNA when you fly on an airplane - surely the TSA must know . the 'identity' of the flying public. For that matter, so would taking . your children's DNA when they start public school.' The five justices who ruled in favor of allowing routine DNA collection said it was similar to practices already allowed under the Fourth Amendment - which protects against unreasonable searches and seizure of property. 'Taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,' Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court's five-justice majority. According to court documents, the FBI's Combined DNA Index System or . CODIS - a coordinated system of federal, state and local databases of . DNA profiles - already contains more than 10 million criminal profiles . and 1.1 million profiles of those arrested. Anger: Justice Antonin Scalia issued a sharp dissent to the court's majority opinion - claiming that the benefits of DNA collection for arrestees do not outweigh to violations of privacy . According to the FBI, DNA from people who have gotten the charge . dismissed, who were acquitted or from whom no charges were brought are . supposed to be expunged from the federal system. But states and other . municipalities that collect DNA make their own rules about what happens . to their collection. The case centers around Alonzo King Jr, who was arrested in 2009 in Wicomico County, Maryland, on assault charges. When he was booked into jail - before his trial - deputies took a DNA sample with a cheek swab. 'Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.' Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting from the majority ruling . The DNA matched evidence from a brutal 2003 rape and robbery of a 53-year-old woman. That evidence was then used to convict him of the six-year-old crime. He was sentenced to life in prison. Twenty-eight states and the federal government now take DNA swabs after arrests. But a Maryland court was one of the first to say that it was illegal for that state to take King's DNA without approval from a judge, saying King had 'a sufficiently weighty and reasonable expectation of privacy against warrantless, suspicionless searches' under the Fourth Amendment. But the high court's decision reverses that ruling and reinstates King's rape conviction, which was overturned by the Maryland court. Kennedy wrote the decision, and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer. The American Civil Liberties Union represented King at trial and condemned the court's decision. 'The Fourth Amendment has long been understood to mean that the police cannot search for evidence of a crime - and all nine justices agreed that DNA testing is a search - without individualized suspicion,' said Steven R. Shapiro, the group's legal director. 'Today's decision eliminates that crucial safeguard. At the same time, it's important to recognize that other state laws on DNA testing are even broader than Maryland's and may present issues that were not resolved by today's ruling.' Rapist: The Supreme Court decision today upheld the conviction of Alonzo King Jr., who was convicted of a six-year-old violent rape after DNA was collected from him at his arrest on unrelated charges . Maryland's DNA collection law only allows police to take DNA from those arrested for serious crimes like murder, rape, assault, burglary and other crimes of violence. In his ruling, Kennedy did not say whether the court's decision limits DNA only to those crimes, but he did note that other states' DNA collection laws differ from Maryland's. Scalia saw that as a flaw. 'If you believe that a DNA search will identify someone arrested for bank robbery, you must believe that it will identify someone arrested for running a red light,' he said. The ruling was praised by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. 'DNA has already aided nearly 200,000 investigations, and thanks to today's decision it will continue to be a detective's most valuable tool in solving rape cases,' said Scott Berkowitz, the group's president and founder. 'We're very pleased that the court recognized the importance of DNA and decided that, like fingerprints, it can be collected from arrestees without violating any privacy rights. 'Out of every 100 rapes in this country, only three rapists will spend a day behind bars. To make matters worse, rapists tend to be serial criminals, so every one left on the streets is likely to commit still more attacks. DNA is a tool we could not afford to lose.' Getting DNA swabs from criminals is common. All 50 states and the federal government take cheek swabs from convicted criminals to check against federal and state databanks, with the court's blessing. The fight at the Supreme Court was over whether that DNA collection could come before conviction and without a judge issuing a warrant.","Justice Antonin Scalia joined liberal colleagues, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in opposing the ruling .

A judge lambasted a mother yesterday after her two youngest sons joined their eldest brother in being jailed for murder. Linda Doran was in the dock with her children, Connor, 17, and Brandon, 14, because she had given the pair a false alibi to shield them from detectives. The teenagers had kicked Kevin Bennett to death for a dare as the 53-year-old father of one slept rough. Scroll down for CCTV . Baby-faced killers: Brandon Doran, 14, (left) who acted as lookout as his brother Connor, 17, (right) and their friend Simon Evans, 14, kicked the homeless man to death . In October, Doran’s eldest son, Ryan, . 23, was given 15 years for the murder of a stranger. And, back in 2009, . her other boy, Jordan, 21, was charged with manslaughter in an arson . case that failed to reach court. Passing sentence at Liverpool Crown . Court yesterday, Judge Clement Goldstone QC told Doran: ‘You are a . pathetic and tragic character. ‘You have just seen your two youngest . sons sent to detention for a murder which within hours you knew they had . committed. You have another son who is serving life for murder. ‘There are not many parents who have . that sort of personal agony to bear, but then again there are not that . many mothers who have shown themselves to be either so unwilling or . unable to shoulder the responsibility of motherhood as you have. ‘There cannot be many mothers, three of whose sons are serving life sentences for murder.’ The QC jailed Doran for 30 months and jailed her two sons and their accomplice, Simon Evans, 14, for a total of 26 years. Attacker: Simon Evans, 14, who beat the homeless man for a dare . The judge, who is the Recorder of . Liverpool, said Doran, who also has a daughter, bore a heavy . responsibility for the total lack of parental guidance afforded to her . sons and her conduct contrasted with that of Evans’s mother, who gave . evidence against her son. ‘Your code of honour was to protect . your boys in their hour of need at any price, particularly if that price . was honesty and decency,’ the judge added. ‘You behaved how you did . despite the serious nature of the charge your sons faced and persisted . in attempts to give them a false alibi for two months. ‘Not even a mother is entitled to lie with impunity to save her sons who she knows to have been involved in a terrible crime.’ He said the boys were flourishing away . from her influence. No father is recorded on any of the brothers’ birth . certificates and Doran, who was 19 when her first child was born, . struggled to control them. By their teens, Ryan and Jordan were members . of a gang and Connor and Brandon, who have learning difficulties, grew . up believing drug taking, violence, clashes with the police and court . appearances were normal.

One official charged with trying to curb their behaviour said Ryan’s . murder conviction ‘lit the touch paper for the rest of them’ and their . crimes escalated. ‘It was almost like “our kid has done . it, so we’re going to do it as well”,’ the source said. ‘It was the . degradation of the value of human life within the Doran family.’ The Doran brothers and Evans, all of Liverpool, denied murder but were convicted following a four-week trial in February. They had been roaming the streets . looking for trouble when they set upon Mr Bennett in the early hours of . August 17 last year. Connor goaded Evans into attacking Mr Bennett, . saying: ‘I bet you haven’t got it in you to do him in.’ Their victim, a former union official, . had turned to alcohol following the death of his father and his . drinking had led to marriage break-up and homelessness.

While Brandon acted as look-out, Evans . and Connor carried out a ‘savage and sustained attack’. Connor even . climbed on to a storage cage to get ‘leverage’ for jumping up and down . on his victim’s chest. Victim: Kevin Bennett, 53, who was kicked to death outside a supermarket . Evans later told a family friend: ‘I kicked him in the head and stood on his ribs. The noises were terrible.’ In what the judge described as a . ‘final and gratuitous insult’, Connor rifled through Mr Bennett’s . pockets to see if there was anything worth stealing. Left for dead, Mr Bennett was found seven hours later by supermarket staff arriving for work. He suffered a fractured eye socket, . collapsed lung and broken ribcage and died six days later in hospital . from blood poisoning after an infection set in, causing organ failure. Jailing Connor for a minimum of 12 . years, Brandon for a minimum of six years, and Evans for a minimum of . eight years, the judge said: ‘It is a desperately sad reflection on the . society in which we live that each of you was party to serious violence . for the sake of it.’ Following the sentencing, Mr Bennett’s . cousin Angela Connerty, 49, said he was a ‘fabulous’ man who would . forever be in her thoughts.

A British aid worker was found beheaded and riddled with bullets on a roadside in Pakistan yesterday because his kidnappers have not been paid the ransom they demanded. Khalil Dale, 60, was taken at gunpoint in January while he was working with the Red Cross in the south-west city of Quetta. His head and body were discovered wrapped in a plastic bag with a note addressed to the chief of police, which read: 'This is the body of Khalil who we have slaughtered for not paying a ransom amount'. Scroll down for video . Experienced: Dale had worked for the ICRC and the British Red Cross in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq before coming to Pakistan . Local police said the Pakistani Taliban had claimed responsibility. David Cameron last night described . the killing of Mr Dale, a Muslim convert who was also known as Ken, as a . ‘shocking and merciless act’. The Prime Minister said: ‘I was . deeply saddened to hear today about the  brutal murder of Khalil Dale – a . man who was killed whilst providing humanitarian support to others. ‘This was a shocking and merciless . act, carried out by people with no respect for human life and the rule . of law.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said . he learned of the death ‘with great sadness’, adding that ‘tireless . efforts’ had been made to secure Mr Dale’s release. Mr Hague said: ‘I utterly condemn the . kidnapping and killing of Mr Dale, and send my deepest condolences to . his family and loved ones.

Mr Dale's step-niece, Justine Barber . Retired nurse Sheila Howat, a former . colleague, said: ‘It’s dreadful what has happened to him, really awful. The world has lost someone who really cared for others. ‘I think the circumstances are absolutely barbaric and disgraceful. He did not deserve that end to his life. ‘I knew him as Ken, and he was an absolutely lovely person, devoted to caring for others less fortunate than himself. ‘He spent time in war-torn countries where help was needed and people were desperate, and that was Ken’s goal in life.’ She plans to contact other friends of .

Iran has denied reports of a major explosion at its Fordow nuclear facility, one of its most sensitive uranium enrichment sites. The country has described the claims as Western propaganda which they say is intended to influence upcoming international nuclear negotiations. The reports originate with Israeli intelligence sources in Tel Aviv, who since Friday have spoken of an explosion damaging the Fordow bunker which is situated deep under a mountain near the religious city of Qom. Well-protected: A graphic showing elements of the Fordow underground nuclear plant near Qom that are visible from the sky. Israeli sources say the facility suffered an explosion last week . The explosion is believed to have occurred early last week. 'The false news of an explosion at . Fordow is Western propaganda ahead of nuclear negotiations to influence . their process and outcome,' the Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted the deputy . head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Saeed Shamseddin Bar Broudi, . as saying late on Sunday night. Iran's ISNA news agency backed up the denial, and quoted military commander Massoud Jazayeri as saying: 'I deny an explosion at the Fordow site.' The Iranians do not appear to have evacuated the area surrounding the site, which sources claim suffered severe structural damage and may have 200 workers trapped inside. In late 2011 Fordow began producing uranium enriched to 20 percent fissile purity - below the 90 per cent level used in nuclear bombs, but very high compared with the 3.5 percent level needed for nuclear energy plants. The Islamic state says it is producing . 20 percent uranium to make fuel for a research reactor in Tehran that . produces medical isotopes, but the move provoked fears that the uranium could be converted to bomb-grade. Several U.N. Security Council resolutions have ordered Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment. Speculation over the explosion followed a report that international discussions on Iran's disputed nuclear programme may be resumed. 'False reports': The Iranian government says there has been no accident at the plant. This map shows the location of the nuclear facility, where - controversially - uranium is being enriched to 20 per cent . The European Union, the lead negotiator on the talks, said there was no such agreement. Diplomats in Vienna, where the United Nations' nuclear agency is based, said they were looking into the reports of an incident at Fordow. One Western diplomat said he did not believe they were accurate. Iran has accused Israel and the United States of trying to sabotage its nuclear programme, due to suspicions that it hides attempts to develop atomic bombs. The Islamic republic says its atomic programme is entirely peaceful and Tehran has accused Israel and the U.S. of being behind cyber attacks on its nuclear programme and the assassination of its nuclear scientists. Satellite view: Avi Dichter, the Israeli Civil Defence Minister, could not say anything about the reported Fordow blast 'beyond what I heard in the media' but added: 'Any explosion in Iran which does not harm people but harms Iran's assets is a blessing' Washington denied any role in the killings and no government has taken responsibility for the Stuxnet computer virus that destroyed centrifuges at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility in 2010, despite widespread reports that it was the result of a U.S. and Israeli government project. Israel has hinted at possible military action against Iran if diplomacy fails to resolve the dispute. Avi Dichter, the Israeli Civil Defence Minister, could not say anything about the reported Fordow blast 'beyond what I heard in the media' but added: 'Any explosion in Iran which does not harm people but harms Iran's assets is a blessing.' Three rounds of talks last year between Iran and Russia, the United States, China, Britain, France and Germany produced no resolution, increasing speculation that Israel could attack Iranian nuclear installations.","Reported last week that Iran's Fordow plant was damaged in an explosion .

Covering up: New guidelines banning shopkeepers from displaying lingerie and skimpy clothing on mannequins outside shops could be passed in Mumbai . Mannequins displaying lingerie could be banned in Mumbai in a bid to halt India's rape epidemic. Mumbai's municipal council passed a resolution barring stores from displaying scantily-clad mannequins outside city shops. The ruling will come into effect if it is approved by the muncipal commissioner. It comes as news emerged that two western women were raped in India in the last two days. A 30-year-old American tourist was gang-raped by three men while hitchhiking back to a guest house in the northern resort of Manali this morning. The attack came just a day after it emerged that a a 21-year-old Irish charity worker was allegedly drugged and raped while volunteering with an aid agency in Kolkata. They are the latest in a spate of sexual assaults on foreign women in India that have led to safety warnings and a drop in the number of female tourists travelling to the country. The resolution  to ban mannequins wearing lingerie was suggested by city councillor Ritu Tawde who said that such displays not only degrade women but could also encourage men to attack them. She said: 'Such people get provoked by mannequins. After all, a mannequin is a replica of a woman's body. That's why I oppose it, because mannequins do not suit Indian culture.' Although the ruling will ban mannequins from going on display outside shops, retailers will still be able to display them how they wish inside stores. Business officials have criticised the proposals, saying that they will have no impact on violence against women. On show: Shopkeepers will still be able to display mannequins however they wish inside the store according to the new proposals (file picture) Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders' Welfare Association, said: 'We are living in the 21st century where these kinds of things, all porn, the movies, the pictures, all these things are available on websites, available on mobiles. (A) mannequin hardly makes any difference to the people.' But Tawde said pornographic internet images are very different than the mannequins. She said: 'If someone wants to watch pornography on the net, that is a conscious choice that he is making. In this case, the mannequins are everywhere and people don't have a choice. Calls for protection: The gang rape and murder of a student in New Delhi sparked widespread protest in India back in December . 'They run into them when they step out of their homes and walk on the streets.' Indians have increasingly demanded stronger protection for women since the gang rape and killing of a student on a bus in the capital of New Delhi in December. That rape sparked public protests demanding better protection for women. In response, the government passed a law increasing prison terms for rape and providing for the death penalty in cases of rape that result in death or leave the victim in a coma. It also made voyeurism, stalking, acid attacks and the trafficking of women punishable under criminal law.","Councillors want to ban scantily clad displays outside shops in the city .

A woman bitten by a mosquito while on holiday in Australia was left paralysed from the neck down. Natasha Porter was confined to a wheelchair for four months and was unable to move anything below her neck for three weeks after suffering the bite. Ms Porter was two weeks into the holiday of a lifetime in Australia when she developed Guillain-Barre syndrome - a disease which causes the body attacks its own nervous system. She first noticed numbness in one toe, but within four days she could barely walk. Doctors told her the fast-moving paralysis could freeze her diaphragm within hours and that there was a chance she could die. Ms Porter watched helplessly as she lost control of her entire body within hours. She was unable to feel her hands, feet or legs - or move anything below her neck. ‘Every time I went to sleep at night I wondered if I might not wake up,’ said Ms Porter, from Crawley, West Sussex. ‘All I could think was I'm 23 - I don't want to die.’ Ms Porter flew to Western Australia in March 2012 and spent seven months working in a cafe to save up for a trip down the country’s east coast. However, she began to notice numbness in her toe two weeks after arriving in Cairns. The paralysis then moved to her hands two days later. Ms Porter visited a pharmacist who dismissed her symptoms as an allergic reaction and prescribed antihistamines. But when her arms began to feel so heavy she could not lift them up to brush her hair, she consulted a doctor who diagnosed anxiety and stress. She spent two more days deteriorating on a two-day cruise round the Whitsunday Islands before a concerned couple rushed her to hospital. The condition causes the body to attack its own immune system and it left Ms Porter in a wheelchair for four months and unable to move anything below her neck for three weeks . Doctors tested her reflexes and found she had none. Ms . Porter said: ‘The doctor said he thought it could be Guillain-Barre . syndrome. I had never heard of it. The next words he said were “I'm . worried,"" and I was so scared. ‘He said it was potentially fatal because it freezes your diaphragm and he said I might need to go on a ventilator really soon. ‘I remember feeling guilty because I knew I was going to have to call my parents. I was thinking, how do I call them up and say I might be dead in a few hours? She was diagnosed after she started to experience numbness in her feet and hands and felt as though her arms were too heavy to lift. Doctors initially thought she was suffering from an allergic reaction or stress . ‘I was thinking I just don't want to die, I'm only just beginning to live.’ Guillain-Barre . syndrome is a rare and serious condition which occurs when the body's . immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system. The exact cause is unknown but around 60 per cent of sufferers develop it when bacteria or a virus enters the body and triggers the immune system to attack nerves. This causes the nerves to become inflamed and stop working and in some cases makes the body numb. She was warned that she could end up on a ventilator, or even die, if her diaphragm also became paralysed by the condition. Her parents had to fly out from England to be at her bedside . Within three weeks she was able to move both her arms a few centimetres, and six weeks after she was paralysed she stood up for a few seconds with the help of three nurses. She had to wear a face mask to protect her from further infections . It can prove fatal but around 80 per . cent of suffers make a full recovery after several weeks in hospital . although some take a year or more to fully recover. Ms . Porter’s father Joe, a taxi driver, flew out to join his daughter, and . called her mother, Sue, a college lecturer, when it became clear she was . very ill. In November, Ms Porter (pictured with father, Joe) was flown back home accompanied by two nurses . Within two days Ms Porter could not move anything but her head. She said: ‘I was trying to wiggle my toe and I was staring at it knowing it should move but it wouldn't. ‘I . couldn't do anything, it was awful. To go from being so independent to . not being able to go to the loo, lift up your own leg. I had to ask to . be turned over in bed. It was depressing. ‘There was a constant burning. It was incredible. I can't describe the pain.’ However, thanks to a lot of physiotherapy, Ms Porter was able to regain her independence one movement at a time. Within three weeks she was able to move both her arms a few centimetres, and six weeks after she was paralysed she stood up for a few seconds with the help of three nurses. She said: ‘People were saying, “bend your legs, straighten your back, tuck you tummy in,” but it was so strange as I just had no idea how to do it. ‘The first time I was able to move for five seconds I remember just yelling and everyone started applauding.’ In November, Ms Porter was flown back home accompanied by two nurses, and reunited with brother Jack, 27, and sister Shelley, 25. By the New Year she was able to take short trips away from her wheelchair and by the end of January she went out dancing with her friends for the first time. Ms Porter has now made a full recovery and returned to work. She and her boyfriend, Tom Kelly, are hoping to finish their travels once they have saved up enough money . In March she began work as an administration assistant, and she is planning to finish the round the world trip she began, and to climb to Everest base camp with boyfriend, Tom Kelly, as soon as they raise the funds. Ms Porter said: ‘I don't want to waste anytime anymore and I hope I have become a better person. ‘I just want to live as much as I can, spend as much time with my friends and family, just enjoying my life.’ Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.","Natasha Porter developed Guillain-Barre syndrome while travelling .

Tony Blair’s job as a Middle East peace envoy is in jeopardy after officials in the Palestinian Authority accused him  of acting like an ‘extreme’  Israeli diplomat. Senior figures in the Palestine Liberation Organisation are reported to be planning to sever all contact with the former prime minister. They described Mr Blair as ‘persona non grata’ and said they were looking to isolate the former PM so his position became untenable on the international stage. Mr Blair has been viewed with an element of distrust by some Palestinians ever since his appointment as the envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East – the mediating body comprising the United States, the EU, the UN and Russia. He was handed the job the day he left Downing Street in June 2007. But antagonism has mounted over allegations that he lobbied European powers to vote against a Palestinian bid for statehood which was submitted to the UN last week. One senior Palestinian official told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘He does not represent the international community but works according to his own opinion, which he shares with the more extreme Israelis. We see him as an Israeli diplomat. A . man apart: Tony Blair with fellow members of the Quartet of the Middle . East and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon (centre) this week. From left, . Hillary Clinton, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and EU . commissioner Catherine Ashton . ‘We will not be unhappy to see his back but when he leaves is something for the Quartet to decide.’ Another added: ‘There is no one within the Palestinian leadership that supports or likes or trusts Tony Blair, particularly because of the very damaging role he played during our UN bid. ‘He is considered persona non grata in Palestine. Although we can’t prevent him from coming here, we can hopefully minimise the role he can play because he is not a mediator, he is totally biased on one side.’ Mr Blair has been based between London and the luxurious American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem since leaving 10 Downing Street in 2007. A storm of suspicion and disapproval has been building among Palestinians since his first days in the region. Many were surprised and disappointed when he failed to speak out against Israel’s invasion of Gaza in January 2009, which left as many as 1,417 Palestinians dead. Anger: Blair's failure to address Israel's continuing building of settlements in the West Bank was key to his draft proposal being rejected . Many also accuse Mr Blair of placing his business interests above his diplomatic responsibilities. A conflict of interest was posed by his £2million-a-year job as consultant for investment bank JP Morgan and his executive role at Tony Blair Associates. Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘There is no question in my mind that Tony Blair is incredibly sympathetic to the Israeli cause and throughout his time as an envoy there has been a question mark about whether he fully understands the position of the Arab countries. ‘He is not the honest broker that he pretends to be.’ A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority said its negotiators often talked to people they did not like. A spokesman for Mr Blair insisted he had no plans to leave the Middle East, adding: ‘He is there for the long term, as he has been from day one.’",PLO motion to declare former PM persona non grata to be held later this week .

Apple has been portrayed as a corporate bully that allegedly lead an illegal scheme to raise the prices of e-books, in a civic trial today. The Justice Department’s suit claims that the Silicon Valley giant forced an end to price . competition and costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. Justice Department attorney, Lawrence Buterman, said a dramatic price increase in e-books was 'no accident or unforeseen outcome' but the result of a deliberate plan by Apple and five book publishers to eliminate Amazon's $9.99 bargain price for popular e-books. He asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is overseeing a trial expected to last several weeks, to find that the computer company had violated anti-trust laws. Apple lawyer Orin Snyder sharply . disputed the government's claims, saying the company had been waiting . eagerly for its chance to show it had enhanced competition and improved . the e-book industry. 'Apple . is going to trial because it did nothing wrong,' he said. 'Apple did . not conspire with any publisher individually, collectively or otherwise . to raise industry prices.' He . called the government's case bizarre, saying: 'Even our government is . fallible, and sometimes the government just gets it wrong.' Buterman . said the scheme to boost prices to $12.99 and $14.99 was encouraged by . Steve Jobs, the late founder of the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer . giant. The lawyer said he would display . emails and other correspondence that showed Jobs was active in the . company's efforts to control e-book prices as Apple was preparing to . launch the iPad. Bullies? Federal prosecutors say Apple colluded with publishers to push Amazon.com out of the e-book market . The nonjury trial results from a lawsuit last year that accused the company of seeking to enter the market for e-books in 2010 in a way that would guarantee it 30 percent profits. A separate court proceeding could be conducted to quantify harm to consumers. 'Apple's conduct cannot be excused,' Buterman said. 'Consumers in this country paid hundreds of millions of dollars more for e-books than they would have.' Federal prosecutor Lawrence Buterman: 'Apple's conduct cannot be excused' But Snyder said a ruling against Apple would mark the first time in anti-trust law history in which a new entrant in a market was condemned when its presence benefited consumers. He said Apple entered an 'e-book market that was broken, lacked innovation, lacked competition and was heading nowhere good.' He said publishers fought a pricing arrangement that the government said would guarantee Apple 30 percent profits, so it defies logic to insist there was collusion. 'The government is asking your honor to proceed on a perilous path,' Snyder said. The . trial's first witness, Kevin Saul, testified that Apple knew publishers . were interested in charging higher prices for e-books when it entered . the market. He said Apple arranged a different pricing model with . publishers than Amazon.com had because Apple realized it would lose . money otherwise. He said Apple was indifferent to how its competitors dealt with publishers. 'We were focused solely on opening an e-books store for Apple,' Saul said. Five . publishers named in the lawsuit have settled. The judge had urged Apple . to do the same, though she assured Apple a fair trial Monday, saying: . 'The deck is not stacked against Apple unless the evidence stacks the . deck against Apple.'","Federal prosecutors say Apple tried to run Amazon out of business by inflating the prices of e-books just prior to the launch of the iPad .

This police officer decided to demonstrate his musical prowess for shoppers in Birmingham - grabbing a busker's guitar and breaking into an impromptu performance of the Oasis hit Wonderwall. A crowd quickly gathered around PC Ian Northcott, 48, whose surprise rendition of the Britpop classic has been watched more than 50,000 times on YouTube. Busking bobby: A passerby shows her appreciation with some change as the West Midlands police officer draws a crowd on New Street in Birmingham . Audience: Scores of people gathered around to hear PC Ian Northcott's impromptu rendition of the Oasis classic Wonderwall . 'Noel would have been proud I hope,' said the West Midlands Police officer, who joked that he might add the track I Fought the Law to his repertoire the next time he decides to entertain the crowds. 'It was such a lovely day, everyone seemed happy, it just felt such a natural thing to do.' PC Northcott, who has played the guitar for around 15 years, said his brief 'gig' on Saturday afternoon wasn't the first time he had teamed up with busker's in Birmingham. 'I’ve got to know a few of the city’s buskers and have joined them before to play,' he said. 'We are always looking for ways to break down barriers between the police and the public and this was certainly one of them.' Music fan: A video of the police officer's performance has been watched more than 50,000 times on YouTube . No stranger to performing, the police officer has also penned his own song - entitled Pleasure - to raise awareness of the plight of homeless people. With the help of four colleagues, PC Northcott has set up Socks and Chocs, which provides socks, chocolates and sleeping bags for homeless people on Christmas Day. 'Last year we donated nearly 1,500 pairs of socks, over 800 bags of chocolate, 60 sleeping bags and 270 hats and gloves to the homeless in Coventry, Birmingham, and Wolverhampton,' PC Northcott said. 'We’ll be starting our collections for this Christmas in September. 'I was walking through Birmingham recently and was approached by a homeless man who needed money to buy a safe bed for the weekend. 'After I had tried to ensure he would use any money to actually buy the bed I explained our Socks and Chocs For The Homeless event to him. 'He said ""Man, I would love a new pair of socks, they make such a difference"".' PC Northcott's unconventional approach to neighbourhood policing has the full support of his superiors on the force. Chief Superintendent Clive Burgess said: 'Whilst neighbourhood policing is primarily about being highly visible in order to deter and detect crime - another key part of the job is to interact with the public and to provide a friendly, reassuring presence. 'It’s clear that many people, be they in the crowd at the time or watching on social media, enjoyed the performance and I’m sure the majority will agree that this really encapsulates the true spirit of neighbourhood policing,' he added. 'It just felt natural': The police officer joked that he might treat shoppers to a rendition of I Fought the Law in future . In the zone: The unlikely sight of a uniformed officer strumming a guitar and singing in the street drew a crowd in Birmingham . Describing his passion for music, PC Northcott said: 'I like Fairport Convention - who I hope will do a version of ‘Pleasure’ for me - Jethro Tull and The Saw Doctors. 'I love singing Share the Darkness, Green and Red of Mayo by Saw Doctors and Hurt by Johnny Cash. He added: 'I might just play ‘I Fought The Law’ next time - simple three chords - just right for a happy strummer like me.'

Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has criticised sports stars David Beckham and Gary Lineker for promoting junk food. The television presenter, who forced the Government to introduce nutrition rules in schools after highlighting the unhealthy meals served to pupils, has added his name to a letter which condemns the use of athletes in commercials. Oliver and other signatories, including Dr Hilary Cass, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), say the practice sends the wrong message to children. Under fire: David Beckham, pictured swigging from a fizzy drink bottle in an advert for Pepsi, has been criticised for promoting the product . The letter, published in the Times, reads: 'On the eve of the London Olympics we, a group with a vested interest in improving the health and wellbeing of young people, express our grave concern about this trend. 'We believe it is wrong for athletes to encourage the excessive consumption of such items, which are fuelling poor health and obesity. Image rights: David Beckham has signed lucrative contracts to endorse soft drink Pepsi . 'David Beckham is a great sportsman, yet he has endorsed Pepsi. 'What about the impact of Gary Lineker’s association with Walkers crisps? Or the partnership between Mars and the FA?' The letter claims that food companies . are aware their products have 'little redeeming nutritional qualities' but can trigger a 'so-called ""halo"" effect' by associating them with . sport. It warns that diet-related diseases are reaching global epidemic proportions. The . letter continues: 'With one in three children in Britain overweight or . obese by the age of nine, we have a public health crisis that requires . urgent intervention.' It . ends: 'We would ask athletes to be very conscious of the effect their . endorsements may have on the future lives of youngsters. 'Obesity does not just carry physical consequences but serious social and emotional ones as well.' Other . signatories to the letter are RCPCH past president Professor Terence . Stephenson, National Association of Head Teachers president Steve . Iredale, Children’s Food Campaign director Charlie Powell and London . cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra. Dr . Malhotra, who has called for a ban on junk food sponsorship of the . Olympics, said: 'It is totally perverse that some of the main sponsors . of the greatest sporting spectacle in the world are McDonald’s and . Coca-Cola. 'One . vital step in reducing the consumption of obesogenic products is to end . the association of sporting role models with junk food. Promotion: Former England striker Gary Lineker has appeared alongside ex-managers Bobby Robson and Terry Venables (left) and singer Lionel Richie (right) in adverts for Walkers crisps . 'The very lucrative financial gain for these athletes is sadly at the expense of our children’s health and we should not allow this to continue.' Dr Cass said: 'We shouldn’t underestimate the fascination that many children and young people have with celebrities, whether that’s teenage girls skipping meals to look like the latest airbrushed magazine model or boys wanting the same brand boot as their footballing idol. 'Sporting role models in particular can send a powerful message to children when it comes to their health and fitness. 'Instead of glamorising junk food, they should be using their influence to inspire children and young people to become tomorrow’s top athletes by eating well and leading active lifestyles. Critical: TV chef Jamie Oliver has signed a letter criticising the use of athletes to promote foods with 'little redeeming nutritional qualities' 'With celebrity status comes responsibility. So rather than helping to fuel this nation’s growing obesity crisis, these stars can play a key role in helping stem it.' Mr Iredale said: 'Like many colleagues in the teaching profession and beyond I continue to be frustrated by the direct link made by large numbers of young people between the sports men and women idolised by so many and the promotion of unhealthy food and drink. 'This sends entirely the wrong message to a generation who are often influenced by the advertising of these products by their heroes. 'I would ask those involved to reflect carefully on the potential consequences of their actions and instead work together to help to improve the health and life chances of those who are so vulnerable.'","TV chef signs letter claiming use of athletes in commercials sends wrong message to children .

But, when it comes to your health, the iPhone emerges as the clear winner over a BlackBerry. Scientists tested several popular smartphones for two of the most common allergens – cobalt and nickel – and found neither metal was present in iPhones. Blackberrys contain nickel which is thought to affect 30% of the population . But a third of BlackBerrys tested contained nickel, which can bring those with sensitive skin out in a rash. A nickel allergy is the most common contact allergy in Britain, thought to affect 30 per cent of the population and rising. The scientists tested the phones' buttons, keypad, speakers, camera and metal panels. Dr Tania Mucci, who presented the study at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said: 'Both metals can cause an allergic reaction including dry, itchy patches along the cheekbones, jawline and ears.' Nickel is a silvery-white metal used in alloys because of its resistance to corrosion. It is found in objects including door handles, scissors, jewellery – and even occurs naturally in some foods, such as nuts and kidney beans. Apple's iconic iPhone contains none of the chemicals associated with common allergies . 'Patients with nickel and cobalt allergies should consider using iPhones to reduce the chance of having an allergic reaction,' said allergist Dr Luz Fonacier. 'BlackBerry users with known allergies should avoid prolonged conversations, text messaging and handling their phones if they begin noticing symptoms.' Women have a higher risk of developing mobile phone dermatitis as they are more likely to have become sensitive to the metal following a reaction to nickel-coated jewellery. The British Association of Dermatologists advises anyone who develops a rash on their face which might be due to prolonged mobile phone use to seek advice from their doctor. A spokesman said: 'In mobile phone dermatitis, the rash would typically occur on the cheek or ear.' A Blackberry spokesperson said: 'Allergic reactions to nickel occur if it is found on the outside of a phone. 'We test our phones against EU test protocol EN 1811 and have found no nickel exposure on the exterior surface of newly purchased BlackBerry smartphones.'","Many smartphones contain nickel and cobalt which can cause allergies .

Demand: Ian Macdonald QC, pictured in 2004, is one of the 702 law professionals who have signed the letter . Hundreds of lawyers, including some of . the country’s most eminent QCs, today launch a devastating attack . on Government plans for secret courts as ‘contrary to the rule of law’ and demand they are dropped. More than 700 figures from the legal . profession insist that the Government’s Justice and Security Bill is . ‘dangerous and unnecessary’ and will ‘fatally undermine’ the fairness of . court hearings. The group of 702, which includes 38 . QCs, says in a letter published in today’s Daily Mail that the proposals . to allow a huge extension of court hearings behind closed doors will . ‘erode core principles of our civil justice system’ by undermining the . right to a fair trial and open justice. They include Nicholas Vineall QC, . former chairman of the Conservative Lawyers’ Association, Reverend . Nicholas Mercer, a lieutenant colonel who was the Army’s most senior . lawyer during the Iraq war, and Ian Macdonald QC, who resigned as a . security-cleared special advocate in protest at the existing use of . secret justice. The intervention of such a significant . number of lawyers is a shattering blow for the Government, which had . been hoping to get the legislation through Parliament as quietly as . possible following months of controversy. It is expected to return to . the Commons next week. In another setback for the Government, . a group of international organisations, including the American Civil . Liberties Union and similar bodies from Ireland, Canada, South Africa, . Argentina, Egypt and Hungary, also expressed concerns about the Bill in a . joint statement. It warned: ‘If the UK Parliament . passes this proposal into law it will be a huge setback for those of us . fighting to secure truth and fairness from our own governments and . within our own justice systems across the world.’ The Daily Mail has led criticism of . Government plans to allow so-called ‘closed material procedures’ (CMPs), . in which cases are conducted entirely in private, in civil hearings. Defendants or claimants will not . allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must . be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their . own lawyer. Currently, such procedures are used in . tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings, but the . Government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed . to involve national security. Secret court: Those who have signed the letter say court hearings behind closed doors 'erodes civil justice system core principles' The legislation has been drafted in . close cooperation with the security services, who have claimed other . countries may stop sharing intelligence with Britain if it risks being . disclosed in open court. But critics say the proposals are simply designed to ensure potentially embarrassing cases are conducted behind closed doors. Reverend Nicholas Mercer, one of the . most prominent signatories of today’s letter, said: ‘The Justice and . Security Bill has one principle aim and that is to cover up UK . complicity in rendition and torture. ‘The Bill is an affront to the open . justice on which this country rightly prides itself and, above all, it . is an affront to human dignity. The fact that some of those individuals . who are complicit in rendition and torture can not only assist in the . drafting of the Bill but also vote to cover their tracks is a . constitutional scandal. ‘It is little wonder that the Bill has . been heavily criticised by the UN Rapporteur on Torture and condemned . by the vast majority of lawyers and human rights organisations in this . country.’ Michael Fordham QC, one of the . country's leading public law specialists, warned the Government that if . it pressed ahead judges might refuse to preside over secret courts. ‘Secret trials undermine the . principles of open justice and natural justice on which the rule of law . is built. By promoting the spread of secrecy, state authorities become . self-immunised from proper public scrutiny, and in relation to the very . types of actions which most need it,’ he said. ‘Parliament is unwisely provoking the . untapped power of our unwritten constitution which it could come to . regret. The last word will not be Parliament's, but that of judges asked . to preside over secret courts. An unwise Parliament may be about to . find that it has constitutional limits, when the rule of law fights . back.’ Paul Bowen QC said: ‘The extension of . closed material procedures is not necessary for public protection.  The . state is already free to withhold evidence from disclosure under Public . Interest Immunity procedures.  What is not fair, or just, is evidence . being shown in secret to the judge who decides the case on the basis of . that evidence. ‘In those cases where disclosure of . torture or other human rights abuses by the British government or its . agents is sought, the public interest surely requires that to be brought . into the open.’ Dinah Rose QC, a former special . advocate and another signatory, said: ‘Closed material procedures are . alien to British justice and will distort civil trials beyond . recognition. 'What may look and sound like a trial is in fact nothing of . the sort. Judges will be asked to decide cases on the basis of ""secret . evidence"" that would not withstand legal challenge and hand down . judgments in secret. This Bill is a dangerous perversion of our national . legal system and will undermine constitutional rights.’ Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil . rights group Liberty, said: ‘When will the coalition . that once championed civil liberties listen to the condemnation of its . secret courts proposals? ‘Liberty was dismissed as the . reactionary human rights lobby- but now legal and international . communities have joined the opposition to secret stitch-ups between . government and judges, with victims, press and public shut outside. Secret justice is a complete perversion - it is no justice at all.’ Minister without portfolio Kenneth . Clarke, who is in charge of the legislation, will today table further . amendments supposed to address some of the concerns of critics. They mean a judge must be satisfied . that the Government has considered whether to make a claim for public . interest immunity before making an application for a secret hearing as . one of the tests to be met. Mr Clarke is also proposing an annual report . on the operation of closed hearings and a full review after five years. He said: ‘With these final amendments . the Government has gone to extreme lengths to meet every practical legal . objection that has been made about the Bill. The judge now has total . discretion over whether to order a closed material procedure following . an application either by the Government, the claimant, or from the court . of its own motion. ‘I do not believe closed material . procedures are ideal, but in the very exceptional circumstances where . national security is at stake, they offer the only practical means of . delivering justice where otherwise there would be none. ‘CMPs already exist in our justice . system and the Government does lose in them – sometimes to the great . anger of the Daily Mail’s readers. ‘This Bill is now proportionate, . sensible and necessary.  It resolves the highly unsatisfactory legal . no-man’s land we have at the moment where national security cases can be . brought, but not resolved. ‘Of course these amendments will not . reassure the Bill’s hardline critics, who prefer silence to judicial . decisions on allegations of kidnap and torture, and are prepared to . accept that millions of pounds could go without challenge to individuals . who could be terrorists. These final amendments should now resolve all . right thinking citizens that this is a sensible, worthwhile Bill which . they would give their support to.

Rio Ferdinand yesterday insisted it was not racist to call his England teammate Ashley Cole a ‘choc ice’. The Manchester United star reignited the John Terry race row after apparently endorsing the term, which it is commonly understood to mean ‘black on the outside, white on the inside’. His comments were made days after Cole testified in defence of his Chelsea teammate Terry as he stood trial accused of racially abusing Ferdinand’s brother, Anton, during a Premier League game last October. Last night Ferdinand used Twitter to . declare ‘choc ice’ was not a racist expression and that it simply . suggested that someone was a fake. The controversy started when someone . sent Ferdinand a tweet about Cole’s involvement in the Terry trial. The . person wrote: ‘Looks like Ashley Cole’s going to be their choc ice. Then . again he’s always been a sell-out. Shame on him.’ Ferdinand responded: ‘I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahahhha!!’ After initial criticism by other . Twitter users, Ferdinand tweeted again: ‘If I want to laugh at something . someone tweets....I will! Hahahahaha! Now stop getting ya knickers in a . twist!’ But as the online backlash continued . Ferdinand tweeted to his three million followers: ‘What I said yesterday . is not a racist term. Its (sic) a type of slang/term used by many for . someone who is being fake. So there.’ Cole, who is also a friend of Rio and . his brother, had earlier moved to calm the situation down and issued a . statement through his lawyers. Race row: Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand, . left, is facing criticism after apparently endorsing a Twitter attack . branding Ashley Cole, right, a 'choc ice' for being a defence witness in . John Terry's race abuse trial . Laughing off: Rio Ferdinand appears to endorse the tweet branding Ashley Cole a 'choc ice' by responding: 'I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahahhha!!' Rio Ferdinand today said his retweet was not racist . England duty: Terry, Ferdinand and Cole have previously played together for England . It said: ‘Ashley Cole has been made . aware of the discussion following comments appearing on Twitter and . wishes to make it clear that he and Rio Ferdinand are good friends and . Ashley has no intention of making any sort of complaint. ‘Ashley appreciates that Tweeting is so quick it often results in off-hand and stray comments.’ The original tweet was believed to have been made by a man from Derbyshire. A Derbyshire Police spokeswoman today said the force had received no complaints over the matter. During the trial at Westminster . Magistrates’ Court, prosecutors alleged that Terry had maliciously . called Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand a ‘f****** black . c***’. The 31-year-old Chelsea captain . admitted calling Anton Ferdinand a ‘f****** black c***’ and a ‘f****** . k***head’ but said he was only sarcastically repeating a false . allegation made by Anton Ferdinand. Giving evidence for the defence, Cole . backed Terry, insisting his teammate was not a racist and saying it was . wrong to prosecute him. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said an . acquittal on the racially aggravated public order offence was the only . verdict he could reach because there was no way to be sure what Terry . had said. Key moment: Terry and QPR's Anton Ferdinand clash during the Barclays Premier League match at Loftus Road . The players met in the Chelsea . changing room after the match and shook hands, writing it all off as . ‘handbags’ and on-pitch ‘banter’. Even when he was shown footage of the incident on YouTube, Anton Ferdinand did nothing. But . an off-duty police officer watching on TV, who claimed to be able to . lip read, complained to the Metropolitan Police that a racially-aggravated offence had . taken place. In the weeks that followed Terry was . stripped of the England captaincy and lost a fortune in sponsorship . deals. England manager Fabio Capello resigned in a row over the move. Cole . gave evidence for his Chelsea and England team-mate during the trial . and told the court that the case should not have gone ahead. Relieved: The former England captain was flanked by security guards as he left the court after being cleared . ‘We shouldn’t be sitting here,’ Cole said. He said that while racism should never be tolerated, saying back what you thought someone said was ‘completely different’. Cole said he did not hear what Terry said to Ferdinand despite being only about a car-length away from the row. But . he said he saw Ferdinand shouting either the word ‘black’ or ‘Bridgey’ – . an apparent reference to Wayne Bridge – and make a lewd gesture at . Terry. Cole said he told . Ferdinand: ‘What you’re doing to JT [Terry] is out of order’. He added . that he did not shake Ferdinand’s hand after the game. Mobbed: Terry made no comment as he left the court building to shouts of support from crowds waiting outside . Anton Ferdinand fears for football's future and believes John Terry's acquittal sends out the wrong message to young people, it was reported today. Reacting to the court's verdict for the first time, Ferdinand said he was shocked and disappointed by the ruling. The Queen's Park Rangers player told the People: 'It is one rule for us, and one rule for John Terry.' Ferdinand, who was not present in court when the verdict was read out, is in Malaysia for his club's pre-season tour of the Far East. A source close to the player told the newspaper he was pleased to be out of the country during the fallout from the case. 'He needs to come to terms with what has happened because he is very, very disappointed,' the source said. 'Anton has been getting brilliant support from his team-mates.' The left-back said abuse towards . Terry over his affair with Miss Perroncel was commonplace during games, . but he had never seen him react to it, explaining: ‘He would probably . laugh about it, it’s part and parcel of the game and you get used to . it.’ Cole was supported by a . host of football stars, Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard and the club's . former manager Jose Mourinho, who vouched that Terry was not racist. Cole described Terry as a good friend and a great captain. He said: ‘He’s one of the best, very inspirational. He gets the team  going in big games. He’s cool, calm and collected.’ Terry . was acquitted on Friday. Ferdinand was not at the hearing as he was . flying from Heathrow with the QPR squad for a pre-season tour of the Far . East. Chief magistrate . Howard Riddle, who is also a district judge, said there was not enough . evidence to prove ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ that Terry was guilty. He said TV footage did not show the complete exchange, meaning it was impossible to be sure exactly what was said. ‘In those circumstances, there being a doubt, the only verdict the court can record is one of not guilty,’ the magistrate said. He . added: 'There is no doubt that John Terry uttered the words 'f****** . black c***' at Anton Ferdinand. When he did so he was angry. 'Mr Ferdinand says that he did not precipitate this comment by himself, accusing Mr Terry of calling him a black c***. 'Even . with all the help the court has received from television footage, . expert lip readers, witnesses and indeed counsel, it is impossible to be . sure exactly what were the words spoken by Mr Terry at the relevant . time.' Anton Ferdinand, pictured leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court after giving evidence accused Terry of racially abusing him . Both Terry and Anton Ferdinand could face disciplinary action after the FA decided to reopen its inquiry into the incident. The . FA, who had a lawyer attending every day of the trial, said they would . look at the findings of the court case before deciding whether or not to . bring any proceedings against the players. The . FA will decide whether Terry should still be charged with using abusive . and insulting words and with making reference to Ferdinand’s ethnic . origin and colour. Ferdinand could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute for the comments he made during the exchange. Charges can still be brought by the . FA against Terry even thought he was acquitted in court because they . have a lower burden of proof - Liverpool's Luis Suarez was banned last . season for racially abusing Patrice Evra but that case never went to . court. Not present: QPR footballer Anton Ferdinand, pictured leaving Heathrow for a tour of the Far East, was not in court for the verdict . In a brief statement . an FA spokesman said: 'The FA notes the decision in the John Terry case . and will now seek to conclude its own enquiries.' Gordon . Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, . says revelations about the obscene remarks which are exchanged during . matches have damaged the game's reputation. Taylor has urged the FA to ensure that players understand their responsibilities as role models next season. He also suggested the FA are in 'a difficult position' over whether they charge Terry. Taylor . said: 'It has been an unedifying process and the game has been damaged . as a result of the dirty linen being washed in public. Even if he had been convicted, Terry would have faced a fine of just £2,500, a fraction of his reported £130,000 weekly wage. But taxpayers will pick up a bill of up to £500,000 for the prosecution.

Police said that David and his friends had been watching YouTube videos on how to make yourself pass out and told officers that this was the first time they had attempted the dangerous hyperventilation game. David Nuno cut his cartoid artery on a glass tumbler that was lying on the floor in his bedroom and bled to death after he caused himself to fall unconscious playing the 'pass out' game . The teenager was tended to by his father who tried to stem the bleeding with a towel but paramedics and doctors could not save him . 'The victim apparently did what was in the video, fell forward and landed on a drinking glass on the floor,' said Chula Vista Police Captain Gary Wedge. Captain Wedge added that there was no sign of alcohol or drug taking by the boys and strongly advised young people not to immitate any 'pass out' game videos they see on the Internet. 'Nothing good can come out of watching videos like that,' said Wedge. Immediately after David fell onto the glass tumbler, his friend's flipped his body over and told police that the boy came to and ran down their stairs for help, but collapsed on the landing. His father attempted to hold a towel over the wound until paramedics arrived, but the cut to his neck was too deep and David lost too much blood to survive. Videos on YouTube are uploaded by other teens and they instruct teens how to cause themselves to pass out . On Wednesday evening, dozens of the teens friends held a walking vigil for David by making the journey from Chula Vista Community Park to Nuno's home. Some of the teen's upset friends spoke of their disbelief that he had died. 'Now that I'm seeing everyone here, I'm realising it's really true. It's not a dream,' said David's friend Jessica Alcala. The teen's Facebook page carried rest in peace messages and high school friends spoke at the vigil of their distress. 'I couldn't comprehend what was happening,' said Mariam Valenzuela. 'I thought it was a joke. His cousin confirmed it was real. 'It was just horrible.' David Nuno's father was home at the time of the accident in the affluent suburb of Chula Vista in San Diego . At the vigil, the teenagers friends spoke about the 'pass out' game and the dangers that come from copying internet videos. 'It's not a game. It's really serious,' said David's friend Hazel Valenzuela. 'We can use it as an example that something so little can turn into something really horrible.' According to the medical examiner's report, David died from multiple lacerations and sharp force injuries to his neck and had just turned 15 on September 16th. 'He was very funny, very loveable,' said friend June Favela. 'A person you couldn't forget. I saw him just last week and it's so surreal.' David Nuno's friends held a walking vigil from a local park to the teens home in Chula Vista . Psychiatrist Daniel Cowell said that parents and children must be aware of the dangers of the 'pass out' game which has caused the death of several teenagers in recent years. In the 'pass out' game, they say, teenagers deprive themselves of oxygen until they lose consciousness and fall into friends' waiting arms, which can produce a woozy, sometimes addictive euphoria. In 2010, two teenage girls died in the Chicago area after attaching cord to their necks to deprive themselves of oxygen, but because they played the game on their own, they hung themselves to death instead. 'Children think it's safe,' said psychiatrist Daniel Cowell, who has studied the phenomenon, 'It's far from safe.'

"By . Bob Graham . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 15 June 2012 . A Texan tycoon who defrauded almost £5 billion from investors and used his wealth to bankroll international cricket matches in England was jailed for 110 years yesterday. Allen Stanford, who for 22 years ran investment scams with an estimated 17,000 victims, was once one of the richest men in America, worth more than £1.2 billion. The courtroom in Houston was packed with many of his victims to hear the sentence handed down, the majority of whom were small business owners. Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court. Jailbird: Convicted financier Allen Stanford arrives at Federal Court in Houston for sentencing . Jaime Escalona, who represented Latin . American victims, addressed the hearing before turning to stare directly . at Stanford to tell him: 'You, sir, are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.' The other victims’ spokesman, Angela . Shaw, of the Stanford Victims Coalition, said of the fraudster: 'Allen . Stanford has stolen more than billions of dollars. He took our lives as . we knew them.' She said some 28,000 people had lost money in the scam. Yet, even in his final hour of shame . the former tycoon couldn’t help but deny it all and to blame others. 'I’m not a thief.....I did not defraud anybody,' he said. 'The US government are responsible . ruining the business....they destroyed it and turned it to nothing. Stanford was a real brick-and-mortar global financial empire.' Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud . Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared 'indigent' – penniless. The court has now to appoint lawyers . who will be funded out of a scheme similar to Britain’s own legal-aid . and it is estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars. During sentencing, . Stanford’s 40-minute rambling account was the first time he had actually . spoken to the court about what had taken place during the 22-years his . banking empire existed. He claimed he was a scapegoat and . blamed the federal government and a court-appointed receiver who took . over his companies in 2009 for tearing down his business empire and . preventing his investors from getting any of their money back. He said: 'I’m not here to ask for . sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell . you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.' Stanford was once considered one of . the richest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of . more than £1.2billion. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to . Latin America and the Caribbean. Calling Stanford arrogant and without . remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought . certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a . string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish . lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship . of cricket tournaments. Stanford added moments before being . led away: 'If I live the rest of my life in prison... I will always be . at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.' Disgraced tycoon Stanford’s schemes . were the second largest in US financial history – second only to Bernie . Madoff, the so-called ‘King of Con’ - who was given 150 years for his . £11.2-billion Ponzi scheme. The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate.

Happier times: Allen Stanford poses with Stanford Superstars following their victory at the end of the Stanford 20/20 Super Series match between England and Stanford Superstars in 2008 . Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who . lost round £900,000 said outside the court: 'This was a wholesale . failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. They are as responsible. 'Here in Texas we believe in capital . punishment but I would not wish it on Stanford, I want him to wake up . every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all.' Stanford, ever the showman, entered the courtroom dressed in green prison fatigues and grinning all over his face. When handcuffs were taken off he waved . to his elderly mother Sammie Stanford who sat in the well of the court . alongside Stanford’s daughter Randi. Prosecutors had asked the court for a . sentence of 230 years in prison. The prosecutor told Judge David . Hittner: '230 years will not get anyone their money back but on . sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.' In June 2008 Stanford signed a . controversial deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for a . series of five Twenty20 cricket games between England and a Caribbean . side nicknamed the ‘Stanford All-Stars.’ The winners would collect a . prize-fund of £13.6-million and the losers would get nothing.

A medical assistant told a jury that she saw one late-term baby who survived an abortion 'swimming' in a toilet 'trying to get out.' Kareema Cross also claimed she saw the spines of at least 10 babies snipped using scissors during unorthodox late-term abortions at a West Philadelphia clinic. Her revelations came in the last day of testimony before the prosecution rests in the capital murder trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell. Gosnell, 72, a clinic owner, is on trial for the deaths of a patient and seven babies. Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, is accused of killing seven babies that were born alive . In the final day of testimony before . the prosecution rests Kareema Cross, a 'medical assistant' who worked at . Gosnell’s Women’s Medical Society clinic for more than four years . testified in a Philadelphia court room yesterday, CNSNews reported . She spoke of the horror of witnessing babies who had survived abortions only to have their necks snipped in two using scissors. 'Did you ever see those babies move?' asked Prosecutor Joanne Pescatore. 'Yes, once in the toilet,' said Cross. The baby 'was like swimming,' she said. 'Basically, trying to get out.' Other employees at the clinic also confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.' The doctor: Kermit Gosnell . Charged: Pearl Gosnell . Employee: Elizabeth Hampton . Arrested: Tina Baldwin . Assistant: Lynda Williams . Worker: Adrine Moton . Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil . Mugshot: Sherry West . Held: Maddline Joe . Many pregnant women were given drugs to induce labor. Cross, who worked at the clinic from . 2005 to 2009, was so disturbed by its operation that she took photos and . called authorities, although she gave a relative's name. In 2007, Cross herself became . pregnant and wanted to have an abortion but decided to not have the . procedure at the clinic, citing the unsanitary conditions. Employee Latosha Lewis said 'one or . two babies fell out of patients each night. They dropped on lounge . chairs, on the floor, and often in the toilet.' 'If a baby was about to come out, I . would take the woman to the bathroom, they would sit on the toilet and . basically the baby would fall out and it would be in the toilet and I . would be rubbing her back and trying to calm her down for two, three, . four hours until Dr. Gosnell comes,” Lewis told the grand jury. Gosnell preferred to have the babies . fall out of their mother because 'it made his job easier,' according to a . Grand Jury report. The report goes on to state: 'If fetuses had not . precipitated, Gosnell would often have his staff physically push them . out of their mothers by pressing in the mother’s abdomens.' The 2011 grand jury report blasts state . and city officials for failing to inspect or shutter Gosnell's busy . clinic in West Philadelphia. The 300-page grand jury report, that . initially laid out the charges against Gosnell, details the appalling . conditions of the West Philadelphia clinic the doctor operated. It . was described as reeking of cat urine, with walls splattered with blood . and patient rooms filled with unsanitary instruments and broken- down . equipment. The tiny fetuses and many of their . bodyparts were piled high throughout Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and . freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, even cat-food containers. Jars with severed feet lined shelves, prosecutors said. 'It was a baby charnel house,' the grand jury repor said. House of horror: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . Adrienne Moton, an employee at the . clinic, then took the baby and snipped the back of its neck while the . mother was still in the room. Cross explained to the jury that the largest baby she saw was when Shayquana Abrams came into the clinic in July 2008. Dr. Gosnell took the baby boy, which . was described as around 12 to 18 inches long, and placed him into a . plastic box about the size of a shoebox. 'The baby was still breathing, he didn’t cut the neck right there.' he said. 'I called people over to come see it and we took pictures,' she said. The baby boy was in the fetal position and was laying on his side in the box. The image of the baby taken by Cross was shown to the court. She added that baby was supposed to be placed into a freezer but was still laying on the table the next day. Gosnell later joked that the baby was so big he could have walked to the bus stop. 'Filthy': Investigators say Gosnell's clinic, the Women's Medical Society, catered to minorities, immigrants and poor women. It was also allegedly the site of unimaginable filth . Shayquana Abrams was 17 when she went to the Women’s Medical Society for a late-term abortion on July, 12, 2008. Earlier in the trial, Abrams testified that she was 29 weeks pregnant. Abortions after 24 weeks are illegal in Pennsylvania. Cross also testified that she witnessed Steven Massof, an unlicensed medical school graduate, snip babies necks  25 to 30 times and sometimes removed the brain through the opening. Dr. Gosnell would cut the back of . their necks with scissors, she said, but the doctor would simply announce . the babies were not breathing. Cross has pleaded guilty to federal drug . charges for administering medications at the clinic, and hopes to get . probation for her cooperation. Scene: A police car is seen outside the the Women's Medical Society in 2011 following Gosnell's arrest . Cross took photos of the clinic in 2008 because she had concerns. Other photos shown in court depicted more than 50 jars filled with baby's feet. Other pictures showed the clinic's . cat roaming freely around the place including supposedly sterile . procedure room along with the bathroom on the first and second floors. Equipment in the clinic was also covered in blood. The trial of Gosnell is currently in . its fifth week. He is charged with, among other crimes, the first-degree . murder of seven babies who had been born alive during abortions and . then killed after their spinal cords had been snipped. The defense has denied that babies . were born alive and will begin its case on Monday.","Kareema Cross claims she saw spines snipped of babies that were still alive .

"By . Martha De Lacey . PUBLISHED: . 07:12 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:29 EST, 31 May 2013 . A mother-of-two whose quest for the perfect bottom led to a quadruple limb and buttock amputation has warned other women against black market silicone injections. Hair stylist Apryl Michelle Brown, from LA, spent five years in excruciating pain when an unlicensed practitioner injected her buttocks with bathroom sealant, telling her it was silicone, in order to enhance them. Doctors had no idea how to treat the botched implants and told her she might have to live with the agony, but when they finally operated the injections became so badly infected she was induced into a coma. It was only when she awoke two months later that Apryl, now 46, discovered the lengths medical staff had gone to to keep her alive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forty-six-year-old Apryl, who lives in Los Angeles, endured black-market silicone injections that a surgeon later identified as nothing more than bathroom sealant . Speaking on to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford ITV's This Morning via satellite link, Apryl explained that as a child she had been teased for having a 'flat butt' and developed a complex, so when a woman came into her salon in 2004 saying she had had silicone injections, Apryl thought she had been 'sent from God'. She said: 'I thought she was a blessing. I hadn't done any other research so I didn't know all the horror stories. I went to someone's private home - she wasn't licensed, but I didn't know that then - and lay on her daughter's bed, wearing special panties with the butt removed. 'She told me I'd need four sets of injections, and when she started to do them it was very painful. I could feel it going into my nerves and muscles.' The pain did subside, and Apryl returned for a second lot of injections. It was as she left the house the second time that she had 'an epiphany'. 'I thought, what are you doing? And that was a sign from God to stop.' Soon after, things began to go dramatically wrong. First the area around the injections began to discolour, then become itchy, then incredibly painful, described by Apryl as 'like a toothache, labour pain and a migraine'. She sought medical advice and the general consensus was that doctors had no idea what to do. Most told her the chemical could not be removed and that she would have to live with the pain. 'Eventually they went in and removed the silicone, along with the butt cheeks,' said Apryl. 'It was then it became infected and they gave me 24 hours to live. I remember feeling relieved when I heard that.' Doctors induced Apryl into a coma and carried out 27 operations, including a buttock amputation and a quadruple lower arm and lower leg amputation. 'I didn't know this until I came around,' she said. 'When I woke up I had no butt and I wasn't in pain anymore.' Apryl taliking to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford live via satellite link on ITV's This Morning . Apryl said: 'When I got the injections I already had great self esteem. I thought I was just enhancing myself. But looking back, I see there must have been an extreme issue' Apryl, who recently completed a three-mile walk, 10-mile cycle and 150m swim for charity, said she wishes to use the experience to teach other women about the dangers of vanity. She said: 'I don't think God gives you opportunity to live again without using it to stop others. I want to teach that we mustn't ever look for something outside ourselves to validate ourselves. 'We're already born whole and perfect and complete, and nothing we do on the outside will make us change on the inside. 'When I got the injections I already had great self esteem. I thought I was just enhancing myself. But looking back, I see there must have been an extreme issue.' A British student died after . jetting to America for an illegal 'butt enhancement' operation in the hopes that having a shapelier backside would make her a hip-hop star. Camilla Aredotimi, 20, hoped buttock implants would make her a hip-hop star . Claudia . Aderotimi, 20, believed a 'bigger booty' would help in her quest to . appear in more music videos, her distraught friends claimed following her death in February 2011. One . even revealed the aspiring dancer - stagename Carmella London - was . dropped from one shoot because directors discovered she had been wearing . padded trousers to help enlarge her bottom. Talent . scout Tee Ali, who met the university student when she filmed a video, . told The Sun: 'She was a dancer and choreographer. 'The problem was she didn't have no butt, and she wanted a butt. 'She went to audition for one video shoot wearing fake booty pants and she got all the attention. 'But when they found out it was fake she didn't get asked back.' He described her as 'victim' of social pressure to be perfect and thought a larger bottom would make her famous.' The Thames Valley University student . developed chest pains and struggled for breath 12 hours after she had . the illegal silicone injections at a budget hotel. She was taken to hospital but could not be saved. A preliminary examination found the silicone filler had leaked into her bloodstream, leading to heart failure. American . detectives are investigating whether she was treated with cheap . ‘industrial’ silicone, normally used as a sealant, rather than . medical-grade material used in breast implant surgery.

Aspiring dancer: Friends claimed Miss Aderotimi was the victim of social pressure to have a larger bottom . It was not the first time Miss Aderotimi had had the procedure. She is believed to have been treated in November 2010 - her 2011 injection may have been a 'top-up' procedure. Accompanied by three friends, she . travelled from London to Philadelphia for the treatment, thought to have . been an early present to herself for her 21st birthday . Bootylicious: Nicki Minaj has become almost as famous for her posterior as for her voice . But a day later she was dead. Buttock enhancement surgery is . becoming popular in the U.S., among women who aspire to the shapely . curves of Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and singer Nicki Minaj. Minaj has become almost as famous for . her posterior as for her voice, and rumours have spread across the web . that the Massive Attack singer underwent surgery or uses pads to boost . her bum, especially on urban gossip sites such as Bossip and . mediatakeout.com. She, however denies having had surgery. The illusion of a larger backside has . become increasingly more fashionable among young women since the rise . of the 'Hip Hop Honey' phenomenon. A bigger behind has become almost a prerequisite for any aspiring dancer wanting to make it on the music video scene. But the hip hop industry has come under . fire for objectifying women in music videos where dancers - or Hip Hop . Honeys - chasing fame can often leave themselves open to financial and . sexual exploitation. And in their desperation to beat off the competition, many resort to surgery to get ahead. 'Top up' procedures are only legal when the silicone . gel is contained and sealed within an implant. But illegal injections of . the material are also widely available from unlicensed back-room medics. One expert said having a . direct injection of silicone gel - long outlawed in the U.S. and . Britain, even for breast surgery - is 'like playing Russian roulette'. Miss Aderotimi and her friends flew to Philadelphia and paid around £100 for the room. Miss Aderotimi's buttock . injections are  thought to have cost around £1,300 - while her . friend had the same procedure along with a hip enhancement treatment. The 'doctor' who injected the silicone left soon after and was not there when Miss Aderotimi began complaining of chest pains. Paramedics were called to the hotel . and she was taken to Mercy Fitzgerald hospital where she died 90 minutes . after being admitted. Dr Rajiv Grover, president-elect of . the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘Buttock . augmentation isn’t a very commonly done procedure here, which is . probably why these girls have resorted to going abroad. 'If correctly . done, it involves implanting solid silicone implants into the buttock . just like breast implants. Paul Harris, consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, warned against going overseas for such treatments . Young women are taking enormous risks in pursuit of a smoother, rounder bottom, an expert said. Paul Harris, consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, warned against going overseas for such treatments. 'Bottom augmentation is becoming more popular and originated in South America, in places like Brazil,' he said. 'More and more people are coming forward in the UK for this procedure.' a . A former Miss Argentina, Solange Magnano, died at 38 in 2010 after a buttocks-enhancement procedure at a medical clinic in Buenos Aires. Mr Harris said he had dealt with two patients who suffered problems after receiving silicone jabs overseas. 'The problems are two fold,' he said. 'Firstly, if you use a low volume amount of silicone it can promote rejection - the body trying to ward it off. That causes a long-term abscess which can damage the surrounding tissue. 'Elsewhere in the world it has been reported to cause problems with pulmonary embolism, a blood clot to the lungs, which may have happened in this most recent case.' The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery says the safety of the use of liquid injectable silicone for cosmetic purposes is controversial, and should not be used outside legitimately approved clinical trials.","Apryl Michelle Brown, 46, mother-of-two and hair stylist from LA .

Spaniards are being called on to supply food parcels to their poverty-stricken counterparts as the nation’s economic crisis continues to bite. Spain’s Red Cross today launches a drastic appeal for €30 million - a move which in recent years has been reserved for helping famine-hit African nations and earthquake-ravaged Haiti. It is the first time the agency’s annual campaign has focused solely on aiding people in its own country and will see essential food supplies handed out to 2.3 million ‘extremely vulnerable’ citizens over the next two years. Recession: Unemployed men and women queue up at a job center in Madrid as the Spanish Red Cross announces its first drive for donations to aid the country's own population . The figure of those in need has already risen dramatically - from 1.5 million in 2010 to 2 million in 2011. Families are being called on to donate money, as part of the Red Cross’s annual Dia de la Banderita (Little Flag Day) fundraising day, for the food parcels. Pasta, rice, olive oil, vegetables and canned fish will be delivered to children living below the poverty-line, pensioners, the homeless and the long-term jobless. An advert to be broadcast on national television will show a family - a father, son and daughter - sharing an omelette made from a single egg. A Red Cross food parcel arrives and their mood lifts. Austerity: Protestors demonstrating against cuts earlier this year in Spain where 2.3 million are now considered 'extremely vulnerable' and in need of Red Cross help . With one-in-four Spaniards unemployed and the country in its second recession in three years, Red Cross director José Javier Sánchez Espinosa echoed the appeal’s slogan by saying the money was needed ‘Now More Than Ever’. He said: ‘We have observed that there has been a serious deterioration in the social situation. Because of that, for the first time, we ask for support in helping the Spanish population.’ He added that, last year, of the two million helped by the agency’s social programme, a disturbing 1.7 million were living below the poverty line, earning less than €627,78 per month.

The IMF said Spain’s economy would contract by 1.3 per cent next year, compared to a government forecast of 0.5 per cent. This would see the country’s deficit spiralling to 7 per cent of GDP in 2012 and 5.7 per cent in 2013 - significantly higher than the EU-agreed targets of 6.3 per cent and 4.5 per cent.","International aid organisation launches appeal for €30 million .

Saenz de Santamaria said that she discussed with Geithner some of the ideas being discussed in Europe about how to set up a fund to recapitalise European banks. She said: 'The problem is not Spain as a country. But our financial system in a given moment has needs just like the other states had at other times.' Crisis: Spain's government nationalised major bank Bankia earlier this month, and now says it needs to inject $23.6billion in public money into the bank . Eurozone unemployment has hit a record high and job losses are likely to keep climbing as the debt crisis eats away at businesses' ability to hire workers while indebted governments continue to cut staff. Around 17.4million people were out of work in the 17-nation eurozone in April (11 per cent of the working population) - the highest level since records began in 1995, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said today. 'This 11 percent level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year,' said Francois Cabau, an economist at Barclays Capital who sees the eurozone's economy contracting 0.1 per cent this year. 'The economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market. There's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year and indicators are pointing to very weak growth momentum for the second quarter,' he said. ING economist Martin van Vliet said he sees the unemployment rate reaching slightly above 11.5 per cent if the economy starts to recover later this year. But if the downturn worsens, 'the risk is for an even higher peak in unemployment,' he said. As the debt crisis intensifies, companies in the euro zone are trying to keep their labour costs low as they struggle with falling demand and profits, while a German-led drive to cut deficits and debt is pressuring governments to shrink spending. But some economists say austerity policies in an economic downturn are self-defeating because governments receive less tax receipts as unemployment grows and must pay out more money in jobless benefits. The denial comes as senior European . officials last night issued a grave warning that the very survival of . the euro is at risk as the crisis in Spain threatens to tear the region . apart. Politicians and . central bankers said the situation in the eurozone was unsustainable and . drastic action was needed to prevent the ‘disintegration’ of the single . currency. They spoke out as European leaders . scrambled to stop the financial crisis in Spain spiralling out of . control and infecting other countries such as Italy. The . euro crashed to a 23-month low against the US dollar at $1.2335 but was . up slightly against sterling having recovered from its lowest level . since late 2008. Last night, £1 was worth €1.2460. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said the eurozone was unsustainable in its current form. In his sharpest criticism yet of eurozone leaders’ handling of the crisis, he said the European Central Bank could not ‘fill the vacuum’ left by governments in terms of economic growth or structural reforms. And he called for overwhelming force to be used to shore up Europe’s battered banks to restore confidence in the financial system. Ignazio Visco, governor of the Bank of Italy and a senior ECB member, said political inertia and bad economic decisions have put ‘the entire European edifice’ at risk. ‘There are growing doubts among international investors about governments’ ability to ensure the survival of the single currency,’ he said. Olli Rehn, EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said bold action was required ‘if we want to avoid a disintegration of the eurozone’. The apocalyptic tone from usually measured EU officials betrayed the spreading sense of panic. Irish voters are likely to approve a European treaty on budget discipline in yesterday’s referendum – securing continued aid. The result will be announced later today. But the outcome of a second Greek election on June 17 – seen as crucial for the country’s future in the eurozone – is too close to call.","World finance bosses deny rumours of staggering bailout plan .

"By . Andy Dolan . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 14 September 2011 . Eastern European workers at a Waterstone’s warehouse have accused bosses of ‘human rights abuses’ after they were ordered to speak English to workmates. The mainly Polish and Latvian staff at a Midlands distribution centre must use only English during working hours, but are free to talk in their native  language during breaks. A novel idea: Waterstone's has banned its distribution centre staff from speaking all languages apart from English . This is to prevent English colleagues feeling ‘marginalised’ and ‘isolated’, while also ensuring that instructions and health and safety rules are heeded. But the immigrant workers, who make up around half the 120-strong workforce, claim the policy is discriminatory. They have drawn up a petition to hand to bosses which claims the rules constitute ‘breaches of their human rights’. The rules have been implemented by logistics firm Unipart, which operates the site at Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, for the book retailer. The foreign workers, who also come from countries such as Lithuania, Hungary, South Africa and Iraq, are being backed by the Unite union. Freedom of speech: Unite union, led by General Secretary Len McCluskey (above) defends the workers' rights to speak their native language . Unite spokesman Rick Coyle said: ‘It is ridiculous to  employ lots of people from other countries while insisting they must speak among themselves only in English. Unipart has a lot to learn about human nature and respect.’ A spokesman for Unipart said: ‘In order to work at the warehouse all workers must speak English because they will be  following instructions and being managed in English. ‘If half of the workforce speak English and the other half speak other languages then this is not conducive to teamwork and can be divisive.’","Eastern European staff day move is a breach of their human rights .
