"With its 12th-century church, clutch of newsagents and parade of  high-street shops, the town of Stevenage, Herts, is a rather unlikely setting for a treasure hunt. But almost everyone here is taking part in a desperate quest for loot, leaving no stone — or sofa cushion — unturned. For today is D-Day: the 180th day since someone in the area bought a winning EuroMillions ticket. The owner of the £2 ticket stands to win almost £64 million — but has until just 11pm tonight to claim their jackpot. Wealthy: The winner of the £64million jackpot would find themselves suddenly richer than Stevenage's most famous sons Harry Potter star Rupert Grint, left, and F1 star Lewis Hamilton . If the ticket isn’t found in time, every penny of the £63,837,543.460 (not to mention the £645,000 interest that the prize money has already accrued) will go to the National Lottery Good Causes fund to be distributed to charities around the country. Should the winning ticket remain elusive, it will represent the largest unclaimed prize in British lottery history. No wonder everyone who has ever bought a Lottery ticket in Stevenage and nearby Hitchin is frantically checking their coat pockets, rifling through their car’s glove compartment and ransacking the kitchen drawers. Posters with ‘Are You Missing £63.8 Million?’ in a big black and yellow font are plastered to shop windows. ‘It’s non-stop,’ says Shilla Sachania, who runs the Chocolate Box news-agent on Stevenage High Street with her husband Umesh. There, more than 1,000 Lottery tickets are sold each week. ‘Everybody’s been checking their ticket to see if they won,’ says Shilla. ‘We’ve had people come in and try to claim with other tickets — all sorts of combinations. ‘There have been tickets dating back months but none with the right  combination of numbers. ‘One customer employed a cleaner especially to sweep through her house and see if it was under a sofa anywhere — but it wasn’t. Imagine losing such a valuable ticket!’ Winner: Past Stevenage lottery winners include Sharon Creighton pictured celebrating with her son James at Knebworth House in 2005 . The prize money would allow the winner to buy 339 houses at the  average Stevenage price of £190,000  or — should the urge take them — more than two million bottles of champagne. It would also make them a good deal richer than the commuter town’s most glamorous son, F1 driver Lewis Hamilton (who is worth a reported £55 million), and almost three times wealthier than local Harry Potter star Rupert Grint (worth a relatively paltry £24 million). Ever since the winning numbers were announced on June 8, Camelot has been urging locals to find and check any tickets they may have forgotten about or lost. Vans bearing the slogan ‘It Could Be You’ have been driven around town. Leafleteers have been stationed on the High Street. They even erected a giant sofa a few weeks ago to encourage residents to look under their cushions. Theories as to what could have happened to the ticket abound. A popular one is that the owner lost it after a few too many at the local Marquis of Lorne pub. ‘I’ve had punters come in and ask if I’ve seen anything lying around,’ says barman Tony Geary. ‘One guy bought a ticket then went out that night, before going on  holiday. When he came back he was moving house and couldn’t find his ticket, so he thought it could be here. But it wasn’t.’ Another theory is that the winner has moved abroad — or even died. Far more likely is that the ticket has simply been misplaced or thrown away by mistake. Camelot deals with countless claims from people who’ve lost their ticket. Most come to nothing. In 2001 Martyn Tott, a purchasing manager from Watford, missed out on a jackpot of £3,011,065 after losing his ticket. Using computer records, he was able to prove the winning ticket was his but Camelot refused to pay out — since the rules state that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune. The decision sparked a national furore, with even the then Prime  Minister Tony Blair championing Mr Tott’s cause — but all in vain. Despite three lengthy court cases against Camelot he ended up without a penny. Loser: Martyn Tott, from Watford, missed out on a £3million jackpot when he didn't claim a lottery win in time . In 2004, £7 million went unclaimed in Belfast, and in September 2007 a £6.9 million win wasn’t claimed in Devon. So far, the largest unclaimed sum is £9.4 million, on a ticket that was bought in Doncaster in July 2005. Camelot’s Simon Horne says: ‘We all want winners to get their money but there must be a deadline. Otherwise every prize would just go on indefinitely. But this way billions of pounds have gone to good causes over the years — from funding the Olympics through bodies like Sport England to local playgroups and Scout clubs.’ Still, the psychological fallout of a near miss can be devastating. After Mr Tott was denied his millions he plunged into depression, separated from his partner and moved to America, where he joined an evangelical cult. He has since returned and, claiming to have found happiness, written a book about his ordeal. Residents in Stevenage can readily imagine the pain of losing a winning ticket. Marion Johnson, 56, a human resources manager, says: ‘Can you imagine? It would be awful. It’s money that could completely change your life. If that were me, I’d feel sick.’ Not to mention more than a little bit silly. After all, how could anyone misplace a piece of paper that could change their lives so dramatically? ‘They don’t deserve to win if you ask me,’ puffs 75-year-old retired telecoms engineer Don Collins. His wife Sheila agrees. ‘Who plays the Lottery and doesn’t check their ticket?’ she says. Deadline: An unlucky lottery winner stands to lose £64million unless they claim their prize by 11pm . Others are more sympathetic. At the Boys To Men Barbers on the High Street, Craig Chalkright has been searching through his shop after losing a ticket he bought on the same day as the elusive winner. ‘I’ve looked everywhere,’ he says. ‘In the end I called Camelot and told them when and where I bought it. They wrote back to me with a photocopy of my ticket, proving that I had not won anything.’ Of course, the treasure hunt would not be needed if Camelot revealed  the precise place where the winning ticket was sold. Purchasing records mean that they can easily identify the shop — but the company’s licence forbids it from making that information public in order to maximise the winner’s chances of anonymity. Retired shop worker Desmond Wales says this is wrong and that Camelot should check CCTV footage in the shop where the ticket was sold. ‘It would save the rest of us a lot of bother,’ he adds. Still not knowing if they sold the ticket, newsagents Shilla and Umesh Sachania have erected a huge  mock-up of what the winning ticket would look like. They say: ‘It would be brilliant if someone claimed the money at the last minute. Hopefully they’d share it out. It would be very exciting.’ Very exciting indeed — though with only hours left to track down the ticket, the chances are fast dwindling. But, you never know. Three years ago, a Lottery winner scooped £2.5 million just before the 180-day deadline expired. So, Stevenage, keep rummaging — it could still be you.","An 11pm deadline has been set for the winner of the Euromillions jackpot from June 8 to claim their prize .

"BBC political editor Nick Robinson has apologised for directly quoting a source who used the phrase 'of Muslim appearance' The BBC's political editor has apologised for directly quoting a Whitehall source who described the Woolwich killers as being 'of Muslim appearance'. Nick Robinson said he was sorry for using the phrase, which 'was both liable to be misinterpreted and to cause offence', during the BBC News at Six broadcast yesterday. The corporation received dozens of complaints after he used the comment just hours after British soldier Lee Rigby, 25, was brutally murdered in the street. Robinson today took to his BBC blog to apologise for using the phrase. He explains how he was informed by a senior Whitehall source just minutes before the BBC News at Six yesterday that the incident was being treated as a suspected terrorist incident. He wrote: 'The police had, I was told, described the attackers as being ""of Muslim appearance"" and shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". On air I directly quoted a senior Whiehall source saying that the police had used that description. 'That phrase ""of Muslim appearance"" clearly offended some who demanded to know what it could possibly mean. Others were concerned that it was a racist generalisation.' The BBC received a total of 43 complaints after Robinson used the phrase, The Guardian has reported. Robinson's report was also picked up by other media organisations who reported it as evidence that the incident was a terror attack. The dead soldier, who was wearing a Help for Heroes top, was hit by a Vauxhall Tigra on the pavement before two crazed men attacked him with knives. Witnesses said the suspects 'hacked and chopped' at his body and were shouting 'Allah Akbar!' - an Islamic phrase meaning 'God is great' - and yelling 'this is what God would have wanted.' One of the men was identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, who ranted on camera with a clear south London accent saying 'you people will never be safe'. The suspected killers were later shot by police and will be questioned by anti-terror officers once they have recovered. Robinson took to his BBC blog today to apologise for using the phrase . One of the alleged attackers (left) rants at the camera while holding bloodied weapons. A second suspected killer (right) speaks to Ingrid Loyau-Kennett who jumped off her bus when she saw the dead man . Robinson wrote on his blog: 'The reports of eye witnesses and the video of the attacker demonstrated that the attack had been carried out by those claiming to be retaliating because ""Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers"". 'Despite this and the fact that I was directly quoting a source I'm sorry for using a phrase that, on reflection, was both liable to be misinterpreted and to cause offence. Many Muslims were quick to condemn the attack and to distance themselves and their religion from the brutal savagery seen on the streets of Woolwich.' The comment yesterday sparked complaints from users on social networking and micro-blogging sites, including Hannah McGill, a film reviewer and panellist on BBC Four's Review Show, who wrote on Twitter: 'Whatever just happened, @BBCNews, it is entirely not OK for your correspondents to refer to anyone as ""of Muslim appearance"".' A picture of victim Drummer Lee Rigby, of the British Army's 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, is displayed with flowers left by mourners outside an army barracks near the scene of his killing in Woolwich . A Help for Heroes t-shirt was left among the floral tributes in recognition of the top the soldier was wearing at the time of his death . It was a barbaric attack carried out in broad daylight on the streets of London. A man hacked to death. The attackers had been shot by the police. An extraordinary and horrific story but not one, you might think, for the Political Editor of the BBC. However, the fact that the victim was wearing a 'Help for Heroes' T-shirt and was walking near an army barracks raised the possibility that it was something else as well - an act of terrorism with implications for the country as a whole. That was my instinct as soon as I heard about the story, but instinct is not enough. I started to try to establish whether the government was treating it that way. With minutes to go before the BBC News at Six I was told by a senior Whitehall source that the incident was being treated as a suspected terrorist incident and being taken very seriously indeed. This information changed the news from a crime story to something of more significance. The police had, I was told, described the attackers as being 'of Muslim appearance' and shouting 'Allahu Akbar'. On air I directly quoted a senior Whitehall source saying that the police had used that description. That phrase 'of Muslim appearance' clearly offended some who demanded to know what it could possibly mean. Others were concerned that it was a racist generalisation. My report and the quotation were picked up by many other news organisations as evidence that this was a terror attack. The reports of eye witnesses and the video of the attacker demonstrated that the attack had been carried out by those claiming to be retaliating because 'Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers'. Despite this and the fact that I was directly quoting a source I'm sorry for using a phrase that, on reflection, was both liable to be misinterpreted and to cause offence. Many Muslims were quick to condemn the attack and to distance themselves and their religion from the brutal savagery seen on the streets of Woolwich. The overnight protests of the English Defence League and attacks on some mosques lead some to fear the consequences for community relations. This all makes people understandably sensitive about anything which could be used to justify hostility to people on the basis of their appearance or religion.","Nick Robinson used the phrase hours after soldier Lee Rigby was murdered .

"Curtis Elton is a perfectly normal nine-year-old boy. He loves football. His favourite band is One Direction. And his favourite cartoon is Phineas And Ferb on the Disney Channel. But he has an exceptional talent. When he sits down at the enormous white grand piano in the sitting room of his parents’ home, you realise Curtis is a little bit different. For a brief moment, he is perfectly still, fingers hovering over the keys. Then, suddenly, he’s off like a rocket, launching into a Bach prelude and fugue in D minor. Piano player Curtis Elton, nine, is releasing an album after becoming the youngest person in the world to pass a university-level piano diploma . Curtis' ATCL Diploma took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice. His mother Haley, pictured with him left, is also a pianist . There’s a look of intense concentration on his face. His fingers whizz up and down the keys as he switches into a Chopin etude in E major. The entire piece of music – lasting around 10 minutes – is done from memory. There’s not a sheet of music in sight. From the other side of the room, his mum Hayley, 40, looks on with pride. Curtis - all 4ft 3in of him - is a musical prodigy, a mini Mozart, a budding Beethoven. He plays to concert halls and has just become the youngest person in the world to be given an Associate of Trinity College London (ATCL) diploma. The diploma – which took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice – is the equivalent of passing the first-year of a university music degree.Curtis had to play for more than half an hour in a church hall in St Albans, not far from their home in . Curtis began playing when he was just three . Whetstone, north London, in front of an examiner. The other two piano students sitting the exam that day were much older - 19 and 38. ‘I was nervous before I went in,’ he giggles now. ‘But when I sit down at the piano, I feel calm and relaxed. I think: “I’m just going to sit here for a few seconds and start.”’ He also had to write 700 words of ‘programme notes’ explaining his choice of pieces – the Bach he plays today, as well as a Mozart sonata in D major and a Schubert impromptu in G flat major. He says he did these himself at the computer in the upstairs study without help from his mum Hayley or his dad, Jonathan, 45, a graphic designer. This remarkable achievement is the culmination of six years of hard work. Curtis started playing at the age of three after begging Hayley, herself a professional concert pianist and piano teacher, for a go while she was playing. ‘I used to play him lullabies before bed,’ she says. ‘Because I was doing it, he wanted to. So I taught him his scales.’ The first song he learned in full was Yankee Doodle Went To Town – rapidly followed by the Pink Panther theme and then Beethoven’s Ode To Joy. ‘I realised he was talented almost immediately. He picked things up very quickly,’ says Hayley. At the age of four, Curtis could read music by sight and took his Royal School of Music Grade One exam. ‘When we turned up at the exam centre, they thought it was me taking the exam,’ laughs his mum. ‘He was so little that he had to helped up onto the piano stool.’ He passed and has since has whizzed through the grades. He passed the final one, Grade Eight, last year, becoming the youngest pianist ever to do so. His first concert performance was three years ago, when a friend of his mum asked if he would play at a show to raise money for the homeless. He chose a piece by Schumann. Curtis aged seven, when he had already passed his grade eight piano exam . Now he gives several performances a year - playing three times at the Chopin museum in Mallorca and performing in front of an audience of more than 2,000 people at Birmingham’s International Convention Centre. ‘I was a teensy bit nervous,’ says Curtis. ‘But it was exciting.’ In 2011, piano manufacturers Yamaha invited him to the firm’s HQ in Milton Keynes headquarters and offered to sponsor Curtis, loaning him keyboards for performances. Not that it has all been plain sailing. Two years ago, Curtis was hugely disappointed when he entered ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent contest. After receiving a standing ovation from the judges at the audition stage, he was told to prepare to return for the televised announcement of the semi-finalists two months later. But two days before filming, he received a call saying that, in fact, he hadn’t made it through. No reason was given. ‘We were all set to go – we had a hotel booked in central London and everything,’ says Hayley. ‘Curtis had his suitcase packed – we were very disappointed.’ ‘I was looking forward to playing for the Queen,’ adds Curtis, wistfully. Two years ago, Curtis was hugely disappointed when he entered ITV's Britain¿s Got Talent contest . He was heartbroken. Perhaps, Simon Cowell’s low-brow musical tastes don’t stretch to Chopin and Schumann. Bouncing back from that setback, Curtis had the challenge of juggling piano practice with his Year Five school work at the £16,000-a-year Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School in Hertfordshire. Though an average week involves six hours of piano practice, his mum says school work is his priority. ‘We only ever practice piano if he’s finished his homework, and though he receives a couple of invitations to perform each month, he can only do concerts on weekends or in the school holidays.’ Even once his homework’s done, piano isn’t the only after-school activity. Curtis is a keen ice skater and footballer. He and his eight-year-old sister Sophia – who plays the piano and the harp - take lessons at the local Lee Valley Ice Rink. Curtis also plays defence for the school football team. Despite his musical talent, his mother says homework always comes first . And it all has to be fitted in before bed at 8pm. It’s an awful lot for one little boy, but his mum insists she is no Tiger Mother. ‘It’s important he has other interests. I’d never dream of sending him to a stage school. He’s intelligent and needs a proper education and normal friends.’ She says that had he not been so eager to learn in the first place, she wouldn’t have forced him to take up piano. ‘I don’t want to push him but he loves performing. He loves music – I can’t imagine him not wanting to do it. ‘ . Does she ever worry about the effect of so much success so young? There’s no shortage of cautionary tales about child prodigies collapsing under the weight of expectation. ‘I think within classical music there are child prodigies – such as the Chinese pianist Lang Lang – who go on to do well,’ says Hayley. ‘And Curtis has balance. He has a normal school life and normal friends.’ What if he were to lose interest and pack it all in? ‘I wouldn’t mind if he really didn’t want to do it. But he’s got a talent and to be able to play and make people happy is a rare thing. It makes him happy, so it would be a shame.’ Listening to Curtis reeling off his favourite composers - Bach and Schubert and Chopin and Mozart (‘because he’s fast and fun’) and pianists (‘Lang Lang and Elton John’) - it’s hard to disagree. He’s bubbly and confident and bursting with energy, bustling around showing me YouTube videos of Elton John playing Circle of Life on Hayley’s iPad and talking excitedly about his football heroes, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. I can’t imagine him being forced into anything. He’s clearly mad about playing. Happily, Curtis says he’s ‘definitely not’ tempted to quit piano – not even if he got the chance to join One Direction. In November, he plans to release a CD and wants to take the next qualification – equivalent to a full three-year undergraduate degree. He also wants to learn how to compose and conduct. When he leaves school, he wants to go to university to study politics and maths. And then what – can he see himself becoming a professional pianist? ‘Well, if my piano gets very good, I’d like to be a piano player with an orchestra,’ he says, thoughtfully. ‘But I’d like to be Prime Minister as well - and maybe a doctor.’ Blimey. A concert-giving, piano-playing, doctor Prime Minister? David Cameron had better watch out.","He is youngest person to be given an ATCL diploma .

"A woman has spoken of her 'total shock' at becoming pregnant with triplets while taking the contraceptive pill. Christie Fletcher, 22, insists she had been taking the medication 'religiously' at the same time every day. Despite this, doctors say she has beaten odds of 25,000 to one to give birth to non-identical triplets - something that only usually happens with the help of IVF. Her sons Jorj, Isaac and Jac arrived four months ago and are all in perfect health. Christie Fletcher, 22, became pregnant with her non-identical triple sons despite taking the contraceptive pill 'religiously' at the same time every day . Her sons Jorj, Isaac and Jac. Doctors say she has beaten odds of 25,000 to one to give birth to the non-identical triplets - something that only usually happens with the help of IVF . Miss Fletcher, pictured left just before the triplets were born, was already mother to two-year-old Osian when she and her partner Carwyn, 27 (right) got the astonishing news . Miss Fletcher, from Glyn Ceriog, Wrexham, was already mother to two-year-old  Osian, when she and her partner Carwyn, 27, got the astonishing news. She said: 'I was so shocked to find that I was pregnant again. I had been taking my pill carefully and never in a million years did I expect to end up with triplets. 'I was on the pill when I fell pregnant with Osian, but I hadn't really been that careful in making sure I took it at the same time. 'After I had him, I was so strict about taking my pill every day as according to instructions - I took it religiously at the same time every single day. 'There was no way on earth I ever thought I'd end up pregnant again.' But she suspected something was up when she randomly began to start feeling sick. 'I was at a bonfire party when I didn't know if I wanted to eat a burger or be sick. My hormones were all over the place and I recognised the feeling from my first pregnancy, but I told myself I couldn't be pregnant as I had been taking my Pill.' The couple were in for more even more of a shock when they attended their first scan and the nurse broke the news they were expecting triplets . The boys arrived four months ago and are all in perfect health. Jorj was the biggest of the three, weighing 4lbs 13oz, while his brother Isaac weighed 4lb 8oz and Jac weighed just 4lbs 3.5oz . Concerned, she decided to do a pregnancy test and was 'gobsmacked' to find out she was expecting. Dr Surabhi Nanda, from Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'According to Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, with perfect use, the failure rate of the combined pill is 0.3 per cent and with typical use is around nine per cent. 'Certain medications including some antibiotics or anti epilepsy drugs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill and thereby increase the failure rates. 'As such, the chance of having a naturally conceived triplet pregnancy is approximately 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 births and even rarer for non-identical triplets. 'It is difficult to say whether the getting pregnant on the pill and conceiving a triplet pregnancy are directly related, as the odds of both the events happening concurrently are indeed very low.' She said: 'I was stunned - and Carwyn was as shocked and surprised as I was. I had only just had my first born and suddenly we were having another. I had been taking my pill every day so I couldn't believe I was pregnant.' The couple were in for more even more of a shock when they attended their first scan and the nurse broke the news they were expecting triplets. Miss Fletcher said: 'When I was having my bump scanned, I knew something was up. 'The nurses went very quiet and were staring at each other, smiling but with a look of disbelief on their face. 'They told me to look at the screen, and I could see three little babies in there. 'I just said ""Oh my god"" and couldn't believe it - I thought I was in a dream.' She gave birth at eight months to baby Jorj, the biggest of the three who was born weighing 4lbs 13oz and his brother Isaac, 4lb 8oz and Jac who weighed just 4lbs 3.5oz. Miss Fletcher said: 'Having this many babies takes some getting used to. And they certainly keep me busy but I love my huge brood.' Their mother said: 'Having this many babies takes some getting used to. And they certainly keep me busy, but I love my huge brood' 'I now have my hands full with four boys and I don't plan on having any more. I'm not relying on the pill again though - this time I'm making sure I get the implant.' Dr Surabhi Nanda, from Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'According to Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, with perfect use, the failure rate of the combined pill is 0.3 per cent and with typical use is around nine per cent.

"She endures up to six hours of sexual arousal a day and once had more than 180 orgasms in just two hours. But mother Cara Anaya-Carlis, 30, from Arizona said the rare condition which causes intense waves of pleasure is 'ruining her life' as she is house-bound and cannot work. She was diagnosed with persistent genital arousal disorder three years ago and became reclusive after having spontaneous orgasms in the supermarket, on the school run and even in the playground. Scroll down for video . Cara Anaya-Carlis, 30, endures up to six hours of sexual arousal a day and once had more than 180 orgasms in two hours, pictured with husband Tony . After suffering an attack of 160 orgasms - not including multiple orgasms - in just two hours, Mrs Anaya-Carlis sought the advice of her GP who was left baffled . Mrs Anaya-Carlis, who has a 10-year-old son Merrick with her husband Tony, now avoids being in open spaces and is too embarrassed to tell a potential employer about the condition. 'It is embarrassing and confusing and humiliating,' she said. 'When you are around children you feel like a pervert because you have all these really strong feelings rushing through your body at the same time. 'So if imagine you can't help out in class or go on school trips because the kids don't understand, the parents don't understand. 'Even doing the school run is a worry because the arousal will build and build and I just have to stay in the car until it is over or try and mask it. 'It has devastated my involvement in my son's life because I feel too dirty to be a part of it. We want him to be a normal kid but at the same time he can't have friends around because mom has this condition. 'The worst thing is I can't explain it to him because he's too young.' She developed the condition suddenly while grocery shopping three years ago. Walking through the store she suddenly found herself aroused by everything she saw, smelt and touched. The mother-of-one began to panic and the arousal continued until she fell to the floor and orgasmed multiple times. 'It was one of the most intense orgasms I had ever had and it was with no assistance,' she said. 'I was frightened and confused, I just ran out of the store and as I drove home I kept orgasming. She had a 10-year-old son Merrick and said she is now too embarrassed to do the school run . 'This was the first time and it was six hours of constant build up and orgasm with just seconds in between. I was terrified.' She has tried everything to cure her condition including ice, cold showers, changing her diet and increasing her exercise regime, but nothing works. The mother-of-one has learnt to control showing her arousal, but said it can really affect her mental well-being. 'It makes me giggle because of the momentary high and outwardly I look okay but inwardly it's a torture. Dr David Goldmeier, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London said: 'Persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire. 'PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer. 'This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms. 'Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon. 'I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know. 'Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.' 'It is ruining my life, because it messes with your head. You body is running on a high, on an up and down, so it really affects your moods. 'Some days when it's really bad I just want to shut the curtains and never get up. 'Other days I have little control over my body, and I will only have suffered 10 orgasms that day and I feel I could go back to work, get my life back. 'On a good day life goes on, a bad day it's disabling but I still have to pick up Merrick from school, be a wife to Tony and make the dinner. 'On a bad day it's like the cookie monster on cookies.' She suffered with her condition for months before it became too unbearable to handle. After having an attack of 160 orgasms - not including multiple orgasms - in just two hours, Mrs Anaya-Carlis sought the advice of her GP who was left baffled. Later, medical experts would identify the incurable condition, which causes dehydration, injured knees and ankles and ultimately exhaustion from lack of sleep. She has been unable to wear high-heels since developing the condition as she never knows when she will suffer an attack. 'You can't say to your future boss, 'I may not be able to come in today because I suffer from orgasms', he would think you were making it up,' she said. 'But it isn't just the embarrassment it's needing a change of clothes, it's that moment if you have a bad one and your knees give way and you hurt yourself. 'You can't be a risk or a burden.' The condition has also put pressure on her marriage as  she craves affection, intimacy and physical contact because of the number of hormones in her body. Before her spontaneous orgasms started, she had only climaxed with her husband and the couple had sex around four times a month. 'We still have sex but it can become incredibly frustrating for both of us because I am forever aroused,' she said. The mother-of-one said her relationship with her husband Tony has become more strained .","Cara Anaya-Carlis, 30, endures up to six hours of sexual arousal a day .

"Breathing secondhand marijuana smoke could damage the heart and blood vessels as much as secondhand cigarette smoke. In a new study, blood vessel function in lab rats dropped 70 percent after just 30 minutes of exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke. Even when the marijuana contained no THC - the compound that causes the 'high' - blood vessel function was still impaired. 'Most people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad, but many don't realise that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful,' the new study warns . Blood vessel function is important because a reduced level may raise the chances of developing hardened arteries. If function is low, plaque can build-up in the arteries which narrows them and restricts blood flow. This, in turn, can increase the risk of a heart attack. 'Most people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad for you, but many don't realise that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful,' said study author Matthew Springer, associate professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco's Cardiology Division. Marijuana and tobacco smoke are chemically and physically alike, aside from their active ingredients. The drop in blood vessel function from THC-free marijuana suggests that the compound isn't responsible for the effect. Similarly, this study confirms that nicotine is not required for smoke to interfere with blood vessel function. In the study, researchers used a modified cigarette smoking machine to expose rats to marijuana smoke. A high-resolution ultrasound machine measured how well the main leg artery functioned. Researchers recorded blood vessel dilation before smoke exposure and 10 minutes and 40 minutes after smoke exposure. Exposure to second-hand marijuana smoke hardened the arteries (pictured) over time, in turn increasing the risk of a heart attack . They also conducted separate tests with THC-free marijuana and plain air. There was no difference in blood vessel function when the rats were exposed to plain air. In previous tobacco studies, blood vessel function tended to go back to normal within 30 minutes of exposure. However, in the marijuana study, blood vessel function didn't return to normal when measured 40 minutes after exposure. Now that marijuana is becoming increasingly legalised in the United States, its effect on others is a growing public health concern, Dr Springer said. 'If you're hanging out in a room where people are smoking a lot of marijuana, you may be harming your blood vessels,' he said. 'There's no reason to think marijuana smoke is better than tobacco smoke. Avoid them both.' Secondhand tobacco smoke causes about 34,000 premature deaths from heart disease each year in the United States among nonsmokers. More research is needed to determine if secondhand marijuana smoke has other similar effects to secondhand cigarette smoke in humans. The research was presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2014.","Secondhand marijuana smoke could damage the heart and blood vessels .
Blood vessel function in lab rats dropped 70% after 30 mins of exposure .
This in turn made hardening of the arteries - and heart attack - more likely .

"David plays Dr. Stagg in a new theatre production of Pressure . All British actors these days tell you they'd really like to be in a Scandi drama like Borgen or The Bridge. Would any be as qualified as David Haig, though? We may think of the star of Four Weddings And A Funeral – he was memorable as bumbling bridegroom Bernard – as quintessentially English (he blames the moustache he sported for most of his career), but one of the more curious discoveries about him is he speaks fluent Danish. He lived in Denmark in his 20s while he was (yes, really) training as a plumber. 'It wasn't an ordinary plumber, so I wouldn't be much good at fitting a toilet,' he says, apologetically, before the conversation turns to tricky  U-bends. 'It was more specialised – I laid pipes underground. I still have the certificate.' He also still has the language skills, crucially. 'I picked it up very quickly because in the part of Jutland I was in no one spoke English, and it's stayed with me.' What he finds hilarious now is that when he was living in Denmark, all anyone wanted to talk to him about was how good British actors were. 'At that time, they were in awe of British drama. It was the time of The Forsyte Saga – those big productions British TV did really well before the low-budget competitiveness crept in.' Heady days, and long gone. Now, he says, 'there's been a complete turnaround' and the entire British TV industry is looking to Scandinavia with lustful eyes. He's even tried to get himself cast in a Scandi drama. You'd imagine they would have jumped at the chance given his CV. As well as the high-profile roles that get him recognised in Sainsbury's, he also has an Olivier Award for his theatre work including King Lear and Jim Hacker (in the stage production of Yes, Prime Minister). Ironically, it was his fluency in Danish that ruled him out of his Scandi dream role. 'I wrote to a producer saying I couldn't think of anything nicer than playing a part in Danish. He wrote back saying, ""We don't want Brits who come over and speak Danish. We want them to come and speak English."" I didn't want to speak English. So that was that.' Denmark's loss was our gain. His latest role, in the play Pressure, has taken him to the stage in Edinburgh, and is now moving to Chichester. David's most famous role was as Bernard in Four Weddings and a Funeral, pictured here with Sophie Thompson who played Lydia . The production tells the true story of Dr James Stagg, a Scottish meteorologist summoned to Allied Headquarters in Portsmouth to advise General Eisenhower on weather conditions in the build-up to what became known as the D-Day landings. As well as playing the lead role, Haig wrote the play. No, er, pressure then. He laughs. 'Well, I didn't write it thinking that I'd take the part. I actually approached some actors I had in mind, but they couldn't do it – so I was persuaded to do it myself. In a way it was fortuitous. I tried to channel all the angst I was feeling from writing the thing into the part. It's all about a man - a mere weatherman - feeling that the weight of the world is on him. He has to make a prediction that could win or lose the Second World War.' It's an extraordinarily tense production, and he's been getting rave reviews in the part. His fans will wonder where the distinctive moustache has gone, though. He says he shaved it off to do The Madness Of George III on stage in 2011 and felt 'liberated'. Unsung hero: David Haig as D-Day weather forecaster James Stagg . 'My moustache tried to pigeonhole me for years,' he admits. 'I honestly can't remember why I had it in the first place, possibly for a part – I was always seen as an upper-middle-class military chap. But I'm free of it now and I must say I don't miss it. The real Dr Stagg had a moustache, so the fact that I didn't grow mine back for it says it all.' At 58, he does seem to be at the peak of his career, trying to get that balance between writing and acting – and between jobs that offer creative opportunity and those that pay the bills. He's an open and thoughtful interviewee but a complicated man. He says he's 'an upbeat person with a melancholy streak' and the upbeat side of him only wins through because of his wife. 'She's everything I'm not,' he says of Julia, a past MasterChef finalist who was an actress and still dabbles (she took her one-woman comedy show about the history of the potato to Edinburgh last year). David with co-star Laura Rogers who plays Kay Summersby in Pressure . 'She's an extremely calm person, whereas I'm not. I throw my energy into everything, can't make decisions.' He half-jokes that the reason he still works so prodigiously is that they have five children. 'There was a terrifying time when I had four at private school at the same time,' he says. Now, ranging in age from 29 to 14, only two are 'officially' still at home, but the others – at drama school or university – keep popping in and out. It all seems idyllic – the family has lived in the same house in south London for nearly 30 years – but the couple have known great tragedy. David's first 'life-changing' loss happened when he was 26. His younger sister Karen died from a brain haemorrhage in 1982, aged just 22, and his world turned upside down. 'It was the shock of it,' he says. 'She was such an effervescent person, a very energised person.' The effect on his life was incalculable. 'Nothing ever surprised me again. Ever since, I've never felt shock from people dying early. It doesn't mean I don't feel it greatly – I do – but it never shocks. I think my sister's death matured me in a way I wasn't expecting.' In 1996, there was unthinkable pain when he and Julia lost a daughter, Grace, at birth. Ever since they have worked for SANDS, the stillbirth and neonatal charity. Julia has also recently qualified as a child counsellor; he has manned the phones at his local Samaritans office. He says he doesn't want to sound trite, 'But there is something about grabbing your experiences in life and turning them into something positive. We've tried to do that. I know it isn't always possible, some things are too crippling, but what is the alternative? I do believe life is about gaining wisdom of some sort.' Has all this loss shaped his own thoughts on growing older? 'I used to be very obsessed by the thought of the end,' he admits. 'Probably a few inches below the surface I still am, but I don't show it the way I used to. I try to be as zen as possible. It's the old cliché about seizing life while you can, isn't it? I've sort of attacked everything.' In professional terms, there is little he hasn't achieved ('although I haven't written a film yet'). And at home he's as close to 'zen' as he's likely to get. 'I'll tell you what's lovely,' he says. 'When all the children are home and we're round the table and you can talk to them as fellow adults and friends. That's one of the nicest things in the world.' Pressure runs at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, until 28 June. Tickets, www.cft.org.uk.","David Haig has experienced some real trauma in his life but he has come out the other side .

"A seven-year-old girl has today thanked thousands of strangers who have raised more than £176,000 to fund vital treatment that could save her life. Brave little Frankie-Rose Lea smiles as she holds up a sign, thanking all those who have been touched by her story. Her parents Michelle and Sam Lea told MailOnline on Friday they were prepared to make their family homeless in their quest to save their daughter. They put the family home in Erith, Kent, up for sale, desperate to raise £160,000 to fund proton beam therapy in the U.S. But within hours donations began to flood their online fund. Overwhelmed, they set up a second fundraising page, and by this morning more than £176,000 had been raised. Frankie-Rose Lea, seven, has today thanked thousands of strangers who have donated more than £176,000 to help fund potentially life-saving cancer treatment after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in August . Mrs Lea, 36, told MailOnline, she 'never expected that to happen in a million years'. ‘What a wonderful world we live in when strangers are prepared to dig into their own pockets to help a family they don’t know,' she said. 'Especially coming up to Christmas.' And Frankie-Rose, added: ‘Thank you everyone. I am feeling really happy now.' The seven-year-old's tumour has tripled in size and spread to her spine since she started chemotherapy in August. Applying for the treatment, sought by the family of Ashya King, on the NHS will take up to eight weeks - time Frankie-Rose does not have. But it emerged on Friday night that her latest MRI scan showed the seven-year-old needs surgery to relieve a build-up on her brain early this week, meaning she can no longer fly. Refusing to give up hope, Mr and Mrs Lea said they will drive Frankie-Rose to Germany or Switzerland, to receive the treatment. Her mother added: 'We are overwhelmed, humbled and extremely grateful. Thank you to you all. ‘Not just the people who donated but also the people who also took their time to send us messages of support. ‘I could only read two at a time without crying but I intend to read every one. ‘I wish I could thank you all personally.’ But their joy is bittersweet because an MRI scan on Friday night after the appeal was launched revealed a fresh build up of fluid on Frankie-Rose’s brain and the couple were told she is now too sick to fly to America. Her father  spent the weekend visiting clinics in Europe to gather information about taking her for treatment. Mrs Lea said: ' He has gone from one clinic to the next gathering as much information as he can for us to present to the doctors this week. Our hope is to find a clinic we can drive too. 'I won't know any more until he gets back today.' Michelle and Sam Lea, pictured with their sons Alfie, right and Freddie, left, had vowed to make their family homeless in a bid to raise £160,000 to fund life-saving cancer treatment for their daughter Frankie-Rose, centre, after experts said the treatment offered Frankie-Rose the best chance of survival . But the couple  no longer have to sell their their terraced home in Erith, Kent, left, after strangers helped raise £176,000. They had put the house on the market desperate to sell it within the week, to fund treatment in the U.S. for Frankie-Rose, right . Mr and Mrs Lea had planned to cancel their August wedding, after Frankie-Rose, was diagnosed the same month. But the seven-year-old told her parents she was desperate to be a bridesmaid . Before Frankie-Rose can travel the youngster will undergo brain surgery this week at Kings College Hospital in London. Until then medics are unsure if she has suffered another bleed. Mrs Lea said: ‘ We won’t know more until they go inside and find out what has happened but until then we have been told not to make plans to fly. Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy. Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body. It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract. The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord. Source: Mayo Clinic . ‘To know we can now fund the treatment without losing our home has taken one worry off our shoulders and means we can focus now on saving Frankie-Rose. ‘I can’t explain how emotional I feel as a result of the donations. 'It’s restored my faith in everything so on the one hand I feel like it’s the happiest time of my life, but at the same time the very worst. ‘We feel so happy and buoyed by the love and support but on the other hand so sad and worried at the same time. 'I never thought it would be possible to experience the best and worst moments of your life at the same time.’ Though their house is currently still on the market, Mrs Lea said they will no longer be selling it in the near future. She said: ‘ I just haven’t had time to take it off the market because this has all happened so fast. ‘But safe to say we won’t be homeless anytime soon now. I still can’t believe it.’ Mrs Lea also issued her thanks to friends and family who have supported the family tirelessly since Frankie-Rose was diagnosed in August this year. She said planned fundraising events would still go ahead. ‘There are still lots of unknowns in terms of the total cost of treatment and after care for Frankie so we will keep the fund open,' she said. Doctors have told the family Frankie-Rose may not live until Christmas. To apply for proton beam therapy on the NHS takes around eight weeks - time the youngster doesn't have . Doctors misdiagnosed Frankie'Rose's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer . 'If we can get Frankie into a clinic in Europe it might be that we can now relocate the whole family so we don’t have to leave our other two children behind. We want to be together at a time like this.’ Plans are underway to put the funds into a trust managed by directors. Mrs Lea said she would also like to be able to help make the treatment more easily available for other children. She said: ‘We are the lucky ones to have had such great help and support but there will be other families out there desperate to fund this treatment too and we feel strongly that it should be available in the UK. ‘The medical care Frankie-Rose has received in hospital has been incredible. The doctors ands nurses who have taken care of her up until now are amazing. ‘But we are not a third world country so why is this treatment only available in Europe or America? 'This is Great Britain, surely UK patients should have access to the best treatments too ? ‘We know this won’t change in time to help us but ultimately we hope we can help make a difference for other families who shouldn’t be worrying how to fund treatment at an already terrifying time.’","Frankie-Rose Lea was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in August .

"We are always being told that being overweight is unhealthy. But new research suggests it could be good for you - if you're over 65. An Australian study shows that older people with a higher body mass index liver for longer. Elderly people who are overweight live for longer than those who are a 'healthy' weight . Scientists at Deakin University, in Melbourne, found people over the age of 65 who fell into the overweight category of BMI were least likely to die. They found that the lowest risk of death was among those with a BMI of about 27.5, which is considered overweight according to the World Health Organisation. They also found that mortality rates were much higher among those with a BMI between 22 and 23 – this is within the normal range. ‘It is time to reassess the healthy weight guidelines for older people,’ lead author Professor Caryl Nowson said. ‘Our results showed that those over the age of 65 with a BMI of between 23 and 33 lived longer, indicating that the ideal body weight for older people is significantly higher than the recommended 18.5 to 25 “normal” healthy weight range.’ The research team reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2013 that reported on BMI and risk of death in people aged 65 years and over. Elderly people with a BMI of 27.5 - which is classed as overweight - live the longest . Collectively these studies followed around 200,000 people over an average of 12 years. The results showed that people with a ‘normal’ BMI of 21 to 22 were 12 per cent more likely to die. They also revealed that people with a BMI of 20 to 20.9 were 19 per cent more likely to die and people with a BMI of 33 to 33.9, which is classed as obese, were eight per cent more likely to die. Professor Nowson suggests that most older people need to get off the weight loss bandwagon. She said: ‘These findings indicate that, by current standards, being overweight is not associated with an increased risk of dying. ‘Rather, it is those sitting at the lower end of the normal range that need to be monitored, as older people with BMIs less than 23 are at increased risk of dying.’ Advice on ideal body weight should take into account factors other than BMI, Professor Nowson said. ‘Factors such as chronic diseases and the ability to move around need to be considered as there is no real issue with being in the overweight range unless it is preventing people from moving around freely,’ she added. ‘Rather than focussing on weight loss, older people should put their efforts into having a balanced diet, eating when hungry and keeping active. ‘Putting too much emphasis on dietary restrictions also increases the risk malnutrition in this age group. Malnutrition in older people is not well recognised as this can occur even when BMI is in the overweight range.’ The study was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.","Older people with a higher body mass index live for longer .
Elderly people with a BMI of 27.5 live for the longest .
Over 65s with a 'normal' BMI live for less time than fatter people .

"Jon Stewart has reacted to his interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News to claim that he was unfairly edited to appear like 'a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown'. The Daily Show Host appeared on Fox News Sunday with Wallace for a heated debate on political bias in the media. The two men were caught in passionate clashes of opinion as Stewart claimed that Fox pushed a right-wing agenda. Scroll down for video . Retaliation: Comedian Jon Stewart takes to the Daily Show to claim that the Fox News interview was edited so he appeared 'emotional and erratic' Comic: Stewart played part of the clip that was edited from the show and parodied the station over its political views . But speaking on his own Comedy Central show on Monday evening, Stewart said that the show's producers had tampered with the interview. He said that he came across as 'emotional and erratic'. 'I suggest you look at the unedited version online where my emotional states don't seem to change so arbitrarily,' he said. 'The arguments are a little clearer and a little less like a scene from woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 'The unedited version which is on the web had what I thought was the takeaway moment of the entire interview where Chris Wallace, one of the more respected individuals at Fox, basically gives away the game.' A clip of the unedited interview then showed Stewart asking Wallace if he thought that Fox News was the ideological equivalent of NBC News. 'I believe that we're the counterweight,' Wallace responded in the unedited version of the show. 'I think that they have a liberal agenda and I think we the the other side of the story.' Accusations: Jon Stewart challenges Chris Wallace on Fox News during the heated interview on Sunday evening about media bias . Confession: An unedited clip of the interview appears to show host Chris Wallace admitting Stewart's claim that the station is ideologically driven . Stewart flew from New York to Washington to record the Fox show. The conversation started jovially, with Mr Wallace joking to Stewart: 'After months of evasion, disconnected phone numbers and press agents saying 'who are you again' it appears he has run out of excuses.' There were even jokes about the sparring partners drinking from two Fox News branded mugs, with Mr Stewart suggesting the water may in fact be poisoned. But the atmosphere quickly turned serious as Mr Stewart, angered by questions over his own 'liberal' bias, snapped. The audience were shown a transcript of Mr Stewart describing Fox News as a, 'relentless agenda-driven 24 hour news opinion propaganda delivery system.' Mr Stewart later erupted: 'You're insane... Here's the difference between you and I. 'I'm a comedian first. My comedy is informed by an ideological background, there's no question about that.' Stewart began his own show on Monday evening by telling viewers that he had been to the nation's capital and taken another 'classic' picture of himself. Viewers were then showed a picture of him posing crudely in front of the Washington Monument. But he moved quickly onto attacking Fox News over the previous evening's interview. After playing the part of the interview where Wallace apparently admits Fox News has a right-wing bias, Stewart then parodies the station. 'The other side of the story. ''We don't tell both sides of the story, we tell one side...the other side, the one we perceive is never told. Because as you know, news only comes in two sides. And if the conservative side isn't being told what's being told must be liberal. '' Fox News isn't fair and balanced. It's balancing the system, man. Don't you get it? The system's unfair and unbalanced. To balance the system, Fox has to be the purest form of right wing resin. Because of how heavy left wing America is. Hollywood, comedians, every single news organization, the Internet, facts, history, science, it's all just left wing bullshit, man....'' 'Is Fox unbalanced? Yeah. Seriously, their ears are nearly touching the floor. But it's only because the system is unbalanced.' Stewart then pretends that his head is exploding.",Chris Wallace 'admitted' Fox News right-wing agenda .
"Two British brothers were lured to fight for Isis in Syria by playing the video war game Call of Duty, their father claims. Ahmed Muthana claims his sons Nasser, 20, and Aseel, 17, were given a copy of the game by extremists in a bid to groom them with violent fantasies. The game, commonly referred to as CoD, is a first-person experience of warfare. In one version, players massacre civilians to infiltrate a separatist movement in the Middle East led by a leader named 'Al-Asad'. Lured? Aseel, 17 (left), and his brother Nasser, 20 (right), from Cadriff, went to fight for Isis in Syria after extremists gave them a copy of Call of Duty, which groomed them with violent fantasies, their father claims . Violent fantasies: Call of Duty is a first-person shooter game that simulates warfare. In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (pictured), players massacre civilians to infiltrate a separatist movement in the 'oil-rich' Middle East . Now, the Cardiff-born boys have joined the jihadist faction in Syria - and Mr Muthana believes the game manipulated them. Last month, Nasser was one of four British Isis members who took to YouTube promoting their activities. In a chilling online message, the former medical student unveiled a photograph of what is thought to be a collection of improvised explosive devices or IEDs. Underneath the image, he wrote: 'So the UK is afraid I come back with the skills I’ve gained.' He also wrote about decapitating his enemies alongside a picture of a chain-like weapon. And Aseel has proclaimed his support for Sharia law online. Distraught, their father claims he had always refused to buy them violent video games for fear it would affect them - and he is certain Call of Duty was used to groom them. Mr Muthana, 57, told The Sun: 'I believe the game was bought for them by the same people who encouraged them to go to Syria.' His claims come after British jihadist Abu Sumayyah al-Britani compared their sieges to CoD. The father-of-three boasted that life with ISIS, who have taken control of parts of Syria and Iraq, is 'really, really fun' and 'better than that game Call of Duty.' Psychologists warned this year that violent video games stunt the 'moral maturity' of teenagers. Brock University in Ontario found adolescents who immerse themselves in these games are losing their sense of 'right' and 'wrong'. Comparison: Last month, British jihadist Abu Sumayyah Al-Britani compared Isis sieges to Call of Duty . Warning: Psychologists have warned violent video games make adolescents feel they can 'play God' They also lure players into believed they can 'play God', another study found. First-person shooters, they say, are very effective at giving players the sense that they’re totally in control of their environment and destiny. The consequences of shooting the enemy, for example, becomes apparent very quickly – and this gives gamers the thrill of being effective. That shoot-em-ups give gamers an enticing sense of control is something that has been underscored by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Lennart Nacke, the director of the Games and Media Entertainment Research Laboratory at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. But there are other factors in play, such as the rewarding feeling of making decisions. 'Fear me': Last month, Nasser released a video in English warning the UK to fear the things he has learned . Sieges: Isis fighters are beheading their way to Baghdad after securing strongholds in crisis-hit Syria and Iraq . Mr Nacke told The New Yorker: ‘Video games are essentially about decision-making. First-person shooters put these tasks on speed. What might be a very simple decision if you have all the time in the world becomes much more attractive and complex when you have to do it split second.’ Violent games also give users an adrenaline rush that men used to get from fighting wild animals. Nacke added: ‘If you look at it in terms of our evolution, most of us have office jobs. We’re in front of the computer all day. We don’t have to go out and fight a tiger or a bear to find our dinner. ‘But it’s still hardwired in humans. Our brain craves this kind of interaction, our brain wants to be stimulated. We miss this adrenaline-generating decision-making.’","Ahmed Muthana claims sons Nasser, 20, and Ameel, 17, were lured by game .

"Women delaying have children into their forties has seen a rise in the number of twins and triplets, new figures showed today. The number of women giving birth after turning 40 has risen steadily in recent years, with multiple births most likely amongst the over-45s. The Office for National Statistics said this higher multiple maternity rate was linked to women turning to IVF to start a family, which is more likely to lead to twins or triplets. The number of multiple births to women over 40 has risen sharply in the last 30 years, the Office for National Statistics found . Women aged 30-34 gave birth to the most twins in 2013, according to the latest figures . More triplets were both to women aged 35-39 than any other age group last year, the study found . New figures released today show that in 2013 there were 10,593 women who gave birth to twins, 187 to triplets and 3 to quads and above. Last year 15.6 out of every 1,000 women who gave birth had more than one baby, compared to 9.6 multiple maternities per 1,000 in 1976. In 1976, women aged 35-39 had the highest multiple maternity rate (13.4 per 1,000 maternities). The ONS said: ‘Between 1976 and 2011 the multiple maternity rate increased for all age groups, but most notably for women aged 30 and over. ‘The greatest increase was among women aged 45 and over where the multiple maternity rate rose from 9.8 in 1976, to 99.3 in 2011.’ Most new mothers in their forties gave birth to their first child, while 52 already had four or more children . The proportion of children who give birth at home has fallen dramatically since the 1960s . Giving birth at home has risen in popularity among the under-thirties, but fallen among older age groups . The number of women in their twenties giving birth at home has risen in the last decade, figures show. Overall in England and Wales last year, 2.3 per cent women giving birth did so at home. In 1960, the percentage of women giving birth at home was 33 per cent, but this fell to a record low between 1985 and 1988 when only 0.9 per cent of women gave birth at home. But the ONS said: 'The percentages of women giving birth at home have decreased in all age groups for women aged 30 and over and have increased in all age groups under 30.' Among under-20s, 1 per cent gave birth at home, 1.6 per cent of women aged 20-24 and 2 per cent of women aged 25-29. Between 2012 and 2013 the rate of multiple births fell for every age group, apart from women aged 40-44. The ONS found that women aged 45 and over ‘had by far the highest multiple maternity rate’ in 2013 at 95 per 1,000 maternities. Women aged under 20 had the lowest rate at just 6.1 per 1,000 maternities. Women are more likely to give birth to twins if they have fertility treatment. On average, 1 in 5 of IVF pregnancies result in multiple babies, compared to 1 in 80 for women who conceive naturally, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Around 17,000 IVF were babies born in the UK in 2011 and the average age of women undergoing IVF treatment in 2012 was 35. The ONS said: ‘The high multiple maternity rate among women aged 45 and over is a result of higher levels of assisted fertility treatments (including medicines which stimulate ovulation and assisted conception which includes IVF) at these ages.’ In 2009 the HFEA launched a policy to reduce the number of multiple births. Babies born with a sibling are more likely to have a lower birth weight. As a result, the infant mortality rate is around five times higher for multiple births than for singleton births.","Rate of multiple births fell for every age group, apart from 40-44 year olds .

"Director James Cameron, a self-proclaimed perfectionist, has made only one change in the re-release of his 1997 blockbuster, Titanic – and it’s all thanks to one man. American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson was on Cameron’s case for more than a decade trying to have a historically accurate night sky - spoiler alert - in the scenes after the Titanic sank. After several encounters, Dr Tyson got his wish, but first, Cameron challenged Dr Tyson to send him the exact constellation map for the sky around 4:20am on April 15, 1912. The sky's the limit: Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, right, convinced Titanic director James Cameron, left, to make the night sky historically accurate in the film's 3D release . That sinking feeling: Dr Tyson said the sky seen during the night of April 15, 1912, was mirrored and incorrect . Dr Tyson, who directs the Rose Centre for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was happy to oblige; he sent Cameron a detailed map of the stars that night, saying astronomy is an easy thing to track. He knew something was erroneous when he first watched the film. He told MailOnline: ‘Normally, I don’t concern myself with director’s errors. But the film was marketed how historically accurate the film was – they observed the state rooms and the china patterns. He put the effort into making the period piece.’ Dr Tyson added: ‘Clearly, you wouldn’t put Leonardo DiCaprio in striped bell bottoms – and you shouldn’t do that with the night sky.’ He said the star placement in the sky was the wrong sky, and used a mirror reflection to fill in the other half. Historically, he said, the sky ‘was cloudless and moonless – we have software you can run that just unwinds the star patterns – you get the right time and the right date, the sky is a very predictable thing, and what birthed our understanding of physics.’ Up she goes: Kate Winslet's character Rose looked up into a historically inaccurate sky in the scene after the Titanic sinks and she and Jack are huddled in the wreckage - the most inaccurate scene, according to Dr Tyson . What Rose saw: Though difficult to see, the left-hand portion of the original sky was a mirror image of the right, and furthermore, was not accurate to begin with; Dr Tyson added that it was cloudless the night of April 15 . What Rose should see: Dr Tyson said Rose should have seen the Big Dipper, bottom and centre, as well as The Milky Way, which crosses the upper half, based on the coordinates where the Titanic sank . The Harvard-educated astrophysicist sent Cameron a letter, and heard no response. He then had two personal encounters with the Avatar director, in which he voiced his complaint – one at a NASA committee dinner and another at magazine awards dinner. Cameron first told Dr Tyson that the night sky was completed in post-production. Dr Tyson told MailOnline that composing the night sky the way it appeared in the 1997 film was 'not only wrong but lazy.' He calculated what the sky would have looked like around 4:20am on April 15, 1912 by using the approximate latitude and longitude where the ship went down in the North Atlantic. Using that data, he was able to render what the night sky would have actually looked like. On that night, the sky was cloudless and moonless. He said: 'We have software you can run that just unwinds the star patterns - if you get the right time and the right date, the sky is a very predictable thing, and what birthed our understanding of physics.' ‘I really wanted him to grovel and ask forgiveness,’ Dr Tyson joked,’ but the mature side of me nodded and I didn’t say anything else.’ Dr Tyson composed Cameron a letter requesting the mistake be rectified, but got no response.It was only years later that the two of them happened to be at a dinner together at the Hayden Planetarium in New York. As the night progressed, Dr Tyson mustered the courage to talk to Cameron, saying: ‘Jim, my issue here is not that the sky was wrong, it was that you got everything else right.’ He said Cameron then told him: ‘Last I checked, Titanic has grossed $1.3billion. Imagine how much more money the film would have grossed if I would have gotten the sky correct.’ In response to the comment, Cameron told UK magazine Culture that he did, in fact, make the one change. He said: ‘Neil deGrasse Tyson sent me quite a snarky email saying that, at that time of year, in that position in the Atlantic in 1912, when Rose is lying on the piece of driftwood and staring up at the stars, that is not the star field she would have seen. ‘And with my reputation as a perfectionist, I should have known that and I should have put the right star field in.’ Dr Tyson said his tenacity finally paid off, saying that he was ‘nipping at his heels’ for ten years. The new 3D version of Titanic – complete with the astronomically correct night sky – will be out later this week. Stars align: James Cameron first told Dr Tyson that the stars were added in post-production .","Harvard-trained astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson said Rose looks up at wrong night sky in famous scene .

"Steve Rayer, 44, has cancelled a fete, concerts, a disco and a pantomime trip which his primary pupils were looking forward to . A headmaster has been branded a Scrooge after calling off a series of Christmas celebrations because school inspectors are visiting. Steve Rayer, 44, has cancelled a fete, concerts, a disco and a pantomime trip which his primary pupils were looking forward to. He sent parents a letter saying the events would have to be rearranged, even though the inspectors have since stressed their presence should not interrupt normal school routines. One mother compared Mr Rayer to the Grinch, the character who ‘stole Christmas’ in the children’s book by Dr Seuss. She said: ‘It’s something the children look forward to all year.  The children are really disappointed thanks to this Scrooge – there have been lots of tears and lots of upset parents.’ Rogerstone Primary School in Newport, South Wales, sent letters to the parents of its 400 pupils  last week announcing the inspection by officials from Estyn, the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted, starting on December 9. Mr Rayer wrote: ‘The Christmas panto and concerts will be rearranged in the new year. The Christmas fete and Christmas disco will be rearranged after the inspection is over. More details will be sent out when new arrangements have been made. ‘We are all very much looking forward to the visit by Estyn to show them the wonderful work everyone does here and how well the children progress in their learning.’ The mother, who has an eight-year-old at the school, said the children had been excited about the  trip to see the panto Beauty and the Beast at the Riverfront Theatre and Arts Centre in Newport. She added: ‘It’s difficult to see how they are going to do Christmas stuff in the new year. It’s such a shame. ‘The children are seeing their friends at other schools celebrating but they’ve got to work on as normal. It’s usually the highlight of the year for them. As soon as the panto finishes one year they are looking forward to the next one. ‘And lots of the little girls had bought new dresses for the disco – it just means so much to them at that age.’ Rogerstone Primary School in Newport, South Wales, sent letters to the parents of its 400 pupils  last week announcing the inspection by officials . Acting head Mr Rayer, who has experience of three inspections at other schools, declined to comment. He joined the school in October after the previous head took temporary leave pending an investigation into how reading and numeracy tests were carried out. Mr Rayer, a rugby coach and keen angler, was photographed last year with the Olympic torch when its round-Britain tour passed near the school. Newport Council said it was up to the school to decide on Christmas events. An Estyn spokesman said: ‘We would never recommend any school should cancel any Christmas activities or day-to-day events because of an inspection.’ Mr Rayer agreed to reinstate Christmas at Rogerstone Primary School following the publication of this article. A school spokesman said: 'The children would have been out of the classrooms a lot that week. 'It is vitally important for the school, including its pupils and their parents, to be examined by Estyn and understand how well it is performing. 'However, following discussions with some parents and Estyn it was agreed to reinstate the children's trip to the pantomime. 'The school would like to thank those parents who have shown their support and understanding in relation to the issues it was facing. 'We would reassure everyone that Christmas will most definitely be celebrated at Rogerstone Primary.'","Steve Rayer branded a Scrooge after calling off Christmas as Rogerstone Primary School in Newport, South Wales .

"Drinking a can of energy drink is enough to give a child caffeine poisoning, a leading doctor has warned. In the past three years, more than 2,000 children under the age of six were taken to hospital in the US suffering from the effects of the popular drinks, a study has revealed. Their symptoms included serious cardiac problems – including abnormal heart rhythms – or neurological problems such as seizures and fits. A can of energy drink could poison a child and a 250ml can of Red Bull, which contains 80mg of caffeine, and a 500ml can of Monster Energy drink, which contains 160mg of caffeine, are well over the limit for a child . Professor Steven Lipshultz, paediatrician-in-chief at Children’s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit, said most cans of energy drink contain enough caffeine to cause a child potential harm. ‘Exposure to energy drinks is a continuing health problem,’ he will tell the American Heart Association at a meeting in Chicago today. ‘You normally think of teens and young adults as most likely to drink them, but we found that half of calls to US poison control centres involved unintentional exposures by children less than six years old.’ High-caffeine energy drinks in the UK carry labels on their cans warning they are not suitable for children or pregnant women - but few retailers actively stop children buying the cans. Professor Lipshultz will say: ‘Energy drinks have no place in paediatric diets, and anyone with underlying cardiac, neurologic or other significant medical conditions should check with their healthcare provider to make sure it’s safe to consume energy drinks.’ The doctor said a child under 12 could be poisoned if they consume more than 2.5mg of caffeine for every kilogram of their body weight - enough to make most energy drinks potentially dangerous to children. Professor Steven Lipshultz said most cans of energy drink contain enough caffeine to cause a child potential harm . His calculations mean 50mg of caffeine in a day is enough to poison an average six year old. A child aged 10 could get caffeine poisoning after drinking 80mg and a 12-year-old might be poisoned after 100mg. A 500ml can of Monster Energy drink contains 160mg of caffeine - well over the limit. A 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine. Young children, especially those with diabetes or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, may be particularly at risk, he said. By Professor Lipshultz’s calculations, a mug of coffee also contains enough caffeine - at 100mg - to cause youngsters harm. A single 330ml can of Coca Cola, meanwhile, contains 32mg, making it safe in moderation. Professor Lipshultz said energy drinks may contain pharmaceutical-grade caffeine and additional caffeine from natural sources that may cause the heart to race and blood pressure to increase. Energy drinks with multiple caffeine sources may have higher rate of side effects, typically involving the nervous, digestive or cardiovascular systems. He said many of the added ingredients in energy drinks have never been tested for safety in children - meaning the caffeine may not be solely to blame. ‘The reported data probably represent the tip of the iceberg,’ he said. ‘This has no place in the diet of children and teenagers, and it shouldn’t be marketed at all to those under 18,’ ‘If the goal is to try to protect the public’s health, then these should be regulated similar to tobacco, alcohol and driving, so you have fewer kids winding up in the hospital or intensive care.’","A can of energy drink can give a child caffeine poisoning, say doctors .

"Fashion designer Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss has split from her husband of ten years, music label executive Joshua Gruss. The 39-year-old New Yorker and her soon-to-be ex-husband confirmed the news to Page Six earlier today, adding that the separation is 'amicable and sad' and revealing that they will continue to raise their three children together. Ms Lonstein, who founded her eponymous fashion label in 1998, married Joshua, 39, in a lavish ceremony at the Metropolitan Club on May 10, 2003. Scroll down for video . 'Amicable and sad': Shoshanna (R) and Joshua confirmed their separation to Page Six earlier today . The couple welcomed their first daughter Sienna in 2005 and twins Angelica and Joseph in 2012. Ms Lonstein, who has collaborated with a number of big name fashion, including Club Monaco and QVC since launching her own clothing line, first rose to fame after enjoying a four-year relationship with TV star Jerry Seinfeld. Mr Seinfeld, who is 21 years older than Ms Lonstein, first met his then-girlfriend while she was still a student at the prestigious Nightingale-Bamford School for Girls in Manhattan. Eager to be closer to the sitcom star, who was, at the time, still filming his hit series in Los Angeles, Ms Lonstein transferred to UCLA, where she completed a double bachelors degree in history and art history. The four-year relationship came to and end in 1997, with the budding designer blaming the split on the constant press attention focused on the pair, coupled with her desire to return to New York in order to start her fashion line. Since her return to New York 17 years ago, Ms Lonstein has continued to attract the attention of the media, not least because of her blunt attitude towards the fashion industry and its intolerance of more curvaceous women. Power couple: Shoshanna and Jerry Seinfeld (pictured) enjoyed a four-year romance between 1993 and 1997 . 'My whole life, starting as a young teen, I was a hard fit for clothes,” she told the New York Observer earlier this year. 'I was incredibly voluptuous, and it was frustrating as a young woman to not find things that fit well and made me feel celebratory of my body. I’m fortunate that I had a mom who helped me find those things or altered them, especially my swimsuits. 'I was a size 2, but then I had a very busty top, and it could be very damaging for young girls to not feel like they can find things that work for them.' Happy families: Mr Seinfeld went on to marry former Tommy Hilfiger PR Jessica in December 1999. The couple are pictured together at the opening night of Broadway's The River yesterday evening . Following her marriage to Joshua, who is the son of financier Martin Gruss and CEO of Round Hill Music,she has continued to see her business thrive and last year was named as the first ever Style Director of high-end brand Elizabeth Arden. Mr Seinfeld, now 60, married his wife Jessica, a former PR for fashion label Tommy Hilfiger, in 1999, after first meeting her in August 1998 at the Reebok Sports Club in New York. The couple have three children together - one daughter, Sascha, 14, and two sons, Julian, 11, and Shepherd, 9.","The designer began dating the Seinfeld star when she was 17 and he was 38 .

"Drinking coffee can help prevent obesity, scientists claim. A new study has identified a chemical compound in the caffeinated drink helps prevent some of the damaging effects of being overweight. Cholorgenic acid, or CGA, significantly reduced insulin resistance and the accumulation of fat in the livers of mice who were fed a high-fat diet. The rodents were put on a high-fat diet for 15 weeks, during which time scientists at the University of Georgia injected them with a CGA solution twice a week. Scientists at the University of Georgia discovered that cholorgenic acid in coffee, significantly reduced insulin resistance and the accumulation of fat in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet for 15 weeks . They discovered CGA was not only effective in preventing weight gain, it also helped maintain normal blood sugar levels and a healthy liver. Lead author, Dr Yongjie Ma from the university's College of Pharmacy, said: 'Previous studies have shown that coffee consumption may lower the risk for chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 'Our study expands on this research by looking at the benefits associated with this specific compound, which is found in great abundance in coffee, but also in other fruits and vegetables like apples, pears, tomatoes and blueberries.' During the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in the U.S and UK. Common side effects of obesity, aside from weight gain, are increased insulin resistance and a build-up of fat in the liver. Left untreated, these disorders can cause diabetes and poor liver function. 'CGA is a powerful antioxidant that reduces inflammation,' said Dr Ma, who works in the laboratory of Professor Dexi Liu in the department of pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences. 'A lot of evidence suggests that obesity-related diseases are caused by chronic inflammation, so if we can control that, we can hopefully offset some of the negative effects of excessive weight gain.' But the researchers said CGA alone is not a cure for obesity. Maintaining a healthy diet and taking regular exercise are still the best methods to reduce the risks associated with obesity. The researchers said while CGA alone is not a cure for obesity, their findings could pave the way for future treatments for those struggling to lose weight through conventional methods (file picture) The mice in this study received a high dose of CGA, higher than that a human would absorb through regular coffee consumption or a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. But the scientists believe CGA may provide the foundation for a treatment for those in need of extra help to tackle their weight. They said more research is needed to develop an improved CGA formulation specifically for human consumption. 'We're not suggesting that people start drinking a lot of coffee to protect themselves from an unhealthy lifestyle,' said Dr Ma. 'But we do think that we might be able to create a useful therapeutic using CGA that will help those at risk for obesity-related disease as they make positive lifestyle changes.' The study was published in Pharmaceutical Research.","Mice were fed a high-fat diet for 15 weeks during which time scientists gave them twice-weekly injections of the compound cholorgenic acid .

The image is a 4D scan - increasingly popular with expectant parents to get a glimpse of how their child will look. Rather then the grainy ‘flat’ images produced by the 2D scanners usually used by the NHS, a 4D machine stitches together pictures taken from a variety of angles to create clear three-dimensional images. These are then recorded on video – the fourth dimension. 4D scans are a highly developed form of traditional ultrasound where very high frequency sound waves are used to produce images of what is inside the body. As with older forms of ultra-sound, sound waves a emitted from a transducer, or probe, which is placed on the mother's abdomen and then moved to 'look at' areas in the uterus. These sound waves bounce back off the foetus, helping to create a 'picture' of the child on a screen. Last week, baby Leo Hargreaves stunned his parents when he beamed for his 31-week scan . John and Charlotte Steel with the scan of their already very happy baby boy . 4D scans use the same frequency of sound waves as in a normal ultrasound.

"More than 2,000 people have been tested for HIV and hepatitis amid concerns a dentist flouting infection control rules put them at risk of contracting blood-borne viruses. Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. NHS England said today 2,403 people have contacted a helpline established to offer advice to former patients. A spokeswoman confirmed 2,258 former patients have had blood tests to establish if they are at risk. But they face an anxious wait, with results not expected for 14 days, the spokeswoman told MailOnline. A whistleblower has alleged Mr D'Mello re-used dirty equipment and failed to change his gloves between patients. And it emerged the latest CQC report by health inspectors who examined the surgery in July found medical equipment was stored in a staff toilet, posing 'a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated'. Dentist Desmond D'Mello is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection-control measures at his Nottinghamshire practice over a 32-year period. So far more than 2,000 of his former patients have sought help and advice . It has emerged Mr D'Mello raked in around £1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. He sold his Georgian mansion on the outskirts of Nottingham for £1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury Nottingham flat, pictured . Six months earlier inspectors had given Mr D'Mello a clean bill of health. A spokesman for NHS England said all 166 patients filmed being treated by Mr D'Mello have been contacted. He said an alert was sent to GPs and dentists in the area with guidance on how to advise patients who might contact them. That alert was sent to all GP surgeries and dentists across the UK, to ensure patients who have moved away from the Nottingham area can still seek help. He added: 'NHS 111 and the NHS Customer Contact Centre have been briefed, as have NHS Choices who have placed information on their website. 'Other NHS organisations, including CCGs and acute trusts, have been notified in order to direct patients to the correct place should they present with concerns.' Detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23-year-old patient Amy Duffield is linked to dental treatments she received. Last week it emerged Mr D'Mello could have earned up to £1,000 a day, fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle. The 60-year-old lived in a lavishly furnished Georgian mansion and drove a range of sports cars, including a Mercedes, a Porsche and a Ferrari, with personalised number plates. The impressive Georgian mansion stands in seven-acres of grounds. It features seven bedrooms, three reception rooms and a study, garages for three cars, a tennis court, pond, wood, meadow and secret garden. It is built on land formerly owned by the Seely family, renowned landowners in Nottinghamshire. He sold the £1.5million grade two listed property, Ramsdale Farm, on the outskirts of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of Nottingham. A dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support. Anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. NHS England has also set up a temporary Community Clinic for patients, to provide further advice, counselling, and where necessary blood testing. Patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, at the Arnold Health Centre, located at Highcroft Medical Centre on High Street in Arnold, Nottingham. Anyone who lives outside the area, or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening. Dentists are paid per patient, earning a minimum of £18.50 for a basic check-up and polish on the NHS. Health bosses revealed Mr D'Mello saw 166 patients in a three-day period when he was filmed by a whistleblower in June. At an average of 55 patients a day, Mr D'Mello would have earned a minimum of £1,017 a day and around £3,071 if all patients were paying the minimum fee. If 55 patients a day was an average for Mr D'Mello, it means the 60-year-old would have earned in excess of £371,000 a year, before tax. It is not known how many of Mr D'Mello's patients had their treatment fully funded by the NHS. But it is unlikely that over the course of the three-day period in June Mr D'Mello only treated those patients charged the minimum fee. Dentists charge NHS patients according to three bands - a band two appointment costs £50.50 and a band three, for the most complex procedures including dentures and bridges, costs £219. It is therefore likely that Mr D'Mello's earnings were in excess of £,3,071 across the three days, and £371,000 a year. Nottinghamshire Police are making enquiries into the death of Amy Duffield, 23, a patient of Mr D'Mello who died unexpectedly last year . Dr Doug Black, a medical director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'He saw 166 patients in a three-day period. 'That is a lot of patients. The footage showed us there were serious lapses.' Mr D'Mello, who studied at the University of Manchester and qualified in 1977, was suspended for just 18 months in August by the General Dental Council, pending the start of the investigation. NHS dentists are paid according to three bands. Band 1: £18.50 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary it will also cover X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment . Band 2: £50.50 covers all treatment covered by band one, plus additional treatment including fillings, root canal and removing teeth. Band 3: £219 covers all treatments covered in bands one and two, plus complex procedures including crowns, dentures and bridges . Miss Duffield, 23, visited her GP on August 18, 2013, suffering from palpitations, and was taken to Queen's Medical Centre before being transferred to Nottingham City Hospital, where she died on August 22 of viral acute myocarditis. Now Nottinghamshire Coroner Mairin Casey, who was not made aware that she had visited Mr D'Mello's surgery prior to her death, has asked police to investigate. Miss Duffield's death was attributed to natural causes and because she died in hospital no inquest was held. The coroner has to power to order an inquest if she feels there are any questions over her death. NHS England has set aside £500,000 for a massive operation to recall the 22,000 patients he treated in a career spanning three decades. Patients say their dentist's fall from grace has sent shockwaves through their community. He was as a well-liked and popular man before he left his role at the surgery earlier this year. One former patient of Mr D'Mello, Chris Dalkin, told MailOnline he had only ever been impressed by his dentist of more than 20 years. Mr D'Mello worked for 32 years at the Daybrook Dental Practice, pictured, in Mansfield Road, Nottingham. NHS bosses stressed the practice is under new ownership . Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission visited Daybrook Dental Surgery on July 17. Their inspection came a month after a whistleblower raised concerns with health bosses over alleged infection-control breaches. In August, a report into their findings, found the practice failing in three of the five areas assessed - cleanliness and infection control, safety, availability and suitability of equipment and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision. The report highlighted a range of hygiene concerns. Inspectors noted: 'We observed the staff toilet and the room next to the toilet were being used as store rooms for equipment. 'This posed a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated. 'This risk had not been identified by staff at the dental surgery and no action had been taken to minimise it. 'We saw that mops and buckets for cleaning the practice were stored directly next to the staff toilet, in the same room, which again posed a risk of this cleaning equipment coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated.' The report noted the practice had an infection-control programme in place, and that it had been reviewed in February 2013. Inspectors had visited the clinic just six months before, in November last year, and gave it a clean bill of health. He said: 'He is a brilliant dentist. Professional, courteous and the same goes for the staff. 'A very popular dentist as the large numbers involved prove. 'The whole thing stinks. I hate to think what Mr D'Mello is going through.' Rumours of his suspension had spread through the community before this week's report was released by the General Dental Council, criticising his hygiene practices. Martin Clamp, 24, a construction worker from Daybrook said: 'When my partner told me about it, I was speechless. I came straight down to the centre and registered to be tested. 'I had three teeth out earlier this year and there were no problems but it makes you think. 'It all makes me feel uneasy, worried and a little bit scared. I've been going there all my life and if I've got something in my blood and passed it on to my partner, she could have given it to my son when she was pregnant.' Emma Hopewell, 27, from Arnold, said she was worried about the situation because she is eight months pregnant. She said: 'I'm having to get my children to go and have blood tests because of this, and I'm pregnant I shouldn't be having to worry about it. 'I think it's disgusting. It's a small dentist so I know they kept files in the toilets, so it wouldn't surprise me if he kept equipment in there as well.' She said they had been given packs with advice in and now had to wait 14 days until they find out the results. Her mother, Iris Brace, 54, also of Arnold, said: 'It's absolutely disgusting. To think that our whole family has been going to see him for so long and now we're all having to get tested over this.'","Desmond D'Mello has been suspended amid claims he flouted safety rules .

"A new baby boom of Hispanic, Asian and black children is coming to America - and it will make whites a minority by 2050. The surge is not due to new immigrants coming to the United States - but instead stems from the immigrants who are already here having children, according to Brookings Institution demographer William Frey. His new book, Diversity Explosion, recounts how falling white birth rates and rising birth rates for minorities will change way the United States of America looks - and votes - forever. Baby boom: By 2050, minorities will outnumber whites - thanks to shrinking birth rates for white families and growing birth rates non-whites . Go east, young man: Hispanics are moving rapidly from the southwest and California eastward and through the South (green dots) Diverse Midwest: The Midwest, Florida and southeastern US have all also see a large increase in the Asian population . Integration by marriage: Biracial families will become dramatically more as more and more people find love outside their own races. Fifteen percent of all new marriages are multiracial . There are already nearly as many non-white babies being born as white children, according to Census Bureau statistics. It's only a matter of time before minorities children outnumber white ones. The result, Frey tells the Atlantic, will be very similar to the Baby Boom after the Second World War - except this time it will be minority children being born. 'Back in the 1950s, we had a lot of Americans across the board in their childbearing years - we had all these babies,' he said. 'Now, that's really only the case for some of the newer minorities.' And it's not just cities that will be changing. The suburbs are already becoming more diverse and are likely to become progressively less white year after year. Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Hispanics in suburbs grew by more than eight million. Major cities added just three million Hispanics. Even among black Americans, the population of suburban dwellers is growing. In the last decade, the population of suburban blacks grew by three million and the population of urban blacks shrank by several hundred thousand. Mixed race: In the next 40 years, the number of mixed race Americans will nearly triple, the number of Asians will double and the number of whites will decline by six percent . Hispanics, blacks and Asians are all moving to the suburbs in greater numbers than whites . The influx of blacks to suburbs is also cutting the segregation in America as neighborhoods outside the city core become more diverse . Suburban sprawl: The number of blacks moving to suburbs has skyrocketed. Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Miami and Washington, DC, are the top cities where black Americans leaving city centers . Headed back South: Two generations after black families fled segregation and poverty in the South, they are beginning to move back. The population of blacks in Atlanta has grown dramatically in recent decades .","White birth rates are falling while immigrants and other minorities are having more children .
The population surge comes from immigrants having children in the US - not directly from immigration .
Minorities are also moving to the suburbs at faster rates, ensuring they are getting more diverse .
The population of mixed race Americans will grow dramatically in the next 50 years - nearly tripling ."
"At almost 400lbs with a 20ft train, the world’s largest beaded wedding dress is unlikely to ever be worn by an actual bride. Dressmaker Gail Be, of Edina, Minnesota, has been working on the gown for the past three years and says she is finally ready to display the lavish creation, which she describes as 'a work of art'. The 57-year-old, who enlisted the help of 22 other seamstresses to complete the epic challenge, told the Star Tribune: 'Nobody knows about us. We’ve been hibernating until I felt like we had something spectacular.' Scroll down for video . Shine on: Gail Be, of Edina, Minnesota, has created a 400lb beaded wedding dress . Longtime passion: 'I always come back to beading,' Ms Be said. 'It’s my calling' The dazzling masterpiece, which she says will be completed in December, boasts 995,000 glass and crystal beads that she has collected from around the world. Ms Be, who has constructed 30 elaborately beaded frocks over the past 25 years, kept the project under wraps until recently. 'I thought, I'm going to build the biggest wedding dress in the world. Didn't know what the stats were, didn't know how to do it, but knew that I was going to be doing the big one,' she said of the dress, which takes up an entire room. Masterpiece: Ms Be crafted the gown out of 995,000 glass and crystal beads, over the course of three years . Team effort: The 57-year-old enlisted the help of 22 other seamstresses to complete the epic challenge . Detail oriented: The designer even added a 20 1/2-foot train to the dazzling wedding dress . According to the Guinness World Records site, the record for most crystals on a wedding dress is 45,024 and was achieved by Özden Gelinlik Moda Tasarim of Istanbul, Turkey, in 2011. Ms Be doesn't actually expect a bride to walk down the aisle in the heavy garment, but would like it to be featured on film or in a museum. In fact, she can already count at least one famous fan of work: Lady Gaga wears a jeweled 'Erotic Ice' headpiece and matching top from Gail Be Designs on the cover of her recent single, Anything Goes, with Tony Bennett. Impressive goal: 'I thought, I'm going to build the biggest wedding dress in the world. Didn't know what the stats were, didn't know how to do it, but knew that I was going to be doing the big one,' Ms Be (pictured) said . Well kept secret: 'Nobody knows about us. We’ve been hibernating until I felt like we had something spectacular,' Ms Be said of the wedding dress . Though the designer values those two pieces at $47,500, she was happy to lend them to the pop superstar free of charge in return for the priceless exposure, adding: 'Of all the fashion houses in the world, she could've chosen Armani, Prada, anybody. Why would she pick some woman in the middle of Minnesota that nobody's ever heard of?' Ms Be insists she never tried to sell her designs in the past, though she's finally hoping to get compensated for her work after a recent separation from her husband limited her household income. 'My purpose for doing this has never been to get rich. It was to make one of the great pieces of art for all the world to see,' she said. Celebrity fan: Lady Gaga wears a headpiece and matching top from Gail Be Designs on the cover of her recent single, Anything Goes, with Tony Bennett . Ms Be, who has no formal fashion design training, reveals on her website that she does not sketch her dresses before executing them, nor does she use any mathematical calculations in her work. She took her first beading class at an American Indian memorabilia store in Minneapolis about 30 years ago, and immediately fell in love with the craft, beading for hours every day. In 1989, she was diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease called keratoconus, which eventually rendered her her legally blind and unable to bead. During this difficult time, she turned her attention to bead collecting. Intelligent design: The 57-year-old has constructed 30 elaborately beaded frocks, such as this one, over the past 25 years . But in 1996, she received her first corneal transplant, and after a second operation followed by Lasik surgery, her vision was eventually restored to 20/20 and she was able to return to what she loves doing most. 'I always come back to beading,' she said. 'It’s my calling.'","Dressmaker Gail Be, of Edina, Minnesota, added a 20-foot train to the dazzling gown .

"Fashion designer Kenneth Cole has broken the Guinness Record for the World's Largest Replica High Heel shoe after creating a 73 inch model of his brand's popular $225 Otto heel. The 60-year-old fashion veteran was enlisted by Today show correspondent Jill Martin, who earlier this year confessed that breaking a world record was on her bucket list. 'After I listed 'I want to break a world record' on my bucket list, I search the Guinness World record site, to see what record I could possibly break,' Jill, 38, said on the show. 'You know, I'm not the tallest person, I'm not the shortest person, I don't have the longest finger nails - but I do know shoes. Scroll down for video . We did it! Kenneth Cole (R) and Jill Martin (L) celebrate their World Record achievement alongside the official Guinness Record Adjudicator . 'So I needed to find a shoe to replicate and I thought ""who is quirky and cool enough to want this title?""' Kenneth and Jill called on the services of Izquierdo Studio, a custom costumes and props company, who offered to help them turn their lofty shoe dreams into a reality. 'Footwear in and of itself might be one of the most difficult products to bring to market because it's not just about designing,' Kenneth told the New York Post. 'It's about engineering and it's about sculpting, and ultimately it has to be a perfect proportion in order for it to fit and hold the weight of its inhabiter. And then to take it and change its scale is an even greater feat.' Kenneth and Jill's mammoth Otto replica, which was verified by an official Guinness Record Adjudicator on Thursday, trampled all over the former record, which was set in 1996 by Edmund Kryza of Poland with a replica pump measuring 44 inches high and 72 inches long. But it wasn't an easy feat finding enough materials to create the statuesque Otto statue; the bootie is made from 6,000 sq ft of calfskin and hand-cut foam, while the buckle was created with a 3-D printer, and the design even comes complete with a fully functional zipper. Little and large: The replica shoe weighs almost 150 times the original Otto design . 'I’ve never had kids, but I feel like I just had one,' Jill admitted. 'It was stressful, exhilarating, random. It was a real labor of love.' The whole shoe weighs a whopping 150 pounds, nearly 150 times the original wearable version currently on sale on the Kenneth Cole website. 'We met with ten different shoe builders because it is not easy to find somebody to build [this],' Jill said. 'There are lots of shoe makers, but there are not many shoe builders,' Kenneth added. The shoe is currently on display at department store Lord & Taylor’s flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York.","The shoe is a copy of the designer's popular $225 'Otto' bootie .

"Parents at Harley Avenue Primary School in Elwood New York, are outraged after the Kindergarten class's annual play was cancelled in order to get them 'college and career ready'. Families received two letters sent home, in which interim Principal Ellen Best-Laimit explained the unpopular decision to cancel the show. 'The reason we are eliminating the Kindergarten show is simple. We are responsible for preparing children for college and career with valuable lifelong skills,' she wrote. Show's over: Parents at Harley Avenue Primary School received two letters this spring, explaining why the annual Kindergarten play had been cancelled. Above, the second letter sent out last Friday . Taking away the music: Kindergartener Gabriela Solis says she was looking forward to singing in the show . Explanation: Interim Principal Ellen Best-Laimit (left in left picture) wrote that the show was cancelled in order to focus on making the 5-and 6-year-olds 'strong readers, writers, coworkers and problem solvers'. The school pictured on the right . Instead of preparing for the show, which was scheduled for mid-May, teachers will be focusing on molding the 5- and 6-year-olds into 'strong readers, writers, coworkers and problem solvers.' The letter was signed by Best-Laimit and four kindergarten teachers. Now parents at the school are fighting to bring the show back. Ninette Solis, whose daughter Gabriela attends the school, started an online petition to reinstate the play and more than 1,600 have already signed it. No more: A grab from a previous year's show, obtained by News 12 . 'These are 5-year-old children! This is outrageous! Canceling the show makes no sense at all,' Solis writes on the Change.org petition. Her daughter Gabriela spoke to News 12 Long Island about her disappointment over the show's cancellation. 'I really like singing and I just really wanted to sing more,' little Gabriella said. A spokesperson for the school told the local station that they believe the decision 'is in the best interest of the students'. Dear Kindergarten Parents and Guardians,We hope this letter serves to help you better understand how the demands of the 21st century are changing schools, and, more specifically, to clarify, misperceptions about the Kindergarten show. It is most important to keep in mind is [sic] that this issue is not unique to Elwood. Although the movement toward more rigorous learning standards has been in the national news for more than a decade, the changing face of education is beginning to feel unsettling for some people. What and how we teach is changing to meet the demands of a changing world.The reason for eliminating the Kindergarten show is simple. We are responsible for preparing children for college and career with valuable lifelong skills and know that we can best do that by having them become strong readers, writers, coworkers and problem solvers. Please do not fault us for making professional decisions that we know will never be able to please everyone. But know that we are making these decisions with the interests of all children in mind. Sincerely,Ellen Best-LaimitAngela CasanoKeri ColmoneStefanie GallagherMartha DeMartini .","The annual kindergarten show at Harley Avenue Primary School in Elwood, New York was cancelled this year .

"Tearful: Shanesha Taylor received donations of more than $114,000 after claiming that she had no option but to leave her two little boys in a sweltering car so she could attend a job interview in March . A mother who won public sympathy - and donations of more than $114,000 - after claiming that she had no option but to leave her two little boys in a sweltering car so she could attend a job interview has been accused by an ex- supporter of refusing job offers and wasting the money donated to her. One of Shanesha Taylor's biggest supporters following her arrest in March was civil rights leader Reverend Jarrett Maupin, but he now says his patience has run out. ‘We're trying to separate Shanesha Taylor from her mistakes, and that has proved to be perhaps an insurmountable obstacle,’ he told ABC15. Following Taylor’s arrest and tear-stained mugshot, the 35-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona quickly raised $114,000 after support poured into an online fundraising account. Part of a deal with prosecutors to avoid charges for Taylor included her putting some of the $114,000 raised into a trust for her children. When she failed to do so, prosecutors reinstated charges against her earlier this month and she will now face trial on December 3 on two felony charges of child abuse. Now Rev. Maupin has spoken out against Taylor and accused her of taking advantage of the people who donated money to her. According to Rev. Maupin, he arranged jobs for Taylor in the hospitality industry after she expressed an interest in the sector - but then she didn't show up. He has also accused Taylor of wasting the money that was donated to her. Scroll down for video . Snubbed: According to Rev. Maupin, pictured, he arranged jobs for Ms. Taylor in the hospitality industry but then she didn't show up . ‘We had someone call my office and alert her attorney to the fact that she spent $6,000 at a music studio in Tempe to finish her baby daddy's rap album,’ said Rev. Maupin. ‘That's not what people gave her that money for.’ In a response to Paupin's claims, Taylor said, ‘I haven't spoken to [Maupin] since July 21. He has not been part of my defense team. Anything he says is libel or slander.’ Ms Taylor was arrested March 20 after leaving her two young sons in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company. Authorities said the temperature inside the car exceeded 100F. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely. She told investigators she didn't have anyone to watch her then-2-year-old and 8-month-old sons. Her situation, along with her mug shot, inspired a New Jersey woman to start an online fundraising campaign for her. Donations poured in. Concern: A passersby called the police after noticing the boys inside the car in March. Police said the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off and the fan was blowing hot air . She struck a deal with prosecutors in July that allowed her to avoid prosecution if she fulfilled a number of requirements, such as setting up the trust funds, taking parenting classes and completing a substance-abuse treatment program. Prosecutors backed out of the deal after they say Ms Taylor failed to put $60,000 in the trusts. Still, they gave her another chance by lowering the amount to $40,000 but again she refused to pay. She has repeatedly refused to say how much of the donated money remains, but has previously claimed it is well over $60,000. She said she didn't fund the trusts because her children will not get the money if they choose not to attend college. Prosecutors say the mother of three has spent about $4,100 per month, including more than $1,000 in non-essential items such as cable TV, clothing and dining. Taylor was granted custody of her children in August after first being prevented from seeing them after her March 20 arrest and later being granted supervised contact.","Shanesha Taylor received donations of more than $114,000 after claiming that she had no option but to leave her two little boys in a sweltering car .

"Designer duo Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have revealed that they faced a huge amount of criticism from fashion insiders at the start of their careers, many of whom viewed them as nothing more than former actresses who were dabbling in the profession for fun. During and interview with ELLE magazine, the 28-year-old twins, who are busy celebrating the tenth anniversary of their globally-successful label The Row, admitted that, despite their incredible success as designers, their initial transition from film to fashion was not without its difficulties. 'People were asking us all sorts of questions in the beginning,' Mary-Kate, who is the younger of the pair by just two minutes, said. Scroll down for video . Dynamic duo: Despite facing harsh criticism early on in their fashion careers, Mary-Kate (L) and Ashley have found huge success as designers . 'It went beyond skeptical,' added Ashley. '[But] you just have to put on blinders and do your work.' Despite any initial doubt they faced from fashion's elite at the start of their careers, the pair have long since proven their abilities both as designers and as businesswomen, and have happily left their once-successful acting careers behind them. The twins, who first rose to fame in 1987 at the age of six months when they shared the role of young Michelle Tanner in hit sitcom Full House, were named as the CFDA's Accessories Designer of the Year in June, having scooped the title of CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year in 2012. Luxury label The Row is now carried in 145 of the most exclusive boutiques and department stores in the US, including Barneys, Bergdorf's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks. Further afield, the brand can be found on the shelves of stores such as Selfridges in London and Le Printemps in Paris. What began with a mission to create the perfect white T-shirt, the first item to go on sale under the label's name, is now a global fashion sensation, with the brand turning over tens of millions of dollars in sales each year. But the Olsen sisters are aware that The Row's high price points - one of the brand's most well-known products is an alligator-skin backpack which retails for $34,000 - don't appeal to everyone. From Full House to fashion house: The girls first rose to fame in 1987 when they shared the role of Michelle Tanner on hit sitcom Full House (R). They quit acting for good in 2004 and are now focused solely on fashion . Happily married? Rumors are circulating that Mary-Kate has married her boyfriend of three years Olivier Sarkozy after she was spotted wearing what appeared to be a gold wedding band during a basketball game last week (pictured) Enter Elizabeth and James, the designers' second, lower-priced, fashion line, which caters for a younger consumer. The label was inspired by their older brother James, 30, who goes by his middle name Trent, and younger sister Elizabeth, 25, who is currently carving out a career for herself as a successful film actress. While it operates on a slightly smaller scale than its sister line The Row, it too has expanded beyond the girls' initial expectations and recently spawned its own signature scents, Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black and Nirvana White. The twins continue to oversee every detail of the day-to-day running of each label, including the venues for their fashion shows, the locations of their stores and the design of every product. 'Every move that we've made through the past ten years has been step-by-step... ' Ashley explained. '...I think we do things because we stare at them for too long.' Cover star: The full interview with the girls is featured in the December issue of ELLE . 'One item at a time,' Mary-Kate added. 'We sit and look at everything in every possible version of how you might wear it. We are all about making our clothes work with reality.' But while the girls are happy to share their design philosophies, when it comes to their personal lives, they are incredibly guarded, preferring to keep everything as private as possible - particularly their relationships. Indeed, in recent weeks rumors have been circulating that Mary-Kate has secretly married French banker Olivier Sarkozy, her boyfriend of three years. The designer has been spotted wearing a gold band on her wedding finger on a number of occasions, most recently while the loved-up pair were enjoying a basketball game in New York earlier this month. But while speculation continues to surround the couple, Mary-Kate has thus far refused to offer an explanation, preferring instead to remain silent on any and all issues not relating to her role in the sisters' businesses, including recent reports that she has undergone plastic surgery.

"Olympic ski racer Bode Miller and his ex-girlfriend have finally reached a settlement in the custody battle over their 18-month-old son - although they still can't agree on his name. Miller and Sara McKenna, a former Marine, finalized a deal last week following a lengthy battle over their son - who is called Sam by his mother and Nate by his father. The deal was reached just before the squabbling pair were due to testify in a public trial about who would be a better parent for the boy, Page Six reported. Details of the agreement are confidential, McKenna's attorney Michael Stutman said. Truce: Sara McKenna, pictured left outside court in December 2013, and Olympic skier Bode Miller, right with wife Morgan Beck outside court in April, have reached a custody agreement over their 18-month-old son . 'Neither of us got exactly what we wanted, but Sam got what he needed and that's what's most important to me,' McKenna, 28, told the paper. The agreement brings a truce after two years of public disputes between the couple, who dated after meeting through a matchmaking service. After McKenna, then a firefighter, fell pregnant three months into their relationship, Miller said he did not want to raise the boy together, and they moved their separate ways. At seven months pregnant, McKenna moved from California to New York to attend Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, while he married volleyball player Morgan Beck. Battle: McKenna, a former Marine who is now studying at Columbia University, is pictured with her son Sam on the Brooklyn Bridge. A judge previously took away custody from her after she moved to New York . With dad: The toddler is pictured with his father and step-mother, Morgan Beck, who call him 'Nate' McKenna said she told him of her plans in a text message but he never responded. But two weeks after Sam was born in February 2013, Miller filed for custody in California and she temporarily lost custody of him, McKenna recounted in an essay for Cosmopolitan. It came just a month after Miller, now 37, and his wife Morgan, 27, experienced a miscarriage. In September last year, a judge gave Miller full custody of Sam, calling McKenna's move to New York 'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'. After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job, she said. But she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters' so she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a way to get Sam back for good, she said in Cosmo. 'Hurtful': McKenna previously said she has struggled to see Beck hold her son as if he is her own . Record breaking: Bode Miller, a five-time world champion, is pictured competing at Sochi in February . McKenna also tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him 'Nathaniel', after Miller's late brother. 'That was really heartbreaking,' she wrote. 'Our son's name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just confusing.' The next time she saw her son was at a court hearing in November where she won back custody. She is now studying law in the hope of helping others going through the same ordeal. Miller, a five-time world champion, still lives in California with his wife. He also has an older daughter from a previous relationship.","Bode Miller, 37, and Sara McKenna, 28, finalized a deal last week over their son - who is called Sam by his mother and Nate by his father .

"Foreign students with low grades are being offered places at top British universities ahead of pupils with better marks in this country, an investigation has revealed. Universities have been accused of making money by rejecting British teenagers so they can fill places with international students who are charged 50 per cent more than the annual £9,000 tuition fees paid by UK and European students. An investigation found that the official agent in Beijing for the elite Russell Group claimed to be able to secure over-subscribed places for a Chinese student with three C grades at A-level - when British students need at least AAB. The University of Sussex denied the allegations which were made after an investigation into agents for prospective overseas students . Undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph were also told that, in order to secure a . visa, they should tell the UK authorities that the student would return . home immediately after graduation - even if this was not the case. Headteachers at private schools have claimed that some of their foreign pupils have been offered places requiring lower grades than their British counterparts. One education expert warned there was risk that standards will fall as universities overlook better-qualified candidates in favour of those who pay higher fees. The reporters visited Golden Arrows Consulting in Beijing, which placed more than 2,500 students in British universities in 2011, claiming to be looking for a place for a Chinese student who had three C grades. Despite being below the entry requirements of most leading British universities, the fictitious student was offered a place at both Cardiff and Sussex. The agent, Fiona Wang said: 'We send student [sic] to Cardiff Business School to study accounting and finance with ACD. So with CCC we can help her.' An applicant would normally need AAB to take the course at the university. 'If the student wants to study economics, it’s three Cs. So economics she can also do,' the agent added. Ms Wang said that the grades meant that she could also ‘choose’ between the University of East Anglia or Southampton University but not Bristol, King’s College London or Warwick. Another Golden Arrow employee reportedly offered to doctor documents to help the student’s application, including visa paperwork and offered assistance with the applicant’s personal statement. The number of foreign students in Britain has risen by a third to almost 300,000 since 2006, with the highest proportion coming from China, while the number of British students missing out on a university place reached a peak of 180,000 in 2011. Universities are allowed to make discretionary offers to students and there are no rules governing entry requirements. It is believed that many wealthy parents would be prepared to pay the higher fees charged to international students, but the system prevents this. Richard Cairns, the headmaster at Brighton College, said: 'Universities are increasingly searching for, and needing, overseas fees. It’s something we have noticed. It’s tougher for British students to get into top universities than overseas students.' Andrew Halls, the headmaster of King's College School in Wimbledon, south-west London, told the Telegraph that he had advised pupils they stand a chance of receiving a better offer if they can apply as international candidates. Last month 68 chancellors, governors and university presidents warned that any crackdown could lead to foreign students going elsewhere, costing the economy billions. In a letter to the Prime Minister they said Britain attracts around one in 10 students who study outside their home country, generating around £8billion a year in tuition fees. Universities take such a valued revenue stream very seriously, with almost all having a dedicated page on their websites listing 'partners' in other countries for prospective students to contact about getting a place. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, told the Telegraph money was the 'main factor' leading universities to push for foreign students. He said there was a risk that educational standards could be compromised as establishments try to secure their future in an era of uncertain funding. From September the Government will . make changes to the system aimed at ensuring that high-performing . teenagers are not denied university places. It will remove a cap on the number of British students a university can recruit if the applicant had A-level grades of AAB. The threshold is due to be lowered to . ABB next year, although only a few universities have indicated that they . will participate because of concerns over the cost of admitting more . British students. Golden Arrow admitted that it had found a place for a student at Cardiff with ACD grades but said it was an exceptional case. The firm denied offering to doctor applications and said it only ‘instructs’ students’ on personal statements but would never 'write on behalf of them'. Sussex and Cardiff Universities denied offering places to international students with lower grades. The University of Southampton said it would be investigating the allegations.","Universities overlooking British applicants because foreign students pay higher fees, it is claimed .

"The former drummer for the Faces and The Who has put forward plans for a world class equestrian arena, boutique hotel and country homes at a polo club where the Royals have played. Kenney Jones, 66, hopes to expand the Hurtwood Park club in  Surrey, where Prince Harry, William and Charles have showcased their polo talents. But the plans submitted by Mr Jones - who played alongside Rod Stewart when they were in the Faces - has been met with almost 100 objections from local residents. The 66-year-old former drummer wants to expand the Hurtwood Park polo club in Surrey (pictured) Prince Harry (left) and Prince Charles (right) pictured during the Kuoni polo day at Hurtwood park in 2003 . Jones (pictured top right) with the Faces - Rod Stewart is seated in the middle and to his left, Ron Wood . The application includes plans for 14 new homes, a five star hotel and luxury spa attached to the club house . They are concerned about the strain the extra traffic will have on the area and the impact it will have on the environment. Mr Jones, who first made his name as a member of the Small Faces, hopes to construct the UK's first all-weather polo and equestrian estate with stables for 78 horses. He also hopes to build 14 new homes for 'equestrian enthusiasts' and a five-star 74-bedroom hotel and luxury spa attached to the existing clubhouse. The former drummer and father-of-six has said the application will boost the local economy, provide it with an estimated 639 jobs and improve the facilities in the local area. Equestrian bodies — including the Federation of International Polo, the British Equestrian Federation, the Hurlingham Polo Association and the Pony Club — have welcomed the new development. Mr Jones said: 'It's great to receive such strong support from the polo and equestrian communities, who have recognised the exciting opportunity that the expanded facilities at Hurtwood can provide to the UK. 'We have also been overwhelmed by the support shown by the community in Ewhurst, having received over 100 letters of support. 'I want to save the future of Hurtwood Park and protect the open, green space. 'We want to make sure we keep polo and equestrian activity at Hurtwood Park and create something that respects Ewhurst as a rural, village environment whilst bringing something special to the area. 'The planning application is intended to provide a facility that preserves the site as a rural equestrian venue and create something local people can be proud of.' Jones, who is a keen polo player, pictured riding Prince Harry in aid of The Prince's Trust in 2002 . Jones (pictured third right) with fellow members of The Who outside the Marquee in London in 1988 - he will reunite with the band on June 14 at the Rock 'n' Horsepower benefit concert held at his polo club . However the application has received almost 100 objections from the local community. Campaign group Save Ewhurst's Environment particularly oppose to the proposed 14 new homes describing it as the 'tip of the iceberg'. There are also fears it would lead to the area being swamped with development, of the threat it will pose to the environment and the extra traffic it will create. Neighbours say a polo tournament earlier this year attracted more than 1,600 cars, leading to huge jams and nearly 300 cars were abandoned due to heavy rain. Henning von Spreckelsen, who opposes the plans, said: 'It is disingenuous to suggest that this  polo club can suddenly turn into a national centre of excellence with only a small handful of wealthy players wanting to live on site.' On the application Nick Aust, from Ewhurst, wrote: 'I feel it would put an excessive strain on the village and also hurt the beautiful surroundings we currently enjoy.' Another, Duane Ayres wrote: 'The application is just a smoke-screen for a massive housing development. The land is clay and not suitable for polo ponies and is underwater for most of the winter.' But former resident Jacki Marshall, who used the polo club as a wedding venue for her daughter, said: 'Having seen their ideas for the site, and knowing that something has to change, this seems to be a wonderful opportunity for the local community. 'It would be a great enhancement to the area to have a good hotel, spa and restaurant, which could bring more jobs and opportunity to the local population. 'Jayne and Kenney Jones have lived in the area for a good number of years. Surely it is always favourable to have someone who has clearly enjoyed living in the Ewhurst area to apply and get the planning they require.' On his Facebook page, Kenney Jones outlines the reasons to support the expansion of his polo club . Prince Charles and Prince Harry at Hurtwood Park - the application has been supported by equestrian bodies . The club is currently licensed for 10 major events a year, each with a maximum attendance of 5,000 people. Mr Jones has told Waverley Borough Council the fourteen country houses will be 'discreetly integrated' into mature woodland and built around a grazing area. A transport assessment submitted as part of the planning application estimates only one extra car a minute would travel through Ewhurst village at peak times and horsebox traffic would be directed away from the village. Mr Jones created a private polo field on the land after moving to Ewhurst in the late 1980s. He quickly turned it into a proper club, hosting star-studded international matches, charity events and concerts. He said he and his wife, former model Jayne Andrew, are proud to have a 20-year record of commitment to Hurtwood Park and to be part of the Ewhurst community. He said: 'We want to create something that puts Waverley even more firmly on the map. Our aim is to get leading equestrians living on the site, people living on Hurtwood Park who have an inherent interest in making sure that its current use is maintained for the long term.' The plans, submitted to the Waverley borough council, have so far received 90 objections and 117 supporters. A decision target has been set for December 12.","Kenney Jones has submitted the application for the Hurtwood Park club .

"The latest addition to casino mogul Steve Wynn’s property portfolio is a Bel-Air mansion that was once owned by country music legend Kenny Rogers. Wynn is spending $65 million to acquire the Liongate Estate, which got its name when Rogers installed two lions at the front gates back in the 1970s. Since then the property has changed hands several times and in the past three years it has undergone a substantial face-lift which has more than doubled the original size to 24,000 square feet. Liongate Estate: The revamped Bel-Air mansion is more than double the size it used to be and is available for $65 million .

Wynn, 72 and his third wife Andrea Hisson can look forward to spreading out in a property which now has 11 bedrooms and 17 bathrooms, three living rooms, a giant ballroom, a 12-seat theater, custom fountains, saltwater swimming pool and a glass elevator that connects the grounds to a tennis court and a sauna. Other features include two fountains, seven fireplaces, a billiards room and media room, a professional-sized gym, a ballroom, three steam showers and a dry sauna, hot-tub and pool. The estate, which takes up an entire block and is hidden from view by a long driveway, will provide the new owners with some of the best views in L.A. It was last sold in 2010 for just $12.2 million by author and LA socialite Nancy Davis. Despite the massive renovations, the current owners have decided to sell after not spending as much time in L.A. as they had previously planned. Before: Prior to three years worth of expensive renovations, the more modest Lionsgate Estate had been sold in 2010 by author and socialite Nancy Davis .

Wynn, who is legally blind, is credited with spearheading the dramatic resurgence and expansion of the Las Vegas Strip in the 1990s. He is worth a reported $3.5 billion after his companies refurbished or built some of the most currently widely recognized resorts such as the Golden Nugget, The Mirage, Treasure Island, Bellagio, Wynn, and Encore. Two years ago, not long after he married 40-something Hisson, he also bought a $70 million New York Penthouse on Central Park South.

"Alastair Bruce has a secret weapon. You can’t see it, or touch it, but his imaginary telephone line has proved vital in his role as historical advisor on Downton Abbey. An expert on protocol past and present, Alastair has brought his forensic knowledge of 20th-century history to bear on every series of the much-loved drama but the cast’s fondness for rather modern displays of affection is something of a bête noire for him – hence the imaginary phone line. 'I'm always trying to stop people hugging,' he exclaims. 'We've become so physically expressive as people – it’s a miracle we're ever unclamped from each other frankly, and the actors are very keen on it – but it’s just not the language of this period. Scroll down for videos . Expert: Alastair Bruce is the man in charge of ensuring Downton Abbey's period detail is perfect . 'I feel an actor can convey gratitude, or all sorts of emotions, without physical contact – just as one has to over the telephone. 'So I often suggest they imagine that the telephone line is there as a means of creating distance.' He may be behind the scenes but Alastair is vital to the making of Downton, as the DVD of series five makes clear. In an accompanying exclusive documentary, he takes us through the bewildering minutiae of 1920s etiquette, illustrated by footage from the Downton set in which we see him scurrying around altering the position of a soup spoon here, the hankie in a tweed jacket pocket there. For Alastair the devil is very much in the detail. At one point he gently chides Michelle Dockery’s Lady Mary for slouching in front of her Dowager Countess grandmother, at another he reminds Laura Carmichael’s Lady Edith that she would never leave her evening gloves on the table after dinner. This is how you do it: Mr Bruce on the set of this season's Downton Abbey with actor Robert James-Collier . Take your hands out of your pockets! Hugh Bonneville, who plays Earl Grantham, gets a telling off . Detail: Mr Bruce is known to cast members as 'The Oracle' because of his exhaustive knowledge . Even Lord Grantham, played by Hugh Bonneville, doesn’t escape the odd ticking off, mostly for putting his hands in his pockets. 'Of course, all these things seem to be absolute nonsense now, but if you’re trying to take people legitimately on a journey in time you have to attend to these things to make it successful,' says Alastair. It’s helpful to put him among the action now and then, to which end he’s cropped up variously on screen as a butler at the Dowager Countess’s Dower House, a Staff Colonel to a visiting General, and a river ghillie in the second year Christmas Special which saw the cast decamp to Scotland. Indeed, it is Alastair’s hands that hold the ruler over the knives and forks on the table every time the titles roll. His crowning glory though came in last year’s Christmas Special, playing the Lord Chamberlain to King George V in the scenes where Lady Rose was presented at Court, a position from which he had the opportunity to supervise the behaviour of the key cast members during the ritual. And it’s clear the cast think he’s marvellous. On set he’s nicknamed 'The Oracle', and the actors are fulsome in their praise. 'I love Alastair,' says Tom Cullen, who plays Lord Gillingham. 'He literally taught me everything, how to tie my shoelaces, how to stand, how to ride a horse.' Hugh Bonneville, meanwhile, cites Alastair’s exhaustive knowledge of history as another great strength. 'He’s very useful in providing context for the interaction between characters,' he says. Which is where that telephone line comes in. Although he’s not a director, Alastair usually gets his way when it comes to the cast doing things properly. He cites a scene in series three, in which Lord Grantham and Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens, came to an agreement over their future roles after months of conflict. 'Hugh and Dan desperately wanted this hug at the end. So, OK, film it – nothing wrong with filming something,' he smiles. 'But let’s film another version, in which they lightly tap each other’s shoulders instead.' The latter was the version that was used. Cameo: Mr Bruce, seen here with director Liz Turbridge, also moonlights as an extra from time to time . Starring role: In season four, Mr Bruce had a cameo as the Lord Chamberlain in episode nine . Stiff: According to Mr Bruce, displays of affection and hugging weren't really done until the 1950s . Whenever a character has a storyline that touches on history, Alastair’s there to fill in the background. This includes Dame Maggie Smith, whose Dowager Countess had, we learned, possibly got a skeleton in her cupboard in the form of an illicit romance with a Russian aristocrat, now living in penury in England after the Russian Revolution of 1917. 'Maggie and I talked about how these Russians came to be in Britain, that something like this happening suddenly seemed possible for the British aristocracy,' he recalls. The principle challenge with the latest series, set in 1924, was persuading the cast that while times may have marched on, stiff manners still governed. 'They were saying, ""Oh Alastair we're in the fifth series, can I relax a bit?"" To which I told them, ""You can relax a bit in about 1955"".' Alastair is something of a Renaissance Man: an author of well-received history books, he is Royal, Religious and National Events commentator for Sky and covered the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee for them in 2012. Royal life: During his stint as the Queen's herald, Mr Bruce persuaded her to be photographed at Balmoral . Tweaks: Mr Bruce spends hours checking and double checking place settings and table etiquette . Popular: Despite his restrictions on hugging, Mr Bruce is a hugely popular member of the Downton team . He’s not just an observer, but a part of the Establishment too: in 1998 the Queen appointed him as one of her heralds, and it was he who persuaded Her Majesty to be photographed in her regalia out among the peat and heather at a misty Balmoral for a book to mark the 60th anniversary of her Coronation, an image that graced Weekend magazine’s cover last year. Despite his best efforts, the odd clanger slips through on Downton, much to the delight of the viewers who revel in pointing out inaccuracies. 'It’s about reputation,' says Alastair. 'If you have a good reputation people want to attack it because it’s more fun – so in a way I look forward to challenges like that as it suggests I have standards.' It’s impossible, at this point, not to bring up the plastic water bottle seen in the background of the publicity shots for this series. Was this a blot on Alastair’s almost-impeccable copybook? 'Oh, I'm perfectly happy to be held responsible for that,' he hoots. 'A lot of people have said, ""What about that plastic bottle?"" and I'll admit I thought, ""Crikey, if that’s about it, then I've done alright"".'","ITV drama employs etiquette expert and historian Alastair Bruce .

"A string of GCSE subjects deemed to be ‘too easy’ are facing the axe as part of a radical overhaul by the Government’s exam watchdog. Courses such as Leisure and Tourism, Health and Social Care, and Preparing for Work and Life – which teaches pupils about finding and applying for jobs – could be stripped of their status as GCSEs. Education Secretary Michael Gove is already toughening up core subjects such as maths and English to boost the exam’s academic reputation. Now regulator Ofqual is set to draw up rigorous guidelines that are expected to result in a swathe of  ‘soft’ qualifications losing their GCSE label. Critics believe many of these qualifications are popular with head teachers because they have allowed less academically gifted children to achieve passes in nationally recognised exams, so boosting the school’s position in league tables. Figures released last week show the number of pupils taking Leisure and Tourism this summer is 7,461 – a 120 per cent rise compared with the previous year. In 2013, more than two-thirds of students achieved at least a C grade in the subject. Health and Social Care is being studied by 18,193 pupils this year, up 44 per cent on 2013, when more than half scored a C or above. And just over 30,000 youngsters are taking Hospitality, which focuses on the hotel and restaurant trade – up 21 per cent on last year. Again, more than half of students achieved a C grade or higher last summer. One question in last summer's Leisure and Tourism exam included: 'Old Trafford is the home of Manchester United Football Club. This is an example of a major sports venue. Name one other example of a major sports venue' Other ‘soft’ GCSE subjects where pupils did particularly well last year included Preparation for Life and Work, and Media Studies. Detractors say many of these  GCSEs, introduced under the last Labour Government, lack academic discipline and ‘discredit’ the system. They want them axed or else become vocational courses. Ofqual, which approves courses drawn up by exam boards, has said that the number of non-academic subjects available ‘devalues’ the GCSE ‘brand’. The organisation said that while it would not make rulings on individual subjects, it would be drawing up criteria that exam boards would have to meet if their papers were to keep their GCSE status after 2016. Thousands of students at some of the UK’s top universities have been caught cheating, new figures reveal. Some take mobile phones into exams or copy coursework from the internet, while others rely on traditional methods such as hiding notes in the toilets and writing answers on their arms. The survey of nine of Britain’s leading universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, has uncovered nearly 4,000 cases of cheating in exams, plagiarism and malpractice since 2009. One student used a memory stick in the exam while another wrote notes on a water bottle. The guidelines will call for more rigorous content and assessment. One question in last summer’s Leisure and Tourism exam included: ‘Old Trafford is the home of Manchester United Football Club. This is an example of a major sports venue. Name one other example of a major sports venue.’ In 2011, the paper asked: ‘Which of the following is an example of a natural attraction? Blackpool Tower, Madame Tussauds, Ben Nevis or The London Eye?’ In Health and Social Care, questions over recent years have included: ‘Starting school is associated with which life stage? Middle adulthood, early childhood, adolescence or puberty?’, and ‘James was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He is obese, has a poor diet and drinks heavily. Assess how James’s lifestyle may affect his health  and wellbeing.’ Chris McGovern, of the Campaign For Real Education, said: ‘These are far too easy for GCSEs. This is obviously a dilution of academic standards and a sad reflection on our examiners that they expect so little. It is a tragic situation. ‘We must get rid of these Mickey Mouse GCSEs. They discredit the entire exam system.’ Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre For Education And Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘GCSEs have spawned in all sorts of directions, some of which look mainly to be a way of occupying the time of non-academic pupils rather than being qualifications that mean something and lead somewhere. ‘It doesn’t make sense to have them as the equivalent of, say, physics or history. ‘The revision of the GCSE structures is the ideal opportunity to decide which are of the right standards and which can be pruned to the benefit of everyone.’ Prof Smithers said many of them could be reclassified as vocational qualifications. Other GCSE subjects popular in colleges could also lose their status, including Catering, Contemporary Crafts, and Motor Vehicle and Road User Studies. The Government has already indicated that, apart from maths, English, science and languages, it wants to retain GCSEs in religious studies, design and technology, art and design, drama, dance, music, physical education, computer science and citizenship studies.","Critics believe 'Mickey Mouse'

"Until now, researchers blamed the collapse of the Bronze Age on widespread changes in global temperatures. But now experts believe the huge population collapse, that took place in around 800BC, actually occurred two generations before this weather shift. Records show that colder and wetter weather conditions weren't recorded until after the collapse - and social and economic pressures were more likely to blame. Historians will have to find alternative explanations for the huge population collapse in around 800BC, because climate records show that colder and wetter weather conditions didn’t occur until two generations afterward. A stock image of snow covered Wicklow mountains near Dublin is shown . Archaeologists and environmental scientists from the University of Bradford, University of Leeds, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast have shown that the changes in climate that scientists believed to coincide with the population fall, in fact occurred at least two generations later. Their results, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show that human activity started to decline after 900BC, and fell rapidly after 800BC, indicating a population collapse. However, climate records reveal that icy conditions didn’t occur until around 750BC. Fluctuations in levels of human activity at a given time are reflected by the numbers of radiocarbon dates for a certain period. The team used statistical techniques to analyse more than 2,000 radiocarbon dates, which they took from hundreds of archaeological sites in Ireland. From this, they were able to pinpoint the precise dates Europe’s Bronze Age population collapsed. Experts from Universities in Britain and Ireland think social and economic pressures were primarily to blame for the population collapse, because when iron production took over, bronze trading networks failed. This caused widespread conflict and social collapse. A Bronze Age spear head is pictured . It has long been thought that climate change led to a dramatic decline in Bronze Age populations in 800BC. But records show that colder and wetter weather conditions didn’t occur until two generations afterwards. Experts believe that social and economic stress is more likely to be the cause of the sudden and widespread fall in numbers. Communities producing bronze needed to trade over very large distances to obtain copper and tin and control of these networks enabled the growth of complex societies dominated by a warrior elite. As iron production took over, these networks collapsed, leading to widespread conflict and social collapse. The researchers then analysed climate records from peat bogs in Ireland, and compared the archaeological data to these records to see if the dates tallied. This information was compared with evidence of climate change across Europe between 1,200BC and 500BC. Lead author Ian Armit, Professor of Archaeology at Bradford University, said: ‘Our evidence shows definitively that the population decline in this period cannot have been caused by climate change.’ Dr Graeme Swindles, Associate Professor of Earth System Dynamics at Leeds University, added: ‘We found clear evidence for a rapid change in climate to much wetter conditions, which we were able to precisely pinpoint to 750BC using statistical methods.’ Professor Armit said social and economic stress is more likely to be the cause of the sudden and widespread fall in numbers. Communities producing bronze needed to trade over very large distances to obtain copper and tin, and control of these networks enabled the growth of complex societies dominated by a warrior elite. As iron production took over, these networks collapsed, leading to widespread conflict and social collapse. The team used new statistical techniques to analyse more than 2,000 radiocarbon dates, taken from hundreds of archaeological sites in Ireland, to pinpoint the precise dates that Europe’s Bronze Age population collapsed. Dunbeg Fort in Munster (pictured) is thought to date to the Bronze Age . Katharina Becker, Lecturer in the Department of Archaeology at University College Cork, explained that the Late Bronze Age is usually seen as a time of plenty, in contrast to an impoverished Early Iron Age. ‘Our results show that the rich Bronze Age artefact record does not provide the full picture and that crisis began earlier than previously thought.’ Professor Armit conceded: ‘Although climate change was not directly responsible for the collapse it is likely that the poor climatic conditions would have affected farming. ‘This would have been particularly difficult for vulnerable communities, preventing population recovery for several centuries.’ He said that in examining the past, humans are inclined to link evidence of climate change with evidence of population change. ‘Actually, if you have high quality data and apply modern analytical techniques, you get a much clearer picture and start to see the real complexity of human/environment relationships in the past.’","Cold and wet conditions occurred two generations after collapse in 800BC .

Black cohosh is the second most popular herbal ingredient in the UK and is used to treat symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes, night sweats, poor sleep, mood changes and irritability. It is also often recommended as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy – and is available in capsules in most high street chemists, health food shops and supermarkets. Richard Woodfield, the MHRA’s head of herbal policy, said: ‘It is important people with a history of liver problems do not use black cohosh herbal products.’ The latest case reported to the . regulator is suspected to be directly linked to the woman using a . product containing the herbal remedy and an investigation is ongoing. The . MHRA said it had received a total of 53 reports of adverse reactions . suspected to be associated with the use of black cohosh products – the . majority involving liver problems. Black . cohosh is registered as a herbal medicine with the MHRA under its . Traditional Herbal Registration scheme, which was introduced last year . to impose more stringent controls. But in some cases, the MHRA has found . it being sold as a food supplement at more than 50 times the . recommended dose.",Black cohosh root is the second most common herbal ingredient in the UK .
"A primary school is facing a parents’ revolt over the content of sex education classes for children as young as four. Up to 20 families are said to be prepared to withdraw youngsters from the lessons because of concerns they are being sexualised too soon with discussions about homosexuality, masturbation and orgasms. Under the plans, those aged six could be taught about same-sex relationships and the difference between ‘good and bad touching’. Topics for ten-year-olds include orgasm and masturbation. Grenoside Primary already offers sex education to pupils in the two oldest year groups, but is now seeking to extend its programme to the younger children. (Posed by models) Grenoside Community Primary in Sheffield already offers sex education to pupils in the two oldest year groups, but is planning to extend it to the younger ones as well. Some parents have been shocked by details of the lessons revealed in consultation meetings. Headmaster Colin Fleetwood insists the material is not explicit and is in line with national curriculum guidelines. But parents including Louise Leahy – who has four children aged five to ten at the 319-pupil school – are furious. ‘There is a great deal of material in there which children don’t need to know at such a young age,’ the 41-year-old said. ‘It’s almost like the lessons and videos shown are saying, “Put all your toys in the bin, now it’s time to grow up”.’ Grenoside Primary school in Sheffield, where consultation is currently taking place between teachers and parents on the proposed sex education classes . She said some of the vocabulary used . for the first two year groups is inappropriate, and objected to a DVD . for older children showing a man lying on top of a woman. Videos . about people touching themselves encourage children ‘to think in a . sexual way’, she said, adding: ‘One governor told me her child needs to . know this stuff because she watches Emmerdale and EastEnders, but mine . don’t and I don’t want them to.’ Katie Burrell, 26, whose six-year-old son Redd is at the school, agreed, saying: ‘My boy still believes in Father Christmas, he doesn’t need to be told these things. ‘The lessons for six- and seven-year-olds . are far too explicit. I think a lot of parents will take their children . out of these classes. ‘I am by no means a prude, but some of this is beyond stupidity.’ Mr Fleetwood said governors will decide what can taught following the consultation. He added: ‘We want this to be a positive learning experience which will help our children make sensible and responsible decisions as they grow up.’ His view was echoed by Dr Sonia Sharp, executive director for children, young people and families at Sheffield City Council, who said the lessons are widely taught at other primary schools in the city. More than a fifth of UK primaries offer sex education, the content of which is decided by governors. It is compulsory only at secondaries. Labour planned to make the subject compulsory from age five. Yesterday, the Department for Education said it is reviewing the subject.","Disgusted parents threaten to pull children out of classes .

"Chloe Turner, 21, of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, has been told that her daughter Ellie, right, cannot attend her local primary school - even though she only lives 100yds from the school gates . A mother has hit out after her daughter was rejected for a place at their local school - despite living just 100 yards away. Furious Chloe Turner, 21, put daughter Ellie's name down for a place at Woodhouse Primary School in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, when she was just three months old. The mother-of-two and her partner Mark Thomson, 25, even moved into their house three years ago because they knew it was a two-minute walk from their desired school. But despite the fact they can hear schoolchildren in Woodhouse's playground from their bungalow, Ellie, now three, has been refused a place along with her friends to start in September this year . Instead, the family has been asked to send Ellie to a different school - 20 minutes away by car. The full-time-mother, who also has a one-year-old called George, says she has not been given a reason for the refusal. She said:  'All of her friends from playschool, which is close by, have been given a place. 'We've always told Ellie that she'd go to Woodhouse with her friends - and I don't know how to tell her it's not going to happen. 'Not only is it the closest school to our house, but it's a very, very good school - I'm so frustrated by it all.'I know of people who are exactly the . same as Ellie - the only box they tick is living close by, they don't . have any siblings at the school - but they've been given a place. It's . not fair on Ellie. Ms Turner registered her interest in her Ellie attending the school formally when the youngster was just three-months old, because she knew places were sought-after. A few months later, Chloe and her windscreen technician partner were looking for a house - and found one just round the corner from the school. In November last year, she painstakingly completed the online registration form to apply for a place at Woodhouse Primary. 'The criteria they use for allocating schools are - firstly, priority goes to children with disabilities or looked-after children. Secondly, if there are any siblings at the school, then they consider living distance from the school and then if there are any spaces left they are allocated,' she said. Woodhouse Primary School, pictured, in Brighouse, West Yorkshire is just 100 yards from Chloe Turner's home - yet she has been refused a place in September . An arrow shows the 100 yards Ellie and her parents would have to walk to reach Woodhouse Primary School from their home - instead they have been asked to drive 20 minutes away . 'There are around 60 places available a year, and we've been told this is a high-birth year so places are even more competitive.' 'After applying, the next thing I knew was when they contacted me saying they had two different addresses registered for me - the other was my parents' address, so I assume they had that from when I registered interest when we were still living with my mum and dad. 'I had to send them proof we lived at this house, which I did, and didn't hear anything back so assumed it was all ok. 'But the next thing we knew, in April I logged onto the website where you apply, and it said ""not accepted"" next to Woodside Primary. 'It also said ""not accepted"" next to our second choice of school, and said ""place given to Castlefield Primary School"". A short walk: If Ellie had been given a place at Woodhouse Primary School in Brighouse, pictured in the background, it would have been a two minute stroll. Instead her mother Chloe has been asked to drive 20 minutes to a different school . 'Castlefield isn't even a school I put down as a choice. It may seem like it's close by on a map but there's no direct route, driving there round all the streets would take about 20 minutes. It definitely is too far to walk.' Ms Turner was offered a two-tier application process including reallocation, which means if anyone turns down their place at the school, Ellie could have it. However despite applying for this, the family found out this week that they had been unsuccessful. Now they will have to try the second appeal process - applying to an independent panel who could allocate a place. 'The appeal panel is in August some time - so what happens if Ellie still doesn't get a place? I'm not sending her to the school they allocated her at, it's too far away. 'I face keeping her off school until she's five, and in the meantime will face all sorts of childcare issues, including paying for nursery. Chloe Turner says she has not yet been given a reason as to why her daughter Ellie will not be able to attend Woodhouse Primary School, 100 yards from her house . 'But I'm going to keep fighting this, because it's ridiculous she can't go to this school when it's so close to our house. 'I haven't told her about it because she wouldn't understand why she can't go to school with her friends, but I'll have to tell her eventually and she's going to be so upset.' Judith Wyllie, Calderdale Council's head of commissioning and partnerships, said: 'Every effort is made by Calderdale Council to offer parents a place for their child at their preferred school, although this is not always possible where schools are popular and oversubscribed. 'If none of a parents' preferences can be met, a place will be offered at the closest school to the family home where a vacancy exists.'","Chloe Turner furious after daughter Ellie refused place at Woodhouse Primary School .

"Manchester United are wasting no time in rebuilding their squad to launch a fresh assault on the Premier League under the leadership of Louis van Gaal. They have already splashed on teenage sensation Luke Shaw and midfielder Ander Herrera, with more deals in the pipeline as Van Gaal looks to haul his new side from the wreckage of last season. Old Trafford could have a Chilean feel next year with midfielder Arturo Vidal and Barcelona's wing star Alexis Sanchez both on Van Gaal's wanted list. VIDEO Scroll down for United target Daley Blind scores a 30 yard beauty against Utrecht . Laying down the law: Louis van Gaal, taking Holland training, will rebuild United's squad . Re-United: Van Gaal will make Robin van Persie his undisputed No 9 up front . Teen star: England's Luke Shaw has already been signed to fill the left-back role . Stalwart: But there may be no room in Manchester United's new line-up for midfielder Michael Carrick . The boss could look closer to home to revamp his back line. Right-back Daryl Janmaat and powerful centre-half Bruno Martins Indi could both be picked up, with both playing in Van Gaal's Holland World Cup side - as does undisputed No 9 Robin van Persie. Other Dutch stars to be linked with Old Trafford moves include Nigel de Jong and former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt. It means there's no room for current Old Trafford charges Rafael or Phil Jones, while the midfield revamp sees Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini ousted. Here, Sportsmail looks at a potential starting XI for next season, and some other targets Van Gaal will have in mind. Theatre of dreams: Could this be Manchester United's new line-up for next season? United's possible XI for next season (4-3-3): De Gea; Janmaat, Smalling, Martins Indi, Shaw; Vidal, Herrera, Mata; Sanchez, Rooney, Van Persie . And here's Van Gaal's shopping list, including some alternative names that could be lining up at Old Trafford next season. ARTURO VIDAL Juventus . Chile midfielder rated one of the best in the world was wanted by David Moyes but Juventus would not sell. Real Madrid have discussed £32m offer but it won't be enough. In action: Arturo Vidal, battling Brazil's Marcelo, is one of the most sought-after midfielders in the world . THOMAS VERMAELEN Arsenal . Belgian has been short on form and confidence but United hope a change of scenery can rediscover the defender of old. Arsenal not keen to sell to United for less than £12million. Aerial threat: Thomas Vermaelen (right), battling Russia's Alexander Samedov, is wanted by United . DARYL JANMAAT Feyenoord . Exciting right-back. The 24-year-old has been watched by Arsenal closely and was the subject of interest from Tottenham, Napoli and Leicester but Louis van Gaal is a fan. Home comforts: Van Gaal make look to his Dutch side for right-back Daryl Janmaat . DALEY BLIND Ajax . Luke Shaw and Patrice Evra may be at left-back but Blind is a decent defensive midfielder too. His displays in Brazil will hike up his £12m price but would be an astute addition. See you next year? Daley Blind (left), tackling Alexis Sanchez, could be a utility man for United . BRUNO MARTINS INDI and STEFAN De VRIJ Feyenoord . Bruno Martins Indi and de Vrij are both ready to leave and 22-year-old de Vrij has been poised to join Lazio. Left-side Indi may offer better balance for United's defence. Powerful: Bruno Martins Indi (right), iun action against Tim Cahill, may be the answer for United at the back . ALEXIS SANCHEZ Barcelona . Fleet-footed forward can play comfortably in a 4-3-3, was a United fan as a boy is also wanted by Juventus and Liverpool among others. Barca want around £30million. World star: Barcelona and Chile's Alexis Sanchez, holding off David Luiz, would be key to a new United attack . KEVIN STROOTMAN Roma . Firm favourite of Van Gaal. Lacks pace but dictates game with strong left foot. His cruciate injury may prompt United to revive interest in Real Madrid's Sami Khedira though.

"Oprah Winfrey's former personal chef Art Smith is set to open the first East Coast location of his popular Lyfe Kitchen chain in Manhattan later this month. The cooking expert, who worked with the TV host for ten years before later featuring as a celebrity chef on Bravo’s Top Chef Masters, is one of the company's two Executive Chefs and has helped to craft a menu which focuses on the health food chain's mantra: 'Eat Good. Feel Good. Do Good.' Each of the dishes on the menu are under 600 calories and contain less than 100mg of sodium, with many being made using fresh ingredients sourced from local vendors. Lifelong friends: Since leaving her employ in 2007, Art Smith has remained close friends with Oprah Winfrey and regularly contributes recipes to her website . After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2010, Chef Smith has focused much of his attention on creating healthy, balanced meals in the hopes of encouraging diabetics around the world to maintain a clean and simple diet. 'It was important that I be a beacon for my family as well as for other people, to show them they could live well,' the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News last year. 'For me, it was working with my doctor to create an individualized diabetes management plan, which really helped me get back on track.' Since his diagnosis, Chef Smith, who has also cooked for former Florida governor Jeb Bush and the Obamas, has done his best to avoid sugars and processed foods, ingredients which you won't find in any of Lyfe Kitchen's branches, which are also located in California, Colorado, Nevada, Illinois and Texas. 'Our hope is that Lyfe Kitchen will be more than just another place to grab a bite,' the Lyfe website explains. 'That it will be a place that reflects your values toward health, community and sustainability. And that maybe - just maybe - we’ll be a source of inspiration, too.' Foodie fans: Oprah (L) is a well-known lover of food and employed Chef Smith as her personal chef for ten years . While he stopped working for Oprah in 2007, Chef Smith has remained close friends with his former employer - who has continued to show support for his work. The TV star features monthly recipes written by her former chef on her website, Oprah.com, and, in 2007, wrote a small piece about the launch of his first restaurant, Table Fifty-Two, which opened in Chicago. 'In all those years that Art was cooking for me, people would always say, ""Oh, well, if I had my own chef, I would be thin, too,""' she wrote. 'Well, please. Art always used to cook so much food, I would say, ""It's just Stedman and it's just me. My god, Art, you need a restaurant!""'","Art Smith will launch the new Lyfe Kitchen in Midtown later this month .

"Starfish have been mysteriously dying by the millions in recent months along the US west coast, worrying biologists who say the sea creatures are key to the marine ecosystem. Scientists first started noticing the mass deaths in June 2013. Different types of starfish, also known as sea stars, were affected, from wild ones along the coast to those in captivity, according to Jonathan Sleeman, director of the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. 'The two species affected most are Pisaster ochraceus (purple sea star or ochre starfish) and Pycnopodia helianthoides (sunflower sea star),' he wrote in a statement in December. Mystery: Millions of starfish on the west coast are dying - and scientists have no idea why . The sunflower sea star is considered among the largest starfish and can span more than a meter in diameter. The most commonly observed symptoms are white lesions on the arms of the sea star. The lesions spread rapidly, resulting in the loss of the arm. Within days, the infection consumes the creature's entire body, and it dies. Entire populations have been wiped out in Puget Sound off the coast of Washington state, in the Salish Sea off Canada's British Columbia as well as along the coast of California. The mortality rate is estimated at 95 percent. Scientists who have spent decades studying the local ecosystem have yet to identify the cause. 'What we currently think is likely happening is that there is a pathogen, like a parasite or a virus or a bacteria, that is infecting the sea stars and that compromises in some way their immune system,' Pete Raimondi, chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told AFP. Wiped out: Entire populations of starfish have been wiped out in Puget Sound off the coast of Washington state . Then, the creatures become more susceptible to bacteria which is ""causing a secondary infection that causes most of the damages that you see.' A barometer of sea health . The 2013 phenomenon has not been observed solely along the West Coast; a smaller outbreak also killed East Coast sea stars last year. Previous cases were believed to be associated with warmer waters -- sea stars have sensitive skin and prefer cooler water -- but this was not the case in 2013. And when the die-offs happened previously, the geographic span of the infections was much smaller, and far fewer sea stars were affected. In 1983, an epidemic nearly wiped out the Pisaster ochraceus from tidal pools along the southern coast of California. Another, smaller die-off in 1997 may have been caused by warmer waters in an El Nino year, scientists said. Parasite: Scientists have theorized that there is some sort of parasite that is affecting the starfish's immune system . Sea stars are important because 'they play a key role in this ecosystem on the West Coast,' Raimondi said. Sea stars eat mussels, barnacles, snails, mollusks and other smaller sea life, so their health is considered a measure of marine life on the whole in a given area. When sea stars decline in number, 'the mussel population has the potential to dramatically increase, which could significantly alter the rocky intertidal zone,' according to Sleeman. While sea stars make up an important component of the base of the ocean food chain and are considered a top predator, they are in turn eaten by other starfish, shorebirds, gulls, and sometimes sea otters. In an effort to find out what is causing the mass deaths, scientists are collecting reports from the public, taking specimens to the lab for analysis and doing genetic sequencing to find out whether a toxin or an infection may be to blame.","Scientists started noticing the mass deaths in June of 2013 .

"Changes to Facebook's data sharing policies will make it almost impossible for presidential candidates to replicate Barack Obama's success on the site. The 2012 reelection campaign won over voters under the age of 29 using an app that supporters could share with their friends. Analysts could view each supporter's friends list and construct a sophisticated database of who to target, rather than the traditional get-out-the-vote ring rounds made difficult as so few young people have listed phone numbers. However, as of April 2015, third-party applications will only be able to see users who download the app, not their associates. Clamp down: Facebook has changed its data-sharing policies that will block third-party applications, such as this one used by Obama's 2012 campaign, from accessing users' friends lists to target fresh voters . Experts who developed the sophisticated voter-targeting system, which was credited with redefining the limits of viral politics, claim the change will pose a significant challenge for the next cycle. 'It's a fairly significant shift,' Teddy Goff, Obama's digital director in 2012, told Yahoo News. 'The thing we did that will be most affected - by which I mean rendered impossible - by the changes they're making is the targeted sharing tool,' Goff added. Obama's youth-focused campaign seemed to be shaken by early statistics that revealed half their swing-state voters under 30 did not have listed numbers. Consequently, they opted to use Facebook as a replacement for the traditional telephone directory. They raised more than $690 million over the internet and amassed more than 45 million Facebook followers. Romney's campaign used a less sophisticated version of the system for just a few days before Election Day. Goff added: 'It's extremely powerful for a campaign to be able to say to [a user], ""Hey, here are your persuadable friends, ranked in order of where they live: Ohio first, Virginia second, et cetera. Go share this video directly with them"".' 'Groundbreaking': Campaign experts branded Obama's digital voter-targeting in 2012 'revolutionary'. The team directed adverts to supporters' friends. Analysts believed Romney (right) suffered by not using the strategy . Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist who worked on George W Bush’s 2004 campaign, hailed the strategy as the future of outreach. Next year's change was announced by Facebook in April this year after receiving complaints about privacy. 'People want more control over sharing their personal information with apps,' Jeffrey Spehar, Facebook's engineering manager, wrote in a blog post. He added: 'We've heard from people that they're often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app. 'So we've updated Facebook Login so that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.' The Ready For Hillary page, set up earlier this year on Facebook, will be able to gather a certain amount of data for the Democrats before April - but the figures will be more than a year out of date by Election Day. Meanwhile the Republican Party does not have any form of campaign page. However, Will St Clair, software engineer for Obama's reelection bid, insists 'the writing has been on the wall for a long time'. 'On the friend list issue, I was very skeptical that would last,' he told MailOnline. 'Even with access, the information wasn't always complete enough for an accurate match against the voter file. 'Many users' privacy settings blocked these fields, and there is increasing awareness of privacy issues in general.' He told MailOnline that Facebook's understanding of its audience is far more sophisticated just three years on. After uploading an advert, an organization can trust Facebook to serve it to users that will be interested. Last chance: The Ready For Hillary campaign page will be able to farm current supporters' information and track friend lists before April 2015. But that information will be more than a year out of date by Election Day . 'Many organizations were treating social as unlimited free earned media,' he said. 'The idea that an existing relationship with your supporters exempts you from having to pay the piper strikes me as a bit disingenuous. 'We were successful at getting people to share content with friends who were higher-priority targets for us, but it was still very organic. 'It's hard to argue that it made a substantial difference, especially compared to the size and sophistication of our field, digital, and traditional media programs. 'Facebook will do whatever it takes to keep your feed enjoyable to read: they need to sell ads on it. Ads are where the game is (perhaps always was) for campaigns.'","Facebook will block third-party apps from accessing  users' friends lists .

"Two British women aid workers were kidnapped and raped in front of their father after being stopped at an unofficial checkpoint in Libya. The sisters were abducted when their vehicle was stopped on the outskirts of the eastern city of Benghazi. They were taken by men in military uniforms to an isolated farm and subjected to a horrific sex attack in front of their father. Kidnap: The sisters, who are of Pakistani origin, were kidnapped on Tuesday at an unofficial checkpoint on the outskirts of Benghazi . Witnesses said the young women, both Pakistan-born British citizens, were wearing veils and Free Palestine T-shirts. Libyan officials said four suspects have been arrested and security forces are trying to trace a fifth. It was unclear whether they were part of the ‘revolutionary brigades’ that serve under the country’s security ministries or outlaw militia. Deputy prime minister Awad al-Barassi said the sisters were in a ‘very bad shape’ after the horrific attack, which happened on Tuesday. Last night they were preparing to fly home to the UK. He said the women were part of an ten-vehicle aid convoy trying to reach the Gaza Strip with medical supplies. Organised by IHH, a Turkish humanitarian relief organisation, the aid mission left Britain on February 25 but became stuck in Libya when Egyptian border guards refused to let the convoy cross into Egypt. Facebook post: Turkish humanitarian relief organisation posted on Facebook that the group had not been in grave danger when they were captured . The family were on a bus on their way to Benghazi’s Benina airport when they were stopped at the unofficial checkpoint by armed young men in military uniforms. Mr al-Barassi said the women and their father were kidnapped, and the man witnessed his daughters’ rape. He said he visited the victims and met their father at a Benghazi hospital to apologise on behalf of the Libyan people and government. He described the family as being in a ‘very bad psychological state’. There were reports that two other members of the aid group were also assaulted by a different armed group and that two others are missing. The remaining members of the aid convoy travelled to the Turkish consulate in Benghazi for safety. The family was on its way to Benghazi¿s Benina International Airport when they were stopped at a checkpoint . Mr al-Barassi said those involved in the attack would stand trial soon. The attack highlights how Libya remains a dangerous place for foreigners in the aftermath of the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime. Hundreds of heavily armed militia, many with links to criminal gangs, continue to operate freely across the country.","Two women were abducted on the outskirts of Benghazi en route to Gaza .

"Prince Harry's visit to Oman this week has been thrown into jeopardy after the country's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, was forced to travel to Germany for medical treatment. As a result, parts of the programme, including a parade, have been cancelled, while the Sultan's cousin, Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said, will welcome the British royal at the airport in his place. This is the second time the 73-year-old ruler, who has been on the throne for 44 years, has had to seek medical help in Germany in three months. Unwell: Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said has had to travel to Germany for medical treatment . In August, Sultan Qaboos travelled to Europe for a routine check-up and was declared in good health - much to his delight. Immediately after returning to Oman, the Sultan, who has no children and thus no heirs, issued a statement that read: . 'The Diwan of Royal Court is honoured to reassure the loyal citizens of Oman that His Majesty Sultan Qaboos is in sound health after conducting medical tests, which His Majesty will continue over the coming period in accordance with a specific medical programme.' But his health has deteriorated in recent weeks and Wednesday's National Day Parade, which would have been the centrepiece of Harry's visit, has been cancelled. Nevertheless, the 30-year-old will still travel to the country and will visit the British Embassy in Muscat, following a ceremonial welcome at Muscat Airport. Visit: Despite the Sultan's absence, Harry's two-day visit to Oman will go ahead minus some key events . Hospitable: Sultan Qaboos has welcomed several British royals to Oman, among them the Queen in 2010 . Colourful: Oman is famous for its horse parades but Wednesday's event will no longer take place . During his visit to Oman, Harry will also travel to the historic Nizwa Fort, where he will be greeted with a traditional sword dance. Built in the 1650s, the Fort is the work of Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya’rubi and is Oman's most visited national monument. After two days in Oman, the royal will travel on to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, to take part in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club. The event, which will help raise funds for Harry's Lesotho-based AIDs charity Sentebale, will also include a charity dinner, during which he will make a speech. Harry hopes that the extra funds will allow the charity to scale up the Mamohato Programme, which addresses the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV. The Mamohato Children's Centre is due to be completed in June 2015 and marks the beginning of Sentebale's plans to expand, both in Lesotho and across southern Africa.

Vain: Rodrigo Alves, 30, has undergone 20 cosmetic procedures including nose jobs, liposuction, six-pack and pec implants, calf shaping and botox fillers and now he's had the first-ever stem cell treatment in the UK to grow his hair back . The  flight attendant is the first person in the UK to have the procedure, which saw doctors inject stem cells into his scalp. The procedure took just four hours and now, two months on, Mr Alves says he is seeing the first results. Mr Alves, who lives in London, said: 'I started seeing results after two months. I have lots of baby hair coming through - it’s amazing. 'My hair was really thin and my temple was starting to recede but now it's coming back in leaps and bounds. Courtesy of ITV's 'This Morning' High tech: The flight attendant became the first person in the UK to undergo the procedure, which saw doctors inject stem cells into his scalp by taking fat from his back and mixing it with his blood . One step closer to his ideal: He said that before the treatment, his hair was really thin and his temple were starting to recede but now it's 'coming back in leaps and bounds' 'Seeing my hair begin to go like that was quite shocking. I was considering going to LA to have a transplant until I found these doctors. I’m getting so many compliments now. 'The main results are on my temple. I don't have a receding line anymore, I'm really happy with it all. It was well worth it.' Mr Alves' £5,100 ($8,000) procedure, which took place in Miami, began with liposuction on his back to extract fat cells. Doctors then took 500ml of his blood and blended the two in a special machine before injecting the mixture into his scalp. Intricate process: The operation involved him having liposuction in his back to extract fat cells before doctors took 500ml of his blood and mixed the two together in a special machine for a number of hours to extract the stem cells, which was then injected back into his scalp . The latest treatment is Mr Alves' 21st and he has had 12 major operations, eight smaller cosmetic procedures and spent more than £125,000 since the age of 20. His long list of surgery includes splashing out £8,000 on botox and fillers, £30,000 on three nose jobs, £3,000 on liposuction to his jaw and £10,000 on pec implants. He has also spent £22,000 on a fake six-pack, £7,000 on fillers to his arms, £7,000 on hospital bills, £7,000 on laser lipo, £6,000 on leg lipo and £3,000 on calf shaping. He also indulges in twice-yearly Botox and filler top-ups and takes a cocktail of daily pills consisting of collagen tablets, anti-water retention and hair growth tablets. Mr Alves said he 'admires' Barbie’s boyfriend Ken - because the toy looks like the 'ideal man'. He decided to go under the knife for the first time in 2004 after struggling with the way he looked since childhood. Cosmetic fan: Brazilian-born Rodrigo has had 12 major operations, eight smaller cosmetic procedures and spent more than £125,000 since the age of 20, including Botox and fillers . As he grew older, Mr Alves realised he didn’t have to put up with his looks - and had his first operation when he moved to London. 'I just want to present myself in a way I have always wanted to,' he said. 'Cosmetic surgery has really changed my life, it was a positive makeover for me. If it wasn’t for cosmetic surgery then I wouldn’t be the man I am today. 'I’m not trying to reach perfection, I’m just trying to be the best that my body allows me to be. I’m more confident now, I’m better looking and able to present myself in a different way.' But his attempt at perfection nearly cost him him life when a Brazilian doctor injected a gel into his arms to make them look more muscly. The 30-year-old was then struck down by a major infection which left him paralysed and unable to feed or wash himself. As he was: Rodrigo pictured before he spent £100,000 on cosmetic surgery procedures to turn himself into a real life Ken doll . After three weeks in hospital with the support of friends and family, he recovered and flew back to the UK. 'I am constantly researching for the best treatments and cosmetic procedures that can make me look better and stop the ageing process,' he added. 'I also still use a laser hair comb and many different vitamins and creams in other to improve the skin and hair condition. 'Thankfully we live in a very modern high-tech society and I believe that now science meet technology and both meet beauty which can be beneficial to many people. It is a constant maintenance process. 'I receive lots and lots of emails and messages on Facebook from people around the world asking for beauty and cosmetic advice. 'I want to set an example of positive makeover and break the taboo about cosmetic surgery.' Forward-thinking: He says that thankfully we live in a very modern high-tech society and he believes that now science meet technology and both meet beauty, which can be beneficial to many people .","Rodrigo Alves, 30, has undergone 20 cosmetic procedures .

"Most of her Made In Chelsea co-stars have turned their hand to designing fashion ranges and it seems that Fran Newman-Young was keen to jump on the bandwagon, too. The reality TV star, who lives with Binky Felstead, has unveiled and modelled her debut range for Daisystreet.co.uk and says it's a dream come true. Speaking to MailOnline about the launch as she gives us an exclusive sneak peek of her designs, the 26-year-old said: 'I am immensely excited. I've always dreamed of having my own fashion line. 'Back at school, my books were covered in doodles of outfits and I've made dozens of scrapbooks filled with magazine cuttings. That’s why creating this range has been such an amazing experience; I've learnt so much from their team.' New drop: Fran Newman-Young, who found fame on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her debut range for daisystreet.co.uk and says she's always dreamed of creating one . From party dresses to daytime attire, Fran promises that there's something for everyone in the collection and says each piece, which is no more than £50, is 'really affordable'. When it came to garnering inspiration for the range, the English graduate, who describes her personal style as 'Bohemian Grunge', looked to music icons. She said: 'A lot of my inspiration comes from Debbie Harry and Gwen Stefani - especially from her earlier years of No Doubt. There are also hints of Stevie Nicks' boho chic in there. 'I love vintage, throwback type pieces but with a bit of an edge. I think that’s really reflected in the collection. In particular with the fedoras, faux fur gilets and relaxed knits.' Party attire: From party dresses to daytime outfits, Fran promises that there's something for everyone . Inspired: Fran says a lot of her inspiration comes from Debbie Harry and Gwen Stefani and there's hints of Stevie Nicks' boho-chic style in there, too . Citing Kate Moss as her ultimate style crush, Fran was extremely complimentary about her co-stars' wardrobe choices. 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea has their own unique style, but I would love to raid Rosie's wardrobe. I've always admired Oliver Proudlock's style too,' she said. She would love to give Simon Cowell a makeover. 'He's a smart, powerful man who's overshadowed by jokes about his waistband,' she laughed. While Fran has fashion covered, her younger sister Olivia, who recently left the E4 show, is a talented make-up artist. Speaking about her sister's work, she said: 'Olivia is the best makeup artist I know. She gives me loads of tips. Her YouTube tutorials are really useful too, especially the one on how to create the perfect liquid liner flick. 'She knows how I like my skin dewy and fresh with minimal coverage. Unfortunately, she doesn't do my makeup as much as I would like her too.' Boho babe: Fran has given FEMAIL an exclusive sneak peek of the new range and she hopes it will provide some Christmas party wardrobe inspiration . Big plans: Fran says she would love to continue with her own fashion line with the e-tailer and says her head is already filled with ideas for SS15 .

"Mama June is lying when she says she has not rekindled her relationship with sex offender Mark McDaniel, Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson has said. In an interview with Dr Phil on Tuesday, Uncle Poodle said he had seen her kissing McDaniel, who was released from prison in March - 10 years after her daughter Anna accused him of molesting her. He added that, despite June's claims, images of her and McDaniel have not been photoshopped - and insisted that he had seen them in bed together with her nine-year-old daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo', during a recent trip to North Carolina. 'She tells everyone that [she and Mark] haven't seen each other and that the photos are photo shopped,' he told Dr Phil. 'It's a big lie.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Honey Boo Boo's uncle Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson has claimed he saw McDaniel and Mama June together, and heard her boasting about having sex with him while on a trip to North Carolina . After the interview, Uncle Poodle flew to Los Angeles for a polygraph test. It revealed that he was telling the truth about seeing Mama June, McDaniel and Alana in bed together during the weekend trip to a North Carolina casino in September. He explained that he and his husband had been sharing a room with June, McDaniel and Alana on the weekend trip and awoke to see them in bed, with June in the middle. At one point at the weekend, McDaniel and June went off together and she returned and - in front of Alana - and described how they had just had sex. 'It got graphic,' he told Dr Phil. Uncle Poodle said that by the time they took the trip, he knew McDaniel was a sex offender so wanted to go to ensure that Alana was safe. Quizzed: Footage from Dr Phil shows Uncle Poodle having a polygraph test. He was asked if he saw Mama June, Mark McDaniel and nine-year-old Honey Boo Boo in a bed together - he said yes and passed . He said that he first met him when he drove Mama June to a house viewing on September 9, and disputed her claim that she did not know McDaniel would be there. When Uncle Poodle returned home, he asked a police friend to run McDaniel's name - and learned he was a sex offender. 'Why would you take your child in front of him knowing that he molested your child?' he said. 'It ticked me off.' He added that Child Protective Services had interviewed him and that he had told them what he had seen, and shared with them photographs he had taken. The interview with Uncle Poodle came just a day after Mama June spoke to Dr Phil. The 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' matriarch insisted that she had no idea that her daughter Anna had been molested by her former boyfriend until two years ago. 'Anna did not tell me, my mother didn't tell me what he was accused of,' June claimed. 'I didn't hear Anna's side of the story until she moved in with me two and a half years ago.' Denial: Mama June appeared on an interview with Dr Phil on Monday and answered questions about her reported relationship with the man accused of molesting her daughter. She denied they were together . She said that even when McDaniel was arrested and in jail, no one would tell her why he was locked up - including the police and the jail staff. But she admitted that she didn't do enough to protect the girl, who told police that she was molested repeatedly in 2002, sometimes while her little sister Pumpkin, then three, was beside her. 'I do in a way feel like I did fail to protect Anna, but I didn't know,' she told Dr Phil. 'And she admitted that too. I was at work when this happened so I knew nothing, and she never did come to me, anything, the whole time it was happening.' She said that even when she did find out a couple of years ago, she was not sure what to believe. 'A person I lived with five years, I don't know if he could do that,' she said. 'It was a shock. I wanted to talk to Anna to get her side of the story but I wasn't able to.' McDaniel ultimately pleaded guilty to child molestation and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Since he was released earlier this year, he has been pictured with Mama June and her kids. But she denied anything was going on. Scandal: Mark McDaniel, left, was locked up for 10 years after pleading guilty to child molestation and since his release earlier this year, he has been pictured with Mama June, right, and her daughter Honey Boo Boo . Accusations: Her oldest daughter Anna accused McDaniel of molesting her when she was just eight and has expressed her anger that her mother could have rekindled her relationship with the man . 'I'm not in a relationship with Mark McDaniel,' she insisted. 'I have seen him twice [since he was released]. One time was by coincidence.' She said that she happened to bump into him 'in the mountains' but that they ignored each other. Then in mid-September, she claims she went to give his son diapers and McDaniel was there. Photographs were taken and leaked showing them smiling and walking around a house together with Honey Boo Boo. Mama June said these were from the accidental September meeting. She said that the only words they exchanged at that meeting were, 'Hey, how ya doing?' She also insisted that another image shared by TMZ and showing her in bed with McDaniel had been photoshopped, claiming that she had other very similar photos of herself on her computer. TMZ said it stands by the integrity of their images '100 per cent'. Mama June, whose real name is June Shannon, claimed that she met with McDaniel the second time so that her daughter Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Thompson could get some closure. Getting back together? Sugar Bear, Mama June's estranged husband, also appeared on the show and they revealed they are still living together - although they are not having a relationship . Questions: One of Mama June's daughters, Pumpkin, said she had asked her mother if she could see McDaniel after his release from prison because she wanted to get closure, and her mother agreed . She said that McDaniel raised the girl, now 14, from when she was two months to when she was six years, and that Pumpkin had many questions about who he really was. Pumpkin later appeared on the show and confirmed what her mother had claimed. 'I guess I wanted closure on actually who he was,' Pumpkin told Dr Phil. 'I wanted to actually know for sure if he did what he did.' But when faced with him, she didn't ask him about the molestation, she said, because she didn't feel like she could. She added: 'If I knew it would blow up as big as it is now, I would never have asked.' She added that she no longer had a relationship with her sister Anna because she thinks she has chosen to believe gossip about their mother and McDaniel, rather than the family. 'If we're supposed to be a family, why would you go by what someone else says and not listen to what your mama has to say?' she said. Mama June also claimed that she believes the recent scandal is only part of the reason why TLC canceled the show. She said she thinks her children were also getting 'wore down' by the filming. David 'Sugar Bear' Thompson - Honey Boo Boo's father and Mama June's estranged husband - also revealed that he is living in the home, despite the separation. But the couple insisted that they were not back together, and instead were just under the same roof for practical purposes in bringing their children up together. Family day out: Mama June is pictured with Sugar Bear and two of her daughters, Lauryn and Alana . 'I didn't say we were going to get back together, but I know he wants to try to get his family back together,' Mama June said. 'Nobody ever knows the future.' The interview comes three weeks after the photos emerged showing Mama June and McDaniel together. In another interview with Entertainment Tonight, Mama June revealed that she was also young when she started dating McDaniel, and indeed when she lost her virginity - at age 12. 'I had no idea what it was, how to whatever… and then it kind of escalated from there,' she explained. 'I was dating men who were in their 20s, 30s, my mom knew about it. I would kind of lie and say they were 21, 22. When me and Mark started dating, I was 20 and he was 38.' Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.","Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson claims to have seen Mama June and sex offender Mark McDaniel 'holding hands and kissing each other'

"As the birth of the Monegasque royal twins draws closer, Princess Charlene's father has told of his and wife Lynette's excitement at the impending arrival. Mike Wittstock, father of 36-year-old South African beauty, described the feeling as 'amazing' - and has even temporarily moved to Monaco to be close to their daughter. Speaking to French publication Point de vue, Mr Wittstock revealed that it has been a busy year for the Wittstock clan as he and his wife have celebrated the birth of two grandchildren already. Scroll down for video . The pregnant princess (pictured in September, left, and during a trip to America last month, right) has said: 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful' The princess with father, Mike Wittstock, on her wedding day. The proud father has moved to Monaco to be closer to his daughter as she prepares to become a mother for the first (and second) time next month . 'Our son Sean, who lives in South Africa, is the father of a 10-month-old child and yesterday it was the first birthday of our granddaughter,' he said. 'Now there are two others about to be born, as you know! It's amazing! Our grandchildren come fast and furious. Four in a year.' But to the South African also revealed that he is determined to treat all of his grandchildren equally - whether they have royal blood or not. 'I will respect everything required by the protocol, my daughter knows that, but other than that they will be treated in the same way as their cousins.' Princess Charlene showed off her baby bump alongside Prince Albert at the Princess Grace Foundation Cocktail Reception in Los Angeles last month . Mike Wittstock, pictured above left with his Charlene and above right with wife Lynette on their daughter's wedding day, described the impending birth as  'amazing' 'I have already opened a savings account for their futures and my daughter's children will also have their own, with the same amount in. 'They certainly do not lack funds but I will treat them equally.' Prince Albert has two children from previous relationships - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, 22, and son Alexandre Coste, 10 - but neither are able to inherit the throne. The princess recently spoke of her elation at the idea of becoming a mother. describing the experience as 'magical'. She told French publication Paris Match, 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful. We are full of love, gratitude, as well as a great sense of responsibility. 'I am particularly grateful for the spontaneous love bestowed on me in these special moments. The show of affection for my family, of the totality of the Monegasque people and all our friends.' After and before: The princess  at seven months pregnant (left) and in April before announcing that she was expecting (right) The royal couple announced they were expecting in May but the news that the former Olympic swimmer had twins on the way was unofficially broken on Twitter a week later by a friend of the princess's father. South African TV presenter Derek Watts, a friend of Mike Wittstock, tweeted: 'My old Bulawayo schoolmate Mike Wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats Princess Charlene and Albert!' The official announcement of the twins was only made last month, with the Palace releasing a statement that read: . 'The Prince and Princess of Monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year.' With an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies, an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - isn't unusual. Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia is one royal parent of twins, who with wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg welcomed Carl Friedrich and Louis Ferdinand in 2013. Another is Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who became parents to Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011. Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, following the birth of Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry, to his wife María Margarita Vargas Santaella in 2010. But although royal twins are fairly frequent among European dynasties, among them the Monégasque couple, British royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years. Born to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430, Alexander and James were the first and only twins born to British royal parents. Tragically though, Alexander, the eldest of the two, died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of Scotland as James II. During his marriage to Mary of Guelders, James sired no fewer than seven children, all of them in separate pregnancies. Despite the lack of British royal twins, odds have shortened on another double birth - for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - taking place. While the Monégasque rules of succession are clear, the British rules aren't set in stone, although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares, the question of who inherits what is less vexed. In theory, with Prince George already in the royal nursery, the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role. As for which parent is responsible for the Monégasque royal twins - or the British ones, should they come to pass, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth, although the mother is the more likely candidate. ‘Twins are not genetically based,' he explains. 'Monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two, creating identical twins. ‘Another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised, creating non identical twins. ‘If either the mother or the father have twins in their family, the chances of them having twins is higher.’","Mike Wittstock spoke of family's excitement ahead of royal birth .

"The next Mrs Jean-Christophe Novelli says she’s nifty with a knife, as her future husband, being a Michelin-starred chef, has taught her. She goes to show me and I think: ‘Oh yawn, she’s going to chop carrots.’ But no! It turns out to be much more thrilling. She’s talking about throwing knives, not dicing veg with them. ‘I’m quite good now,’ says Michelle Kennedy, a 39-year-old brunette who hails from Luton but is currently in the Austrian Alps, planning her wedding in a castle. Scroll down for video . TV chef Jean-Christophe Novelli with fiancee Michelle Kennedy and their two sons Jean, five, and Jaques, two . Video courtesy of ALDI . ‘Jean taught me that it’s all in the wrist action. It started when he was chopping one day and threw the knife down on a board. He showed me how, and I got quite into it, to the point where we even put targets on a barn door at home for practice. ‘He has a portrait of himself in the kitchen and once I tried to hit it. Bingo! I took a chunk out of his face.’ Blimey. Who knew kitchen skills were so transferable? If the bottom falls out of the food industry, they could become a circus act. Still, being able to inflict such damage is arguably useful when you’re set to marry a man famed for his way with the ladies. Having read the newspaper cuttings as I travelled to meet the happy couple, though, I can see the attraction in taking a sharp implement to Mr Novelli: for as well as apparently being the sexiest chef on the planet, he might also qualify as the most sexist. This, after all, was the man who said of Nigella Lawson: ‘From the back, she looks 60.’ His explanation for this is little more than him gazing at me with puppy-dog eyes (at 53, he’s filled out a bit since Hell’s Kitchen but the swoon-factor is still great), and saying he was caught out with a ‘silly little interview’. Kennedy, 39, met Novelli in an airport where she was doing promotional work and he was catching a flight . ‘I was a prat and I should have been in control of that, but it was a ridiculous thing.’ So, is he sexist? He looks appalled and says he is hurt I could think that. He can’t possibly be sexist because ‘it’s as bad as being racist’. He says he has lots of friends who are women. Delia Smith hugged him the other day. ‘And the TV chef Rosemary Shrager is one of my best friends. I gave her her first job — would I have done that if I was sexist?’ His fiancee, being from Luton rather than Languedoc, has a less romantic approach. ‘He can be such an ****hole,’ says Michelle. ‘I did go mad with him. It was an outrageous thing to say. He was furious with Nigella because she said she preferred Italian food to French food. ‘No other French chef reacted like he did. Michel Roux didn’t go off on one. But Jean did — and in the most awful way. I said to him, “You haven’t just insulted Nigella but every woman on the planet. My sister, my mum . . .”’ But he isn’t sexist? ‘No! He just says things without thinking. Things he doesn’t even mean!’ Hmm. Novelli also tends to say things that aren’t quite true. Like they’d marry in Luton Airport, where they first met eight years ago (she was doing promotional work; he was catching a plane). ‘Oh that’s Jean making up stories,’ she says. ‘He does like to tell people things they want to hear.’ Although the pair have a home in Hertfordshire — where his cookery school is — they spend summers at their second home, an hour outside Salzburg. Despite getting engaged seven years ago and raising a young family, the romance is still alive for the couple . Everything about them is dramatic — outwardly at least. He was part of that wave of chefs who became as famous as rock stars; their Michelin stars as shiny as gold discs. At the height of his fame, he was appearing on TV, bringing out books, running a string of restaurants and endorsing products. Voted the world’s sexiest chef, he could do no wrong. Then, in 1999 he went bankrupt. Friend Marco Pierre White appeared brandishing a cheque book. ‘I told him to f*** off,’ he says. ‘I was too proud to take his money. He said, “Jean, do not be a prat. Tell me how much”.’ His private life has been a rollercoaster, too. Hearing his fiancee describe it is quite an eye-opener. He no longer sees his first wife, Tina, who he met when he was just 22, despite having an adult daughter, Christina, together. Michelle Kennedy says she wasn't put off by her French fiance's  reputation as a womaniser . Their split, after she cheated on him, was acrimonious. ‘He was never at home,’ explains Michelle. ‘They were young. You can see how that wouldn’t work.’ His second marriage, in 1999 to South African model Anzelle Visser, ended in divorce in 2005. ‘They shouldn’t have married.’ Many women would run a mile from getting involved with someone with such a colourful past. And, to be fair, they are not in a rush to make the union official. They got engaged seven years ago, and since then have had two sons — Jean, six, and Jacques, two. She says her friends groan and go ‘not again’ when she tells them they have a date: August 2016. 2016?! ‘There’s no rush,’ she says. ‘I feel we’ve been married from the first moment we set eyes on each other.’ When they first met, Michelle was determined not to be another notch on his bedpost. She took a job at his cookery school, but resolved to keep their relationship professional. ‘I thought he was incredibly handsome, and I could easily fall for him — but I wasn’t going to. I remember saying “Don’t look into his eyes, Michelle”. For six months, I didn’t.’ What was she afraid of? ‘He had a reputation. He was French, famous, you know.’ Yet he was smitten. Within six months, he’d seduced her. He took her to dinner with his friend, the late chef Keith Floyd. She knew she was in love with him when she saw him dancing in a club afterwards — badly. ‘I was already on the dance floor — and this manic figure came towards me, all arms and legs flying. It was Jean. It was so passionate. He dances like he does everything else — throws himself in.’ Michelle’s very pretty, with astonishing eyes, but regards herself as ‘nothing special’. It took a while for her to trust him. ‘Oh yes, at the start I went through his phone messages, thinking I was going to catch him out, but I didn’t. Then I realised “he means this”. He wants a family life. He wants loyalty.’ What about the female attention he attracts, though? They can be blatant, she says, slipping numbers into his jacket pocket. She stands up and thrusts her chest out, to demonstrate what women do in front of him. How does he deal with it? ‘He’s very good at repelling it,’ she says. ‘He’s the most loyal person I know.’ He isn’t at all aware of his looks, she says. Jean gets all French when I ask him about fidelity. ‘It is the most important thing. If someone is unfaithful at home, you must question everything about them.’ Despite admitting to booze-fuelled rows, the couple have settled into domestic bliss . Did he and his big mate Marco ever discuss fidelity (Marco being another of the culinary world’s supposed bad boys)? He looks shocked. ‘Marco was NEVER unfaithful. Never. I know this for a fact. He’s a remarkable man.’ What’s interesting is how many parallels there were, in the early days at least, between Jean and Michelle’s fiery relationship and the one between Marco and his (now estranged) wife Mati. Michelle says they had their fair share of huge, often booze-fuelled rows, where petty jealousies and insecurities came to the fore. ‘About two years ago, we actually changed the way we were doing things because we were drinking too much, and rowing through the drink. I’d accuse him of flirting with other women. He’d do the same. It’s destructive.’ Although he still appears on TV, Jean’s main job is now the cookery school. Neither seem to miss the restaurants. ‘Not having them — and the hours that go with them — means we have a chance of a family life,’ says Michelle. He must miss the Michelin stars, though? ‘I am still a Michelin-starred chef,’ he says. ‘I always will be.’ What about Michelle? It now seems almost de rigeur for TV chef WAGs to launch their own career (Jools Oliver’s clothing range, Tana Ramsay’s cookery book). It seems we shouldn’t hold our breath for the latter. ‘Oh God no, I’m a hopeless cook,’ she says. ‘ . She could, though, write the definite book on How To Tame A Man.

"One Direction's Zayn Malik has said he is 'angry and upset' after Today host Matt Lauer questioned bandmates about alleged drug use in his absence. The presenter was booed by fans after asking the remaining four members why the 21-year-old wasn't there, suggesting it was not down to illness and questioned whether it was actually because of rumored substance abuse. Speaking to Dan Wootton at British newspaper The Sun, Malik confirmed that he was too ill to fly to America over the weekend as the band begin promoting their new album Four. Scroll down for video . A special appearance on the Today show to promote their new album was spoiled by 1D appearing a man down due to Zayn Malik, 21, suffering apparently from a 'tummy bug' Matt Lauer risked the wrath of an audience full of devoted One Direction fans on Monday when he quizzed the boy band about drugs . He said: 'I'm really angry and upset by what was said on The Today Show. I was really ill at the weekend. That's why I couldn't fly to America.' During the interview at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, Lauer said: 'I'm counting chairs here and I see four. Normally we're used to seeing you guys with five, so let's start with the obvious: where is Zayn?’ 'He’s got a tummy bug so he’s not very well,’ explained Liam Payne. ‘We only found out this morning so we’re really sad, he is as well, that he can’t be here for our album release.' Lauer then decided to press the boys for more information, citing online speculation that drugs might be the real reason for Malik’s no show. 'There has been a lot of action on social media about him,’ said Lauer. ‘Is it something more serious than just a minor illness? There have been rumors of substance abuse: what's going on?' Malik's band-mates Louis Tomlinson left, and Niall Horan, right, shifted nervously in their seats when asked to explain Zayn's absence . Fans showed their concern about Zayn's absence with the hashtag #GetWellSoonZayn, which quickly becoming a worldwide trending topic on Twitter . The host’s question drew loud boos from the crowd made up of predominantly of teenage girls who had been waiting hours for the band's appearance . 'No, he's just got a stomach bug, he's OK. He's just at home, he needs to rest,' said Payne, while he band-mates shifted nervously in their seats. This isn't Malik's first absence from 1D duties, earlier this month he wasn't present for the filming of a video to receive an MTV Europe award. In May, MailOnline ran exclusive video footage of Malik and bandmate Louis Tomlinson caught laughing and joking about marijuana as they shared a roll-up 'joint' during the Latin America leg of their 2014 Stadium Tour. A representative for 1D told MailOnline: 'Zayn was taken ill after recording the Band Aid single at the weekend and was unfortunately not well enough to fly to the USA yesterday.

'He will join the band for promotion for the new album as soon as he possibly can.' Payne was joined on Today by bandmates Harry Styles, Tomlinson, and Niall Horan for the launch of the band's now somewhat ironically titled new album Four.

"A British couple from Leeds got their Hollywood happy ending after getting engaged on stage - with a little help from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger, who is famous for his roles in blockbusters such Predator and The Terminator, later posted a video of the proposal online. The clip, which has now attracted over 30,000 hits, opens with a voiceover from the star, in which he says: 'This was a first. Spoiler: She said yes. Congratulations! I wish you the best'. Scroll down for video . Left: Dean Goulding, 29 goes down on one knee and proposes to girlfriend Jessica Eddy, 25, as Arnie looks on; Right: The couple celebrate on stage with the star at a charity event in Leeds . The couple, Dean Goulding, 29, and Jessica Eddy, 25, were called to the stage by Mr Schwarzenegger, who  was making an appearance in Leeds at a charity event. In the video, Mr Goulding then gets down on one knee and pops the question to Miss Eddy, as the former Governor of California looks on. Mr Schwarzenegger then embraces the happy couple, as Elland Road, Leeds United's football ground, erupts into cheers. Speaking afterwards, Miss Eddy told of her disbelief at the surprise proposal and her admiration for the Terminator star. 'I still can't believe it, I'm so shocked,' said the delighted bride-to-be. 'It feels like I'm in a dream. 'Arnie comes across the funniest person and seems so grounded and really kind-hearted - and what he did for us really shows that.' Miss Eddy, a receptionist at the local university, has been dating Mr Goulding, a physical trainer employed by the Navy, for six years. This is the moment a couple perfected their Hollywood ending - after getting engaged on stage with Arnold Schwarzenegger at a charity event hosted by Jonathan Ross . She added: 'I'm a massive Arnie fan but Dean's the one who has lots of pictures of him round the house!' Mr Goulding, who is currently in the process of moving to Bahrain for six months for work, said: 'It was amazing. He's my idol!' During his two-hour set, which was hosted by Jonathan Ross, Mr Schwarzenegger talked movies, bodybuilding and politics. The actor and politician appeared in Leeds last Friday for one of only two UK appearances, and paid tribute to Reg Park, the Leeds United reserve player whom went on to be crowned Mr Universe and starred in Hercules movies. 'It's wonderful to be back in Leeds,' Mr Schwarzenegger, 67, told the crowd. 'For me it's kind of emotional coming here because my idol Reg Park was born in Leeds. 'He was one of the best bodybuilders of all time and is one of the people who was most inspirational for me.' Speaking about his impressive career, he said: 'It is a dream come true. I want to let people know that anyone can do it. Anyone of us is a champion.' Mr Schwarzenegger also helped auction an array of movie memorabilia, raising thousands of pounds for Leeds-based Candlelighters and Global's Make Some Noise Charity. He even coughed up £15,000 to buy one of the lots himself - a mosaic of the Terminator.

"Levels of vitamin D in pregnant women may not affect the baby’s bone health - contrary to official advice, say scientists. They found no link between a mother’s levels of the vitamin while carrying the child, and the latter’s bone health at the age of 10. Current NHS guidance says all pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a 10 microgram vitamin D supplement every day, because it is believed to help build stronger bones in their offspring. Research: The study showed that there was no obvious link between mothers taking Vitamin D while pregnant and the strength of their children's bones . Professor Debbie Lawlor, who led the . Children of the 90s study at Bristol University, said there was ‘no . strong evidence’ that pregnant women should be taking vitamin D . supplements.’ But other experts said some groups of . women such as those getting little sunlight and the obese were more at . risk of low vitamin D stores and they should still be encouraged to do . so. The study published in The Lancet . medical journal assessed vitamin D levels in 3960 women . throughout their pregnancy. The bone mineral content (BMC), a measure of bone health, of their child was then assessed at an average age of 9.9 years. Researchers measured vitamin D levels at all stages of pregnancy. Levels were higher in summer months . and lower among non-white mothers and those who smoked during pregnancy, . but overall there was no significant link between a mother’s vitamin D . levels and her child’s BMC. The Sunshine vitamin: Those who have limited exposure to sunlight are advised to continue taking the supplements . Dr Tony Falconer, President of the . Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said ‘We know that . Vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium in the body, which helps to . keep bones and teeth healthy, and low levels have been associated with . problems relating to the baby’s bone formation and a higher risk of . diseases such as rickets and osteoporosis in later life. ‘Some women are more at risk of . having low vitamin D levels, these women include those of south Asian, . black African, black Caribbean, or Middle Eastern origin, women who have . limited exposure to sunlight, obese women (pre-pregnancy BMI >30) and those who eat a diet low in vitamin D. It is particularly important . these women get their required dose. ‘As healthcare professionals, it is . our role to reinforce the importance for proper diet and nutrition . during pregnancy and throughout a woman’s lifespan. 'It is important that at-risk women . are informed, at their first antenatal booking, of the importance of . adequate vitamin D during pregnancy and after, to maintain their own and . their baby’s health. ‘Further research is needed to look at vitamin supplementation including potential benefits, harms and optimal dosing.’","'No obvious link' between Vitamin D tablets and healthy bones in babies .

"He may run some of the world's leading technology companies such as SpaceX and Tesla Motors, but in recent months Elon Musk has become increasingly wary of the growth of technology. In particular, he has repeatedly expressed his concern at the rise in artificial intelligence, and he thinks it could pose a serious threat to the future of humanity. In his latest comment he fears that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ could be in as few as five years. SpaceX and Tesla CEO has again warned of the dangers of AI robots. In a comment he said he feared something 'dangerous happening'. Musk (pictured) says the rise of AI will be exponential could spell disaster. He cites a London-based company called Deepmind as an example of how rapidly AI is improving . Although he doesn’t go into detail, he alludes to ‘digital superintelligences’ and internet bots as being among the potential problems facing humanity. Musk made the comment on futurology site Edge, but deleted it soon after. The reason for him deleting it is not known, although Business Insider suggests it may be because he feared being mocked for his ‘outlandish predictions’. In the comment he says the pace of progress in AI is ‘incredibly fast’. DeepMind Technologies is a British artificial intelligence company based in London. It was acquired by Google for £400m ($625m) in January 2014. The company says its exact goal is to ‘solve intelligence’, one of its recent achievements being the creation of a neural network that learns how to play video games. The team is building algorithms that can learn in an attempt to create artificial intelligence. Otherwise, though, the goals and methods of the company are not well-known - but it was apparently enough to convince Google to fork out a fairly sizable chunk of cash. He continues: ‘Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast - it is growing a pace close to exponential.’ He goes on to say that the risk of something dangerous happening is in the ‘five year timeframe’ or ten years at most. But he adds that he is normally ‘super pro technology’ and has not raised this issue until recent months. ‘This is not a case of crying wolf about something I don’t understand,’ he writes. ‘I am not alone in thinking we should be worried. ‘The leading AI companies have taken great steps to ensure safety. ‘They recognise the danger, but believe that they can shape and control the digital superintelligences and prevent bad ones from escaping into the internet. That remains to be seen…’ Musk made the comment on futurology website Edge (screenshot shown) but then deleted it. It follows numerous other such comments from the entrepreneur recently . Although he doesn’t go into detail, he alludes to ‘digital superintelligences’ and internet bots as being among the potential problems facing humanity (stock image shown) Musk’s latest comments follow similar opinions posited by the entrepreneur in recent weeks. In August in a tweet he said AI could be potentially more dangerous than nuclear weapons. Then in early October Musk, talking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit, said that AI could delete humans akin to ‘spam’ in an email inbox. Later in October, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AeroAstro Centennial Symposium he said: ‘I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence.’ He continued: 'I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. ‘With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.’ He is not alone in his viewpoint, though. Others, such as Stephen Hawkling, have also expressed concern at the rapid rise of AI. ‘Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,’ Hawking said earlier this year in the Independent. ‘Unfortunately, it might also be the last.’","SpaceX and Tesla CEO has again warned of the dangers of AI robots .

"An American veterinarian's trip of a lifetime was ruined in September when she was arrested in East Timor after sharing a cab with a stranger caught smuggling drugs. Since then, 41-year-old Stacey Addison has been unable to leave the southeast Asian country, and is currently being held at a women's prison as the State Department and members of Congress fight for her release. 'Just to think of it, to think that she's in a cell locked up, 18 hours a day, really it breaks my heart to think of it,' Addison's mother Bernadette Kero, of Klamath Falls, Oregon, told CBS.'I'm trying to write everybody I can. I'll write the Pope, Bill Clinton - someone's got to be out there that can resolve this.' 'I just want my daughter home, that's all, I just want my daughter to be freed, to come home,' Kero added. Holiday from hell: Stacey Addison, 41 (pictured), is currently imprisoned in East Timor, where she is being held as a witness to a crime. The veterinarian from Portland, Oregon was arrested in September after sharing a cab with a stranger who was caught smuggling meth in the southeast Asian country . Addison planned the solo-trip to see wildlife around the world for nearly two years, and had visited Antarctica and parts of Europe before she landed in southeast Asia in early September. On September 5, Addison was sharing a cab with a complete stranger, en route to the capital city of Dili, when she first ran into trouble. 'The other passenger said he wanted to pick up a package at DHL and when he came out, the police swarmed it and she was terrified,' Kero said. Wrong place, wrong time: Addison crossed into East Timor on September 5, sharing a cab with a stranger who asked to stop at a DHL office to pick up a package. Police swarmed the vehicle and found the package contained meth. Addison pictured above stuck in East Timor on October 20 . That package contained meth, and everyone in the car was arrested. Addison spent the next four nights in jail, and when officials eventually released her, they took her passport leaving her unable to travel outside the country. 'Police searched me, they tested my urine. Everything was negative, so I thought its okay, it will be okay - but it's not,' Addison said. She remained positive since her computer records turned up clean and she had no criminal record. State Department spokesman Jen Psaki says it's believed Addison is being held as a witness to the crime, and that they are doing everything in their power to secure her release. But since East Timor just gained independence in 2002, their justice system is still in development which has hindered the drug case, leaving Addison lonely, frightened and alone and in a strange country. The case took yet another negative turn on October 28, when she was arrested again and put behind bars in a cell. She is currently incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison where she shares a cell with several other prisoners, including a women who just gave birth to a baby, and cares for the child behind bars. Addison's lawyer Paul Remedios says he still hasn't received an answer as to why his client was arrested again. Last Friday, the National Parliament fired all foreign judges and advisers in the legal system, including the prosecutor who was handling Addison's case. Remedios says he does not even know who is handling the case now. 'I would not say she is happy,' Remedios told Fox News in a phone interview. 'She is not. But she's strong and knows we are doing all we can to help her.' The lawyer now plans to file an appeal to have Addison released on grounds that her arrest was illegal. According to the law in East Timor, suspects and their lawyers are entitled to know when and why and arrest is imminent, but Remedios says he still hasn't received a copy of the arrest warrant. Behind bars: Addison's passport was seized after her first stint in jail, leaving her unable to leave the country. Her case took yet another bad turn on October 28, when she was arrested again and incarcerated at Gleno Women's Prison (pictured above) where she remains today . 'Her human rights were violated,' Remedios said. 'According to our national laws there is a miscarriage of justice in the making.' U.S. Embassy workers and her lawyer visit Addison in jail regularly, bringing her books and even birthday cake. Her cellmates helped her celebrate her birthday behind bars on November 5, and since they couldn't give her any gifts, vowed to pray for her swift release. Several members of Congress have been working to secure Addison's release, including Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley. 'We are in continual communication with the State Department and they are taking all appropriate action to respond,' a spokesperson for the Democrat said in a statement. 'Senator Merkley and his staff will continue to do everything we can to assist Ms Addison and her family through this terrible situation.' Sending their love: Addison's lawyers and U.S. Embassy workers regularly visit her behind bars. Above, a few treats and letters she recently received. On November 5, Addison celebrated her 41st birthday with her cell mates . Champions: Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley and California Rep Darrell Issa have both fought for Addison's release. Pictured above at the hostel where she was staying before her second arrest . Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, also spoke with East Timorese government officials about the case during a visit to the nation on October 7. Another factor which may speed the process of Addison's release, is the appointment of Karen Stanton as U.S. Ambassador to East Timor. 'East Timor has not had an ambassador in well over a year,' said Kero. 'We were told that the highest level Timorese officials would be more likely to talk with a U.S. Ambassador in place.' Addison is also scheduled to meet this week with the former president of East Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, who has been championing for her release. For now, Addison communicates with her friends and family back home through Facebook. Addison, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and UC Davis was living in Portland, Oregon before she set off on the second half of her trip earlier this year. Trip of a lifetime: Addison was on a trip around the world when she was arrested in East Timor.

"Carla Bruni will record a French-language version of Do They Know It's Christmas?, her agent confirmed today. Mrs Nicolas Sarkozy is rumoured to have lined up a number of French acts, including Daft Punk, for a continental take on the Band Aid song's revival in aid of the fight against Ebola in West Africa. Earlier today, organizer Bob Geldof announced that the volume of pre-orders for the track ensured it had raised in excess of £1million within minutes of the song being premiered on TV last night. Joyeux Noel: Italian singer and former First Lady of France Carla Bruni-Sarkozy will take part in a French-language recording of Do They Know It's Christmas? Geldof announced the former first lady of France's involvement in the interview with the BBC. Ms Bruni's involvement was later confirmed to The Telegraph by her agent. 'The Germans go into bat today, I have asked the Germans to do the German version and I have asked Carla Bruni to do it in France, to translate it into French, so they're going next.' Geldof has called the track 'a little bit of pop history' and said it delivered a powerful message about the urgent need to fight Ebola, estimated to have killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. He then went on to criticize the response from some national governments. 'The Germans aren't doing enough, frankly. Obviously the French have sent their troops to help in Guinea and of course the British, the squaddies are down in Sierra Leone,' he said. Bob Geldof, pictured on X Factor last night, announced that both Germany and France are recording their own versions of the Band Aid song . 'The Germans are the most powerful economy in Europe. They are laggards and they shouldn't be. 'It's as dangerous for them as it is for us. This thing is a flight away from us.' The latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas, released today, has already raised more than £1million and is set to top the charts. If it does, it will become the fourth time the charity record has taken the number one spot. The original recording, which featured Bono, George Michael, Paul Weller, Boy George and Simon le Bon, was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK when it was first released. It led to the successful Live Aid concerts in 1985, which raised around £150million for the fight against famine in Ethiopia. Since then, there have been two further charity recordings of the same track, Band Aid II in 1989 and Band Aid 20 in 2004, both of which also topped the charts. Band Aid II included contributions from Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Sir Cliff Richard among others, while Band Aid 20 featured Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal . All together: The Band Aid 2014 line up, from top row L-R: Kyle Simmons (Bastille),  William Farquarson (Bastille), Guy Garvey (Elbow), Chris 'Woody' Wood (Bastille), Chris Martin, Dan Smith (Bastille), Seal, Sir Bob Geldof, Karl Hyde (Underworld), Roger Taylor, Joe Suggs (Youtube), Alfie Deyes (Youtube), Milan Neil Amin-Smith (Clean Bandit) and Grace Chatto (Clean Bandit). Second Row L-R: Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Olly Murs, Sinead O'Connor, Ellie Goulding, Jessie Ware, Ed Sheeran, Zoella (Youtube), Angelique Kidjo, Emeli Sande, Paloma Faith. Front Row crouching: Midge Ure, Bono . The 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged Sudanese region of Darfur. Although it also reached Number 1, it sold just over one million copies, compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit. Band Aid 20 was also criticised by the World Development Movement, which said many of the song lyrics were 'patronising, false and out of date'. Sir Bob Geldof said he was spurred to mobilise today's pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola. 'The nurse forgot where she was, and what was happening, and wiped a tear from the child,' said Sir Bob. 'The child died and the nurse died. You can't get more tragic than that.' After this, Sir Bob – once disinclined to revisit Do They Know It's Christmas after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song. Fixed in his mind, as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer Midge Ure, was the image of the nurse wiping away the child's tear. Now the line 'Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears' is replaced with 'Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear'.","Carla Bruni 'to record version with French groups including Daft Punk'

"It's every bride's worst nightmare... that an unsightly blemish might ruin their wedding photos. And poor Solange Knowles appears to have suffered a nasty case of hives after walking down the aisle with her video director boyfriend Alan Ferguson on Sunday in a fun-filled New Orleans ceremony. The singer was pictured with unfortunate red lumps all over of her face and neck, something which TMZ has attributed to a food allergy, as she clambered into the back of a waiting car with her sister, Beyonce, and brother-in-law, Jay Z. Scroll down for video . Angry rash: Solange Knowles was pictures with raised, itchy-looking blemishes all over her face and neck as she left her New Orleans wedding venue on Sunday after tying the knot with Alan Ferguson . Her superstar sibling was at hand to help and appeared to be comforting her, covering her up in the back of the vehicle. A source told TMZ: 'Solange suffered some kind of food allergy, though she isn't sure what it was from....the hives were gone in a matter of minutes.' MailOnline has contacted the star's representative for comment. Luckily for Solange, it seems her angry allergic breakout only occurred at the end of the ceremony and didn't ruin the whole day. She was the epitome of elegance as she walked down the aisle with her long-term love Alan, clad in a conservative yet chic cape dress. Helping hand: Beyonce tried to assist her younger sister in the back of the car by covering her up . Family exit: The singer was also joined by her brother-in-law Jay Z and her 10-year-old son Daniel Julez from her first marriage in the getaway car . Supportive: The Halo hit-maker and Solange's new husband Alan Ferguson (R) rushed to her assistance . Personal ride: The key members of the wedding party left in a car while the 100 guests boarded party buses . What a difference: Poor Solange's skin looked amazing as she partied the night away a few hours earlier . After the wedding bells rang, Solange opted to let loose, slipping out of her floor-length gown and into a plunging jumpsuit - her second of the day - to commemorate her nuptials. But the 28-year-old singer seemed to be so high on love she didn't realize she suffered from a minor wardrobe malfunction while dancing the night away at a Mardi Gras style parade in New Orleans' French Quarter. Unfortunately, Solange had a slight nip slip, revealing a bit too much through the large cut-out in the front of her bright white caped onesie. After recognising the dilemma, she was seen holding a hand over her chest. Yet, nothing could keep the blushing bride from enjoying her big day, unable to stop smiling amid of any dramas. It's my party, I can let loose if I want to! Earlier in the evening, Solange suffered a minor wardrobe malfunction as she celebrated her nuptials during a Mardi Gras style party in the French Quarter of New Orleans . Racy: It seemed almost inevitable the singer would reveal a bit too much through the cut-out of her plunging white jumpsuit . Prior to her party, Solange was spotted in a Humberto Leon for Kenzo floor-length gown with an attached cape, which is what she wore to say 'I do' to her longtime love, reports Us Weekly. And the star wore yet another wedding ensemble, a plunging cream jumpsuit, as she and her love arrived at the venue together, riding bicycles. Her hair was styled in its signature Afro and she added a pop of collar to her cream ensemble with crimson lips which remained throughout the day. Nothing can rain on her parade! After noticing her issue, Solange kept smiling and covered up her chest . What a party! The newlyweds were surrounded by friends and family who mostly appeared to be wearing white . Solange's older sister Beyonce was also a glamorous sight at the nuptials on Sunday afternoon wearing the Maggie dress from collection Torn by Ronny Kobo. The 33-year-old stunned in the slinky white frock as she cradled her two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy outside the church, where her sister tied the knot in front of about 100 guests, reports E!. Slinky minx: Beyonce stunned in a fitted white frock from Torn by Ronny Kobo as she cradled her two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy en route to her sister's wedding . Multiple options! Solange donned a daring low-cut cream jumpsuit as one of her wedding outfits during her special day with her longtime love Alan Ferguson, right . She showed off her slender frame in the long white dress, which sported spaghetti straps and a low-cut neckline. She added white platform heels, and wore her highlighted hair in voluminous curls. The singer cradled her daughter, who looked adorable in a sparkling beige fairy-like dress.

Her little angel: The singer cradled her daughter, who looked adorable in a sparkling beige fairy-like dress . Family time: Beyonce and Jay Z were seen playing with their daughter on the lawn outside the venue . Earlier, Beyonce's husband Jay Z, 44, was seen dressed in a white suit as he carried Blue Ivy to the wedding. Meanwhile, a casually clad Beyonce carried what looked like a tulle dress as she ducked into the venue. The  superstar singer was edgy chic in a leather jacket featuring a colourful print on the back as she highlighted her shapely legs in blue skinny jeans paired with beige pointed-toe pumps. Breaking with tradition: Solange and her future husband Alan Ferguson were spotted riding bicycles to their nuptials . Leaving little to the imagination: Solange wore a plunging cream pantsuit with a cloak attached . Wheely good fun! Solange appeared to be having the time of her life on a bike alongside her new husband . The Pretty Hurts hitmaker carried an eggshell-white dress featuring a tulle skirt. Solange’s husband-to-be and her 10-year-old son from a previous marriage, Daniel Julez Smith, were also pictured arriving to the pre-wedding proceedings. The 51-year-old music video director sported a white windbreaker with loose-fitting white trousers and glossy black dress shoes. Happy day: The couple posed for a snap outside the venue, giving a huge grin for the camera . Glamazon: The 28-year-old wore her hair in its signature Afro and added a pop of collar to her cream ensemble with crimson lips . The wedding festivities kicked off on Friday with Solange and Alan treating Beyonce and about 50 of their friends to cinema night at the Indywood movie theatre. They watched the Diana Ross 1975 classic film Mahogany, the movie they saw on their first date, as People reported. Before the film played, the couple screened a very personal documentary that they made of how they met. Mr and Mrs Ferguson! Solange and her new husband were seen walking down the stairs after the ceremony . Pure elegance: Solange's outfit showed off her toned back as she stood waiting to take some pictures . 'It was pretty adorable,' Indywood Movie Theatre owner Hayley Sampson told People. 'They were talking about how they met and that they bonded (over) this film and then showed everybody the movie.' Everyone was in great spirits, a sign that the infamous elevator fight back in May - in which Solange was caught hitting Jay Z in front of Beyoncé - is all in the past. You can see where they got their looks from! Solange and Beyonce's mother Tina looked the height of style in a long-sleeved white dress . Daddy's girl! Jay Z was suited up in all white as he carried daughter Blue Ivy, who wore a sparkling beige fairy-like dress in New Orleans on Sunday . 'What's important is that my family and I are all good,' Solange told Lucky magazine. 'What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that.' 'At the end of the day families have problems and we're no different,' Solange, Beyoncé and Jay Z said in a joint statement after the physical altercation. 'We love each other and above all we are family. We've put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.' Edgy chic: A casually clad Beyonce carried her dress as she ducked into the venue .

"Evidence of rivers, streams, and lakes suggests that Mars was, at some point, warm enough for liquid water to flow on its surface, according to a new study. But, rather than having permanent bodies of water, as seen on Earth, the surface of Mars likely went through episodic periods. The study suggests that periods of temperatures warm enough for water to flow may have only lasted for  tens or hundreds of years at a time. Scroll down for video . Research suggests that warmth and water flow on ancient Mars (illustration shown) were probably episodic. These temperature changes may have also been related to brief periods of volcanic activity that spewed tons of greenhouse-inducing sulphur dioxide gas into the atmosphere . The study was carried out by scientists from Brown University  and Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science. These temperature changes may have also been related to brief periods of volcanic activity that spewed tons of greenhouse-inducing sulphur dioxide gas into the atmosphere. Evidence of water on Mars dates . back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues . of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and . fogs. Viking orbiters that . followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing . how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars . is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist . on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have . been warmer and wetter in the past. In . June last year, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good . enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of . soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface . of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. The work combines the effect of volcanism with the latest climate models of early Mars. With all that's been learned about Mars in recent years, the mystery of the planet's ancient water has deepened. The latest generation of climate models for early Mars suggests an atmosphere too thin to heat the planet enough for water to flow. The sun was also much dimmer billions of years ago than it is today, further complicating the issue. However, when volcanoes spewed out gas the atmosphere may have warmed enough for liquid water to form periodically on the surface. Co-author Dr James Head, Professor of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown University, said: 'These new climate models that predict a cold and ice-covered world have been difficult to reconcile with the abundant evidence that water flowed across the surface to form streams and lakes. 'This new analysis provides a mechanism for episodic periods of heating and melting of snow and ice that could have each lasted decades to centuries.' The work combines the effect of volcanism with the latest climate models of early Mars (mosaic shown). With all that's been learned about Mars in recent years, the mystery of the planet's ancient water has deepened. The researchers explored the idea that heating may have been linked to periodic volcanism . In this image from NASA's Curiosity rover in September 2012, a rock outcrop called Link pops out from a Martian surface that is elsewhere blanketed by reddish-brown dust. The fractured Link outcrop has blocks of exposed, clean surfaces that are consistent with deposits of water on Earth . The researchers explored the idea that heating may have been linked to periodic volcanism. Many of the geological features that suggest water flow date to around 3.7 billion years ago, a time when massive volcanoes are thought to have been active and huge lava outpourings occurred. However, on Earth widespread volcanism often leads to cooling rather than warming. Sulphuric acid particles and thick ash reflect the sun's rays, and that can lower temperatures. But the researchers thought the effects of sulphur on Mars's dusty atmosphere might have been different. To find out, they created a model of how sulphuric acid might react with the widespread dust in the Martian atmosphere. The work suggests that those sulphuric acid particles would have stuck onto dust particles, which would reduce their ability to reflect the sun's rays. Meanwhile sulphur dioxide gas would produce a modest greenhouse effect - just enough to warm the Martian equatorial region so that water could flow. Dr Head has been doing fieldwork for years in Antarctica and thinks the climate on early Mars may have been very similar to that of the cold, desert-like McMurdo Dry Valleys. Professor Head has been doing fieldwork for years in Antarctica and thinks the climate on early Mars may have been very similar to that of the cold, desert-like McMurdo Dry Valleys (pictured) in Antarctica . He said: 'The average yearly temperature in the Antarctic Dry Valleys is way below freezing, but peak summer daytime temperatures can exceed the melting point of water, forming transient streams, which then refreeze. 'In a similar manner, we find that volcanism can bring the temperature on early Mars above the melting point for decades to centuries, causing episodic periods of stream and lake formation.' But as that early active volcanism on Mars ceased, so did the possibility of warmer temperatures and flowing water. Dr Head said the research may offer new clues about where the fossilised remnants of life might be found on Mars, if it ever existed, and added: 'Life in Antarctica, in the form of algal mats, is very resistant to extremely cold and dry conditions and simply waits for the episodic infusion of water to ""bloom"" and develop. 'Thus, the ancient and currently dry and barren river and lake floors on Mars may harbour the remnants of similar primitive life, if it ever occurred on Mars.'","Scientists from Brown University and Israel's Weizmann Institute have claimed water on Mars could only survive briefly .
They claim it was only able to last for periods of tens or hundreds of years .
This was due to the temperature on Mars, which made water flow episodic .
Volcanoes spewed sulphur into the atmosphere and changed the climate .
When it warmed, it melted ices and snows, forming lakes and rivers .
But the climate would soon cool again, turning the liquid into ice .
This process may have occurred repeatedly in many episodes .
Evidence for water on Mars has been found in the form of dried up lakes, rivers and streams by the Curiosity rover .
But this is the first study to suggest water was episodic, not permanent ."
"Asprey worker Martin with the £80,000 bags . This may not be a question you've ever asked yourself, but how much would you be prepared to pay for a money safe shaped like a gorilla? A tenner? £100? What do you mean they'd have to pay you to take the monstrosity home? Would it make a difference to discover that the gorilla is solid silver, hand-crafted by some of the finest silversmiths in the land, and on sale in a shop that epitomises the 'If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it' ethos? The actor Samuel L Jackson fell in love with this, er, unusual piece on a trip to London. It isn't known if he paid the full price (celebrities often don't), but for a mere mortal to take it home would cost an eye-watering £55,000. The price of a solid silver gorilla safe is just one of the life lessons you learn from watching a jaw-dropping documentary that goes behind the scenes at Asprey, the jewellery and gift store to the rich and famous. Austerity Britain this is not. One customer, who comes in to buy handbags, expresses an interest in some rings as she's about to leave. A particularly sparkling little gem  is placed on her finger. The price?  £4.6 million. That she doesn't have a heart attack tells you everything you need to know about the clientele. A bona fide British institution, Asprey can trace its history back to 1781 and has been a presence on upmarket New Bond Street since 1847. It's held a Royal Warrant from every British monarch since Queen Victoria awarded it one in 1862, and everyone from Mae West to  the Beckhams has been a customer. And at one point the joke went that the Sultan of Brunei was the only customer, so lavish were his spending sprees there. The last time Paul McCartney popped in it was because he needed a couple of dozen wine glasses for a party. Not that 'need' is a word much associated with Asprey. Who 'needs' a solid silver cocktail shaker shaped like a rocket (£7,500), or a stag's head decanter – an Asprey bestseller at £2,500? 'It's not a case of  ""I need one."" It's a case of ""I want one,""' says one staff member. 'And what people are buying is exclusivity.' The staff are upfront about the fact that prices aren't emblazoned all over the shop. Mostly you need a magnifying glass to find one. One salesman talks about how you sell a champagne bath (it's a big bucket, basically). It seems you don't scream about how it costs £30,000, you point out how long it took to make, and how it is a unique piece. By the time the question of 'How much?' comes up, he says, the customer is likely to think, 'That's just the thing for my yacht.' In an age of mass-market consumerism, Asprey is something of a relic. It's still the place to go in certain circles for gifts though, and it's never too young to start. One can quite imagine Elton John and David Furnish practically moving in when they were doing up the nursery. A solid silver baby hairbrush will set you back £265 (although you'd probably want the matching comb – £185 – too, so as not to look like a cheapskate). An egg cup shaped like a rocking horse costs £495, while a little tube to hold a birth certificate is £675. Aspreys  £55,000 Silver Gorilla Safe purchased by Samuel L Jackson . The company made its name making intricate gilded travel cases for the discerning. The manufacturing process involved heating mercury to extreme temperatures – at which point it gives off deadly fumes. Dying on the job was an occupational hazard, and the average lifespan of the Asprey craftsmen, back in the day, was just 41. These days the craftsmen and women who toil in the workshops may have dwindled to just a handful (due to a lack of demand rather than mercury poisoning), but they're still responsible for making and mending some of the world's most iconic pieces, including the Crown Jewels. Watching them at work is awe-inspiring, and as a lament to the lost world of the British master craftsman this programme is as powerful as it gets. It can take months, even years, to craft some items, but in the modern world these are no longer skills that are valued. One silversmith is filmed cleaning the toilets. His services doing the job he trained for were no longer required. Another, Stuart Greig, is filmed nervously stepping onto the shopfloor in his overalls, to hand over a necklace that will retail at £133,000. 'I'm a scruffy urchin. I feel out of place,' he says. Alas for the purists the market for near-priceless trinkets has evolved and the customers targeted today are likely to be film stars and footballers with an eye for the eccentric. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie even designed a range of jewellery for them called The Protector in 2009. A bangle from Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's collection, £10,500 . The fact that cameras have been allowed in for the first time shows that things are changing. Once Asprey was a byword for discretion and quiet opulence. But the company has had its share of tribulations in recent years. Its own financial history is chequered; the firm posted losses of  £10 million in the mid-90s. The latest financial figures are healthier following a £50 million refurbishment by Lord Foster and a surge in demand from Middle Eastern customers. The programme doesn't flinch from showing the challenges of keeping a company like Asprey afloat. An extraordinary project – the sale of 41 bespoke handbags – is launched while the cameras are there. These are off-the-scale high-end bags, some made from crocodile skin with 18-carat gold fittings and encrusted with diamonds. The most expensive is £80,000. Special events are arranged to try to flog these handbags. High teas are laid on, but the sandwiches and macaroons remain uneaten. Treasured clients are invited but fail to turn up. Celebrity events are held. After one month, only a couple of the bags have sold. Alex, the salesman charged with shifting them, starts to sweat. He works on commission, has a small child at home, and is now worried about having one of his 'bread and water months'. We cheer for him when a Saudi Princess swoops in at the last minute and buys a dozen. In some ways the programme lifts the lid on a preposterous world. There's a Texan tourist who's with a salt and pepper set shaped like The Owl And The Pussycat. Yes, yes, it looks as hideous as it sounds, but she absolutely won't hear of leaving without it. The price? £6,995. One Oriental gentleman is warmly greeted – hardly surprisingly, since we learn he comes three or four times a year. He's looking for a watch and when he's told the price of the one he likes is £85,000 he buys two. Will it make you wish your husband was the sort to pop into Asprey and ask them to help him choose your birthday gift? Yes and no. The gentleman who does this asks the saleswoman to model some earrings for him so he can choose. She duly obliges. It's not a service you get in Argos, granted, but some might find it a bit, well, weird that while the birthday girl's earrings may have cost £15,750, they've also been in someone else's ears.

"A jealous wife who tracked down and threatened to kill a topless model after growing tired of her husband ogling the 20-year-old in a newspaper has been fined £6,000. The unnamed 51-year-old, from St Gallen in Switzerland, launched a vicious campaign of hate against the model, identified only as 'Jil', who regularly appears semi-nude in popular tabloid Blick. A court heard how the woman became fed up with seeing her husband rush out and buy the paper  to look at bare-breasted girls each morning. Scroll down for video . Vicious: The unnamed 51-year-old, from St Gallen in Switzerland, launched a vicious campaign of hate against the model, known only as 'Jil' (pictured), who regularly appears semi-nude in popular tabloid Blick . Jealous: But her ire exploded when she found out her husband was among those who voted 20-year-old mother-of-one Jil (pictured) in as Blick's Girl of the Year in 2012 . But her ire exploded when she found out he was among those who voted mother-of-one Jil  in as Blick's Girl of the Year in 2012. A court heard how, at first, she focused her anger on the newspaper's editor, sending him increasingly vile hate-mail demanding Jil, among other models, be dropped. 'I don't want to see any more naked breasts in the paper,' she wrote. 'Otherwise you're going to find them with their throats cut on a rubbish dump somewhere.' She also wrote to various journalists on the newspaper as well as the publishing house itself expressing similar sentiments. Abuse: Shortly after Jil (pictured) was voted Blick's Girl of the Year, the woman wrote to her, calling her a 'dirty little whore'. She also wrote to Blick's editor threatening a 'bloodbath' in its offices (in background) But she reserved her most hate-filled vitriol for Jil. Shortly after Jil was voted girl of the year, the woman wrote to her, saying: 'Jil, do you know that you are a dirty little whore.' She soon wrote another: 'Just on the off chance that you decide to turn up topless in Blick again, we are going to kill you. We know who you are and what your daily routine is.' She even claimed she had hired a hitman to kill Jil. She also turned her attention on Swiss marketing firm XL-Media AG, which had advertised alongside the sex-shop chain Libosan in the daily Swiss newspaper. Terrifying: She also told Jil, 'Just on the off chance that you decide to turn up topless in Blick again, we are going to kill you. We know who you are and what your daily routine is' She told them to pull the adverts or face a 'bloodbath' in one of their branches. XL Company boss Thomas Scheurer said: 'One gets used to a bit of criticism but this letter was so hostile it was almost embarrassing.' It was only after an intensive police investigation and two years of hate mail that the woman was finally arrested and her motive revealed - jealousy at the fact her husband was looking at the partially-naked women in the newspaper. She pleaded guilty to charges of making threats, insults and falsifying documents as well as causing an accident with a car while drink driving on a mountain bike. She was ordered to pay a £6,000 fine or serve 120 days in prison. She can still appeal the verdict.","The 51-year-old, from St Gallen, grew jealous that husband was ogling 'Jil'

"More than 60 per cent of comments on Obamacare's Facebook page have come from fewer than 100 people, a report has revealed. The site has amassed 226,838 posts since September 2012 - a significant number that has boosted the page in search engines. But an investigation by the Washington Times has found 136,103 of those were left by a small collection of Facebook users - many of whom have at least three profiles. Paid commentators? An investigation has found 60 per cent of  comments left on the Obamacare Facebook page since September 2012 have been left by fewer than 100 people, many of whom have multiple profiles . The revelation came just hours before a poll found Obamacare to be more unpopular than ever, with just 37 per cent support - just as the state and federal health exchanges central to the health care reform law reopen for business. Organizing For Action, which runs the Facebook page and Obama's Twitter profile, refused to confirm or deny whether people were paid to comment on the site, the Times said. The most prolific commentator on the Obamacare Facebook site, California-based Cyndi Huynh, posted 59 times a day in 60 days. Her posts came only during working hours and never on weekends, the Times's data analytics team discovered. Huynh, who has campaigned for the California Democratic Party, told the Times she has a full-time job and does not get paid for her posts but operates under multiple aliases to maximize her influence on the site. On her LinkedIn page, Huynh describes herself as a Safety and Environmental Compliance Coordinator at production and management company Anonymous Content. Prolific: Cyndi Huynh once posted 59 times a day for 60 days during working hours and not on weekends . Alias: She admitted to operating under four profiles, including this one, to maximize her influence on the site . And another: This is the third of four profiles she used, but insists she does not get paid for the service . When MailOnline called the Los Angeles Anonymous Content office nobody could verify her claim to work there, and she did not appear on a list of employees. Obamacare invited Huynh to be a patient advocate but she declined, she told the paper, offering instead to voice her support online. Other commentators included Wanda Milner, from Canada, who has posted 4,695 times in the last two years. She told the paper she doesn't have any aliases, does not get paid to comment, and posts because she is passionate about the subject. A woman named Eileen A.

"Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player, has been named one of GQ's Men Of The Year as it emerges he could be recruited into the Arena Football League by Mötley Crüe front man Vince Neil. Sam, 24, made history this year when he was drafted into the NFL's St Louis Rams after publicly revealing he is gay. But he has yet to play a regular season game as he was dropped by the Rams in August, snapped up by the Dallas Cowboys days later, only to be dropped again in October, having never made it out of the practice squad. Man Of The Year: This is one of GQ's revered collectible covers naming Michael Sam as a man of the year . Different league? Michael Sam (left) is set to be offered a contract with the new Arena Football League team Las Vegas Outlaws by owner, Motley Crue front man Vince Neil (right) after being dropped twice this season . The move to Neil's newly-formed Las Vegas Outlaws would be widely recognized as a step down for the defensive end, who many analysts expected to be offered a contract in the Canadian Football League. Sam signed his historical contracts as the first 'out' player with the St Louis Rams in May, and then another with the Dallas Cowboys in September, despite a disappointing performance in the NFL Scouting Combine. His first signing prompted a letter from Barack Obama congratulating the NFL on 'taking an important step forward today in our Nation's journey' by drafting a gay player. However, his deal was terminated at the end of the preseason. Sam  then joined the Cowboys on September 3, and practiced for seven weeks before being dropped. He was never placed on the 53-man active roster. The latest potential lifeline for Sam, who has yet to play a regular season game, comes as Mötley Crüe's Neil builds the franchise's first ever squad for their debut season in 2015. Deemed to be too small to play defensive end in the NFL, the smaller scale of Arena Football could play to Sam's strengths. The singer told the Las Vegas Review Journal he plans to make the offer in the coming days. It is unclear whether Sam plans to accept the offer. Neil's venture was approved by the league on June 17 this year, and had his chosen name, the Outlaws, approved in August. The squad will play at the Thomas & Mack Center on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, campus. Neil follows Jon Bon Jovi, Tim McGraw, and KISS members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley into the indoor league. Dropped: Sam thanked Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his support when he was dropped  last month . Man Of The Year: Sam has been praised for being open about his sexuality in GQ's Men Of The Year list . Sam was today revealed as one of GQ's Men Of The Year and cover stars. He came out to his Missouri teammates before his senior season in August 2013, when he had 11 1/2 sacks. He told his father and the rest of the world three months before the May draft. When he was dropped by the Cowboys, Sam thanked the family of owner Jerry Jones on Twitter, along with 'friends, family, teammates, and fans for their support.' 'While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday,' Sam wrote. Lifeline: Sam, who came out before this season's draft, has yet to play a regular season game this year . The signing of Sam by the Cowboys brought an overflow crowd to coach Jason Garrett's daily news conference, and he was surrounded by about two dozen reporters in the only interview he conducted on the same day. But he mostly blended in after that, making occasional appearances in the locker room when it was open to the media and earning praise from Garrett and defensive coordinator and defensive line coach Rod Marinelli the few times they were asked about him. 'Comes to work every day and practices hard,' Garrett said. 'One of 10 practice roster guys that we have, so he's working on his skills, trying to develop, but also doing a lot of other things. Playing offense, defense, playing the kicking game. That's what a lot of those guys do.'","Michael Sam made history when he was drafted this year after coming out .

"The paralysed man in charge of assessing benefit claimants has said the UK expects too little of disabled people. Dr Stephen Duckworth, who broke his neck during a rugby accident 33 years ago, said society is letting down the disabled by not demanding a contribution from them. The 53-year-old now leads the team that  will assess those who apply for the personal  independence payments, which will replace the disability living allowance. Outspoken: Dr Stephen Duckworth says disabled people should be encouraged to do more for themselves . Dr Duckworth said: ‘We need to move to a culture where employers recognise employment is therapeutic as opposed to illness-creating. ‘It is far better to go back to work to get better than to wait to get better to get back to work. Use work as a therapeutic intervention.’ Dr Duckworth – who trained himself to breathe by using his diaphragm rather than his chest muscles – believes more than 20 per cent of  Britain’s five million disabled have wrongly become dependent on benefits. He said ‘at least a million, probably north of a million’ of those ‘deemed to be disabled... have got there through system failure and the way society is organised’. The father of four – who receives DLA himself and will be assessed for the new benefit – said that minor injuries had become ‘a very common avenue towards multiple benefit receipt’. Courage: Dr Duckworth was paralysed in a rugby accident but went on to forge a successful career . In an interview, he details a claimant’s possible path after an accident ‘that could have happened at work as a result of lifting a box of photocopy paper’. He says: ‘It gave you a bit of a limp; you get a no-win, no-fee solicitor, a claims farmer, coming up to you.’ As a result, he continues: ‘You get, say, £6,000 in damages from your employers, that builds your impairment, you’re off work for six months, then drop from full pay to half pay, then statutory sick pay.’ After which, Dr Duckworth says ‘you’re feeling the financial pinch’, and he envisages the claimant realising he can get an enhanced income from employment support allowance, and going on to claim it. The scenario, he says, is: ‘Do my work capability assessment, get signed off on to the employment and support allowance at £106, so have a bit to pay the loan sharks back, [but] I am depressed and my partner has left me... my life is falling apart.’ Dr Duckworth, who served on the board of the Olympic Delivery Authority for London 2012, was suicidal after being paralysed as a medical student, but he refused his parents’ offer to look after him. He said: ‘When I broke my neck, my mum and dad said, “Don’t worry, Stephen, we will build you a granny annexe”, and I screamed until I was blue in the face. ‘If they had built me one I would still be living there, they’d have wrapped me  in cotton wool and I’d never have got  back to London.’","Dr Stephen Duckworth was paralysed in a rugby accident aged 20 .

"The BBC has defended a controversial joke about Prince Harry which suggested the young royal had snorted cocaine.

"A rocky planet the same size as the Earth has been discovered orbiting a star like our sun. It is the first time a planet of this size has been detected in another solar system. Scientists have hailed the technical achievement of detecting . Earth sized ‘exoplanets’ - the technical term for planets outside the solar system - as it increases the chances of finding life-bearing worlds. Although the planet, Kepler-20f could have a thick water-vapour atmosphere, its surface is believed to be too hot for life. Kepler 20f has been hailed as a major discovery - it's the first earth-sized planet found orbiting a star like our own Sun . A second planet in the same system, Kepler-20e, is only slightly smaller than Earth and even hotter. Both worlds circle their parent star closely with 'years' that last just nine and sixteen days respectively. Dr Francois Fressin, one of the astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian . Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, US, said: ‘It is the first time . humanity has been able to discover an object similar to the Earth around . a star, so maybe we will be able to find others. ‘This could be an important milestone. I think 10 years or maybe even . 100 years from now people will look back and ask when was the first . Earth-sized planet found. It is very exciting.’ Nasa's Kepler space telescope is built specifically to look for worlds outside our solar system. It scans distant stars for 'distortions' that indicate a planet has passed in front of it, using an array of digital camera sensors . The parent star, Kepler-20, is not exactly a close neighbour, being 945 light years away. Neither lie within the ‘habitable zone’ where temperatures are just warm . enough to allow liquid surface water, increasing the prospects for . life. A number of extrasolar planets have already been identified with radiuses of 1.5 to twice that of the Earth. But Dr Fressin pointed out that even these have far more volume than the . Earth and it would be wrong to consider them truly ‘Earth-like’. Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f compared with Venus and the Earth. Scientists have found the two Earth-sized planets orbiting a distant star, an encouraging sign for prospects of finding life elsewhere . Nasa's Kepler telescope has found 28 confirmed extrasolar planets so far - but thousands of likely 'candidate' planets. The discovery of a planet so close to our earth in size is highly significant, says Nasa . Earlier this month the telescope discovered Kepler-22b, a planet 2.4 . times the size of the Earth situated in the middle of its habitable . zone. But scientists say that Kepler 22-b may not be suitable for life. ‘You could fit 13 Earths inside Kepler-22b,’ said Dr Fressin. ‘The most . likely thing is that it's simply a mini-Neptune, not suitable for life. Just because a planet lies within the habitable zone that doesn't mean . it is habitable.’ Like Kepler-22b, the two new planets were found by the American space agency Nasa's Kepler space telescope - which scans distant stars for the signs of 'transits', planets passing in front of them. The findings are reported today in an early online edition of the journal Nature. Both planets are part of a solar system family already known to contain three larger worlds. Kepler-20f has a radius just 1.03 times larger than Earth's, while Kepler-20e is 0.87 the size of the Earth. Discovery: An artist's impression of the planet Kepler-22b, the earlier 'find' by the Kepler telescope . The astronomers spent years making sure the signals they detected really were from planets. ‘We simulated all possible alternative configurations and tried to . quantify the probability that a false signal could occur,’ said Dr . Fressin. ‘We confirmed that the signals were coming from an Earth-size . planet. It couldn't be due to anything else.’ Both planets are believed to be rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate, and very hot. Kepler-20f is a baking 426C and Kepler-20e a scorching 726c. The solar system is not hugely like our own, though. In our solar system small, rocky worlds orbit close to the Sun and large, gas giant worlds orbit farther out. In contrast, the planets of Kepler-20 are organized in alternating size: big, little, big, little, big. 'We were surprised to find this system of flip-flopping planets,' said co-author David Charbonneau of the CfA. The planets of Kepler-20 could not have formed in their current locations. Instead, they must have formed farther from their star and then migrated inward, probably through interactions with the disk of material from which all the planets orbiting the star formed from. Kepler identifies 'objects of interest' by looking for stars that dim slightly, which can occur when a planet crosses the star's face. To confirm a transiting planet, astronomers look for the star to wobble as it is gravitationally tugged by its orbiting companion. Kepler has found 28 confirmed planets so far.","'This find will be remembered in 100 years time' - scientists .

"Professor Simon Rule, pictured, said the drug could 'completely change the way' cancer is treated in the UK . A new ‘miracle’ pill which could extend the lives of terminally-ill cancer patients and eliminate their symptoms overnight is being trialled by British researchers. The medicine, which is said to have virtually no side effects, is taken in a single dose every morning and effectively switches off the mechanisms of leukaemia and lymphoma. Unlike traditional forms of treatment like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it has none of the debilitating side effects such as hair loss, tiredness and sickness. Cancer patients at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, were the first in the world to trial the new drug, which is a new class of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibiting drugs. They said the breakthrough treatment left them feeling better immediately and has had no side effects to date. One terminally ill man given just months to live before the trials says he's ‘fighting fit’ - more than a year-and-a-half later. The world-first project is being led by Professor Simon Rule, a globally-renowned expert in haematology and researcher at Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry. He says the new pill has the potential to transform the lives of desperately ill patients and eliminate the need for costly, gruelling bouts of chemotherapy. Professor Simon Rule, right, is leading the trials of the new drug at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon. Terminally-ill patient David Hodge, 74, left, is testing the oral pill and says he is 'fighting fit' a year after he was told he only had months to live . Professor Rule said: ‘The astonishing thing about these drugs is that they have virtually no side effects, which is unprecedented from my experience. In some patients the effects are immediate. The Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) pill is built around a protein which plays a role in the signals that cause growth in cancerous cells. The pill blocks this protein causing the cancerous cells to die but leaves normal cells unaffected. It is taken orally in a single dose every morning and effectively switches off the mechanisms of leukaemia and lymphoma. It stops patients feeling all symptoms of the disease and has the ability to make cancer-sufferers feel better ‘the next day’. Terminally-ill patients who are currently trialling the drug have so far not reported any side effects, unlike other cancer treatments such as chemotherapy. It is likely to be several years before the drug can be made available to the public but Professor Rule says it has the potential to replace chemotherapy. It can improve life expectancy of those who are terminally-ill and improve quality of life. ‘Patients with lots of symptoms, particularly those with lymphoma, will feel better the next day after taking the medication.’ Current cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, intensive chemo-immunotherapy, or stem cell transplants are effective but patients frequently relapse and eventually run out of further options. The new oral pill works by blocking a protein which causes growth in cancerous cells which in turn caused the infected cells to die and leaves healthy cells unaffected. The drug was first trialled on David Hodge, 74, from Plymouth, Devon, who has battled chronic lymphocytic leukaemia for 17 years. Mr Hodge was given months to live because his immune system was so badly damaged and had become resistant to all other treatments. He spent the first night of the trial in hospital before returning for regular check-ups over the subsequent 20 months. He said: ‘I think with any new trial or drug, or with chemotherapy there's a little bit of trepidation but I'm a Christian and I prayed about this and I got great peace about it. ‘Even if it proves at this moment to be of little use to me, I trust that with fine tuning it will prove to be significant to those taking the drug later on. ‘It's just like, well it's better than taking paracetamol. I take the medication first thing in the morning at 6 o'clock and then go back to bed for an hour. ‘Afterwards I get up and get on with my day; I'm fighting fit. I've had no problems, no side effects, nothing.’ The next phase of Professor Rule's study will see BTK trialled against standard chemotherapy to see if it can become a viable long-term replacement. He said: ‘This will completely change the way we manage these diseases. We have access to the next generation of the drug to be part of the next trial phases. Patient David Hodge, 74, pictured, is the first person in the world to be treated with the new medication which is said to have virtually no side effects . Mr Hodge, who is trialling the drug, said: 'I take the medication first thing in the morning at 6 o'clock and then go back to bed for an hour. Afterwards I get up and get on with my day; I'm fighting fit. I've had no problems, no side effects, nothing' ‘This is not a cure for cancer but it will mean we are significantly improving our patients' life expectancy and quality of life; similar to managing a chronic condition. ‘I have yet to come across another class of drugs in my career that has been so successful for leukaemia or lymphoma. ‘I have done a lot of drug trials in my career, this drug and its predecessor, which I was fortunate to be the first person in Europe to use - they are transformational as far as I am concerned. Prior to starting the new drug, Mr Hodge, from Plymouth, battled chronic lymphocytic leukaemia for 17 years and was given months to live because his immune system was so badly damaged and had become resistant to all other treatments . Professor Rule, pictured, will now trial the new drug against standard chemotherapy to see if it can become a viable long-term replacement. He said: 'This will completely change the way we manage these diseases' ‘Normally, what you expect with trials like this is that you treat a patient for a period of time and often what happens is the drug doesn't work. ‘The side effects make you stop the trial or the disease doesn't respond for very long. What is very exciting about this drug is the effects are continuing and there are no emerging side effects. ‘The next stage will be chemo-free treatment. We've been talking about it for years and now it might be a reality. ‘This has the very real prospect of changing the management of these difficult forms of cancer.'","The pill is taken daily and blocks protein which causes cancerous cells .

"Men who drink at least two cups of tea a day could slash their risk of prostate cancer by more than a third, according to new research. Regular tea drinkers were 37 per cent less likely to develop a tumour than those who drank it less than once a week. But there was no benefit from coffee, according to scientists at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, where the latest study was carried out. Regular tea drinkers were 37 per cent less likely to develop a tumour than those who drank it less than once a week . Nearly 40,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK and 10,000 men die from it - the equivalent of more than one an hour. The risks increase with age, with men over 50 more likely to develop a tumour, and there is a strong genetic element to it. As with some other types of cancer, diet is thought to be a key factor in the development of the disease. But there has been conflicting evidence on the role of popular beverages. Last year, for example, a study at Glasgow University found heavy tea drinkers were more at risk of the disease. The study showed that drinking coffee had no benefits in preventing prostate cancer . It tracked the health of more than 6,000 male volunteers over a period of 37 years and found those consuming over seven cups a day had a 50 per cent higher risk of prostate cancer than moderate and non tea drinkers. But the researchers stressed they could not be sure if tea really was a risk factor, or if drinkers lived to ages where cancer was more common. In the latest study, the Maastricht University team compared 892 men diagnosed with prostate cancer with a similar number who were in good health, studying their dietary and drinking habits. The study was carried out on a population of men in the US, where coffee is much more popular. Only one in five volunteers drank at least one tea a day, compared with nearly 60 per cent when it came to coffee. But the results, published in the journal Cancer Causes Control, showed two or more teas a day appeared to have a powerful anti-cancer effect, while coffee had none. The study did not examine how tea might help to prevent prostate tumours but previous investigations have found it contains disease-fighting chemicals, called polyphenols, that may protect vital tissues and organs against an invasion of cancerous cells. A 2010 study discovered women drinking just one cup of tea a day were ten per cent less likely to suffer ovarian cancer. In a report on the latest findings researchers said: 'This is further evidence that tea consumption may be a modifiable exposure that reduces the risk of prostate cancer.'","Regular tea drinks 37 per cent less likely to develop a tumour .

"Birmingham council could rename the city's airport in honour of local lad and heavy metal star Ozzy Osborne . Birmingham Airport could undergo a heavy metal-style makeover as plans have been aired to rename it after Ozzy Osborne. The city is considering following in the footsteps of others such as Liverpool and New York and renaming their airport in honour of the Black Sabbath frontman. Jim Simpson, who discovered the band, said there would be no better Brummie to inspire visitors than Osborne. 'I believe it would be a masterstroke that would instantly confound the cynics. 'How does the Ozzy Osborne International Airport resonate? The message says, 'Hey world, we are proud of our own'.

"New data suggests that only women can reap the benefits of a fruit and veg rich diet . Eating fruit and vegetables could stop you having a heart attack - but only if you are a woman. Young females who eat a healthy diet are less likely to develop clogged arteries from a build up of plaque, which can lead to heart attacks or stroke, compared with those who eat a less balanced diet. However the same benefit does not apply to men - and scientists don't know why, saying the phenomenon 'warrants further . investigation'. The study, comprised of more than 2,500 people in the U.S, reinforces the importance of developing healthy eating habits early in life. Previous research was able to find that middle aged adults who eat a lot of fruit and vegetables are less likely to have heart attacks or strokes, but the effect on young adults is less clear. Women in their 20s who said they ate between eight and nine servings of fruit and vegetables a day as part of a 2,000 calorie diet were 40 per cent less likely to develop a build up in their arteries called 'plaque', or coronary artery calcification. This was when compared with those in their 40s who ate only three or four servings a day, whose chance of developing the build up was much higher. This trend carried on even after other lifestyle behaviours like smoking, exercise and sugary drink consumption were accounted for. The study also took into consideration current eating habits, further demonstrating how dietary patterns affect younger people as well. Dr Michael Miedema, of the Minneapolis Heart Institute, said: 'Several other studies have also suggested a diet high in fruits and . vegetables is less protective in men, but we do not have a good . biological reason for this lack of association. 'It is an important question because lifestyle behaviours, such as a . heart healthy diet, are the foundation of cardiovascular prevention and . we need to know what dietary components are most important.' A healthy diet from an early age can help stop development of calcification of the arteries (pictured) which can lead to blockages and heart attacks .","Young women who eat fruit are less likely to have clogged arteries .

"Glugging milk from a bottle, Amara Chiedozie looks like any other contented three-week-old. Except, that is, for the fact she is already capable of holding the container on her own. Even more incredibly, her mother claims she has been doing it since she was three days old. The strength of her grip at such a tender age has amazed her family and medics. Scroll down for video . Amara Chiedozie strated feeding herself at just three days old . Her mother Onyi Chiedozie, 20, said: ‘When we were feeding, she started shaking, then she just grabbed the bottle. She was holding it by herself. ‘We couldn’t believe it because babies don’t normally do it that young. I’m so shocked that I have been documenting it every day. It’s unbelievable. ‘When she doesn’t want it she will push it away. She isn’t strong enough to throw it away, but she does push it, like she does with her dummy. If she is really hungry, she starts shaking. Then she will just grab the bottle as you give it to her.’ Miss Chiedozie, a single mother from Chadwell Heath in Essex, makes sure she is always watching her daughter when she is feeding herself. She said: ‘Sometimes I hold her or sometimes you can prop her up with a pillow and give her the bottle. I’m always watching her – I don’t let her out of my sight.’ Amara weighed 6lbs 3oz when she was born on August 3 at Queen’s Hospital in Romford. Miss Chiedozie said her progress had astounded medical professionals. The student added: ‘Even nurses are really surprised. When my health support nurse came, she was shocked as well. She couldn’t believe that this could happen. ‘Whenever we go to appointments, we take pictures of her doing it. The midwife and even the doctor we had an appointment with on Saturday were actually amazed. They couldn’t believe it. Onyi Chiedozie couldn't believe it when her daughter grabbed the bottle during a feed . Miss Chiedozie also breastfeeds Amara regularly. She said: ‘The breastfeeding is better now – it’s comfortable. It used to be painful and sore before but it’s good now. ‘When she breastfeeds she is touching and holding on to me. It’s a really nice experience and way to bond.’ Babies are usually able to hold a bottle unaided from around six months. Parents’ charity NCT warns on its website against letting them feed themselves. It advises: ‘If you give your baby a bottle, always hold the bottle and your baby whilst feeding. It’s not safe to leave babies to feed themselves or to prop up a bottle; if they choke they won’t be able to push the bottle away.’ The charity also warns that babies can choke on something as small as a grape and should not be left alone while feeding or eating.

"Until very recently, TV chef Lorraine Pascale refused to delve too deeply into her complicated past. When you look at the bare facts of her early life – given up by her birth mother as a baby, fostered, then adopted, then ricocheted back into the foster system, all by the time she was eight – you can understand why. Since she burst into public consciousness, first as a model then as a potential successor to Nigella, Lorraine (herself the mother of a 17-year-old daughter) has answered questions about her childhood honestly but with a degree of vagueness. She admits she didn't know half the story herself. There was, she says, an unwillingness to 'take a brick out, in case the whole wall falls down'. Scroll down for video . In a new TV documentary about fostering, Lorraine uncovers the dark secrets of her past . Now, as part of a BBC programme Lorraine has made about fostering, she got access to her own fostering and adoption records for the first time and from there she set about tracking down the people responsible for bringing her up. It's an astonishing programme, but a harrowing one for the viewer, never mind for Lorraine. 'I thought I knew my own story,' she admits. 'But I underestimated how difficult it would be.' What she uncovers is the stuff of nightmares. The biggest question had always been why her adoptive parents, Audrey and Roger Woodward, had actually allowed her to go back into foster care. Lorraine discovers, via social workers' records, it was because when the Woodwards' marriage broke up (Lorraine was three at the time), Audrey began drinking heavily. Lorraine became the subject of her rages – to the point where she was placed on the at-risk register. In the programme Lorraine, 41, reads reports of how her mother had physically attacked her and even fantasised about throwing Lorraine under a lorry. The first reports are dated 1976. By 1981 her records state, 'The mother was in an agitated state and demanded we take her daughter into care as she could not stand her any longer. She said she dreaded the school holidays and was sure she would do Lorraine some damage. Lorraine holds a photograph of herself as an 18-month old . 'She said she had already tried to strangle her and suffocate her, and had hit her before she went to school this morning. She said the only way she could keep from hitting Lorraine was to keep her locked in her bedroom.' While Lorraine remembers things being very wrong at home, she did not have any inkling of this. 'I always got the feeling I didn't belong, that I was in the wrong place, tip-toeing around, trying to be as quiet as I could be, not feeling good enough,' is how she puts it. 'But that was devastating to read.' For most of the programme she's remarkably composed, but here she cracks and has to leave the room. Later, she explains, 'I was reading it as if it was someone else. I don't want to sound ""Poor me"", but it's not nice.' Audrey Woodward, Lorraine's adoptive mother admitted trying to strangle and suffocate Lorraine . Lorraine's story starts in November 1972 when she was born in The Mothers' Hospital in Hackney, London. There had never been any question of her birth mother – who was unmarried – keeping her. It was a place, she explains, for 'destitute mothers, which she thought she was'. As soon as she was born she was placed into the care of a couple called Marian and John – their first foster child. She only tracked them down after a radio appeal asking listeners if they remembered a white couple in Leytonstone caring for a black baby. Lorraine lived with them happily for 18 months, along with another little girl. She was, she learns from Marian, 'a chunky little child' but an adorable one. There was talk, she learns, of the home becoming a permanent one. 'I wanted to adopt you,' says Marian, starting to cry. 'But we had only signed up to be temporary foster carers. And by then I was pregnant myself.' Marian and John met Audrey and Roger, the then prospective adoptive parents. 'They were smitten with you,' says Marian. 'And they were middle class. We were working class. We thought you'd get a good education with them. But handing you over was the most difficult thing I've had to do.' Lorrine was adopted as a baby and later went into foster care . By rights, the rest of her life should have been more settled. In reality, it was anything but. Her relationship with her adoptive parents at their Oxfordshire home has always sounded warm and supportive (they have featured in her cookery programmes), but the reality was much more complex. Audrey now has dementia so is not a part of the programme, but Roger is. Lorraine confronts him, gently, about his memories of what happened. After he and Audrey split he lived apart from the family – in a boat, it seems – and has scant knowledge of what his daughter was going through. 'I wasn't aware what was going on,' he says. Even when the idea of Lorraine going back into care was raised by the social workers? 'I was the obvious alternative, but I was living in a one-berth boat.' He wonders if he could have done more. His daughter doesn't reply. Lorraine retraces some of her old, temporary homes, and has to steel herself for a meeting with Stella and Warren Eccles and their daughter Ruth – 'the only foster carers I was anxious about'. Lorraine had lived with them for six months, and not happily. Former missionaries, it is suggested that they were paired with Lorraine simply because they had some experience of black people. Lorraine was, by then, an angry child – resentful of having to go to church, and desperate to go home to her mother Audrey. They recall happy times, she less so. 'They're friendly people,' she says. 'They had a home and I needed a home. What was the problem? It would probably be different now because there's all sorts of training.' Outwardly, Lorraine triumphed. After her spell in emergency foster care she went back to her mother, although the subsequent years were not easy. She's said in the past that her difficult upbringing made her determined and self-sufficient. But she does open up here about the difficult years in between. Speaking to one troubled teen she says she recognises the mix of 'toughness and vulnerability' youngsters in care show, saying she got involved with a gang who were drinking and stealing. 'I was on the fringes of that,' she says. 'I could have gone down a dark route.' That she didn't seems all the more remarkable as the credits roll on her extraordinary story, which she sums up as 'enlightening and daunting and sad'. There are no regrets, however, that she went looking for the truth. 'I'm lucky to have such a history written in black and white,' she says, in reference to her social work records. It's a sober reminder of how even difficult answers about who you are can be better than none at all.

"Claim: Met Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates was 'extremely brief' in dealing with black, gay officer Kevin Maxwell, it was alleged . A senior Metropolitan Police officer forced to resign in the wake of the phone hacking scandal was racist and homophobic, an employment tribunal heard today. Assistant Commissioner John Yates, due to formally step down in November, was allegedly 'extremely brief' when dealing with the case of a black, gay officer who was off sick with depression. Detective Constable Kevin Maxwell, who is suing the force based on claims he was bullied due to his race and sexuality, wanted discretion to keep his £40,000-a-year salary longer than the normal six month period. However, Mr Yates refused to grant him the special treatment, usually reserved for hero officers injured in the line of duty, traumatised child abuse investigators and the terminally ill. Kweku Aggrey-Orleans, representing Detective Constable Maxwell, told Mr Yates: 'I suggest that you dealt with Mr Maxwell's application for an extension of pay extremely briefly and without properly considering it because you knew that he had raised allegations of racism and homophobia.' Mr Yates replied: 'No that's complete nonsense. I gave very careful consideration to this. 'I was very concerned about Kevin, very concerned about his well being.'Mr Aggery continued: 'And also that you dealt with the appeal extremely briefly because Kevin was black and gay.' Mr Yates replied: 'That doesn't merit an answer but it's absolute nonsense.' The former counter terrorism chief resigned in a media storm after being told he would be suspended while under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), including over his links with Neil Wallis, a former senior executive at the News of the World. The tribunal heard how Mr Wallis was a press advisor to Mr Yates' office at the time of his decision not to extend Detective Constable Maxwell's pay. 'Bullied': Detective Constable Kevin Maxwell claims he witnessed racism from colleagues while on duty . The detective constable's partner, Alex Parr, previously claimed a 'senior policeman' leaked details of the law suit to the Sun, owned by the same company, News International, as the now closed News of the World. However, Mr Yates was not accused of being the source of the leak during the tribunal hearing. Detective Constable Maxwell claims he was bullied by colleagues at Heathrow Airport and witnessed racism while on duty. He claims a colleague refused to eat a curry on a trip to a mosque aimed at building community relations because 'they would have spat in it', and said fellow officers did not like being lectured to by imams. However, Mr Yates said it was not his responsibility to deal with issues related to Detective Constable Maxwell's claims he was off sick because he was discriminated against at work. Mr Yates said in written evidence to the tribunal: 'I did not reject Detective Constable Maxwell's appeal on the ground of his race or his sexual orientation. 'I rejected his appeal because his case did not meet the criteria. 'I have declined to extend the full pay of other officers who did not meet the criteria.' The tribunal heard how Detective Constable Maxwell was offered any job he liked as senior Metropolitan Police officers were left 'bending over backwards' trying to get him back to work. He was told he could move to a different part of London where he would never see the officers who he worked with at Heathrow Airport again. However, he turned down the offer and the tribunal heard how he wanted the Met. to address his concerns about racism and homophobia, rather than simply moving him elsewhere. Detective Inspector Ajoy Gosain, his welfare officer, said: 'When I met Det. Chief Insp. D'Orsi we discussed the issue of identifying a suitable post for Detective Constable Maxwell to return to. 'Detective Chief Inspector D'Orsi asked me to establish with Detective Constable Maxwell what role he would like to return to. 'He said that he would like to accommodate anything that Detective Constable Maxwell wanted to do. Detective Constable Maxwell said he was bullied by colleagues at Heathrow Airport due to his race and sexuality . 'I thought that Detective Chief Inspector D'Orsi was taking a genuine and generous approach towards Kevin Maxwell in that regard. I felt he was bending over backwards to try to assist Detective Constable Maxwell in getting back to work. 'In that he had such an open ended offer, Detective Constable Maxwell was in a favourable position.' Detective Inspector Gosain, a former president of the Kent Black Police Association, described how he met the officer in June 2010 to try and convince him to return to work. 'The following day Detective Constable Maxwell emailed me to say that he didn't feel he could return and to ask me not to raise the issue of returning again. 'I was deeply disappointed with Detective Constable Maxwell's reaction. 'I had genuinely tried to help get him back to work in any way possible and I was disappointed that he seemed to totally dismiss what I had been saying.' He was forced to resign earlier this year over his links to the News of the World having been responsible for the investigation into phone hacking by the newspaper. When Jean Charles de Menezes was shot by police at Stockwell Tube station following the 7/7 bombings in 2005 he led the Met's response to the tragedy. He also ran the investigation into the 'cash for honours' scandal in 2006, which revolved around allegations peerages had been handed out in return for loans to the Labour and Tory parties. Detective Constable Maxwell, of Wilmington Square, London, is facing dismissal from the force under the Unsatisfactory Performance Procedure after being off sick since July 2009. He said he developed depression after being bullied at work due to his race and sexual orientation. He had worked his way up to Detective Constable after first joining the Greater Manchester Police in 2001. He transferred to the Met Police in October 2008. The tribunal continues.

"Court case: Businessman Innocente Marcolini developed a brain tumour after 12 years of using a mobile phone six hours a day . A court has ruled that mobile phones can give you cancer in a landmark case that could open the gates for other victims to take legal action. Businessman Innocente Marcolini, 60, was diagnosed with a brain tumour after using his mobile phone at work for up to six hours a day for 12 years. Italy's Supreme Court found that there was a 'causal link' between his phone use and his illness. Experts now predict a barrage of legal claims by victims who believe their own illness was caused by their use of mobile phones. Mr Marcolini told The Sun newspaper: 'This is significant for very many people. I wanted this problem to become public because many people still do not know the risks. 'I was on the phone, usually the mobile, for at least five or six hours every day at work. I wanted it recognised that there was a link between my illness and the use of mobile and cordless phones. 'Parents need to know their children are at risk of this illness.' Oncologist and professor of environmental mutagenesis Angelo Gino Levis and neurosurgeon Dr Giuseppe Grasso gave evidence supporting Mr Marcolini's claim. They argued that mobile and cordless phones emit electromagnetic radiation causing damage to cells and increasing the risk of tumours. But they added that many tumours don't appear for 15 years making short-term studies on mobile phone use redundant. The jury is still out, however, for many scientists who claim it is still unknown what, if any, link there is between mobiles and brain tumours. Landmark ruling: Italy's Supreme Court in Rome found there was a 'causal link' between Mr Marcolini's phone use and his brain tumour - opening the doors for other legal claims . Earlier on this month, a Danish study on more than 358,000 mobile users over 18-years-old found that those who used mobile phones for 10 years or more were no more at risk than those who never used them. Researchers led by the Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen found cancer rates in the central nervous system were almost the same in both long-term mobile phone users and non-users. But other scientists disagreed, saying the Danish study excluded business users and included as non-users people who began using mobiles later on. The big debate: The jury is still out for many scientists who argue there is no evidence to support a link between cancer and mobile phone use . Denis Henshaw, Emeritus Professor of Human Radiation Effects, Bristol University said the study was 'worthless', and the researchers themselves admitted non-users may have been misclassified which would bias the findings. He said: 'This seriously flawed study misleads the public and decision makers about the safety of mobile phone use.' Professor Henshaw has previously advocated cigarette-style warnings on mobile phone packets and urges more independent research. He . said: 'Vast numbers of people are using mobile phones and they could be . a time bomb of health problems - not just brain tumours, but also . fertility, which would be a serious public health issue. 'The . health effects of smoking alcohol and air pollution are well known and . well talked about, and it's entirely reasonable we should be openly . discussing the evidence for this, but it is not happening. 'We want to close the door before the horse has bolted.' The . International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rang alarm bells . last year when it classified mobile phones as 'possibly carginogenic'. In . April, The Children with Cancer conference highlighted figures . published by the Office of National Statistics, which showed a 50 per . cent increase in frontal and temporal lobe tumours between 1999 and . 2009. The ONS figures . showed that the incident rate has risen from two to three per 100,000 . people since 1999, while figures from Bordeaux Segalen University showed . a one to two per cent annual increase in brain cancers in children.

"Professor Byron, pictured, expressed her concerns about 'moral panic' surrounding young people and the web at a teacher conference in Birmingham . 'Moral panic' about the internet among middle class parents is stunting children's development, a leading psychologist has warned. Professor Tanya Byron believes that unless parents let their children explore and make mistakes - both in the real-world and online - they will never become 'digitally responsible'. However, she added that managing these risks, and guiding children through them, is ultimately the responsibility of the adults in their lives, both at home and school. Speaking at a teacher conference in Birmingham, Professor Byron expressed concerns about the ‘moral panic’ that surrounds young people and the web. She said: ‘The moral panic is unhelpful. Awareness without life experience can sometimes be challenging – so it’s our responsibility to bridge that gap.’ ‘We need to accept that kids are going to take risks online so that we can guide them, just as our parents did when we were allowed to ride our bikes.’ Two-thirds of parents in a recent Co-operative Childcare survey said their children spent significantly less time outside than the parents did. Eight in ten said their own favourite activities as children involved being outdoors, but only half their children lead the same active life. British adults said they loved playing ball games, skipping and other traditional outdoor activities. But their children prefer to get their kicks from a screen, by playing computer games, surfing the internet or watching TV. Children can't become digitally responsible citizens unless they're allowed to take risks online. Stock image pictured.

"To the naked eye, a chicken nugget may seem like a relatively healthy and wholesome treat, but under the glare of a microscope the offal truth is revealed. Dr Richard D. deShazo, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at University of Mississippi Medical Center, said that he was 'floored' and 'astounded' when he took a closer look at the make-up of the ubiquitous all-American meal. When Dr deShazo and pathologist Steven Bigler sliced into a pair of randomly selected nuggets - bought from two different fast-foot chains - they discovered a jumble of blood vessels, fat, cartilage, but not a whole lot of actual chicken meat. The offal truth: When researchers placed a pair of chicken nuggets from two fast-food chains under the microscope, they discovered a concoction of blood vessels, fat, intestinal tissue, but little actual meat . What's in a nugget? Researchers in Mississippi examined two fast-food chains' chicken nuggets and found that half or less than half of the nuggets were made of meat. The rest was made of high-fat chicken parts . A study of the chicken from the first restaurant revealed . that it was 50 per cent muscle. The other half of the nugget was made up . of fat, blood vessels, nerve and epithelium tissue from birds’ cavities. The nutritional breakdown was 56 per cent fat, 25 per cent carbs and 19 per cent protein, according to The Atlantic. The . nugget from the second restaurant was 40 per cent skeletal muscle, a . mix of fat and connective and organ tissue, as well as bone debris. Dr DeShazo . compared nuggets served in some national franchises to ‘super glue’, . comprised of bits of poultry leftovers mashed up with fatty ‘goo’ and . fried in salty batter. The . scientist insisted that calling the product 'chicken nuggets' is . misleading, because they are mostly fat tissue rather than actual poultry . meat. 'What has happened is that some . companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts . rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and . still call it chicken,' Dr deShazo said. 'It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and . fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and . kids love it and it is marketed to them.' The National Chicken . Council, a non-profit group that represents America's poultry . producers, has dismissed Dr deShazo's finding, arguing that nuggets are 'an . excellent source of protein' - especially for children who tend to be . finicky eaters. But according to Dr deShazo and healthy-eating advocate and renowned chef Jamie Oliver, that is part of the problem. According . to Oliver, America’s kids have been 'brainwashed' to such a degree that . even if they know that nuggets are mostly made of goo and bone bits, . they would still happily eat them. The . problem is especially acute in Dr deShazo's home state of Mississippi, . which has the highest rate of childhood obesity in the country. Don't make it a habit: Dr deShazo, the lead researcher of the study, said it's OK to eat chicken nuggets every once in a while but he's concerned for the people who eat them multiple times a week . By 2030, Mississippi is projected to have the highest obesity rate at 66.7 per cent. Ashley Peterson, a representative of the NCC, . pointed out that nutritional information for most fast food chains is . available online, and that anything for sale at the grocery store has a . list of ingredients. 'Chicken . nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded . and fried. But it's no secret what is in a chicken nugget,' she said. To . counter claims similar to the ones laid out in D deSahzo's study, KFC and . Chick-fil-A have been running ads touting their chicken nuggets as made . entirely of breast meat.","Researchers in Mississippi examined chicken nuggets at two different fast-food chains and found that only about half of the nuggets were made of muscle meat .

"An accountant at a chain of academies championed by Michael Gove is at the centre of a fraud investigation after £4million of school funds ended up in his personal accounts. Nigerian-born Samuel Kayode is said to have spent much of the cash on an extravagant lifestyle and buying a string of properties. The 57-year-old part-time pastor was told by the High Court to pay £4.1million back to the Haberdashers’ Aske’s chain of academies more than a year ago. Investigation: Nigerian-born accountant Samuel Kayode (right), 57, is at the centre of a fraud investigation after £4m of school funds ended up in his personal accounts. Left, his late wife, Grace, whose assets were frozen . He has failed to do so, and it is feared most of the cash has been transferred to Nigeria. The case, kept secret for almost two years, is believed to be Britain’s biggest ever education fraud. Although Kayode was arrested in October 2012, police have yet to charge him with any crime. Critics of academies – state schools which have control of their own finances – say the massive loss of cash calls that entire system into question. Questions were also asked about whether Mr Gove – who lost his job as Education Secretary last week – took close enough interest in the case. Academy: Kayode was an accountant at Haberdashers' Aske's chain of academies. He is said to have spent much of the cash on an extravagant lifestyle. Above, Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College in London . The vast sum of money is missing from the Haberdashers’ Aske’s Federation Trust in South London. It is named after 17th century silk merchant Robert Aske who left much of his wealth to create an educational charity fund run by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. The Haberdashers’ Aske’s public schools for boys and girls in Hertfordshire were founded with his money. Three Haberdashers’ Aske’s state secondaries in South-East London – Hatcham College, Knight’s Academy and Crayford Academy – are run by the trust as a separate charitable wing funded by Mr Aske’s endowment. They were often referred to by Mr Gove in speeches. Inquiry: Crayford Academy (pictured) is also run by the Haberdashers' Aske's Federation Trust in South London . Kayode went to work at Hatcham in 1997 and rose to become accounts manager for the whole chain. He was paid £57,000 a year, and told . colleagues of his work as a pastor in the Christ Apostolic Church, South . London, peppering his conversations with ‘praise the Lord’. In October 2012 it emerged that a large sum of money was missing from the academies’ funds. Kayode’s assets and those of his wife Grace, who died aged 53 last year, were then frozen. Former Education Secretary: The academies were championed by Michael Gove (pictured) It appeared that huge sums of school money had been paid into a bank account in Nigeria and a company called Samak, which is said to be run in Nigeria by Kayode’s second wife Yoni, although he denies any wedding has taken place. The trust launched a High Court case to reclaim the missing cash but the accountant denied wrongdoing and claimed ‘all transactions had been authorised by the finance director’. However, the judge found in the trust’s favour last July and ordered Kayode and the estate of his late wife to pay back more than £4million plus interest. He remains at large and is not facing any charges, although he is due to speak to detectives again this week. A Metropolitan Police spokesman would say only that a man from Lambeth was on police bail. Adrian Percival, chief executive of Haberdashers’ Aske’s Federation Trust, said: ‘The civil case found in favour of the federation and we are trying to recover the money that has been taken from us. We are obviously shocked and saddened.’ But furious parents say Haberdashers’ Aske’s has tried to hush the scandal up. Jill Rutter, who has several children at the Hatcham academy, said in an online blog: ‘The fraud strikes at the heart of the educational establishment and shows that the current system and the freedom afforded to academies is not working. Ultimately it is our children that suffer.’ Kayode’s boss at Haberdashers’ Aske’s, former chief finance officer Paul Durgan, is now working for a new academies chain. He said: ‘Sam Kayode completely had me taken, like everybody else. Nobody from the police or school has spoken to me.’","Samuel Kayode, 57, was an accountant at Haberdashers' Aske's academies .

"An apple a day could stop you having a heart attack – and may even be as effective as taking a statin. Healthy over-50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a tablet, Oxford University researchers claim. Their study goes some way to proving the proverb coined by the Victorians: ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ Oxford University researchers claim healthy over-50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a statin . The scientists’ calculations suggest that prescribing an apple a day to everyone aged 50 and over would prevent or delay around 8,500 heart attacks and strokes a year in the UK. The health benefits are similar to giving statins to everyone over 50 who is not already taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Dr Adam Briggs, of the British Heart Foundation Health Promotion Research Group at Oxford University, said: ‘The Victorians had it about right when they came up with: “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” It just shows how effective small changes in diet can be, and that both drugs and healthier living can make a real difference in preventing heart disease and stroke.’ Researchers said people should not replace prescribed statins with apples but could benefit by eating more fruit . He added: ‘While no one currently . prescribed statins should replace them with apples, we could all benefit . from simply eating more fruit.’ In the study, published in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal, researchers used mathematical models to assess the impact of prescribing a daily apple for all older adults. They assumed almost three-quarters would eat their apple a day and that overall calorie intake stayed constant. They estimate 5.2million people are now eligible for statins in the UK, and if it became policy to prescribe statins to all over-50s as some doctors want, a further 17.6million would be offered them. But this would also lead to a spate of side effects, including 1,000 extra cases of muscle disease, and more than 10,000 extra diagnoses of diabetes. The researchers calculate that offering a daily statin to 17.6million more adults would reduce annual vascular deaths by 9,400. However, offering a daily apple to 70 per cent of Britons aged over 50 – 22million people – would avert 8,500 vascular deaths. The scientists calculated that anyone eating one portion of fruit and vegetables, such as an apple, a day benefits from a 12 per cent reduction in their risk of heart attack and stroke. And this protection from one portion is roughly equivalent – in a person at low or moderate risk of heart problems – to the reduction in vascular death from taking a statin. The calculations suggest anyone already eating an apple a day would gain an additional 12 per cent protection from a second apple. The more portions of fruit and vegetables you eat, the greater protection against deaths from these causes. Latest official figures show only one in three achieve the target of five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Dr Peter Coleman of The Stroke Association said: ‘While it is vital those who have been prescribed the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins continue to take this highly effective medication, everyone can lower their risk of stroke with simple lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet.’","Oxford University researchers say healthy over-50s who added apple to diet benefitted as much as those who start taking a tablet .

"A seriously disabled man who has never been able to walk, talk or feed himself has had his benefits stopped and been told he must have a medical to decide if he is fit for work. Ryan Norman has needed round the clock care since he was a baby but now he has turned 20 his child benefit and tax benefits have automatically stopped. His mother, Ceneta, his sole carer, claims she is in serious financial difficulties after the benefits dried up on Ryan's birthday - September 1 - with a wait of several weeks before he is assessed for adult benefits. Constant struggle: Ryan Norman, 20, from Darlington, County Durham, needs round the clock care from his mother, Ceneta, but has had his benefits stopped as he has now turned 20 . Ms Norman, of Darlington, County Durham, described her son as a baby trapped in an adult's body and said she cannot understand why he must prove his disabilities for the adult benefits system when his condition is already well documented. The single mother said she will struggle to provide for Ryan and her two other children, Shane, 15, and Shanice, nine, without money for Ryan's care. Ms Norman, 49, said: 'Everything seems to be such a struggle, the authorities don't seem to think of him as a person at all. 'There is no communication between the children's side and the adult side at all - they blame each other and I am passed from pillar to post. I don't know what I am going to do.' Child tax credits are assessed and paid by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and automatically stop when a child reaches 20 if they have been in full-time education. The adult benefits system is operated by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which introduced a Work Capabilities Assessment last year to determine whether disabled people could be considered fit for work. Disgusted: Mrs Norman says she will now struggle to meet the costs needed to look after her severely disabled son . Ryan was born a healthy baby but contracted meningitis at four months old, leaving him severely disabled. He attended a special school at Education Village, in Haughton, Darlington, but after turning 20 he is now classed as an adult. Ms Norman, 49, said: 'Ryan cannot walk or talk, I have to feed him, help him to drink, do everything for him. 'He will never work or do anything for himself. That did not change overnight when he turned 20. 'When he was in the hospital with meningitis the doctors did not expect him to pull through. They said he was a little miracle. 'I look after him, he's my pride and joy, but I must be saving the Government thousands of pounds by looking after him myself.' Ms Norman claims she had been given no indication that her payments for Ryan would stop so suddenly and only found out about the need for a medical after calling the benefits office when she noticed her payments had been reduced. She added: 'I can understand the need for his benefits to change but it is the gap between the child benefits ending and the adult ones starting. There's no co-ordination.' A spokeswoman for Darlington Borough Council said: 'The changes in benefit referred to are a result of Government policy. 'DWP are responsible for the assessment for these benefits not the council. However, the council is providing the family with advice regarding completion of the relevant forms and will continue to support the family throughout this matter.' A HMRC spokeswoman said customers in receipt of child benefit would be written to ahead of the child finishing education. She added: 'Once a child who has been in education or training turns 20 payments will stop automatically and with immediate effect.' A DWP spokesman said: 'Disabled adults often have different support needs to children, and this is reflected in the different benefits available to people when they reach adulthood. 'Employment and support allowance is a benefit for adults who are too ill or disabled to work. To apply for it, someone just needs to fill out a form and provide some medical evidence. 'If we are given all the information we need to enable us to make a decision, there is often no need for a face to face assessment.'","Ryan Norman, from Darlington, County Durham, needs constant care from mother Ceneta, 49 .

"Even a short term diet of junk food can have a detrimental effect on the brain's cognitive ability, scientists said . Everyone knows that junk food is bad for the waistline, but new research suggests it can damage memory, too. Australian researchers found that even a short term diet of junk food can have a detrimental effect on the brain’s cognitive ability. The study suggests that obesity can trigger rapid changes in the brain. Scientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) showed for the first time that rats fed a diet high in fat and sugar had impaired memory after just a week. Interestingly, the results were similarly poor for the rats fed a healthy diet that had been given sugar water to drink, according to the study, which was published in the journal Brain, Behaviour and Immunity. The animals found it more difficult to recognise specific places after their junk food diet and showed a lesser ability to notice when an object shifted to a new location. The mice also had inflammation of the hippocampal region of the brain, which is associated with spatial memory. ‘We know that obesity causes inflammation in the body, but we didn't realise until recently that it also causes changes in the brain,’ said Professor Margaret Morris from UNSW Medicine, who co-authored the study. ‘What is so surprising about this research is the speed with which the deterioration of the cognition occurred,’ she said. ‘Our preliminary data also suggests that the damage is not reversed when the rats are switched back to a healthy diet, which is very concerning.’ Some aspects of the animals' memories were spared, regardless of their diets. All the animals were equally able to . recognise objects after eating either the healthy, healthy with . sugar or ‘cafeteria’ diets, the latter of which was high in fat and . sugar, including cake, chips and biscuits. The change in the animals' memory appeared even before the mice eating junk food gained any weight. The research builds on previous work that has implications for obesity. 'Given that high energy foods can impair the function of the hippocampus, if you eat a lot of them it may contribute to weight gain, by interfering with your episodic memory,¿ Professor Morris said . Ongoing work will attempt to establish how to stop the inflammation in the brain of animals with the unhealthy diets, which could unlock secrets relating to humans who eat unhealthily. ‘We suspect that these findings may be relevant to people,’ said  Professor Morris. ‘While nutrition affects the brain at every age, it is critical as we get older and may be important in preventing cognitive decline. An elderly person with poor diet may be more likely to have problems.’ The research builds on previous work that has implications for obesity. ‘Given that high energy foods can impair the function of the hippocampus, if you eat a lot of them it may contribute to weight gain, by interfering with your episodic memory,’ Professor Morris said. ‘People might be less aware of their internal cues like hunger pangs and knowing when they have had enough,’ she said.","Australian researchers found that even a .

"Christopher Todd sent so-called 'revenge porn' to his ex-girlfriend's mother after the pair split up. He has now been given a suspended sentence . A young woman was left distraught after her ex-boyfriend sent naked 'revenge porn' pictures of her to her parents. Hannah Davison, 21, was mortified when Christopher Todd sent an intimate photo of her to her mother's phone after their break-up - in a message then opened by her father. Todd has now been given a suspended sentence for sending the offensive message, which claimed Ms Davison was spreading sexually transmitted diseases. Ms Davison, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, went out with Todd, 22, for more than a year before catching him in bed with another girl and ending the relationship. But jilted Todd then bombarded his former girlfriend with texts and calls every time he was drunk. She said: 'It went on for weeks, but I never expected that he would stoop so low as to involve my parents.' On May 17 last year, Ms Davison left her phone at home when she went out. When Todd got drunk and couldn't make contact her, he began texting her mother, Donna, 57. The messages claimed that her daughter was  spreading sexually transmitted diseases and listed the names of people that he claimed she had slept with. When he got no response he sent an intimate picture of Ms Davison to her mother's phone. The message was received at 3am and Ms Davison's father, Joseph, 59, was the first to see the disturbing image. He said: 'When I lifted the phone and saw the reams of messages I was angry, I knew that Christopher hadn't treated my daughter well and I wished he would respect her decision to end the relationship. 'When I saw the picture I felt sick to my stomach, no one wants to see their own child like that. 'I was furious that he had put us all in such a horrible situation, I felt sorry for Hannah, her mum and myself.' Ms Davison's parents got in touch with her through a friend and asked her to come home. Later, the family went to the police and made a formal complaint about the messages. Ms Davison was left distraught after the 'disgusting' message sent by Todd was opened by her father . Ms Davison said Todd sent her texts for weeks after the split, but she did not expect him to involve her parents . Ms Davison said: 'The texts were disgusting. They claimed I had slept with half the town. If he had sent the message to anyone else I think I would have dealt with it and moved on. 'As horrible as it would have been, nothing is as bad as mum and dad reading those things about and seeing me in that way.' Ms Davison said that she regrets letting Todd take the picture, but at the time they were in a committed and happy relationship and he she believed he could be trusted. The government was warned earlier this year that too many people are getting away with posting 'revenge porn' online. A House of Lords committee which looked into the issue found that social media websites are often poor at keeping track of the real identities of the people behind online profiles. While the committee found there are laws that can be used to prosecute abusers, the scale of the problem makes it very difficult to monitor. Lord Richard Best said: 'We were astonished at the scale of social media. One and a half billion people on Facebook, 500 million tweets a day. 'One could not possibly police all of this but in extreme cases prosecution must follow. We need to know who is responsible... and get to them.' Todd, of Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, pleaded guilty to sending a communication of an indecent and offensive nature at a hearing at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court and was given an eight-week, suspended sentence. Ms Davison's mother said in a victim impact statement that she felt the messages were sent 'maliciously by Todd to shock and upset her and cause distress and embarrassment to her and her daughter'. Ms Davison, who works in a call centre, got together with Todd after met at South Tyneside College. She said: 'I was attracted to him because we both liked the same things, we had a similar taste in music and films and a similar sense of humour.' But just a few months into their relationship she began to notice a change in her boyfriend, especially when there was drink involved. She said: 'He worked away so it was easy for us to get on most of the time but when he was home we argued and fought non-stop. 'We didn't see much of each other so even though he upset me a lot I made excuses for him, he treated me nicely and would take me out for food to apologise any time he hurt me.' As the months went on her ability to see past Todd's mood swings diminished. She said: 'He was totally different after a drink and I saw sides of him that made me really uncomfortable. 'The way he treated me and other people made me slowly lose respect for him and when he cheated it was the final straw.'

"Zoe Taylor had her first epileptic seizure in May 2013. It was the most frightening and painful experience of her life. ‘I’ve had two children without pain relief and that was a breeze by comparison,’ says Zoe, 33. The ketogenic diet involves cutting carbohydrate intake to a minimum — no more than an ounce a day. Patients eat generous amounts of fats, such as olive oil, butter and coconut oils . ‘It was a pain you can’t imagine. It started in my tongue and I felt impelled to open my jaws as wide as possible. 'I expelled all the air from my lungs and then I couldn’t breathe in.’ As well as feeling as if she was suffocating, her body was jerking uncontrollably, then she fell unconscious. After that, she had similar seizures every six weeks or so and smaller ones up to ten times a day. ‘My jaw would go fuzzy and numb. Afterwards, I’d feel tired and get emotional about the smallest thing.’ In July, the cause was revealed — a slow-growing brain tumour. ‘I was told it might stay in the same state for years, but they wouldn’t operate because its location meant I might suffer brain damage,’ says Zoe, who lives with her husband Lee, 35, a hairdresser, and their children, Milo, four, and Isabella, seven, in Totnes, Devon. Unfortunately, leaving the tumour in place meant it could become aggressive. ‘I was told radiotherapy might prolong my life by several years, but only half of patients who develop the aggressive type of tumour are alive a year later.’ Conventional treatment for brain cancer involves surgery, if possible, and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, as well as epilepsy drugs for the seizures — these occur because the tumour presses on surrounding brain cells. Zoe is taking epilepsy drugs, but she believes their effect has been boosted dramatically by following a diet approved to treat children with epilepsy. Known as the ketogenic diet, it is being used experimentally to help a few adult brain cancer patients control their seizures. It’s thought it might even help tackle cancer. Many cancer patients switch to a diet high in fruit and vegetables in the belief it can help them fight the disease. Many cancer patients switch to a diet high in fruit and vegetables in the belief it can help them fight the disease. However the evidence for this sort of diet is 'weak' However, according to Professor Tim Key, of Oxford University’s cancer epidemiology unit, the evidence for this sort of diet is ‘weak’. But could the ketogenic diet be different? The radical approach is being investigated at two university brain research centres. The diet involves cutting carbohydrate intake to a minimum — no more than an ounce a day. Out go pasta, rice, sugar, cakes and biscuits; fruit and vegetables are the main carbohydrates. Patients eat generous amounts of fats, such as olive oil, butter and coconut oils, and normal amounts of protein — meat, fish and eggs. The idea is to keep carbohydrates low enough so the body starts producing ketones as an alternative energy source — these are produced by the liver from body fat. This is a natural process and many of us have slightly raised ketone levels before breakfast because we’ve been fasting through the night. They have been found to have a calming effect on the brain. Indeed, ketogenic therapy is a recognised medical treatment for childhood epilepsy. ‘About 30 per cent of epileptic children don’t respond to drugs. 'Ketogenic therapy is used after randomised trials found 40 per cent of children had a 50 per cent reduction in their seizures,’ says Susan Wood, a dietitian who specialises in ketogenic therapy. Extensive trials haven’t been done on adults with epilepsy. The theory is ‘almost too good to be true’, says biochemist Dr Daniel Tennant at Birmingham University. ‘Tumours are addicted to a high glucose supply, so a reasonable way to attack them is by cutting carbs, which lowers blood glucose, reducing their energy supply.’ What’s more, the ketones that the body produces to replace glucose as an energy source can be used by healthy cells, but can’t be used by cancer cells. ‘The ketogenic diet seemed such a plausible way to protect brain cells and starve cancer cells that we had to investigate it,’ he says. A U.S. study on mice published in the Journal of Lipid Research found those on a ketogenic diet responded better to radiotherapy than those on a normal diet. Professor Adrienne Scheck, a neuro-oncologist at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Arizona, led the research. Patients eat generous amounts of fats, such as olive oil, butter and coconut oils, and normal amounts of protein — meat, fish and eggs . ‘It looks as if the diet can have an effect on the way genes behave — it can help reverse processes that encourage tumour survival,’ she says. It seems to reactivate a system that forces damaged cells to commit suicide. A branch of Imperial College in London — the Molecular Neuro-oncology laboratory at Charing Cross Hospital — is also looking into ketones and cancer. One of its scientists, Dr Nelofer Syed, who studies the biochemistry of the brain, was intrigued by Professor Scheck’s mice study. ‘There is a possibility this diet could change the way tumour genes behave,’ she says. Zoe Taylor has been on a ketogenic diet for a year, helped by the Astro Brain Tumour Fund, which funds NHS dietitians to treat adults whose cancer is causing epilepsy. ‘At first, it was challenging,’ says Zoe. ‘You have to cut out so many foods and eating out is almost impossible because everything contains carbohydrates.’ A typical breakfast is scrambled eggs and cream while dinner is fish curry with green peppers, coconut and watercress. ‘But it’s made such a difference. A month after I started, I felt a big seizure was coming, but it just fizzled out. I’ve had no major ones since and only a fraction of the mini-attacks. ‘I’d been feeling dreadful for two years before the first seizure — I picked up any infection going around and had tonsillitis every six months. I used to have a brain fuzziness and that’s gone. 'I’m brighter and more energetic.’ She’s also been told an operation to remove the tumour is now possible because it has shrunk. ‘No one is saying the diet did it, but I think it made a difference,’ she says. However, the diet is controversial, not least because it flies in the face of conventional advice. Dietitians are wary of recommending large amounts of fat, much of it saturated. There are also concerns that a high protein intake is unhealthy, with one major study linking it to a raised risk of heart disease. But the ketogenic diet used to treat epilepsy has normal levels of protein and high fat. Kieran Clarke, professor of physiological biochemistry at Oxford, believes concern about the safety of increasing ketone levels is based on a misunderstanding. ‘The ketone pathway developed as a way to provide animals and humans with energy in times of famine. 'It’s only if someone has uncontrolled diabetes that raising your ketone level is dangerous. ‘Today, people rarely need to switch to ketone production because we are surrounded by cheap carbohydrates. 'Before, many people would be making ketones for much of their lives.’ Dr Tennant is leading a study at Birmingham University in which healthy volunteers on a low-carb, high-fat diet will be given MRI scans to track metabolic changes in the brain. ‘We will be able to see the changes in the way cells use energy,’ says Dr Andrew Peet, a paediatric oncologist involved in the research. ‘We can monitor how fats and carbohydrates affect the rate of cell growth.’ This is a new direction for cancer research which, for a decade, has been about targeting genes. ‘That hasn’t been as successful as we hoped because the target keeps moving as cancers keep mutating,’ says Dr Peet. ‘But that’s not a problem if you can target the energy supply. This research could alter the way we think about the role of diet in treating cancer patients.’ The hope is to start a trial with human volunteers within a year. Charing Cross Hospital supports brain cancer patients who ask to go on the diet as well as have standard treatment. ‘If a patient asks for the ketogenic diet to be part of a package that includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy, we will involve a dietitian to help them,’ says consultant oncologist Dr Matt Williams. Cancer Research UK has been cautious about possible benefits of any diets on cancer. However, Professor Key, its scientific adviser, says the ketogenic diet research is ‘very interesting’ and he ‘looks forward to the results’. Astro Brain Tumour Fund, astrofund.org.uk.

Initial tests showed it has painkilling potential and now the scientists are setting up more trials to see its full potential, the Express reports. Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis Research UK, has put £135,000 towards the cost of the research. He said: 'Spironolactone has been around for decades so we know it is safe.' Osteoarthritis is most common among older people and causes swelling and stiffness in joints. There is no cure for the extremely painful condition and long-term treatment can include having artificial joints.

"The chief of the Pakistani Taliban who had a $5 million bounty on his head has been killed in an American drone strike. Hakimullah Mehsud, thought to have been behind a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square and several attacks inside Pakistan, is one of five believed dead in the attack this morning. The attack and his death were confirmed by senior Taliban commanders, who said they saw Mehsud's body, and U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources. Killed: Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who had a $5m bounty on his head, pictured in 2009 . It is believed the men were killed in a U.S. drone strike on Mehsud's car in the mountainous North Waziristan region, in the north west of Pakistan. Reports said Mehsud led the violent militant group from a secret hideout in the tribal region, which is one of the Taliban's main strongholds. How the U.S. Department of State described Mehsud, who has been among the CIA's most wanted men in the world for at least four years . Drones fired four missiles at a compound in Danda Darpa Khel, a village about three miles from the regional capital of Miranshah, sources said. Two of the dead reportedly included Hakimullah's personal bodyguard Tariq Mehsud and his driver Abdullah Mehsud. A senior Taliban commander said: 'We confirm with great sorrow that our esteemed leader was martyred in a drone attack.' Mehsud took over the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban in August 2009 after his predecessor was also killed in a drone attack. Since then he has been one of the CIA's most wanted men with a $5 million bounty on his head. He appeared in a farewell video for a Jordanian double agent whose suicide bombing in 2009 killed seven CIA employees at a base in Afghanistan. The U.S. named him 'the self-proclaimed emir of the Pakistani Taliban' and charged him with conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens abroad and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. His funeral will be held tomorrow in Miranshah, the Taliban commander said - which is likely to stir tensions further in the highly volatile region. Today's drone strike came amid peace talks between the Pakistani government and militants in the region to end years of fighting. Unconfirmed reports say the strike came as Mehsud attended a gathering of 25 Taliban leaders to discuss the government's offer of peace. Hakimullah Mehsud, pictured right, was said to command violent militants from a mountainous hideout . This photo from November 2008 shows Mehsud, second from left, speaking to journalists at a Taliban base . During . a visit to London yesterday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who won a landslide election victory in May, confirmed talks with the Pakistani Taliban had started. The Pakistani government condemned today's drone strike, although their statement was issued before Mehsud's death was reported. Controversial: Taliban leaders have already described Hakimullah Mehsud as a martyr . 'These . strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial . integrity,' said a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The drone strikes are unpopular in Pakistan, . where many people view them as an infringement on Pakistani sovereignty . and say innocent civilians are killed in the process. But the Americans have had some successes - in May, a drone strike killed Mehsud's second-in-command, and one of his most trusted lieutenants was captured in Afghanistan last month. The CIA and the White House declined to comment on Mehsud's death. Although the killing will spark calls for revenge among Taliban leaders, it may make negotiations with the militants easier in the long-run, said Saifullah Mahsud, director of the Pakistani think-tank FATA Research Center. He said: 'Hakimullah Mehsud was a very controversial figure and he had very tough demands.' Mehsud, who told jokes and had an interest in modern technology, was the driver for the former head of the Pakistani Taliban before rising through the ranks. The militant leader, known for his emotional outbursts, had two wives but moved frequently because of his fear of U.S. drone strikes. His wing of the Taliban was accused of being involved in an attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square in 2010. But recently Mehsud's rivalries with other Taliban commanders over the spoils from extortion and kidnapping had sharpened, it is believed, raising tensions within the armed organisation. Tension: Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, pictured meeting U.S. President Barack Obama last week, said only yesterday that peace talks with the Taliban had started.

"Sometimes, it’s not so bad being a laboratory guinea pig, though my laboratory is an odd one. In fact, I’m installed at a table at the Horniman at Hays pub on London’s South Bank. And the scientific test itself is even odder — I am being forced to consume an ice-cold pint of Pilsner Urquell beer. Wrapped around my ankle is an electronic ‘sobriety tag’ — a black plastic box about the size of a cigarette packet, weighing 5.8oz. It is a ‘transdermal tag’ or a ‘Breathalyser for your ankle’, as it’s been dubbed. Harry Mount has tested the electronic ‘sobriety tag’ which is to be fitted to the ankles of drunken offenders . These gizmos can tell whether you’ve been drinking — and the results are then transmitted to a computer that records the exact moment you slip down the pub for a quick one. Under new Tory plans, thousands of drunken offenders will be fitted with the devices. If the Conservatives win the next election, the Government will impose ‘sobriety orders’ — already dubbed ‘Sosbos’ — instead of prison for certain drink-related offences. The orders will be enforced by the tags, which offenders will wear for up to 120 days. The tags were first introduced in 2007 in South Dakota in America. The results were astonishing — 83 per cent of offenders didn’t drink while tagged and incidents of drink-driving across the state fell. The jail population declined. It wasn’t long before the bracelets were introduced across America. So far, they have been used on 360,000 offenders. Actress Lindsay Lohan was among those fitted with one. Successful pilot schemes were launched this year in London, Northamptonshire and Cheshire, and now the Conservatives are planning to roll out the scheme across England and Wales. Legal powers for Sosbos already exist and the Tories will promise in their election manifesto to deal with an initial 5,000 offenders a year, in a scheme which will cost an estimated £15 million. Sosbos would be imposed on those convicted of drink-related offences, such as common assault, drink-driving, obstructing a police officer, being drunk and disorderly and causing criminal damage. Offenders thought to be alcoholics will not be eligible. The programme is surprisingly cheap. It costs only £800 per offender for 120 days — a lot cheaper than jail. Might it be the magic bullet to cut alcohol-fuelled crime, estimated to cost us £8 billion a year? Successful pilot schemes using the device (pictured) were launched this year in London, Northamptonshire and Cheshire, and now the Conservatives are planning to roll out the scheme across England and Wales . It will be particularly aimed at those binge-drinking youths who turn our city centres into battle zones on Friday and Saturday nights. Probation officers monitor the bracelets’ results. If offenders remain sober throughout their period with the bracelet, then they have satisfied the probation service’s demands. If they relapse, they will be hit with an £80 fine, community punishments or a jail term. My aim, though, in the Horniman at Hays, is not to stay sober, but to test the device to destruction by drinking. And I’m proud to say that, within 20 minutes, I’ve broken it. The computer chip was so confused by the speed with which I got stuck into my mid-afternoon Pilsner that it died. The software hadn’t had a chance to warm up. I had to call for the help of Matthew Mitchell, the UK manager for Scram Continuous Alcohol Monitoring, the company that invented the bracelets. ‘I’ve never seen an offender do that before,’ Mr Mitchell said, as he fitted me with a new device. ‘Usually, we fit the bracelet and then give them a half-hour induction. That gives the software enough time to normalise.’ Once the new one is strapped around my ankle, it works like a dream. The technology is fairly simple. Every half an hour, 24 hours a day, you feel a little buzz from the machine — like a vibrating phone sending a text. It comes from a tiny pump connecting a small, perforated metal plate to my skin. As it buzzes, the pump takes a sample of sweat. About one per cent of everything we drink is expelled via our pores all over the body. We sweat alcohol out as ethanol molecules. They then interact with a fuel cell in the bracelet to create an electrical current. The principle is the same with a Breathalyser, except that there the ethanol molecules are in the air we exhale. The strength of the electrical current varies according to how much alcohol there is in your system, and the bracelet sends all the information to a computer kept at your home. Twice a day — at 11.30pm and 6.30am — it wirelessly downloads your drinking pattern and transmits the results to the probation services. The black plastic box can tell when people have had a drink and transmits the results to a central computer . If I were an offender, the magistrate or judge could then convict me for breaking the terms of my probation. The bracelet can also tell if you try to tamper with it. If I were to stick a piece of cardboard between the bracelet and my skin to block the perspiration readings, sensors would tell base command I was up to no good. And, if I were to break the bracelet, the computer would log that, too. Submerging the bracelet in water is an offence — although it’s fine to take a shower, as I do twice over two days, with no damage done. After 48 hours, Mr Mitchell downloads a graph that shows my drinking — and it’s astonishingly accurate. Even though I broke the first bracelet with my early drinking, the central computer still managed to record my consumption. That pint of Pilsner Urquell, first glugged at 3.43pm, shows up half an hour later as a sharp rise on the graph. My TAC levels — ‘Transdermal Alcohol Concentration’ — continue to climb even after I stop drinking, as my body absorbs the alcohol. Actress Lindsay Lohan has been among those fitted with one of the black tags to monitor alcohol use . The body continues to metabolise alcohol and expel it long after you’ve stopped drinking — that’s why drink-drivers are often caught the morning after a heavy drinking session. After a short break — when my TAC levels fall — I continue my arduous experiment at 6.41pm, with my first sip of a pint of Amstel. The graph is accurate down to the minute. At 7.28pm, I start a second pint of Amstel. At 8.08pm, I begin a third pint — this time of Pilsner. At 8.42pm, I sensibly downgrade to a half-pint of Pilsner. The following evening, I have two pints of San Miguel lager, followed by half a bottle of white wine. The white wine — at 11.5 per cent alcohol strength — is considerably stronger than the 5 per cent beer. But the stronger wine doesn’t show up as a steeper line on the graph. ‘When the body reaches maximum alcohol capacity, it can only expel the ethanol at a maximum rate,’ says Mr Mitchell, ‘If you drank several shots quickly, it would just take a longer time to expel it. You don’t get a spike.’ In my two days wearing the device, I barely notice it buzzing and sleep through it. The bracelet is slightly uncomfortable, though. On a long walk, it began chafing the skin above my ankle. More difficult is the social stigma. As I sat in the Horniman at Hays, I noticed several people staring down at the bracelet — you can barely see its outline when it’s concealed by your trouser leg, but it was exposed in the act of sitting down. If you were an offender, you might feel slightly ashamed by such an obvious criminal tag. No bad thing, I say. ‘Some offenders in America actually wear them as a badge of honour,’ says Matthew Mitchell. ‘They’ll wear shorts to show them off. Others are so pleased with being sober that they’ll have an image of the bracelet tattooed on their ankle as a constant reminder of how useful the programme was, once they’ve had the real thing removed.’ I began the experiment by thinking it was a draconian imposition on civil liberties. I end up convinced of its use as a law enforcement device. Not only does the tag barely interrupt your everyday life. It also saves taxpayers’ money, keeps offenders out of jail and makes our High Streets more pleasant. I’ll raise my glass to that.","Harry Mount tests electronic ‘sobriety tag’ which is to be fitted to offenders .

"The science that could allow babies with three parents to be born in Britain is unproven and may be unsafe, a leading US scientist warned last night. The Government could give the go-ahead as early as next year for children to be born using genetic material from two mothers and a father – making the UK the first country in the world to license the technique for clinical use. But Professor Evan Snyder, the top scientific adviser on the issue to US authorities, yesterday warned there were unresolved safety concerns. A top scientist warned there was years more testing to be done before the technology, which helps families have healthy babies, can be introduced (file image) The procedure is designed to give couples who have endured the heartache of repeatedly miscarrying or burying much-longed-for children the option of having a healthy family. It helps women with damaged mitochondria – which power cells by turning food into energy. The defect causes serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and is behind 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy. Women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain childless. But scientists want to swap healthy mitochondria from an egg donated by a woman into the egg of the mother-to-be. The UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said this year there was no evidence that the technique would be unsafe. But Professor Snyder, who chairs the scientific panel advising the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), believes years’ more research is needed before the technique is used. Speaking to the Independent newspaper, he said: ‘The panel was not in any way antagonistic towards this intervention. ‘The diseases are terrible, the treatments are non-existent and the technology so far is a tour de force. 'However, everybody concluded that there is still more work to be done. Scientists want to swap healthy mitochondria from an egg donated by a woman into the egg of the mother-to-be. Pictured, a single sperm is injected into an egg via IVF . ‘The gap I’m talking about is about how much pre-clinical scientific work needs to be done before scientists or someone on the FDA would feel comfortable that we’re assured of safety.’ Asked whether it would be justifiable to permit the procedure to go ahead on compassionate grounds, Professor Snyder said it should not be allowed until all the extra research is completed. He said: ‘We don’t know whether these changes will be passed to future generations.’ The UK’s proposals involve the replacement of all mitochondria in a mother’s egg with that from a donor, rather than mixing it together from the two different mothers as intended in the US. Critics say the technique defies nature and crosses a crucial ethical line because it could be altered to create ‘designer babies’. By swapping genetic material before conception, doctors could create babies made to order by hair or eye colour. Even among those who do not oppose the technique on ethical grounds, many fear that we have insufficient scientific evidence that it is safe.","Science that could allow three-parent babies is 'unproven', scientist said .

"A video of a rabbit with a rare disease that causes gruesome-looking growths to protrude from its head has attracted over 200,000 views online in less than a week. Dubbed ‘Frankenstein', the animal was first seen by the Boettcher family in Mankato, Minnesota, early last month, hopping around in their backyard. The rabbit is infected by the cottontail papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, which causes tumours to grow on or near the animal's head. The tumours can eventually become large enough to interfere with the rabbit's ability to eat, causing them to die of starvation. Scroll down for video . Frankenstein: The rabbit has a disease that causes tumours to grow from his head . Monster rabbit: Frankenstein hides under the Boettcher family's truck in their backyard in Minnesota . The horn-like tumours growing from Frankenstein's head will eventually get so big that he will die from starvation . Gunnar Boettcher, 20, who studies Exercise Science and Studio Art at Gustavus Adolphus College, St Peter, Minnesota, tells the Mail Online he thinks the rabbit lives in their shed or wood pile. ‘Whenever we got close, he always ran away. We could never get a close look at him,’ says Gunnar. The college student finally got close enough to take the first pictures and video of Frankenstein last week. He and his younger brother, Zander, 15, made a ‘funny documentary' on the rabbit as it hopped through their garden. In the video, Gunnar tells the viewers he has seen a 'monster rabbit'. 'It’s crazy, it’s got monster spikes sticking out of his head, we don’t know what this thing is capable of,' he says as the video zooms in on the rabbit. Gunnar Boettcher, 20, tells viewers he is about to approach the 'monster rabbit' he has named Frankenstein . They uploaded the video to Facebook which spread like wildfire and has become ‘extremely popular’, according to Gunnar. He says his friend Shane decided to put the photos of the rabbit on Reddit.com, titled ‘Rabbit living in my friend's backyard’. The video has garnered 1,950 comments and 223,592 views after just five days online.

"France's under pressure power grid could struggle to cope if growing numbers of electric car owners all recharge their batteries when they sit down for dinner, the industry said today. The warning comes after French car-maker Renault launched its long-awaited electric car Zoe this month at a price on a par with petrol models, making it the first electric vehicle with mass-market potential. The government, meanwhile, has been encouraging the technology with generous subsidies. But this comes in a country with a power . grid that is already extremely sensitive to spikes in demand because of . its high reliance on electric heating. Power bosses have warned of the effect of an increasing number of people using electric cars after the Renault Zoe, the first with mass market potential, was launched . Though the prospect of a fleet of hundreds of thousands of electric cars remains some distance off, France needs to consider how it will cope when cold winter evenings prompt households to turn on the heaters, lights and electric gadgets at the same time. Olivier Grabette, head of R&D at French power grid RTE, said: 'If it's badly managed, it could prompt power surges, which would cost a lot in peak production, CO2 emissions and would also necessitate the construction of relatively costly infrastructure.' Grabette said that under the 'ambitious' scenario of a fleet of two million electric vehicles by 2020, total French annual electricity consumption would rise by 1 to 3 per cent. 'It's not huge in terms of energy,' Grabette said. 'But if all these vehicles charge at peak times, even with slow car chargers, it could add between 3 and 6 gigawatts (GW) of peak demand, which would be felt if it comes at the wrong moment.' Data last year from U.S. eco-town Mueller, in Texas, showed that owners of electric cars typically plugged in their vehicles when home electricity use spiked, causing potential problems for the grid. The heavy reliance on electrical . heating in France was instigated by successive governments to absorb . surplus nuclear power. Its 19 nuclear power plants make France Europe's . biggest electricity exporter and ensure generally steady power supplies. However, . it lacks flexible capacity - usually generated by gas, coal or . oil-fired plants - to meet peak evening demand during cold snaps. Under pressure: Electric pylons which are part of the grid in Albertville, Savoie, France . Renault's decision not to provide chargers compatible with home sockets, thereby requiring Zoe owners to buy 'Wall-Box' chargers, could soften the impact. Peak demand has hit record highs in each of the past 10 winters. In February last year demand at one point hit more than 102 GW and pushed the network to its limits, obliging France to import a record 9 GW. RTE and other state agencies identified the problem in a 2011 report and recommended car chargers that take up to eight hours to recharge a vehicle. Though quick chargers do the job in about 30 minutes, these draw more energy than a dozen electric hot-water heaters. There is also the problem of a geographical concentration of cars drawing power from quick chargers; at supermarkets, motorway service stations or business districts, for instance. 'The issue is not the total number of vehicles, it's how they will spread - and we think they will spread in clusters,' said Laurent Schmitt, Smart Grid vice-president at French engineering company Alstom. 'You can have only 1,000 cars, (but) if 500 of these are connected to the same building, you'll have a problem with this building and the neighbourhood around it,' he said. 'The issue is not the total number of vehicles, it's how they will spread - and we think they will spread in clusters.' Alstom's vice-president . The key could be off-peak charging via 'smart grids' able to communicate with chargers that can then be operated remotely. 'There could be a problem, if we're not careful, in terms of peak capacity,' said Bruno Dobrowolski, in charge of the electric vehicle programme at ErDF, the electric distribution arm of state-owned utility EDF. 'That's why smart charging is necessary.' French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg, the first Renault client to be handed the keys of a Zoe, has appointed a committee to advise on the expansion of the charger network. Renault's decision not to provide chargers compatible with home sockets, thereby requiring Zoe owners to buy 'Wall-Box' chargers, could soften the impact. In Britain, Renault will subsidise the cost when the car is launched there in June. The partly state-owned carmaker says owners could also use smartphone apps to set charging times depending on power prices. 'If it is developed well, in a coordinated way, it isn't a problem and could even help to rebalance a network, especially by integrating more renewable energy,' RTE's Grabette said. Electric cars' batteries could smooth the variability of wind and solar energy by storing wind power produced at night and injecting it back to the grid when it needs help, he said. Such vehicle-to-grid systems are already being tested in the United States and Japan. Alstom's Schmitt said France has domestic industrial players in each of the necessary fields of expertise, but the government needs a strong hand to ensure an integrated approach. 'You don't need to work with 10,000 players, but five or 10 who are leaders in their field. However, that raises the issue of the big players' egos,' Schmitt said.","Warning comes after Renault launched electric car with mass potential .

"We are all used to our image being captured by CCTV everywhere we go - but now, it is about to get a lot smarter. Researchers have unveiled smart software that can automatically track people across moving and still cameras - allowing them to be automatically tracked in real time. The cameras can first identify a person in a video frame, then follow that same person across multiple camera views - and can even analyse live footage from drones. Scroll down for video . The University of Washington researchers are developing the software to work in real time, which could help pick out people crossing in busy intersections, or track a specific person who is dodging the police. The researchers say the system could create a 'super GPS'. 'Imagine a typical GPS display that maps the streets, buildings and signs in a neighborhood as your car moves forward, then add humans to the picture,' they say. 'With the new technology, a car with a mounted camera could take video of the scene, then identify and track humans and overlay them into the virtual 3-D map on your GPS screen.' The University of Washington electrical engineers say their system could save hours of sifting through CCTV footage - and even revolutionise GPS systems. The UW researchers are developing the software to work in real time, which could help pick out people crossing in busy intersections, or track a specific person who is dodging the police. 'Tracking humans automatically across cameras in a three-dimensional space is new,' said lead researcher Jenq-Neng Hwang, a UW professor of electrical engineering. 'As the cameras talk to each other, we are able to describe the real world in a more dynamic sense.' Hwang and his research team presented their results last month in Qingdao, China, at the Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE. He says the system would have been able to analyse footage from the Boston combing and track suspect's movements across cameras within hours of the explosion taking place. 'Our idea is to enable the dynamic visualization of the realistic situation of humans walking on the road and sidewalks, so eventually people can see the animated version of the real-time dynamics of city streets on a platform like Google Earth,' Hwang said. Hwang's research team in the past decade has developed a way for video cameras – from the most basic models to high-end devices – to talk to each other as they record different places in a common location. The problem with tracking a human across cameras of non-overlapping fields of view is that a person's appearance can vary dramatically in each video because of different perspectives, angles and color hues produced by different cameras. The researchers overcame this by building a link between the cameras. Cameras first record for a couple of minutes to gather training data, systematically calculating the differences in color, texture and angle between a pair of cameras for a number of people who walk into the frames in a fully unsupervised manner without human intervention. The research team has tested the ability of static and moving cameras to detect and track pedestrians on the UW campus in multiple scenarios, even using cars and drones. After this calibration period, an algorithm automatically applies those differences between cameras and can pick out the same people across multiple frames, effectively tracking them without needing to see their faces. The research team has tested the ability of static and moving cameras to detect and track pedestrians on the UW campus in multiple scenarios. In one experiment, graduate students mounted cameras in their cars to gather data, then applied the algorithms to successfully pick out humans and follow them in a three-dimensional space. They also installed the tracking system on cameras placed inside a robot and a flying drone, allowing the robot and drone to follow a person, even when the instruments came across obstacles that blocked the person from view. The linking technology can be used anywhere, as long as the cameras can talk over a wireless network and upload data to the cloud. Inevitably, people will have privacy concerns, Hwang said, and the information extracted from cameras could be encrypted before it's sent to the cloud. 'Cameras and recording won't go away. Cameras first record for a couple of minutes to gather training data, systematically calculating the differences in color, texture and angle between a pair of cameras for a number of people who walk into the frames in a fully unsupervised manner without human intervention.

'We might as well take advantage of that fact and extract more useful information for the benefit of the community,' he added. This detailed visual record could be useful for security and surveillance, monitoring for unusual behavior or tracking a moving suspect. But it also tells store owners and business proprietors useful information and statistics about consumers' moving patterns. A store owner could, for example, use a tracking system to watch a shopper's movements in the store, taking note of her interests. Then, a coupon or deal for a particular product could be displayed on a nearby screen or pushed to the shopper's phone – in an instant. Leveraging the visual data produced by our physical actions and movements might, in fact, become the next way in which we receive marketing, advertisements and even helpful tools for our everyday lives.","Firm says technology could allow for 'real time Google Earth' with live people shown .

"This is the astonishing moment that German soldiers were forced to surrender during the notorious Battle of the Somme almost a century ago. The image was taken in July 1916 by a soldier who defied Army chiefs in the First World War to take secret photographs of life in the trenches. Amateur photographer Lance Corporal George Hackney took candid pictures of the Great War when he signed up to fight in October 1915. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: Lance Corporal George Hackney captured the moment the 36th (Ulster) Division forced German soldiers to surrender in July 1916. The amateur photographer used a folding camera slightly bigger than a phone to capture the battle, which saw more than a million men killed . Self-portrait: Lance Corporal George Hackney (pictured above), took candid images of the Great War when he signed up to fight in 1915. Despite filming without permission being banned, he risked facing the court martial by capturing the scenes from the trenches during the war . Crossing: Men sailing on the English Channel from Southampton to Boulogne in October 1915 sleep on the deck while others look overboard. The Battalion sailed on the former Isle of Man paddle steamer, Empress Queen, and some would've been keeping watch for German U-boats . In the trenches: This rare photograph of scouts and snipers was taken by Corporal Hackney in France during the winter of 1915/16. The rifle to the left of the frame has a modified cheek rest attached which would have been used to help the shooter align his eye to a telescopic sight . He captured the moment the 36th (Ulster) Division forced the Germans to surrender in the bloody battle, which saw more than a million men killed. The soldiers can be seen on the horizon of the dramatic photograph, and the battle in France was far from over - it would last a further four months. The Northern Irishman used a folding camera, believed to be a Vest Pocket Kodak which was only just bigger than a smartphone, during the war before giving the photos to loved ones on his return. Lance Corporal Hackney faced court martial if he was ever caught filming without permission - but his record now offers a testimony to life at the front. Now, the soldier’s photographs have been published for the first time after being found two years ago alongside a host of his personal diaries. His images were aired last night on BBC One Northern Ireland in a documentary called The Man Who Shot the Great War. Director Brian Henry Martin said his 'unique collection of images' give 'a window into what it was like to live, and die, on the Western Front'. Reading the newspaper: Soldiers in the summer of 1916 at Ploegsteert Wood near Messines in Belgium. A 'keep down' sign can be seen left . In the field: Paul Pollock, standing and smoking, was the son of a Presbyterian minister at a church attended by Lance Corporal Hackney. Mr Pollock was killed on July 1, 1916. His body was never found and his name was only added to the Thievpal Memorial to the Missing last year . Comrades: A photograph taken at Randalstown Camp in County Antrim in 1915 of Lance Corporal Hackney's friend John Ewing writing. Historian Richard Van Emden said the corporal would've mainly only got his camera out in front of friends for fear of being caught by officers . He added: ‘Who was this man? How did he manage to capture these remarkable scenes from a range of sites at a time when unofficial photography was illegal on the Western Front?’ The stunning photographs, which were donated to the Ulster Museum after the veteran died in 1977, show the mundane life of soldiers relaxing in the trenches and travelling to France on a boat. And Lance Corporal Hackney, of Belfast, even captured the moment the 36th (Ulster) Division forced German soldiers to surrender in July 1916. The shots have been hailed as the ‘photographical First World War discovery of the century’ by Belgian Ministry of Defence chief Franky Bostyn. Portrait: John Ewing, a fellow soldier of Lance Corporal Hackney, is pictured with a 'Plum Pudding' mortar in one of the many photographs in the collection . Amanda Moreno, head of collections for the Museums of The Royal Irish Regiment, said: ‘As a collection of photographs of the First World War, they are totally exceptional. ‘In terms of what they tell us about the First World War, the 36th (Ulster) Division, I’ve never seen anything like them before. I don’t suppose I ever will again.’ The military man gave some of his photos to the loved ones of fallen comrades, including Sergeant James Scott. Scott was killed in the Battle of Messines in Belgian West Flanders in May 1917, and Lance Corporal Hackney presented three pictures to his family after the war ended in 1918. Director Mr Martin had a chance meeting with his great-great-grandson Mark Scott while chasing the source of the pictures at the Royal Ulster Rifles Museum in Belfast. The photographs were undiscovered until two years ago when Mr Martin stumbled across them while researching the Ulster Covenant. Now, just a week after Remembrance Day, the director is bringing the 300 pictures to the TV programme to show what life was really like in the war, 100 years on from its outbreak. And it is believed that there could be another 200 pictures still undiscovered. Producer Dermot Lavery, of filmmakers DoubleBand Films, said: ‘The full philosophical implications of George Hackney’s remarkable journey from the Battle of the Somme to the end of his life only revealed themselves as we prepared to make this documentary. ‘He was, in fact, just a simple, modest Belfast man - but a man whose message still rings true even today. In a way all we had to do was not let him down.’ Author and First World War historian Richard Van Emden described the photographs as ‘amazing’ and said they were ‘extremely rare’. In reference to the picture showing the moment the 36th (Ulster) Division forced the Germans to surrender on the Somme, Mr Van Emden said he had ‘never seen a picture like it’. He said that while he had seen photographs showing the moment minutes after that scenario, he had not seen a picture depicting the soldiers with their hands in the air taken from that particular view point. He said: ‘The further you go on during the war, the rarer the photo albums become. ‘That style of the image taken from over the top, I’ve never seen anything like that from a private collection. Action photographs such as that are very rare indeed. ‘The quality of his pictures are good. He’s almost certainly used the VPK (Vest Pocket Kodak). ‘He’s obviously a keen amateur photographer and man who knew how to use a VPK.’ Standing up: Soldiers at Randalstown Camp in County Antrim in 1915. The 14th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles stayed there in wooden huts after being moved from Finner Camp in January 1915. They remained in the huts at Randalstown until moving to England in the July of that year . Horseback: Sergeant James Scott in East Sussex in 1915. He was killed at the Battle of Messines in Belgian West Flanders two years later . The Vest Pocket Kodak (VPK) was a camera marketed to soldiers during the First World War. It was a foldable camera, which measured no bigger than a smartphone, and could fit easily in a uniform pocket. On sale from 1912 until 1926, the VPK was the first camera to use the smaller 127 film reels. It had to be loaded through the top with both film spools at once. The basic VPK was fitted with a two-speed ball bearing shutter – 1/25 and 1/50 sec – and a fixed-focus lens. The camera was favoured by soldiers due to its size - when folded it measured no bigger than 2.5 inches by 4.75 inches. More than two million were sold before it was discontinued in 1926, and it is believed that they retailed for about 30 shillings. Mr Van Emden believes the photographs were most likely taken on the VPK, which was a basic camera used by soldiers during the war. He said that Corporal Hackney would have had to have been extremely careful to not have been caught using the device, as he would’ve faced heavy punishment due to the ban in place on filming without permission. The historian, whose recent published work includes Tommy’s War: The Western Front in Soldiers’ Words and Photographs, said: ‘Any pictures from the middle to late Battle of the Somme get really really rare. ‘This is obviously a man who knows how to use his camera. He’s got to make sure he’s taken them quickly. He’s got to be confident the officer is not going to walk around the corner. ‘He would’ve been in serious trouble especially at that time if he had been caught.’ Mr Van Emden said no officers could be seen in Corporal Hackney’s collection, perhaps further highlighting the fact they were taken discreetly and out of view. He said it is likely he only got his camera out in front of close friends and comrades. He said: ‘There’s not a single one that has an officer in which is absolutely typical. These are really rare photographs. ‘He would’ve been very careful not to wave his cameras around in front of officers. ‘He would’ve looked around, thought “I wouldn’t mind getting a shot of that”, checked no officers were looking, taken the camera out and changed the settings all within 10 seconds. ‘It’s a very quick operation. He clearly knows what he’s doing. He would’ve been very circumspect and would’ve probably only taken it out in front of his close friends.’ Mr Van Emden said the Kodak camera was marketed at soldiers going to war during that time and said it would’ve cost about 30 shillings. He said: ‘It was quite a basic camera. It was built for the man in the street. It had roll film, it could fit into a small pocket, and it had fold-away bellows. 'In its day it was a portable digital camera of its time. No thrills, inexpensive but good quality pictures. ‘It would’ve been sold for about 30 shillings which was not an inconsiderable sum for a working class man. They would’ve had to save but ultimately it wasn’t beyond their reach.’ The public will be able to see Lance Corporal Hackney's album in a new modern history gallery at the Ulster Museum in Belfast from next Wednesday.","Lance Corporal George Hackney took candid pictures of war when he signed up to fight in October 1915 .

"They are certainly advanced despite their tender years, thanks to their precocious talent and famous parents. But even their grown-up fans will be left scratching their heads after reading a new interview the children of Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith. Willow, 14, and Jaden, 16, sat down with T Magazine to discuss Prana energy (meditation), school being overrated and how Willow possesses the ability to control time. The siblings also rant about how 'life is meditation' and how babies 'remember' when they are born. Scroll down for video . Radical thinkers: Jaden Smith, 16, and Willow Smith, 14, talk quantum physics, their ability to control time and why school is useless in the new issue of The New York Times Style Magazine T . First off, the pair reveal in the interview that Willow is currently reading 'quantum physics' while Jaden reveals he is glossing over an 'ancient text' called The Ancient Secret of the Flower Life [that] can’t be pre-dated'. The interviewer then asks the pair what themes 'recur' in their music, to which Jaden replies 'the melancholiness of the ocean; the melancholiness of everything else' while Willow describes the feeling of being in a 'holographic reality that a higher consciousness made'. It is not surprising, that they both confess they've already had enough of going to school like normal teenagers. 'I went to school for one year. It was the best experience but the worst experience,' Willow admitted. 'The best experience because I was, like, ""Oh, now I know why kids are so depressed."" But it was the worst experience because I was depressed,' she added. While Jaden took aim at Driver's Ed, suggesting that the amount of car accidents that happen prove school isn't working. 'You never learn anything in school. Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver’s ed? What’s up?' he said. 'I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please': Willow claims she can control time in a new interview with T Magazine . Bookworm: Jaden is currently reading The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life and 'ancient texts; things that can’t be pre-dated' 'I still haven’t been to driver’s ed because if everybody I know has been in an accident, I can’t see how driver’s ed is really helping them out.' Jaden added: 'Here’s the deal: School is not authentic because it ends. It’s not true, it’s not real.' 'Our learning will never end. The school that we go to every single morning, we will continue to go to.' Willow then rather bizarrely claims that time is a concept that she can control with her mind. 'I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please,' she says. 'That’s how I know it doesn't exist.' And despite only being fourteen years old, Willow already misses her days as a newborn. 'When they’re in the stomach, [babies are] so aware, putting all their bones together, putting all their ligaments together. But they’re shocked by this harsh world … As they grow up, they start losing.' Discussing honesty, Willow goes on to suggest that she has started 'caring less and less about what your own mind thinks' in a bid to stop her feeling sad. Jaden agrees by saying: 'Exactly. Because your mind has a duality to it. So when one thought goes into your mind, it’s not just one thought, it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain.' The pair also admitted that they do not think a lot of music 'out there' is cool while Willow claimed that because she doesn't like novels, she writes her own. 'Willow’s been writing her own novels since she was six', Jaden then says. Too cool for school: Willow, Jaden, Will and Jada at a premiere in Toronto in 2012 .

"In the third episode of the Simpsons in 1987, Smithers made his first appearance. When viewers first laid eyes on Montgomery Burns' assistant, he was black. But when he appeared on screen again he was yellow, because of what the show's creator Matt Groening says was a mistake. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Smithers first appeared in the third episode of the show in 1987 (left). In his second appearance he was yellow, as he has remained ever since . The 60-year-old claimed that the character was always meant to be yellow, but animators painted him the wrong color and, because they were low on funds, they could not afford a retake. The writer also revealed that all the characters are yellow, because he wanted them to look different to everything else on TV, and have four fingers because it is easier to draw. Talking to TMZ, he said: 'He was always yellow, and they painted him wrong once. 'At the time we didn't have enough to do retakes, so when there were glitches and mistakes it stayed that way. 'He was never 'black', it was an accident.' The interviewer then asks why all of the characters are yellow, to which Groening sarcastically replies:  'I've never noticed'. He then adds: 'It is so they wouldn't look like anything else on TV... except for Spongebob.' And he said that the reason all of the characters have four fingers is because it is 'easier to draw'. Error: Creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, says that Smithers was black in the first episode because animators painted him the wrong color and they could not afford retakes . 'That is a lot of pencil mileage if you add another finger' he said. The 26th season of The Simpsons begins on September 28, where Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, Krusty the Clown's father, was killed off. The show originally ran as shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987. After three seasons, the shorts were developed into a half-hour prime time show that debuted on December 17, 1989 as a Christmas special. The Simpsons have won 28 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Homer's catchphrase 'D'oh!' has entered the American lexicon while the show has become the longest-running US sitcom, the longest running American animated program and the longest-running US scripted primetime TV series. The show's other notable catchphrases include Marge's questionable 'Hmmmmmm', neighbor Ned Flander's greeting 'Hi-Diddily Ho!' and schoolyard tyrant Nelson's 'Haw Haw!' The Simpsons Movie was released in July 2007 and the feature-length film grossed more than $527 million.","Mr Burns' assistant appeared as an African American in the 3rd episode .

"The Leonid meteor shower is set to be visible across the East coast tonight. It should reach its peak before dawn on Tuesday - although experts say it will be a relatively disappointing show. The Leonid meteor shower should produce about 10-15 meteors per hour, Nasa predicts. Scroll down for video . A meteor from the Leonid shower, visible as a diagonal streak between the fingers of a cactus plant, is seen in this time exposure photo from early Sunday, Nov. 18, 2001, in Tucson, Arizona. Tonight shower is expected to produce around 10-15 meteors per hour, and be visible across the East coast. To have the best chance of spotting meteors, you should go to a location away from city lights, dress warmly, lie flat on your back and look straight up, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cook. No special viewing equipment is needed to see the Leonid shower. This year's shower is likely 'to be weak and there probably will be long stretches when not a single Leonid will be seen,' said Joe Rao of Space.com. To have the best chance of spotting meteors, you should go to a location away from city lights, dress warmly, lie flat on your back and look straight up, said NASA meteor expert Bill Cook. No special viewing equipment is needed to see the Leonid shower, he said; it can be seen with the naked eye. The Leonids appear to be coming from the constellation Leo the Lion (hence their name). Skies should be clear along the East Coast for viewing the meteor shower late Monday night and early Tuesday morning. If forecasters are correct, the shower should produce a mild but pretty sprinkling of meteors. The waning crescent moon will not substantially interfere with viewing the Leonid shower. 'We're predicting 10 to 15 meteors per hour,' says Bill Cooke of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Nasa recommends going to a location away from city lights, dressing warmly, and lie flat on your back and look straight up. No special viewing equipment needed — just your eyes. 'For best viewing, wait until after midnight on Nov. 18, with the peak of the shower occurring just before sunrise.' Cooke also recommends going to a location away from city lights, dressing warmly, and lie flat on your back and look straight up. No special viewing equipment needed — just your eyes. Leonids are bits of debris from Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Every 33 years the comet visits the inner solar system and leaves a stream of dusty debris in its wake. Many of these streams have drifted across the November portion of Earth's orbit. Whenever our planet hits one, meteors appear to be flying out of the constellation Leo.","Leonid meteor shower should produce about 10-15 meteors per hour .

"Attacker: Usman Yasin, 30, attacked Patricia Pearson in a vicious road rage attack but has now had his jail term quashed in favour of community service . An aggressive male motorist who hit an 81-year-old woman in a road rage attack because she was driving at five mph has had his jail sentence quashed. Pensioner Patricia Pearson was left with deep cuts on her head and face after Usman Yasin overtook and blocked the road before smacking her in the face. She had been driving to visit her husband in his care home. Magistrates at Burton upon Trent jailed him for 16 weeks last month, but an appeal judge at Stafford Crown Court has now changed his sentence. Instead, the father of two was ordered to do 150 hours unpaid community work, banned from driving for two weeks and ordered to pay Mrs Pearson £100 compensation. Yasin, 30, of  Burton, was convicted of common assault. The court heard how Yasin became increasingly frustrated as he travelled behind Mrs Pearson, maintaining that she had been driving at no more than five mph. Solicitor Nick Burn told his appeal hearing: 'The defendant came up behind Mrs Pearson, there was a combination of loud revving and sounding of the horn, clearly impatience on behalf of the defendant.' Yasin eventually overtook and stopped in front of Mrs Pearson’s car, causing her to brake. She got out, went up to Yasin’s Peugeot and 'exchanged words'. She put her hand up to his face in a gentle push, but Yasin reacted by lashing out with his hand. Passer-by Mr David Smith intervened and Yasin said to him: “The b**** hit me.' Painful: Patricia had a swollen lip, lumps on her forehead and cuts on her cheek from the incident . Victim: Patricia Pearson, 81, suffered horrific injuries after being slapped by Yasin - who was angry at her for driving too slowly . Mrs Pearson said:  'This incident has left me feeling scared and vulnerable. I have always been a strong person, but I was terrified. There was no need for him to do this to me or use the language that he did. I know he may say I shouldn’t have put my hand up to his face, but that was only to stop him using the language he did.” Mr Burn added 'Overall, this was an ugly and unpleasant incident to which the appellant reacted with unnecessary force towards an elderly lady.' Mrs Pearson was on her way to visit her husband in a care home when the incident happened. Scene: Yasin raced past the pensioner in All Saints Road in Burton (pictured), blocked the road and attacked . Attack: Pensioner Patricia Pearson was left with cuts to her head and lip when Usman Yasin thrashed her in the face in a road rage attack, Stafford Crown Court heard (pictured) But Miss Rebecca Wade, for Yasin, said he had just been to visit his mother who was in hospital with breast cancer. 'He was clearly irritated at the slow driving and stopping and starting of the complainant. It was she who got out of her car [but] his reaction was completely unjustified and caused her injury which he deeply regrets.' She said Yasin had never been in trouble before and this was wholly out of character. 'He has been vilified within the community and while you would expect a significant level of outrage, this has gone beyond, the case has been all over the national press.' She said if he went to jail, Yasin would lose his job in a fast food restaurant. In quashing the prison sentence, Recorder Mr Kevin Hegarty QC said: 'We have looked at the circumstances operating on your mind at the time and the references from your friends. We have regard to your hard-working nature, holding down two jobs, and we have come to the conclusion that the appropriate penalty is a community order.' Yasin had earlier told the magistrates: 'I am very remorseful. She’s the same age as my grandma. If I had taken a second to think and had just driven on I wouldn’t be here today.'","Patricia Pearson was punched in the head and mouth by Usman Yasin .

"A Seattle hip-hop artist has apparently shot himself dead after writing a series of tragic Twitter messages detailing his misery and how he was going to kill himself. Freddy E, 22, died on Saturday from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The King County medical examiner's office said an autopsy would be performed on Monday to confirm the cause. Before his death, the performer, who was born Frederick Eugene Buhl, tweeted a long string of messages, beginning with: 'Annnd, my day is ruined.' 'If there's a God then He's calling me . back home. This barrel never felt so good next to my dome. It's cold . & I'd rather die than live alone,' he tweeted. 'It's... all... bad... y'all. *puts finger around trigger*' Tragic: Hip hop artist Freddy E died from an apparent self-inflicted gun shot wound on Saturday after a writing desperate tweets. One of his fans posted this picture of him brandishing a gun, right, to Facebook . Freddy E, who uploaded pictures to his Twitter account showing him partying on the day of his death, then told his family members that he loved them before posting his final tweet: 'I'm sorry.' While investigations into his death continue, MTV reported that many fans were accusing Toronto rapper Honey Cocaine for causing the heartbreak that led Freddy E to take his life. Cocaine, who herself was shot last year after a show in Nebraska, took to Twitter to argue that there was a connection between their relationship and his suicide. 'To say I caused what happened is ignorance,' she wrote. 'You know nothing about our . friendship or the story, hate me if you feel. We loved each other. We . were homies. We had a bond and a connection. Final messages: Freddy E wrote a series of tragic tweets on Saturday before apparently taking his life .

Play your cards right and keep your soul pure cuz you can be a victim in a second.' While the exact nature of their friendship is not known, he praised her on his Facebook page late last month and described how they were in constant contact. 'Love': Some fans said he took his life over a failed relationship with Toronto rapper Honey Cocaine, pictured, yet she called the claims 'ignorance' and maintained they were good friends . 'I talk to Honey damn near every day,' he wrote. 'I text her. She calls me. We talk on the phone for hours. I've met some of her family and she's met some of mine. We call each . other by our birth names. I'd take a bullet for her, as would she take . one for me. I actually know her.' On a video posted earlier this month, he added: 'Honey, you're one amazing individual. Someone doesn't have to be in your life very long for them to leave a huge impact, and she definitely did that. 'She's beautiful, ambitious, passionate about her craft. Seriously... I love that girl.' As fans flocked to his Facebook page to pay their respects, Freddy E's family did the same.

"There is no clear link between passive smoking and lung cancer, American scientists have claimed. Researchers from Stanford University say their findings add to a body of evidence which shows that while smoking cigarettes is strongly linked to cancer, passive smoking is not. Their large U.S. study of more than 76,000 women did not find a link between the disease and secondhand smoke. Only people who live in the same house as a smoker for over 30 years might be more likely to develop lung cancer, they say. Scientists from Stanford University claim only people living with a smoker for over 30 years might be more likely to develop lung cancer . ‘The fact that passive smoking may not be . strongly associated with lung cancer points to a need to find other . risk factors for the disease [in nonsmokers],’ said Ange Wang, a medical . student at Stanford University, who presented the study at the meeting . of American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Researchers from the university and other institutions examined data from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study to come up with their controversial findings. Data for 76,304 participants about passive smoking exposure in childhood, the adult home and work for was studied. Of those that took part, 901 people developed lung cancer over 10.5 years of follow-up. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute said the incidence of lung cancer was 13 times higher in current smokers and four times higher in former smokers than those who have never smoked cigarettes. Unsurprisingly, the risk of the disease for both current and former smokers depended on their level of exposure. The study claims the incidence of lung cancer was 13 times higher in current smokers and four times higher in former smokers than those who have never smoked cigarettes . However, among the women who had never smoked and those who were exposed to secondhand smoke, there was not any ‘significant’ statistical increase in lung cancer risk . ‘The only category of exposure that showed a trend toward increased risk was living in the same house with a smoker for 30 years or more,’ the researchers claimed. While the latest study might surprise many, it is not the first research to come to the same conclusion. Writing for The Telegraph, author and journalist James Delingpole pointed out that between 1959 and 1989, two staunch anti-smoking campaigners called James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat surveyed 118,094 Californians in a bid to prove that smoking had damaging side effects to smokers’ nearest and dearest. However, they reportedly discovered that . exposure to ‘environmental tobacco’ or secondhand smoke, did not . significantly increase a person’s risk of lung cancer or heart disease – . even if they had been exposed for long periods of time. The large U.S. study of more than 76,000 women did not find a link between the disease and secondhand smoke . Mr Delingpole also said that the World Health Organisation came to a similar conclusion in 1998 after a seven-year study, as well as the Greater London Assembly and the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. But despite a growing body of evidence, politicians still went ahead with the smoking ban between 2006 and 2007 in the UK. Epidemiologist Dr Geoffrey Kabat, an advisor to the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said the latest study does not come as a surprise. He told ACSH: ‘The association is weak and inconsistent.’ ‘We should not overstate the weak and uncertain association [of lung cancer] with passive smoking and should be looking for other, larger risk factors for lung cancer occurring in never smokers.'","Scientists from Stanford University claim only people living with a smoker for over 30 years might be more likely to develop lung cancer .

"FDA says antibacterial soaps could be at best, ineffective and at worst, a threat to public health (stock image) The Food and Drug Administration said today there is no evidence that antibacterial chemicals used in liquid soaps and washes help prevent the spread of germs, and there is some evidence they may pose health risks. The agency said it is revisiting the safety of chemicals like triclosan in light of recent studies suggesting they can interfere with hormone levels and spur the growth of drug-resistant bacteria. The government's preliminary ruling lends new credence to longstanding warnings from researchers who say the chemicals are, at best, ineffective and at worst, a threat to public health. Under its proposed rule released Monday, the agency will require manufacturers to prove that their antibacterial soaps and body washes are safe and more effective than plain soap and water. Manufacturers will have a year to prove it after the FDA said: 'To put it simply, we need to collect additional information from the companies that make these products so that consumers can be confident about their effectiveness and about their safety.' If companies cannot demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their products, they would have to be reformulated, relabeled or possibly removed from the market. The agency will take comments on its proposal before finalizing it in coming months. 'Due to consumers' extensive exposure to the ingredients in antibacterial soaps, we believe there should be a clearly demonstrated benefit from using antibacterial soap to balance any potential risk,' said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's drug center. 'The proposed rule covers only those antibacterial soaps and washes that are used with water. It does not apply to hand sanitizers, hand wipes or antibacterial soaps that are used in health care setting such as hospitals', the FDA said in their blog. They aim to have their final rule by September 2016. The agency's proposal comes more than 40 years after the agency was first tasked with evaluating triclosan and similar ingredients. At least 2,000 different soap products contain triclosan or some other antimicrobial agent and it is also used in toothpaste to kill germs that cause gum disease, the FDA's Dr. Sandra Kweder said. FDA first tasked started evaluating triclosan 40 years ago - which is an ingredient in antibacterial soaps . Ultimately, the government agreed to publish its findings only after a three-year legal battle with the environmental group, Natural Resources Defense Council, which accused the FDA of delaying action on triclosan. The chemical is found in an estimated 75 percent of antibacterial liquid soaps and body washes sold in the U.S. The FDA's preliminary rule only applies to personal hygiene products, but it has implications for a $1 billion industry that includes thousands of antibacterial products, including kitchen knives, toys, pacifiers and toothpaste. Most of the research surrounding triclosan's safety involves animal studies, which cannot always be applied to humans. But some scientists worry the chemical can disrupt hormones in humans too, raising the risk of infertility, early puberty and other developmental problems. Other experts are concerned that routine use of antibacterial chemicals like triclosan is contributing to a surge in drug-resistant germs, or superbugs, that render antibiotics ineffective. In March 2010, the European Union banned the chemical from all products that come into contact with food, such as containers and silverware.","Chemicals are, at best, ineffective, and at worst, a threat to public heath .

"Burst his bubble: Jacksonville Jaguars starting cornerback Dwayne Gratz missed practice Monday after being arrested on two misdemeanor charges in Miami . A player for the Jaguars cornerback Dwayne Gratz found himself into a sticky situation early Sunday morning as he tried to pay for items at a grocery story with chewing gum. The second-year player didn't have any cash on him so he attempted to use bubble gum to pay for several items at a grocery store at the Ocean Reef Suites in Miami Beach, Florida. Refusing to take no for an answer, Gratz then began to argue with an employee at the store and then refused to leave the store. It caused a such disturbance that caused other customers to leave the store and the police had to be called. Officers with Miami Beach police say Gratz had bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol. They him to leave the store several times but he told police: 'No. I'm not leaving.' Gratz was ultimately arrested just before 6 a.m. and charged with disorderly intoxication and trespassing after a warning, both misdemeanors. He spent the following night in jail and was not released until Monday morning, missing team practice.

"Animal rights group PETA has been accused of stealing a family's beloved dog, driving away and then killing it by the pet's distraught owners. Surveillance footage appears to show the animal rights group taking away Maya – a Chihuahua – from the front porch of her family's trailer in Parksley, Virginia. And according to Wilbur Cerate, whose daughter has been distraught since Maya left, two PETA representatives knocked on his door three days later to tell him his dog had been killed. Scroll down for video . Taken: Maya, the beloved chihuahua of the Cerate family in Parksley, Virginia, was reportedly taken by PETA representatives . Caught on camera: Wilbur Cerate recorded this footage of a van pulling up outside his house and a person walking away carrying something . Angry: Wilbur Cerate (pictured) reported PETAto police, but criminal charges were later dropped . By way of consolation, they offered the family a fruit basket, WAVY-TV reported. Cerate said: 'My chihuahua, when she sees my car, she come to me. That Saturday she did not come.' 'I was angry. I understand they pick up my dog, [sic] if it was in a tree or another place, but this is in my house.' Footage dated October 18 shows a PETA van pulling up to house's driveway. A woman is seen getting out, approaching the home, then leaving moments later with something in her arms. Despite dozens of requests for comment from local and national media, the group is yet to issue a statement on Maya's removal and death. Cerate reported PETA to the police, and the local sheriff filed larceny charges. Virginia has specific provisions in law for the theft of dogs or other domesticated animals. Silence: Peta has refused to respond to repeated request to explain the alleged actions . But after the case was passed on to the commonwealth attorney's office to handle, it was dropped because the evidence was not strong enough. PETA has a history of killing large percentages of the animals in its possession – a process it defends because it claims to be the 'shelter of last resort'. On its website, a statement says: 'When impoverished families cannot afford to pay a veterinarian to let a suffering and/or aged animal leave this world, PETA will help. 'When an aggressive, unsocialized dog has been left to starve at the end of a chain with a collar grown into his neck and his body racked with mange, PETA will spare him from dying slowly and miserably in someone's backyard.' But annual reports on PETA's track record caring for animals show that more than 97 per cent of creatures in its care were killed since 1998. Some 1,792 such animals were put to death at its headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2013 alone, pushing the total death toll, which has risen further since, beyond 31,000.","Family in Parksley, Virginia, say their chihuahua, Maya, was taken away .

"He plays a care home resident who witnesses a violent death in his first leading TV drama role in more than 20 years. And for Michael Palin it proved to an opportunity to reflect on how he would want to be looked after in old age – and the Monty Python star is adamant he does not want to leave his own home. Palin, 71, plays Tom Patfitt, a frail old Yorkshireman in the upcoming BBC supernatural thriller Remember Me. His character is vulnerable and solitary among well-meaning strangers but it is not an experience Palin would wish to repeat. Michael Palin plays Tom Patfitt, a frail Yorkshireman in the upcoming BBC supernatural thriller Remember Me . Commenting on the care of the elderly and the 'connection' with their lives that they lose when placed in a home, the star said: 'My mother never went into a home. My mother-in-law, who is over 100, has not gone into a home. 'My father was in a home for a bit, and however enlightened the people and friendly the care, I just was aware that he had lost something. 'And I know that if I was taken away from my home to go and live somewhere else, even if I needed the treatment, a whole part of my life would have gone; my connection with the past and all the objects that I've collected. Keeping people in their own home environment for as long as possible is really important.' Mr Palin said playing a man 10 years older than him made him aware of his mortality, pictured with wife Helen . Playing an old man 10 years older than him has made Palin aware of his mortality. He told Radio Times: 'I suppose, I looked at Tom and thought, 'I'm not going to be like that'. Undoubtedly the years go by, I'm aware that I read the medical pages more carefully, follow the great statins debate and that kind of thing – but to be honest, it seems to me my life is much more enjoyable, certainly better organised, now than it was when I was young. I think I have benefited, as I approach my 70s, from the jolts and jars of earlier ages.' The admission of Palin's character to a care home on the Yorkshire Moors triggers a string of chilling events. Apparitions emerge, linked to his past and, on his first day at the home, he's the only witness to the mysterious death of a social worker. Palin admits it was his love of ghost stories that attracted him to the role – that and the opportunity to return to his place of birth. 'I'm not interested in the supernatural in the sense that I go to mediums and that sort of stuff. Nor have I ever seen a ghost or had any kind of psychic experience. But I'm interested just because so many other people have had these kind of experiences. I think that in a good supernatural story, the most shocking moments are not always when the ghost goes, 'Woo!' Something just happens to make you think, 'God, this is terrible'.' He told Radio Times: 'I suppose, I looked at Tom and thought, 'I'm not going to be like that' The three-part drama was filmed around Scarborough and Huddersfield and near where Palin was born - providing him with a chance to reminisce: 'Any excuse, I try to get back to Sheffield. I find London, where I've lived for 50 years or so, exciting, vibrant, stimulating – all those words – but it's almost as if London is so vast that you can't really get a sense of the city. 'When you're in Sheffield you can see the hills around you and there's a real sense of what Sheffield was – a big industrial city. There's a definite identity still, which goes right through all the people I know from Sheffield, rich or poor. They're proud of Sheffield, in a slightly stroppy sort of way. 'So when I go to Sheffield, I look around at the stone walls and the hills and I know where I am. Whereas in London, I feel kind of rootless.' Scarborough, on the other hand, was 'an absolute revelation,' said Palin. 'I'm embarrassed to say it, as a Yorkshire-man, but I had only ever spent about one afternoon in this amazingly beautiful place. I keep thinking to myself that I ought to explore a bit more closer to home, because when I do go round the UK, it's really beautiful. And not to know it better is really rather shameful.' Palin has not played a leading role in a TV drama since starring as a politically conflicted headmaster in Alan Bleasdale's GBH in 1991 in which Robert Lindsay co-starred. Since then he has gone on to present several travel documentaries including Brazil With Michael Palin and voice Ernie in Arthur Christmas. Palin, who is married to Helen and has three children, became a household name with the Pythons. Earlier this year he reunited with Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese to return to the stage for a string of Monty Python shows at London's The O2 after 30 years. But given his age he is no longer as driven and competitive as he used to be: 'One of the great things about getting older, is that you just don't feel as competitive any more.In my 20s and 30s, I was really competitive, all the time. Now I think the work I've done, I've done. Judge it one way or the other. Now it's time to relax.'","Michael Palin, 71, is adamant he does not want to leave his own home .

"Families will be paying almost £300 a year in green energy taxes by 2020. The levy will more than double until a quarter of every pound spent on electricity goes on wind, solar, nuclear or home insulation schemes. Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted last night that households will be better off thanks to the benefits of electricity-saving initiatives. But families will be able to claw the money back only if they buy more efficient domestic appliances and boilers. The average power bill is now £1,267 – with £112 of that going on green taxes, including an £18 wind farm subsidy. By 2020, green taxes will have risen by more than 150 per cent, ensuring each family contributes £286, according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change. It reckons that by then households will be saving £452 a year by taking up schemes to lower energy use and by switching to more efficient kettles, fridges and TVs. The ministry also hopes smart meters, which track energy consumption, will alter consumer behaviour and lower consumption. But John Constable, of the charity Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘DECC is clearly embarrassed by the terrifying costs of its ever-growing range of green policies, and is covering up with a whitewash of wildly optimistic assumptions about energy efficiency. Increase: According to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, green taxes will have risen by more than 150 per cent by 2020, funding wind energy and other renewable schemes . Savings: The DECC reckons that by 2020 households will be saving £452 a year by taking up schemes to lower energy use, such as solar panels, and using more efficient goods . ‘If electricity prices increase by a third, as DECC admits they will, it is vanishingly unlikely that better dishwashers, kettles, and fridges, even assuming households can afford them, can cancel out the increases and deliver lower bills.’ Mr Davey said his projected savings would mean that households would end up paying £166 less than if the green policies had not been introduced in the first place. ‘Global gas price hikes are squeezing households,’ he added. ‘We are doing all we can to offset these global energy price rises and, while we have more to do, this new study shows that our policies are putting a cushion between global prices and the bills we all pay. Claims: Energy Secretary Ed Davey said his projected savings would mean that households would end up paying £166 less than if the green policies had not been introduced in the first place . ‘The analysis shows our strategy of shifting to alternatives like renewables, and of being smarter with how we use energy, is helping those that need it most save money on their bills. ‘The poorest who take advantage of the help that is available through the initiatives we have on offer stand to make the highest savings, from the warm home discount to our new regulation on energy firms to force them to improve the energy efficiency of fuel poor households.’ DECC claims ‘the large majority of households’ will benefit and even those that do not add insulation or take advantage of energy rebates will be £15 better off. Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, said last night: ‘The Government’s underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families’ energy bills is shameful. ‘At a time when hard-pressed families and pensioners are seeing their incomes squeezed, only this out-of-touch Government could expect people to fork out thousands of pounds on new TVs, fridge freezers and washing machines just to save a few pounds every few months on their energy bill.’ DECC admitted green policies had added £22 to household bills over the past two years. Household energy consumption has fallen since 2005, with gas usage dropping by a fifth and electricity demand down by 11 per cent. The drop is partly attributed to energy efficiency measures, but is also a result of belt-tightening, both of which the Government expects to continue. By 2020, DECC estimates that householders will have replaced 12million boilers with more efficient models. Criticism: John Constable, of the charity Renewable Energy Foundation, said: 'DECC is clearly embarrassed by the terrifying costs of its ever-growing range of green policies' Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘The Government must ensure that the savings to consumers they have estimated will flow from their energy policies, become a reality. That will require more transparency and scrutiny of their plans and more practical help for people to make their homes energy efficient. Shameful: Caroline Flint, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'The Government's underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families' energy bills is shameful' ‘Effective competition in both the wholesale and retail energy markets will also help keep prices in check, but the Government’s plans for reform don’t yet go far enough to give people confidence that the price they are paying for their energy is a fair one.’ Under European climate change targets, around a third of our electricity will have to be generated by renewable energy sources by 2020. Mr Davey said: ‘The analysis underlines the importance of pressing ahead with the range of steps we’re taking to decarbonise and insulate our economy from excessive reliance on imported gas.’Meanwhile, green taxes on business will double, the Treasury admitted last night. Total green taxes – including only those mainly designed to change behaviour – will rise from £2.5billion to £5.6billion by the time of the 2015 election. They are then forecast to carry on rising to £5.9billion by 2017/8. The figures released to Parliament include the cost of the climate change levy, the aggregates levy, the landfill tax and the EU’s environmental trading scheme. They also include the new carbon price floor – a price per ton of carbon emitted. Analysts warn that because it only applies in the UK it will force energy intensive firms to move abroad. The combined cost of the measure and the climate change levy is due to rocket from £600million this year to £2.4billion in 2015/6. Increase: Total green taxes - including only those mainly designed to change behaviour - will rise from £2.5billion to £5.6billion by the time of the 2015 election . But the figures do not include other ‘revenue raising’ measures, which are sometimes credited with having a ‘green’ effect, such as fuel duty. The Treasury said green taxes would rise as a proportion of total taxation from 0.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent. Economic Secretary Sajid Javid said the Coalition was ‘on track’ to meet a commitment to increase the proportion of revenue from green taxes. Energy price tariffs are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers constantly battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage . of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year . to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year . will save you significant amounts. If you have never switched suppliers, or haven't switched for an extended period of time, then now is the time to do it. The cheapest rates are usually offered via online tariffs, so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. And, suppliers tend to charge more for electricity to those customers who live in their 'home' region - the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly before energy deregulation. So switching away will almost always save you money. Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.

"Giancarlo Stanton has agreed to an eye-popping contract extension worth $325 million over 13 years with Major League Baseball's Miami Marlins, the most lucrative deal in U.S. professional sport. It means the 25-year-old two-time All Star will earn more than $50,000 every time he bats for the Florida team and over the span of the deal, will make $2,853.88 an hour. 'This is a landmark day,' Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria told MLB.com by phone on Monday. 'I'm happy for the city. I'm happy for him. And I'm thrilled for baseball. Star: Giancarlo Stanton has agreed to an eye-popping contract extension worth $325 million over 13 years with Major League Baseball's Miami Marlins, the most lucrative deal in U.S. professional sport . 'We have a player who is committed to us, and we've committed to him for the life of his career. The deal includes a no-trade clause and Stanton, who is aged 25 and led the National League (NL) with 37 home runs last season, can opt out after six years, Loria said. The mind-boggling move more than triples the previously biggest contract reached by the Marlins -- $106 million spread over six years for Jose Reyes in 2012. The deal also exceeds the previous MLB record of $292 million over 10 years agreed by Miguel Cabrera with the Detroit Tigers in March. 'It's great for this franchise and the city,' said Loria. 'Besides being a terrific athlete, he's a first-class young man. I've loved watching him play, but I love this kid. He's just a special young man.' There will be an official announcement at the Marlins' ballpark on Wednesday, according to the report on the league's website. A second-round pick by the Marlins in the 2007 MLB Draft, Stanton is one of the most feared power hitters in baseball and, despite playing his home games in the spacious surrounds of Marlins Park, has blasted 154 career homers. Wealth: It means the 25-year-old two-time All Star will earn more than $50,000 every time he bats for the Florida team and over the span of the deal, will make $2,853.88 an hour . He led the NL in slugging percentage (.555) for the 2014 season, finishing with a .288 batting average when his season ended prematurely after he was hit by a pitch in the face by Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Mike Fiers. Stanton earned his first NL Silver Slugger Award and became the first Marlins player to win the Hank Aaron Award, which recognizes the top offensive performer in each league and is voted on by fans and a panel of Hall of Fame players.

"A pair of University of Tennessee football players have been suspended from the team after it was discovered they'd been named as suspects in a rape and sexual assault case. The school's Athletics Department announced via Twitter that linebacker A.J. Johnson and defensive back Michael Williams had been suspended from all team-related activities. Police indicate that the alleged incident took place shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday morning at a Woodlands apartment complex, as reported by two 19-year-old women. The school's Athletics Department announced via Twitter that defensive back Michael Williams and linebacker A.J. Johnson had been suspended from all team-related activities while a rape and sexual assault investigation was underway . WBIR reports that one victim alleged she had been raped by two UT students while the other claimed to have been sexually assaulted. Both women were examined at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. While one of the alleged victims was a student the other was visiting a friend in Knoxville and has since chosen to return to her home in Florida and will not press charges at this time. Neither of the players have been charged with a crime. According to attorney James A. H. Bell, aggravated rape is a class A felony with mandatory prison sentencing but there must be evidence of unlawful sexual penetration. Without such evidence a suspect may be charged with sexual battery. 'When you have an actual rape charge, don't overlook the fact that you will have a lot more forensics such as semen, or DNA, and that type of thing,' Bell said. A wait for DNA evidence could mean a long investigation. Police indicate that the alleged incident took place shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday morning at a Woodlands apartment complex, as reported by two 19-year-old women . 'Right now in the process of gathering all information,' coach Butch Jones told reporters. 'Once we have all that appropriate information we will act in a very decisive matter which we have proven over time to do here at the University of Tennessee.' Johnson was arrested in February and charged with buying alcohol for people under 21 and for resisting arrest. However a judge dropped the charges when the linebacker made a plea agreement. While one of the alleged victims was a student the other was visiting a friend in Knoxville and has since chosen to return to her home in Florida and will not press charges at this time . This is Johnson's senior year with the program. 'I had only two classes and I already heard a bunch about it,' said UT student Stephen Rolfes. Radio host Dave Hooker notes the timing of the investigation is crucial for the players. 'I think if these allegations are true, AJ Johnson would have a heck of a price to pay. Because he is five months away from the NFL draft and that's where he can become a millionaire,' he said.","Linebacker A.J.

"This is the terrifying moment a fisherman was almost wrestled into the sea by a gigantic fish. The mystery man was dangling his arm over the edge of a jetty, believed to be somewhere in Florida, as he tempted the fish with a morsel of bait. Then, much to the horror of screaming onlookers, the monster leaps from the water and latches on to his arm, seemingly trying to drag him back to the water. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This is the terrifying moment a fisherman was almost wrestled into the sea by a gigantic fish as he tried to tempt it with a piece of bait . The man, who it is believed had been trying to catch the fish by hand, was almost pulled into the sea by the creature. As he tries to move back (right) the fish refuses to let go, instead latching on to his arm . Video taken by an onlooker shows the pair wrestling the length of the jetty with the fish refusing to let go of the man's arms as he desperately tries to free himself. After a dramatic tussle - which sees the man knocked to the floor by the gigantic catch - he is helped free by two other men. Eventually the fish - believed to be a tarpon - flips back into the water victorious, as the man walks away, visibly relieved, but also appearing to be dripping with blood. It is believed the man had been trying to catch the fish without the use of a rod. The pair are filmed wrestling the length of the jetty, with the fish - believed to be a tarpon - refusing to give up. Eventually the man is helped free by two others and, victorious, the fish flips back into the waters . Tarpon are known by fishermen as the 'silver king'. It is an extremely strong fish with a huge mouth which has extremely small densely packed villiform - or teeth. They can reach 2.5m (eight ft) in length and weigh 160kg (350lb) and while it is not eaten, the fish are mainly caught for sport. It is not the first time tarpon have been known to attack. There have been many incidents at docks in Florida when people who have been trying to hand feed them have been knocked off their feet by the quick fish.","Man held bait above the water while lying on a jetty, believed to be in Florida .

"It’s one of the world’s most bizarre and best kept secrets of Indonesia. In the world’s largest Muslim majority country, thousands of Indonesian pilgrims travel to the Gunung Kemukus, otherwise known as ‘Sex Mountain’ in Central Java, to have sex with strangers as part of a religious ritual . Dateline video journalist, Patrick Abboud, whose story is set to show on SBS, got to uncover the incredible life on top of the mountain, given unusual access to what goes on. Mr Abboud says every 35 days you have to perform sex seven consecutive times for the ritual to work. ‘It’s a pretty bizarre story. A few years ago I read a piece about it and looked into it, it took a while to get there,’ he said. And what he found he described as ‘incredibly surprising’. Scroll down for video . Sex Mountain involved thousands of people flocking to the mountain to have sex with strangers as part of a ritual . Dateline video journalist, Patrick Abboud was unable to cover the bizzare ritual where people have sex in hope it brings them good fortune and luck . ‘More shock of the sheer size of the place and thousands of people, up to 8,000 on a busy night,’ said Mr Abboud. ‘It was hard to make sense of it, after being there it took a few weeks to digest.’ Dateline video journalist, Patrick Abboud (pictured) covered the bizzare story of the Sex Mountain and found it interesting and awkward . The ancient ritual dates back to the 16th century and is a regular meeting of ritual believers participating in sexual acts, with the view that it brings good luck and fortune. From married men, housewives, government officials and prostitutes, there’s a variety of people who participate. And for a country and religion where sex out of wedlock is taboo, Mr Abboud says the idea of a mountain top sex ritual for Muslims in Indonesia seems very strange. ‘Back in the 16th century, a young Indonesian prince had an affair with his step mother,’ he said. ‘They ran away to the mountain and had sex and mid coitus they were caught, killed and buried. ‘There is a shrine there now and because they didn’t get to finish the act, others believe that if you do, fortune will come to you, most people like poor farmers who want to get ahead in life.’ He says he saw no Westerners there but people come from all over Indonesia to see if their luck would change. ‘It’s a Javanese ritual which is very different to the Muslim world, very different to everywhere else in Indonesia, the beliefs are a blend of Islamic, Hindi and Buddhism,’ he said. So popular the ritual has now turned into a tourist attraction for locals with the government charging people to go there, with stalls and even buskers. ‘It’s a bit of a carnival.’ ‘It’s contradictory, the government knows adultery is happening yet they’re preaching something different and turning a blind eye,’ he said. While Mr Abboud, who was fascinated by the ritual, said the only problem is that there is more men than women and in turn it has become prime territory for commercial sex workers. He even got propositioned himself by a sex worker whilst filming but said he quickly declined the offer. He said seeing inside doings of the religious ritual, it seems very controversial. Back in the days people used to have sex out in the open but now there are a number of huts that people can sex in behind closed doors . 'I think there's a growing contradiction with Sex Mountain, there's the prostitution, so how it is possible this is all being condoned by the government and religious leaders,' he said. 'The one thing is the problem of sexually transmitted diseases, there's health clinics set up at mountain.' 'I talked to a doctor and he said most sex workers have sexual diseases and men don’t use condoms, so HIV is on the up.' The Dateline video journalist was lucky enough to follow some pilgrims to the mountain and talked to them about their experiences. 'It took a lot of convincing, as it is adulterous, I followed them, some came by boat or motorbike, from right across Indonesia and I had access to friends and people before they got there.' So popular the ritual has now turned into tourist attraction for locals with the government charging people to get, with stalls buskers . Mr Abboud followed a female pilgrim called Mardiyah who was a widow and for two years had struggled financially. Living in a small Javanese town, she had just completed her mission of having sex seven times when he was there. 'She said business become better and made more money, it's maybe proof it does work,' he said. 'I met a male pilgrim called Gepeng, and his friends but he didn't want to kiss and tell.' 'One of his friends said they went for fun and karaoke, another said he does go for the sex ritual but didn't want to say too much because he didn't want his wife to find out, but felt his life would turn around.' He also described another pilgrim he met that also didn't want to talk too much about it in fear of his wife finding out. 'It's Incredibly hard to get women talking, obviously cheating on their husband.' While he found the incredibly bizarre sex ritual confronting and rather 'awkward' to film and talk about, he said there was nothing unsafe or dangerous about it. 'Quite beautiful prayers, they give beautiful offerings of flowers, at the grave of shrine people get teary and pray for hours on end.' 'Never felt in any threat, it was a nice environment.' He did however feel what needed to be mentioned is that the religion was not specific of Islam. 'It's not something to demonise the religion,' he said, 'it's not strictly Islam as we know it.' 'You'll never find any ritual like this in any part of the Muslim world and Indonesia, Javanese interpretation is much more liberal.' Mr Abboud's story airs on Dateline Monday night at 9.30pm on SBS ONE.","Dateline journalist Patrick Abboud got to uncover the interesting sex rituals on 'Sex Mountain' in Central Java, Indonesia .

"The hotshot executive hired to help turn around the Today show’s slump in the ratings is departing less than three month after taking over. Former ESPN executive Jamie Horowitz 'was not the right fit' according to a staff memo sent on Monday by NBC News President Deborah Turness. Once the nation's leading network morning show, Today has fallen behind ABC's Good Morning America in the battle for ratings over the past two years. Out: ESPN executive Jamie Horowitz, brought to NBC to take charge of the Today show, is exiting after less than three months . When the Horowitz’s hire was first announced in May, Turness said he would push the Today brand and look for new opportunities online and with events. But show insiders told The Wrap that Horowitz managed to alienate both presenters and producers alike during his brief tenure after he sought to pit staff against each other and create an unsettled environment. One source said he had invoked the reality show Survivor in conversations with staffers, asking them which producers they think should be ‘voted off the island’ (aka fired). 'There was a lot of insecurity and instability created when he walked in the door. He would pit anchors against anchors and producers against producers and it created a lot of internal problems,' another source told the New York Post. 'Passed over': Morales, far left, has been at the Today show since 2006 but Savannah Guthrie, in pink, joined the show in 2012 and took the top anchor spot. They are pictured with Matt Lauer and Al Roker . Overseeing: NBC News President Deborah Turness broke the news of Horowitz's departure on Monday . ‘He would ask the staff who they wanted to be their seniors and who were the weakest links in the organization.’ Horowitz wasn't supposed to officially start running the show until December 1, but had been on a 'listening tour' since September. His vision to topple GMA was not met favorably by the show's anchors, while producers were left fearing for their jobs. Horowitz was said to be completely caught off guard by the decision to let him go. In her memo to staff, Turness says Horowitz would be replaced in 'due course' and she will help oversee the show in the meantime. NBC News declined to comment on Horowitz's departure. Horowitz was president of original programming and production at ESPN. His TV career started with an entry-level position on NBC's Olympics team. The Today show continues to be rocked by reports of tensions on set. Last week it was reported that Natalie Morales is looking for new roles after falling out with fellow co-host Tamron Hall. Morales joined the Today team in 2006 as a national correspondent but she has missed out on being the top anchor, including when Ann Curry left in 2012. Following Curry's emotional exit after just a year in the job, she was replaced by Savannah Guthrie.

'I was watching TV last night because I wanted to look at Solange’s wedding dress, and I had to do two or three double-takes, like, ""Wait a minute - Beyonce is wearing my dress!""' she told the New York Daily News. 'My email is exploding. It’s such a compliment on so many levels. I’m really humbled by it. She could have worn any designer in the world, and the fact that she wore mine is just really incredible. And she’s one of my favorite musicians.'

The 24-year-old intruder demanded they drop their money and phones into his duffel bag. But many of the guests, who had just sat down and got out their purses, thought Lee's arrival was part of the game, First Coast News reported. One woman pushed his hand aside and insisted he was only holding a water pistol, according to news4jax.com. 'I felt this boldness come up in me and I just stood up and said, ""In the name of Jesus, get out of my house,"",' said Ms Hagler. 'And he said, ""I'm going to shoot somebody if you don't do what I say.""' Ms Hagler repeated her order and the other guests began chanting, 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.' The would-be thief quickly scanned the room and looked terrified before fleeing the scene, said the homeowner.

"Victoria's children's commissioner Bernie Geary has blasted Jamie Oliver, calling him 'a d***head' and cruel' for disciplining his daughter by feeding her one of the world's hottest chilis. The celebrity chef admitted on Monday that because 'you can't smack naughty kids' when one of his four young children became unruly or disrespectful, he would coat their sliced apple with a type of chili known as the Scotch bonnet. Scotch bonnets have a  rating on the Scoville scale, which measures chili heat, of 100,000 to 350,000, making them up to 140 times hotter than a normal chili pepper. Speaking with Radio 3AW's Neil Mitchell, Mr Geary said, 'He's a d***head Neil. It's just not appropriate to use cruelty as a form of discipline.' Mr Geary went on to say that Oliver's chili trick was a form of 'child abuse'. Scroll down for video . Victoria's children's commissioner Bernie Geary has blasted Jamie Oliver  (pictured, above) with wife, Jools and, from left, daughters Poppy, 12, Petal, 5, Daisy, 11, and four-year-old son Buddy . 'Way off the planet': After Jamie Oliver (above, left) admitted he used ultra-hot chilis to discipline his children when they were naughty, Victoria's children's commissioner, Bernie Geary (above, right) described him as 'cruel' and ' a d***head' 'This bloke, he should realise the influence he has as a high-profile public figure and a high-profile father,' Mr Geary said. 'If he's joking it's not even appropriate because some parents and families might think it's a legitimate or alternative way of disciplining children. He's way off the planet as far as I'm concerned.' Mr Geary was responding to Oliver's extraordinary confession about how he disciplines his children, saying on Monday, ‘I give them chillies for punishment. It is not very popular beating kids any more, it’s not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper. So you need a few options.' A scorcher: the 'Scotch bonnet' chili (pictured) that Jamie Oliver feeds his children is 140 hotter than a normal pepper . Oliver said he had once tricked his 12-year-old daughter into eating an ultra-hot Scotch Bonnet, much to the annoyance of his wife, Jools. At the BBC Good Food Show, Oliver said: ‘Poppy was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck. In my day I would have got a bit of a telling-off but you are not allowed to do that. ‘Five minutes later she thought I had forgotten and I hadn’t. She asked for an apple. I cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with Scotch Bonnet and it worked a treat. She ran up to mum and said, “This is peppery”. I was in the corner laughing. [Jools] said to me, “Don’t you ever do that again”.’ Mr Geary, who is Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People, said Oliver's role as an educator made his actions even more troubling. 'He purports to be a teacher and a role model and works with children. If he worked in a school in Victoria they'd sack him,' he said. 'If you were cruel to children in that way here in Victoria in a school you'd get sacked. It's a way of assaulting children. It's child abuse.' Given his struggle to impose order on daughters Poppy Honey Rosie, Daisy Boo Pamela, 11, and Petal Blossom Rainbow, five, and son Buddy Bear Maurice, four, perhaps it is no surprise Oliver is not keen to add to his family. He revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea, saying: ‘You know what she said last night? She is 40 in about ten days and I took her out and she goes, “OK are we going to have another kid then?” I said, “You what?”. The family pose together for the December issue of Red magazine, where the couple talk about family life . ‘The woman wants another baby. So watch this space. But with all the power in my body we are not having another baby.’ He admitted, however, that Mrs Oliver usually wins the arguments at home – even about food. He said: ‘My wife loves a destroyed steak. I have been with her since I was 18 years old, how romantic, but it is hard to keep loving someone when they want a well-done steak. I have tried to tell her but she is a very single-minded, dominant woman.’ The couple – who have a combined wealth of £240million – met when they were 17. The chef drove to a cinema, but crashed the car. He has joked she started dating him out of pity as a result. Mrs Oliver, a former model, has worked as her husband’s PA and now designs children’s clothing. Jamie Oliver, who was named as a Special Achievement Honouree at the LOVIE awards last week, said his wife Jools has asked whether they can have another child - their fifth - but the chef has said no .","Victoria's children's commissioner has called Jamie Oliver 'a d***head'

"The peer said he couldn't get excited by the current leaders or the visions they have . The peer who bankrolled Labour through the Blair and Brown years has condemned Ed Miliband as an ‘average’ politician with an uninspiring political vision. Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who has given more than £12 million to the Labour Party, says that he has no intention of donating to the party again. The multimillionaire businessman and philanthropist said of the labour leader: ‘In terms of political skills, I think he’s average. Average in the sense that I think Nick Clegg and David Cameron are pretty average. ‘None of the three leaders was in the “top bracket”, and did not compare with Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher,’ he told the Times. But the peer, part of the Sainsbury’s supermarket dynasty, denied that he had stopped funding Labour because David Miliband - who he had backed in the Labour leadership race in 2010 - was defeated by his brother. The comments come before the release of Lord Sainsbury’s new book, in which he makes the assertion that the economic policies of the Blair and Brown governments, in which he played a role, were flawed. In his book, Progressive Capitalism, he writes: ‘I believed the policies we [Labour] had developed in opposition would increase the prosperity of the country and create a fairer society. ‘But in government, I gradually came to realise that our thinking largely reflected the dominant neoliberal political economy of the time, which was not a useful basis for developing policies to achieve our goals.’ He continues:  ‘In retrospect the Labour government should have used the opportunity of a strongly growing economy to reduce the deficit.’ The peer denied that he had stopped funding Labour because David Miliband - who he had backed in the Labour leadership race in 2010 - was defeated by his brother Ed (left) The peer said he couldn’t get excited by the current leaders or the visions they have and that he could not suggest an alternative leader to Ed Miliband, because he ‘wouldn’t want to blight their careers by singling them out’. He said he has become less political following beginning his work with the Institute for Government, the charity he set up to improve Civil Service effectiveness, and as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, a role he assumed in 2011. ‘It’s much easier to do them if you’re not heavily involved in politics,’ he said. However, he insisted his has not become ‘apolitical’ and is still a member of the Labour Party. He continues to talk to them on ‘issues on policy and progressive capitalism. But I put that in a very different category from major contributions to the party,’ he said. And Lord Sainsbury denied that he withdrew funding from the Labour Party because Ed Miliband won the 2010 leadership contest. Although he made his last direct donation to Labour in April 2010, the peer has continued to fund Progress, a Blairite think-tank, and Movement for Change, which trains Labour activists in the UK. He has donated £1.3 million since May 2010, according to Electoral Commission records. Last summer, the GMB union called on Ed Miliband to outlaw Progress. ‘They made these various speeches but no one paid any attention to it, as far as I know,’ Lord Sainsbury said. ‘I guess it’s to do with the idea that Progress is a Blairite organisation which the trade unions should oppose.’ Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'This is further proof that a weak Ed Miliband is allowing Labour to be taken over and run by unions in their interest, rather than in the interests of the hardworking British people. 'It's no surprise that Ed Miliband's totally opposed to dealing with the deficit, fixing welfare or getting immigration under control when 81 per cent of his funding comes from union bosses. 'All Ed Miliband offers is the same old Labour solution that got us into this mess in the first place - more spending, more borrowing and more debt.'","Lord Sainsbury of Turville says Labour leader's political skills are 'average'

"One of the deepest mysteries in science - where all the antimatter went after the Big Bang and therefore why there’s matter at all in the universe  – is a step closer to being solved, claim CERN researchers. It comes because they’ve reached an important milestone in being able to make precision comparisons between atoms of ordinary matter and atoms of antimatter. ‘We’ve demonstrated that we can probe the internal structure of the antihydrogen atom,’ said team spokesman, Jeffrey Hangst, ‘and we’re very excited about that. We now know that it’s possible to design experiments to make detailed measurements of antiatoms.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Hi-tech: The CERN Alpha experiment uses cutting-edge equipment to trap antihydrogen atoms . Today, we live in a Universe that appears to be made entirely of matter, yet at the Big Bang, matter and antimatter would have existed in equal amounts. The mystery is that all the antimatter seems to have gone, leading to the conclusion that nature must have a slight preference for matter over antimatter. If antihydrogen atoms can be studied in detail they may provide a powerful tool for investigating this preference, as the results from CERN’s Alpha collaboration suggest. Hydrogen atoms consist of an electron orbiting a nucleus. By firing light at them the atoms can be excited, with the electrons jumping to higher orbits, and eventually relaxing back to their so-called ground state by emitting light. The frequency distribution of the light emitted forms a very precisely measured spectrum that, in the matter world, is unique to hydrogen. Pioneering: Professor Jeffrey Hangst at the Alpha experiment . Leap forward: Professor Hangst explained that his experiment means antimatter can now be better understood . Basic principles of physics say that antihydrogen should have an identical spectrum to hydrogen, and measuring this spectrum is the ultimate goal of the Alpha collaboration. ‘Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and we understand its structure extremely well,’ said Hangst. ‘Now we can finally begin to coax the truth out of antihydrogen. Are they different?  We can confidently say that time will tell.’ In a paper published today in Nature, Alpha reports the first, albeit modest, measurement of the antihydrogen spectrum. In the Alpha apparatus, antihydrogen atoms are trapped by a sophisticated arrangement of magnetic fields acting on the magnetic orientation of the antihydrogen atoms. By shining microwaves with a precisely tuned frequency on the antihydrogen atoms, the collaboration flips the antiatoms’ magnetic orientation, thereby liberating antihydrogen from the trap. When this happens, the antihydrogen meets ordinary matter and annihilates, leaving a characteristic pattern in particle detectors surrounding the trap. This measurement shows that it is possible to set up experiments in which the internal properties of antihydrogen atoms can be changed by shining microwaves on them. In the near future, Alpha will work at improving the precision of the microwave measurements, and undertake complementary measurements of the antihydrogen spectrum using lasers.","Milestone in comparing ordinary matter with antimatter has been reached, say experts .

"It has been reported that Robin Williams may have been affected by Parkinsonian . They are two of the most devastating conditions — but the cruel double whammy of both Parkinson’s and dementia affects around 100,000 Britons. These people have Parkinsonian symptoms — slow movement and problems with gait — as well as confusion, memory loss, hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia. They may get Parkinson’s first, then develop dementia a year or more later — known as Parkinson’s dementia. Or, if dementia is diagnosed before or at the same time as Parkinson’s symptoms develop, they are said to have ‘dementia with Lewy bodies’ — a type of dementia that shares symptoms with Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies are the same problem — the difference is the order of the symptoms. It’s been reported that the actor Robin Williams might have been affected by this ghastly disorder when he took his life this summer. He’d suffered from Parkinson’s for three years — then last week a leaked pathologist’s report revealed there was ‘diffuse Lewy body dementia’ in his brain. Lewy bodies are tiny clumps of abnormal proteins produced by the brain when its cells are not working properly. They cause memory problems, although these don’t tend to be as severe as with Alzheimer’s — which is linked to a build-up of the protein beta-amyloid. Another key difference is that Lewy body dementia affects regions of the brain responsible for vision, causing powerful hallucinations, nightmares and spatial-awareness problems. Studies suggest that up to 80 per cent of people with Parkinson’s will develop Parkinson’s dementia. Professor David Burn, clinical director of the charity Parkinson’s UK, says: ‘People with Parkinson’s will already have Lewy bodies in the bottom of the brain, which controls movement. 'In Parkinson’s dementia, the Lewy bodies spread up to areas involved in memory, cognition and vision. ‘For the patient with dementia with Lewy bodies, the problem starts at the top of the brain and spreads down — they tend to go to their doctor with cognitive problems, then develop Parkinson’s or get both simultaneously.’ In your 50s, the illness is more likely to start as Parkinson’s. Dementia with Lewy bodies usually affects people in their 70s, says Ian McKeith, professor of old-age psychiatry at Newcastle University and chairman of the Lewy Body Society. Diagnosis is usually via a brain scan that tests for dopamine, a chemical that is lower in people with Parkinson’s and Lewy body dementia. Symptoms vary — but it’s a harsh blow for patients, says Professor Burn. Margaret Kelly would agree. Her husband Reggie, 76, a father-of-three and former supermarket manager, was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia in 2009, when he was 71. Up to 80 per cent of people with Parkinson’s will develop Parkinson’s dementia . ‘Every form of Alzheimer’s is cruel, but I do think this is the cruellest,’ says Margaret, 75, from North-East London. ‘Reggie was such a fit man. Now he’s like a baby. He can’t speak and he’s so confused he doesn’t know me any more.’ Four years before his diagnosis, Reggie couldn’t move his legs away from the sink while washing up. Margaret then started noticing changes in his behaviour — he would become quiet and expressionless at times. A GP diagnosed depression, but antidepressants didn’t help. Reggie went on to develop a shuffling gait, and in 2006 a neurologist diagnosed Parkinson’s. Medication helped control those symptoms but in 2009 Reggie’s behaviour changed dramatically. ‘He became terribly aggressive,’ says Margaret. ‘He’d wreck the shed looking for a screwdriver. He’d never admit he couldn’t remember where it was.’ Memory tests showed signs of Lewy body dementia. Around this time, Reggie started having hallucinations, some of which were horrific. Since his 40s, he’d suffered with nightmares and restless leg syndrome — the urge to move your legs at night. It is thought there may be a link between sleep disturbances and Parkinson’s and Lewy bodies. The cause of Lewy body dementia is largely unknown but the risk increases with age. Both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s are slightly more common in men. Patients may be prescribed Parkinson’s medication and cholinesterase inhibitors, such as Aricept and Exelon. These particularly help with hallucinations, says Professor McKeith. Correct diagnosis is vital, as some Parkinson’s drugs can worsen hallucinations. The proportion of all dementia cases diagnosed as Lewy body dementia . Although dementia and Parkinson’s specialists are well aware of Lewy bodies dementia, GPs and the public are less so. A U.S. study found half of patients with Lewy body dementia saw the doctor more than ten times before diagnosis. Motor symptoms of Parkinson’s can mask cognitive issues. And hallucinations, delusions and movement problems aren’t usually associated with dementia, as Bridget Hunt discovered after her mother Rose developed Lewy body dementia. ‘We never thought it could be dementia because of the hallucinations,’ says Bridget, 60, of York. Rose started seeing things in her early 70s. Other symptoms included struggling to add up, shuffling, a tremor in her arm and spatial-awareness problems. At 80, she was finally diagnosed with Lewy body dementia. Aricept slowed the disease down, but her increasing disorientation is difficult to witness, says Bridget. While Rose still lives at home, Reggie moved to a care home in 2011 after a serious fall. Margaret, who is disabled, visits him every week. ‘I desperately want to take him home,’ she says. ‘He’s not the same man I knew but we’ve still got him.’ For more information and support, contact Alzheimer’s Research UK (0300 111 5555, alzheimersresearchuk.org) or Alzheimer’s Society (0300 222 11 22, alzheimers.org.uk).","Both Parkinson’s and dementia affects around 100,000 Britons .

"Three Royal Marines accused of executing a wounded prisoner in Afghanistan had been sickened by the Taliban hanging limbs of maimed comrades in trees as trophies, a court martial heard. Tensions had built up before the killing after insurgents paraded the body parts of close colleagues blown up by improvised explosive devices. The gruesome detail emerged as one of the commandos admitted he was ashamed of shooting the captured enemy in the chest at point-blank range with a 9mm pistol. Death scene: The court martial board watch footage of the shooting of a Taliban fighter. The hearing was told that tensions had built up before the killing after insurgents paraded the body parts of maimed Marines . But the experienced sergeant, who can only be identified as Marine A, insisted he believed the gunman was already dead when he pulled the trigger. He blamed lack of self-control and poor judgement for the ‘spur of the moment’ decision sparked by ‘pent-up emotions’. The three Marines – identified as A, B and C – are accused of murdering the prisoner during a patrol in Helmand on September 15, 2011. Marines B and C allegedly encouraged and assisted Marine A. All three deny the charges. They are said to have killed the seriously wounded prisoner, whose body has never been found, after an Apache attack helicopter pilot strafed him with cannon fire as he attacked a British base. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Marine A, 39, said ‘tensions and stress’ among the men of 42 Commando had increased in the run-up to the incident because of the frantic pace of operations. In one instance, a respected officer and a second colleague were killed and others badly wounded in a roadside bomb strike. Some of the injured men’s limbs were not recovered and were picked up by the Taliban and hung in trees as a ‘kind of trophy for the world to see’. He said that atrocity had ‘quite a harsh effect’ on the Marines. On the day of the alleged murder Marine A’s patrol was ordered to check the insurgent targeted in the helicopter attack. Hearing: Members of the defence legal team sit next to a blue screen erected in the courtroom to hide the identities of three Royal Marine Commandos accused of the murder of an un-named enemy combatant . Footage of the shooting was captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B, which has been played to the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire. It shows the insurgent – who had been armed with an AK47 assault rifle and a grenade – being dragged roughly across a field to the cover of trees. Marine A admitted this was ‘heavy-handed’.The sergeant, who has served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, is then filmed walking forward, bending down and shooting the detainee in the centre of his chest. As the Afghan spasms and gasps for breath, Marine A taunted: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’ He then turned to comrades and said: ‘I just broke the Geneva Convention.’ Yesterday Marine A accepted video footage of the incident suggested the man was ‘probably’ still alive when he pulled the trigger. But he insisted: ‘It was my belief that at the time I discharged my pistol he was dead.’ He claimed to be ‘very surprised’ when the prisoner began convulsing after the shooting. Poor judgement: Marine A told the court martial, sitting at the  Military Court Centre at Bulford, Wiltshire, that he believed the gunman was already dead and blamed a lack of self-control for the shooting . ‘He suddenly became very animated after I had discharged my firearm. I questioned if I was right. Had I made a mistake?’ Asked by his barrister, Anthony Berry, why he had shot an apparent corpse, Marine A said: ‘Stupid, lack of control, a momentary lapse of judgment.’ He denied the footage of him telling the insurgent to ‘shuffle off this mortal coil’ was evidence he knew he was alive, insisting the remark was ‘foolish bravado … something I’m not proud of’. He said he had believed he had broken the Geneva Convention because he had mistreated a body. The court martial heard that back at base he briefly discussed the incident with his comrades, telling them ‘I ****ed up there, lads’. But he did not talk about it again until he was arrested a year later because he was ‘ashamed of my actions’. He also said he treated a remark by Marine C that he should ‘pop’ the insurgent with a bullet to the head as a ‘throwaway comment …  dark humour’ used by troops as a ‘coping mechanism’. Marine A admitted he told a number of lies in interviews with the Royal Military Police. David Perry, prosecuting, said he had omitted the ‘one key and crucial’ piece of evidence in his first interview with investigators – that he had fired his pistol. The court martial continues.

No facebook for a year - $1,000 (£600) Clean roadkill for a year - $100,000 (£60,000) Become a radio tower repairman for a year - $1 million (£600,000) Shave entire body - $5.5 million (£3.3 million) Run coast to coast like Forrest Gump - $5.5 million (£3.3 million) Eat a doughnut from the New York Subway floor - $10 million (£6 million) Live with 300 spiders for three weeks - $100 million (£60 million) ‘You’d probably say a significant amount of money could get you to do something bizarre - but just how much?’ That was the crux of the Ebay Deals survey and some of the results were surprising to say the least. One of the questions was the minimum amount of money the participants would accept to give up Facebook for a year. According to the survey 22.9 per cent of males 55 to 64 years old said they wouldn’t stop using the social network even for over $10,000 (£6,000) a year - but 26.7 per cent of females aged 18 to 24 said they’d do it for just a dollar (60p). Meanwhile women were apparently more addicted to coffee than men, but both genders were less willing to give it up as they got older. Above are the results of the various questions that were posed to 1,000 people, with the number of people who answered directly below the percentages . EBay Deals says that some of the results were quite surprising. For example, men were more likely to give up coffee than women, while older people were generally quite reticent when it came to giving up digital services like Netflix and Hulu or social media networks like Facebook . Most age groups were willing to give up video streaming services like Netflix and Hulu for a year if they were given less than $10,000 (£6,000) - except for men over 65, where only 50 per cent said they’d do it for that amount. Meanwhile under two per cent of women said they’d travel to Mars on a one-way trip for under $10,000 (£6,000), compared to over 20 per cent of men aged 18 to 24. The company then also compiled the average amount of money people would do something for. The running of the bulls, for example, saw most female age groups refuse to do it for less than $55 million. Men, meanwhile, would mostly do it for under $550,000 (£330,000) And while women are thought to be more inclined to love cats than than men, it was the males who were more willing to live with 50 cats for a year for less money. Some things, however, were too much for people to handle. When it came to swimming with sharks with no cage, or doing pullups from the top of a 20-storey building, for most people there was no amount of money that would persuade them to do it. This flipbook shows various comparisons within the results, with some surprising conclusions from the survey .","eBay Deals asked 1,000 people a series of 23 questions .

"Fred Phelps, who founded the Westboro Baptist Church known for its anti-gay sentiments and protests at soldiers' funerals, has died, his son said on Thursday. The 84-year-old, who founded the church is 1955, died of natural causes in Kansas at 11.15pm on Wednesday, according to church spokesman Steve Drain. Previously he said that that Phelps was being cared for in a Shawnee County facility. His passing comes just days after another son, Nate Phelps, took to his own Facebook page to announce that his father was 'on the edge of death' at Midland Hospice house in Topeka. Scroll down for video . Passed: Fred Phelps Sr., the founder of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church, died on Wednesday . Nate Phelps, who left the extreme Christian sect 37 years ago, said his father was excommunicated in August 2013 from the church for advocating more kindness toward its members. Three of his own children ex-communicated their father, according to WIBW. 'I'm not sure how I feel about this,' Nate Phelps wrote on Facebook. 'Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way. Destroyed by . the monster he made. 'I . feel sad for all the hurt he's caused so many. I feel sad for those who . will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I'm bitterly angry . that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, . and saying their good-byes.' On Thursday, friends flocked to Nathan's Facebook page to pass on their condolences. Phelps leaves behind his wife Margie and five children, Nathan, Fred Jr., Margie, Shirley and Rebekah. It is unknown if the family will hold a funeral for Phelps; in February, Margie tweeted that the church does not hold funerals. Posting: Nathan Phelps - who left the Westboro Baptist Church 37 years ago - wrote on his Facebook page that his estranged father was 'on the edge of death' on Sunday . Anger: Phelps is pictured wielding placards protesting homosexuality in Laramie, Wyoming, in April 1999 . 'We don't worship the dead in this church, so there'd be no public memorial or funeral to picket if any member died,' she wrote. On Thursday, his granddaughter Libby, who has left the church, wrote on her Facebook page: 'RIP, Gramps. I love you forever.' She continued: 'I'm so sorry for the harm he caused. That we all caused. But he could be so kind and wonderful. I wish you all could have seen that, too. 'I understand those who don't mourn his loss, but I'm thankful for those who see that ""An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.""' His death does not mean the end of Westboro. Earlier this week, a current church elder told WIBW that they need no leader because their head is Jesus Christ. Support: Phelps stands with his wife Margie, left, and daughter, also called Margie, in Baltimore in 2007 . Passed down: His children Fred Phelps Jr., left, and Rebekah, right, continue to spread his word . Bucking the trend: But his son Nathan, pictured last year, has broken away from the church . Phelps Sr. started the Westboro Baptist Church in 1955 and went on to earn a law degree at Washburn University in 1964. He also worked as an award-winning civil rights attorney - but he was disbarred in 1979 after badgering a witness in what the Kansas Supreme Court called 'a personal vendetta'. He lost his license to practice law in federal courts in 1989. Despite being disbarred, he fought to stay in the public eye and made bids for Senator and Governor - scoring 30 per cent of the vote in his 1992 senate bid. He became known for his crusading against gay people and his . followers gained world-wide notoriety for picketing the funerals of US . servicemen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. His organization teaches that homosexuality is the root of all evil and . that anyone who refuses to denounce it is the cause of all tragedies, . including war deaths. Reflection: Phelps Sr. is pictured in prayer at his Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas in 2006. One of his sons has revealed that Phelps was excommunicated from his own church last year . At protests . they brandish placards with phrases such as 'Thank God for IEDs, 'Fag . soldier in hell' and 'Soldiers die 4 fag marriage'. In an interview in 2010, Phelps explained that 'the Lord Almighty called on me to preach'. 'I don't think this country can be saved, but I have a duty to preach it anyway,' he said. 'That's the mission: to preach it even if that soldier's widow doesn't want you to. It's irrelevant what she wants. My job is to preach it without timidity.' In . 2012, half-a-million people signed . petitions asking the White House to crack down on Westboro Baptist . Church after the group threatened to picket in Newtown, Connecticut, . where 20 children and six staff members were killed in December 2012 by a . gunman. Five petitions . posted on the White House website since the shootings have asked the . government to name the church as a hate group or end its tax-exempt . status. The Southern . Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization, has called the church . 'arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America' because of . the anti-gay signs its members carry. But the church has gone to court to defend its right to protest. Messages of hate: Phelps, pictured in 2007, prepares to protest outside the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka . Following: Members of the Westboro Baptist Church - known for their anti-gay sentiments and picketing soldiers' funerals - hold signs at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Veterans Day in 2010 . In . March 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the group's funeral . protests were protected speech under the First Amendment in a suit . brought by Albert Snyder, the father of a Marine who had died in Iraq. The . protesters had carried signs that stated, 'God Hates You,' 'You Are . Going To Hell' and 'Thank God for Dead Soldiers' at his son's funeral. But not all the protests were without consequence. In 1998, he led protesters outside the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was killed because he was gay. In 2009, President Obama signed a law making crimes against perceived sexual orientation a hate crime. In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a law establishing that picketing was banned with a 150-foot zone of a military funeral within an hour of the service. In August 2012, Obama increased the area to 300 feet within two hours of the service.","Fred Phelps died of natural causes on Wednesday night .

"Nevada drivers could soon be sharing the road with vehicles that don't need them. Department of Motor Vehicles officials said Monday they've issued Google the nation's first license to test self-driving cars on public streets, after conducting demonstrations on the Las Vegas Strip and in Carson City that show the car is as safe - or perhaps safer - than a human. For one thing, the engineers programed the car to create a ‘virtual buffer zone’ around obstacles, making it more aware than some drivers to boot. Scroll down for video . All the (road) rage: Nevada's DMV issued Google a licence allowing the world's first driverless car to drive on public streets . Motorised view: This is what a driverless car sees now that Google's Prius is allowed to roam the streets . 'It gets honked at more often because it's being safe,' Nevada DMV Director Bruce Breslow told the AP. Self-driving vehicle technology works like auto-pilot to guide a car - in this case a modified Prius - with little or no intervention from a human operator. Laser radar mounted on the roof and in the grill detects pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles, creating a virtual buffer zone around the obstacles that the car then avoids. While some envision the robotic car dropping off its operator at the front of the mall and hunting for a parking spot on its own, Mr Breslow said not so fast. Nevada's regulations require two people in the test cars at all times. A user, who is legally blind, sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed To date, Google's cars have gone about 700,000 miles (1.1 million km) in self-driving mode . One person is behind the wheel, while the other person monitors a computer screen that shows the car's planned route and keeps tabs on roadway hazards and traffic lights. If there's a glitch, the human driver can override the autonomous auto with a tap on the brake or a hand on the steering wheel. Last summer, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval took the car for a spin in and around the state's quiet capital city. But Las Vegas Boulevard, where costumed superheroes routinely take the crosswalks and massive billboards angle for the attention of starry-eyed tourists, was perhaps best suited to test the car's main purpose. Food run: Steve programmed the car to drive in for a quick bite to eat at a drive-thru . 'They're designed to avoid distracted driving,' Mr Breslow said. 'When you're on the Strip and there's a huge truck with a three scantily clad women on the side, the car only sees a box.' So far, Google's applied to license three test vehicles. Mr Breslow said the cars will display red plates and an infinity symbol to represent their status as vehicles of the future. Once they're ready for the market - something Mr Breslow guesses could come in three to five years - the plates will be green.","DMV gives Google first license to test self-driving Prius on public streets .

"His nickname is Mr Remarkableman, and painter and decorator Shaun Jones has certainly lived up to the accolade. The 51-year-old successfully completed a two day lifting marathon and today claimed the astonishing world record for the number of squat lifts completed in 48 hours. And it isn't the first time the father-of-three, who lifted huge weights of up to 230kg for 48 hours, has emerged as a record breaker as he currently holds the title for the fastest ever time of blowing up a hot water bottle until it bursts. Scroll down for the video of earlier record attempts . Two day triumph: Shaun Jones, 51, looks slightly red-faced during the 48 hour challenge lifting a staggering  576,745kg . Shaun, who has featured in auditions for Britain's Got Talent, settled into a pattern of lifting for three minutes, then resting for two to complete the task. Over the two days the athlete lifted a staggering total 576,745kg. The father-of-three, of Hoveton, Norfolk, already knew he had the pedigree to be a record-breaker after smashing the record for blowing up 100 hot water bottles with his mouth until they burst - in just one day. Shaun, who lives with his wife Denise, 45, said: 'It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. And up! Shaun Jones started training for the event in 2004 and employed the technique of lifting for three minutes and resting for two . 'There were some really dark moments and I nearly packed it in half way through. 'But my son was by side and he kept pushing me on - I don't think I could have done it without him. 'Loads of people came to cheers us on but they became a blur after a while. 'When you do such an arduous activity you tend to forget about your surroundings and just focus on the task at hand.' Dedicated Shaun started training for the challenge, in 2004, by forcing himself to lift 30,000kg twice-a-day, seven days-a-week. During the challenge Shaun lifted weights ranging from 230kg to 80kg by carrying out as many reps as he could for three minutes and then resting for just two. The bodybuilder's effort was spurred on by memories of his late mother, who he completed the challenge in honour of by raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Shaun said: 'It's an amazing triumph. It's been a long and arduous journey but it feels amazing to have finally finished. 'When I think about it, it is quite an unbelievable triumph. I did it for my mum Joan who died of cancer ten years ago. 'She was diagnosed with the disease and then died just two weeks later. Her passing taught me to relish life and every minute I was lifting the weights I was just happy to be alive.' Shaun also holds the world record for blowing up a hot water bottle with his mouth until it bursts, with the fastest ever time recorded at just 18.81 seconds.","Bodybuilder Shaun Jones, 51, completed 36,288 separate squats during his marathon 48 hour weight-lifting challenge .

"It is the derriere that captivated the country at her sister’s wedding. Now Pippa Middleton has decided to share the secret of how she achieves her toned behind – and keeps it in shape. The answer is a simple 30-minute total body workout that includes ‘plié squats’. Scroll down for video . Sharing her secrets: Pippa Middleton's derriere captivated the country at her sister’s wedding, left, and now she is telling her readers about the routine that helped her achieve her toned behind. Right, out for a run . The 31-year-old – dubbed Her Royal Hotness ever since the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011 – has been given a monthly column in Waitrose Weekend Magazine in which to share her diet and exercise tips. She already writes for the supermarket’s food publication Waitrose Kitchen and now plans to share her ‘personal philosophy of healthy eating and exercise’. She swears by four key exercises – ladders, plié squats, wall pushes and the ‘classic plank’ – that are ‘quick and great for toning all over’. She said: ‘To get us started, I’ve chosen some of my favourite exercises for toning the whole body, all of which can be done at home. 'Do the routine three times a week and you’ll really notice a difference.’ Each exercise takes around two minutes to perform, and she recommends a 30 second break between the moves with a two minute rest at the end of each circuit. For those who are keen to emulate Miss Middleton’s famous behind, the squat and the plank will be of most interest as they are designed to strengthen and trim the gluteal muscles that make up the buttocks. To help fire up her readers with her own self-improving zeal, Miss Middleton added: ‘I know that if I fit in at least three, ideally five, sessions of exercise a week – be it a 30minute run, an hour’s walk or a good game of tennis – it boosts my mood and energy, and helps me sleep and digest better. ‘So I make it a priority, whatever the weather or my work schedule.

"More than five million people are walking around as ‘ticking time bombs’ because they have no idea they suffer from high blood pressure, warn experts. The condition has been called the nation’s biggest ‘silent killer’ as it has no obvious signs or symptoms. It is one of the most common causes of premature death and disability as it can lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart failure or even kidney failure. Scroll down for video . High blood pressure, dubbed Britain's 'silent killer', is one of the most common causes of premature death and disability as it can lead to strokes and heart attacks, as well as both heart and kidney failure (file picture) In England, 7.6million patients have been diagnosed with high blood pressure – or hypertension – with many taking drugs to control it. But another five million are unaware their blood pressure is too high, said Public Health England. Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of charity Blood Pressure UK, added: ‘There are over five million people walking around like a ticking time bomb, unaware they are at risk of a stroke or heart attack due to their blood pressure.’ Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘It produces no symptoms until it causes a heart attack or a stroke, yet it is easily detectable and easily treated. ‘Despite this, there are millions walking around with this ticking time bomb, unaware that they are at increased risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke. ‘It is simply unacceptable that so many avoidable heart attacks and strokes are occurring when the solution is so simple.’ Hypertension affects more than one in four adults and accounts for 12 per cent of visits to GPs in England. Latest PHE figures put the annual cost from diseases it causes at an estimated £2.1billion. In England, 7.6million patients have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, known as hypertension . Reducing the blood pressure of the country as a whole could save £850million in health and social care costs over ten years, it said. If 15 per cent of those who are unaware they have the condition were diagnosed, £120million could be saved over a decade. And if 15 per cent of those currently being treated for the condition controlled it better, a further £120million could be saved. PHE has set up the Blood Pressure System Leadership Board of public bodies, charities, such as the BHF, and other experts. It will operate like successful initiatives in the US and Canada to encourage people to take simple steps to cut their blood pressure. These include changing their diet to reduce salt intake, keeping a healthy weight and not drinking too much alcohol. People at risk should monitor their blood pressure regularly and alert their doctor with any changes, said PHE. Companies are also being urged to offer high-quality testing for staff at work. The leadership board will focus on the most deprived areas as people living there are 30 per cent more likely to have hypertension. Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and well-being at PHE, said: ‘Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and high blood pressure plays a big part in this. ‘It is vital for partners to come together – from local government, to the Health Service and charities, we all have a role to play.’ Professor Huon Gray, national clinical director for heart disease for NHS England, said getting the nation’s blood pressure levels into the normal range could prevent more than half of strokes and many heart attacks. It was essential for everyone to have regular checks and take steps such as cutting salt intake and exercising more, he added. A high blood pressure reading exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury. The first figure is the systolic pressure – the ‘surge’ which occurs with each heartbeat. The second is the diastolic reading, which measures the pressure in the ‘rest’ between heartbeats.","More than five million have no idea they suffer from high blood pressure .

"Education minister Liz Truss said schools were free to teach about porn . Schools are free to give lessons in pornography, an education minister has admitted despite concerns about the impact of hardcore images on children. Campaigners have warned that growing numbers of youngsters are hooked on graphic films found online. While lessons on pornography would focus . on the impact and dangers of graphic images online, they could backfire . by alerting children to what can be easily accessed on the internet. David Cameron is preparing to make it easier for parents to block online porn from new computers. But Liz Truss insisted lessons in porn can form part of ‘age appropriate’ studies. Some teaching unions have called for students to be taught about porn from the age of 10. But an alarming study last month revealed children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet pornography giving them 'unrealistic expectations' of sex. Counsellors at Childline also report a surge in calls from youngsters traumatised after seeing adult images online. The intervention by Miss Truss comes a month after a teaching union called for students to be taught porn from the age of 10, so that they know about the dangers and can protect themselves from stumbling across adult images. The green light from a minister could encourage more schools to institute lessons in pornography – a development which will alarm many parents. She said: ‘The Government wants all young people to have high quality, age appropriate sex and relationships education. ‘The current non-statutory programmes of study for Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education, which include sex and relationship education, can provide opportunities for schools to teach about pornography.’ PSHE, which includes sex and relationships education, is not compulsory in England unlike other parts of the UK. Last night Norman Wells, from pressure group Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘Bringing pornography into the classroom will introduce sexual images to many children who have not encountered them before and will arouse in some pupils a curiosity to search out more images for themselves. It will not solve anything and will only compound the problem. ‘Most parents would far rather the government introduce an opt-in system to limit the risk of their children accessing sexual images online in the first place than add pornography to the school curriculum. ‘Talking freely and openly about sexual matters with young children in the classroom has the potential to break down their natural sense of reserve and encourage casual attitudes towards sex. ‘If we want children to view sexual intimacy as something valuable, special and worthy of respect, we need to treat it with modesty and restraint. To give lessons on pornography is to play with fire.’ While lessons on pornography would focus on the impact and dangers of graphic images online, they could backfire by alerting children to what can be easily accessed on the internet. David Cameron is ready to take action to curb online porn. Anyone buying a new computer or signing up with a new internet service provider will be asked whether they have children when they log on for the first time.

Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said it should be a matter for parents not teachers . ‘There is a general concern across the . country that these things are becoming far too accessible for young . people and the moral side of this needs to be upheld. ‘Guidance on young people is something that is something we need to ensure is there, rather than let this sort of thing become too prevalent.’ The Daily Mail is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children. Over-18s would only be able to access adult images if they opt in following a strict age verification check. Last week the deputy children’s commissioner, Sue Berelowitz, said the impact of online porn was at least partly to blame for almost a half of cases of gang-based sex attacks. She said the easy access of porn online skewed young people's views about what is 'acceptable, required or expected' of sex, and could leave boys seeing girls as 'objects to be used and abused'. Last month the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) called for porn to be taught in lessons from the age of 10. Policy adviser Sion Humphreys said: ‘Children are growing up in an overtly sexualised world. ‘That includes easy access to porn and they need the skills to deal with it.’ The union called for teaching about the impact of pornography to be included ‘as part of a statutory Personal Social Health Education (PSHE) programme’. ‘Evidence suggests 10 isn't too young to start lessons on pornography, but it wouldn't be a full on lesson but the grounding would be laid down.’ The National Union of Teachers said referring to issues of porn in lessons is a step too far and that schools should only talk about it if asked by students. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the Commons select committee, said any lessons on pornography would have to be handled sensitively. 'It is much better for schools to take control of this issue rather than simply allow children to find images on their phones in the playground. 'It would be naive to think that you could just prevent children getting access to these images.' Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC’s Sexual Abuse programme said: 'It’s a good thing for children to learn that porn does not mirror real-life and gives a distorted view of sex. 'As long as this is explained in an age-appropriate way, with the consent of parents where necessary, it can help children form healthy relationships based on care and respect.' Last night a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘Obviously the minister was saying that PSHE could give schools a chance to teach children about the dangers of pornography – something which is a growing problem in our schools that parents are rightly very concerned about.’","Liz Truss reveals teachers can give lessons on porn as part of Personal, Social, Health and Economic classes .

"When Sue Walters was diagnosed with leukaemia, she hoped that the best of medical science would be used to cure it. What she could never have anticipated was that her life would be saved by an 18-year-old boy from a remote German village. Sue’s only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant — previously known as a bone marrow transplant. ‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life. If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months,' said Sue Walters of her donor Nicola Gerber . This would give her a new, stronger immune system to destroy the cancerous cells in her blood. No one in her family matched her tissue type, so doctors searched the worldwide donor register — and found Nicola Gerber, a student from Mechern, near the French border. He had recently registered as a stem cell donor, and was the perfect match. Thanks to Nicola, Sue has made a full recovery. The two began writing to each other a year after the transplant and recently met for the first time when Nicola flew from Germany to see Sue. ‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life,’ says Sue, who broke down in tears when he walked into the room. ‘If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months.’ Sue’s husband Humphrey, her son Mark and daughter-in-law Maria were all there to show their enormous gratitude. ‘What’s remarkable is for a young guy like this to have the social awareness to do something like that,’ says Humphrey. For Nicola the reward is seeing Sue in good health. ‘She looks so well and so happy,’ he says. ‘It’s a good feeling.’ The story behind his decision to donate is extraordinary. In 2011, a man in his village was diagnosed with leukaemia and needed a stem cell transplant. ‘Half the village — about 300 people — got checked to see if they were a match and one was found,’ says Nicola, now 21 and studying engineering. ‘I registered and though I wasn’t a match, three months later I got a letter saying there was another person who needed my cells. ‘I was told it was a lady from England. I was happy to help,’ he says. Sue, 74, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) — aggressive cancer of the white blood cells — in July 2011 after a blood test showed up abnormalities. About 2,600 people in Britain are diagnosed with this form of leukaemia each year. It’s most common in the over 60s. ‘She looks so well and so happy. It’s a good feeling,' said Nicola . ‘The diagnosis was a huge shock,’ says Sue, who lives in West London and has two children, Claudia and Mark, and three grandchildren. ‘I wanted to know if I was going to die and my doctor said: “Do not go and Google this.” To this day I have never looked.’ She adds: ‘Initially, I did cry, but soon I thought: “I’ve got to get a grip on this.” I never asked about my prognosis. I had complete confidence in the wonderful doctors and nurses. 'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was.’ Sue began two courses of chemotherapy, each involving a five-week hospital stay. Her doctor explained that while they could control her cancer with chemotherapy, the only cure was the transplant. Stem cells are ‘master’ cells that can develop into a variety of different cells — those in the bone marrow turn into blood cells. These play a crucial role in the immune system, and in leukaemia, all these cells become abnormal, says Dr Mike Potter, consultant haematologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital and the London Clinic, who treated Sue. ‘Chemotherapy can reduce the cancer, but it can’t destroy it completely. In a stem cell transplant, cells travel to the centre of the bones and start making new blood cells able to fight the cancer that’s left over from the chemo.’ Essentially, the patient’s blood and immune system is replaced by the donor’s. During Sue’s second course of chemotherapy, she was told a donor had been found. ‘I was just told it was a young German boy of 18 and that was a bit of a strange thought,’ says Sue, who works for her husband, a motivational speaker and performance coach in business and sport. About 2,000 people in Britain need a stem cell transplant for leukaemia and lymphoma — cancers of the blood — and other blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia. Often, it is their last hope of survival. Patients can receive a stem cell transplant only from someone who matches their tissue type or else the body rejects it, says Dr Potter. ‘There are 22 million volunteers in the world and, for every patient, there are usually just one or two donors who match and sometimes none,’ he says. Around a million Britons are registered as stem cell donors, but there’s a desperate need for more. Only 60 per cent of patients in need of a transplant find the best possible match, according to the charity Anthony Nolan. There is a particular shortage of young, male donors and those of ethnic minority. 'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was,’ said Sue . It’s possible to perform a stem cell transplant using a donor who is a less-than-perfect match, but the risks of rejection are higher. Stem cells used to be collected via a needle into the bone marrow, an operation involving a general anaesthetic, which caused considerable pain for days afterwards. Now they can be taken from the blood without an anaesthetic. Before donating his cells Nicola had to inject himself in the stomach twice a day for three days with a drug that stimulates stem cells to come out from the bone marrow and into the blood. ‘It didn’t hurt, but it’s uncomfortable when you feel the stem cells coming out — like a pressure in my chest and back,’ he says. He then travelled to a hospital in Frankfurt to have cells harvested during a three-hour procedure. Blood was removed via a tube into his arm and into a machine, which removed the stem cells before the blood was returned to a tube in his other arm. About ten to 15 litres of blood were removed, then returned. Nicola says it was painless, and while some donors feel very tired afterwards, he felt fine. His cells were flown straight to London — the transplant must be done within 48 hours as the cells have a lifespan of only 72 hours. Sue was prepared with high-dose chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system so her body would accept the new cells. Though her donor was a perfect match, the transplant still carried a 20 per cent risk of her dying, due to infection or rejection of the cells. The transplant on November 25, 2011 was just like a blood trans-fusion, says Sue. ‘I did have terrible pain in my back for about a week after, which I was told was my body fighting the new stem cells.’ It takes three weeks for the donor immune system to start working, and with her own immune system in decline, Sue was kept in hospital. 'She was discharged on Christmas Eve, feeling ‘very weak’. Gradually, her new immune system started to fight the leukaemia. By the summer, Sue’s strength had returned and she now feels extremely well. It’s not until after five years that you can say someone is ‘cured’ — but at three years, Sue is ‘in a very good position’, says Dr Potter. She still takes antiviral and antibiotic drugs as a precaution. A year after the transplant, she received a letter through the London Clinic from Nicola, though their names couldn’t be revealed to each other until two years had passed (to avoid distress for the donor and recipient). ‘It was a very sweet letter,’ she says. ‘He just said: “I’m really glad to help you.” ’ They exchanged Christmas cards and then decided to meet. ‘I’d wanted to know where my stem cells had gone,’ says Nicola. ‘I wanted to know if it worked.’ He says the decision to donate was a simple one. ‘If you have the chance to help someone, you should do it,’ he says.

"Gill Bembridge wasn’t overly worried when she saw a slight swelling on the neck of her nine-year-old daughter Faye. She just thought Faye had swollen glands and was getting a cold. But a few days later a friend pulled Gill aside and voiced concerns. Gill Bembridge thought her daughter Faye had swollen glands and was getting a cold, but instead the swelling was a sign of iodine deficiency . ‘He’s a retired GP called Pete Lansley, and he told me the swelling was a sign of iodine deficiency,’ says Gill, 31, who also has a son, Tyler, eight. ‘This wasn’t anything I’d thought of before.’ Far from being as innocuous as a cold, a lack of iodine can have a major impact on physical and mental health for adults and children. Studies show it is becoming increasingly commonplace in this country — up to two in three British girls and women are thought to have low iodine levels. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says iodine deficiency is the biggest worldwide cause of mental impairment. It has been linked to low IQ, fatigue, miscarriage and problems with the thyroid — the gland in the neck that regulates metabolism and early development. Since spotting Faye’s goitre (the name for a swelling at the front of the neck caused by iodine deficiency), Dr Lansley has noticed an increasing number of people in the street with goitres near his home in Yorkshire. These swellings are in the middle of the neck and will move up when you swallow. Goitre is the only obvious sign of iodine deficiency and the result of the thyroid gland enlarging. This is because the job of this gland is to produce the thyroid hormone, which it does using iodine. But if the body is not getting enough iodine, the gland expands to try to produce more thyroid on its own. Serious cases of iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) — causing long-term health problems such as foggy thinking, memory loss and infertility. Dr Lansley says: ‘I’ve started looking at people’s throats when I’m out and about, and I’ve discovered that quite a lot of people have goitres — the majority of whom are teenage girls. ‘When I was doing my medical training in the late Sixties, I was at a hospital in Ankara in Turkey and there were lots of people there suffering from goitres. 'The biggest I saw was the size of a small melon. ‘But you don’t expect to see many in the UK. It does make you wonder if there’s some sort of deficiency problem here.’ ‘Pete Lansley (a retired GP) suggested a couple of iodine drops from the chemist mixed in with squash once a week. Within a month the swelling had gone and Faye stopped taking the drops,' said Gill . Recent research also points to problems with iodine intake. One study, published in The Lancet last year, looked at iodine levels in urine samples from 100 pregnant women. Expectant mums need more iodine than most people as its vital for foetal brain development. But two-thirds of the women in the study by Surrey and Bristol Universities were iodine deficient. The children of these women had lower IQs by the age of eight and poor reading ability by age nine compared with those born to the mothers with adequate iodine. Meanwhile, another study, in The Lancet in 2011, involved more than 700 teenage girls from across the UK and revealed 70 per cent of them had iodine deficiency. One in five had a ‘very low’ level. Teenage girls need more iodine, too, for breast and ovary development. As a result of this study, the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders placed the UK on the list of mildly deficient nations. The Department of Health has now added iodine to its National Diet and Nutrition Survey, which checks the nutrient intake of adults and children in UK. It will look at the results next year and decide whether steps need to be taken to increase the nation’s iodine intake. So why are our levels so low? Most of the world’s iodine is found in the oceans — seafood, seaweed, cod and scallops are especially rich sources. But in the UK, cows’ milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt are our main source. This is due to a lucky accident: iodine is used as a disinfectant to clean cows’ udders and added to their feed, so it has entered our food chain this way. But consumption slumped when free school milk ended in the Seventies. And it has fallen further in recent years due to allergy fears and our changing tastes. Milk consumption has fallen further in recent years due to allergy fears and our changing tastes . Organic milk, which has grown in popularity, has around 40 per cent less iodine due to the different farming processes. Dr Mark Vanderpump, the consultant endocrinologist at the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust who led the 2011 research, says: ‘In our study it seemed that the girls who weren’t having any milk were the ones who were losing a big part of their iodine supplementation. ‘Before we did the study we thought we might be looking at iodine toxicity — too much iodine from milk — but the opposite was true.’ The recommended daily intake of iodine is 150 micrograms (mcg) for adults — 250 mcg for pregnant women. Children should have around 120 mcg. A 100g portion of shellfish provides 90mcg, and a 200ml glass of milk has 50-80 mcg. So it’s easy to see how shortfalls arise. The UK Iodine Group, formed by Dr Vanderpump, is pressing the Government for a solution to Britain’s deficiency. In many countries, including Canada, the U.S., Denmark and Switzerland, salt manufacturers have been required to add iodine to their products since the 1920s. This is thought to be the simplest and most effective way of improving population-wide intake. Recently, WHO added iodine to the salt in India to help improve levels there. But there are no plans to iodise salt here. ‘As soon as you even mention salt in Britain, people start talking about high blood pressure and strokes,’ says Dr Vanderpump. ‘That’s why I think the Government doesn’t want to intervene, because it’s always easier to leave the status quo. ‘It’s ironic that we fund programmes to iodise the salt of Third World countries, yet we don’t bother about our own.’ The UK Iodine Group believes we should prioritise efforts to boost the iodine intake of teenage girls — the mothers of the future. ‘You could say, “Why don’t we focus on pregnant women?” but the problem is that only 50 per cent of pregnancies are planned, and you need your iodine and thyroid status to be good pre-conception, as the foetal brain develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy. ‘If you suddenly start taking iodine supplements when you’re six weeks’ pregnant, it might not be good for you. 'Your thyroid takes a while to adjust and it could harm it if you take too much iodine too quickly. ‘Another argument for focusing on teenagers is a New Zealand study that found your brain doesn’t finish forming until you’re about 15. The drop in UK milk consumption over the last decade . 'They gave 12 year olds iodine for six months and it improved their mental functioning.’ So what should you do if you fear your iodine levels are low? The usual test is via a urine sample. But Dr Vanderpump warns that this may not be accurate. ‘Results vary widely according to recent diet so are not useful to assess someone’s iodine status,’ he says. If you have a goitre you should see your GP, who may refer you to an endocrinologist for thyroid assessment. Adequate iodine supplies should reduce the swelling. Dr Vanderpump says the only way to ensure your iodine levels are adequate is to consume more milk and dairy products. ‘Or you can add an over-the-counter potassium iodine supplement of 100-150mcg per day.’ Yet when Gill took Faye to her GP to ask for an iodine supplement she was brushed off. ‘We were told that at Faye’s age there are so many hormonal changes going on, the lump would probably go,’ says Gill, who lives in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. ‘But Pete suggested a couple of iodine drops from the chemist mixed in with squash once a week.’ Within a month the swelling had gone and Faye stopped taking the drops. Gill now ensures her children have plenty of milk and iodine-rich food. ‘I count us very lucky that we have Pete as a friend. 'If it wasn’t for him Faye’s iodine status would have gone unnoticed.’","Faye, 9, had slight swelling on neck caused by iodine deficiency .

"Cashing in: Putman was charged with cashing around £15,000 in income support and housing benefit from the Department of Work and Pensions . When Edward Putman scooped nearly £5million on the Lottery, he asked to have no publicity. That anonymity was ripped away yesterday when he appeared in court accused of fraudulently claiming £15,000 in benefits after his big win. The 46-year-old, who lives in a large detached house with a fleet of cars outside, is said to have continued applying for income support and housing benefit nearly two years after receiving his Lotto cheque. Although he was not convicted yesterday, his barrister said his client would admit two charges of benefit fraud at the next hearing. The delay came after the Crown Prosecution Service was unable to confirm exactly how much the millionaire owes. Putman attempted to continue living out of the public eye after yesterday’s hearing when he sprinted from St Albans Magistrates’ Court trying to hide his face with his mobile phone. He refused to comment at the £600,000 home in the upmarket village of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, which he shares with his long-term partner. It is understood Putman was unemployed when he won £4,525,058 on September 26, 2009. Sources said an investigation began after council officers became suspicious when he tried to buy his former one-bed council flat in Hemel Hempstead with cash. Enquiries found Putman appeared to have continued claiming income support and housing benefit between September 2009 and May last year. Yesterday, his brother, Raymond, who lives in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, said: ‘He was absolutely skint and then suddenly he had millions. ‘He won’t be happy people know about his win because he’s a private person. I don’t even know how much he won. He didn’t even tell me about the court case. How crazy. ‘I don’t know if he has been managing the money but he had a BMW, then a Range Rover. There are other cars and motorcycles. ‘He’s also bought friends and family cars. The other week he bought seven Suzuki Swifts to give to people. That’s just him. I hope he doesn’t waste it all.’ Putman’s former partner Gail, who took his name during their time together, said he had hidden the Lotto win from her. Jailed: In April 2011, Lesley Brogan was jailed for 21 months after she claimed more than £100,000 for her 'disabled' husband, despite the fact that they had won £120,000 on the lottery . Miss Putman, who had a son by him . before they split several years ago, said: ‘I never knew he’d won the . Lottery – he never told me. He couldn’t even pay me £5 a month . maintenance. ‘If he won this money and he’s done this fraud, what does that tell you about him?’ Miss . Putman, who lives in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, added that she . believed her former partner had fathered another son with a different . woman before starting his current long-term relationship. Neighbours of Putman’s also revealed how he claimed to be a property developer. Windfall: Putman's £600,000 house in the village of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire . One added: ‘I’ve been made redundant three times and when I claimed income support I had to sign on. I had to show them I’d been trying to get a job and going for interviews. How did he claim it for 20 months without them making him get a job?’ Last night it appeared Putman was trying to sell his home. A message posted anonymously on buildinglanduk.co.uk said his house, garden and even his mobile home were up for sale. It said: ‘I’m not sure how to explain what I have without someone looking but I have a four-bed detached house with a garden which has a mobile home on.’ During yesterday’s five-minute hearing, George Brooker, chairman of the bench, said the case would be adjourned for sentencing until July 3. The Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘We cannot comment until sentencing.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Edward Putman, 46, alleged to have claimed £15,000 in handouts over 20 months ."
"Spider attack: Actress Julie Peasgood was stricken by an infected bite . A cold Sunday morning last December, and I’m up at the crack of dawn. My lovely hairdresser Kevin has agreed to come to my home in Surrey at 8am, as I then have to race back to Grimsby for panto rehearsals — I’m an actress and TV presenter and this is my first venture into pantomime. I am slightly perturbed, however, as I have woken to find a weird, golf-ball sized blister just above my right ankle. It doesn’t hurt, but it is quite hot and angry-looking, and I’m mystified as to what it can be. At Kevin’s insistence, I call NHS Direct while he’s cutting my hair. In less than two hours, I am sitting opposite the out-of-hours GP who advises me to not lance it (I so want to). He says it looks like a bite or a burn. I don’t see how it can be the latter, and although I’m a magnet for mosquitoes, I’ve never had a bite this big before and it is winter. I try to ignore it, hoping the swelling will disappear as quickly as it came on. The following Friday we have our first performance of Sleeping Beauty — I play Azuriel, the Good Fairy. Unfortunately, the blister has burst overnight and won’t stop weeping — though it is a relief not to have an egg-shaped lump on my ankle any more. My legs are on view on stage and the lump had been difficult to disguise. My husband, Patrick Pearson, also an actor, renames the show ‘Seeping Beauty’, which I find very funny. One week later and it’s our Mince Pie Matinee, but I’m not feeling very festive — I’m dosed up with horse-strength antibiotics as the blister has become infected. I’ve been back and forth to the local GP, where my wound is dressed every other day. My nurse, Jackie, tells me she’s seen this before and is convinced it’s the result of a false widow spider bite. The bite is now a small, yellowy-green, glutinous crater. It’s not painful — just revolting. Later, my husband discovers a shiny, black spider in an outside crevice of the cottage in Cleethorpes I’m renting while in the show. Scroll down for video . The bite initially (left) and how it soon developed (right). It took three months after the bite first appeared, before Julie could cast boot and bandages aside . It doesn’t look very threatening as it’s quite small, but it does have long legs and a bulbous body with some strange, creamy-white markings. I Google ‘false widow spiders’ and it fits the description. There are seven types of false widow spider in the UK, but the kind associated with bites is the noble false widow (Steatoda nobilis). It’s one of a dozen larger species of spider in Britain that can give a nasty bite. Apparently, noble false widows — about 2 cm wide, including their legs — nest anywhere that’s dark and damp. I think of piles of wood shavings near the cottage, which I trod on in the dark one night. Stuart Hine, manager of the identification and advisory service at the Natural History Museum and an expert on false widows, says the noble false widow has been increasingly common in the South of England for the past ten years or so. The spiders were first sighted in Devon in 1879, and were thought to have hitched a ride here on a boat importing bananas — but now they are migrating north from there, possibly due to climate change. ‘Their numbers are increasing, and as a result, more people are reporting bites,’ he says. It’s just a shame one has settled in Cleethorpes. 'I spend the next couple of months keeping my feet up wherever I go,' said Julie . I can’t stop searching for information on false widows. They aren’t aggressive and will only bite if provoked (for example, if you try to prod them or if they are caught in clothing), but the skull-like markings on their bodies are sinister. Although the noble false widow has been described as Britain’s most venomous spider, a bite will typically only cause a small swelling and numbness — similar in scale to a wasp or bee sting. For most people, keeping the bite clean and applying an antihistamine bite cream will help it heal in a few days. But it’s now nearly three weeks since I was bitten and my leg has gone from bad to worse. On Christmas Eve, my friend Lindsay helps me tend to what is now a suppurating ulcer the size of 10 p coin. We joke about calling the panto ‘Pus in Boots’, but I’m feeling quite down. Our final performance is just before New Year. My dresser Rosie is also a trained nurse, so she has by turns been zipping me up and applying industrial-sized plasters to my leg. She thinks it may not clear up until the spring, so I add ‘rapid healing’ to my New Year’s resolutions. Back home in Surrey and with the show over, I’m feeling scared. I’m on my third course of antibiotics and the thing is still growing. Tests have revealed a streptococcal bacterial infection, and my GP seems out of his depth, saying he’s never witnessed this kind of bite. Stuart Hine says in cases where bites cause a wound that won’t heal it’s most likely a secondary infection with bacteria that’s the problem: ‘Horror stories you hear about large wounds or limbs going black are likely to be down to an infection similar to necrotising fasciitis, where bacterial infection leads to tissue dying off.’ He adds it’s difficult for medics to get a clear picture of how much damage the venom itself can cause. Doctors may not see a bite until it’s already infected. ‘There have been claims that bacteria are injected by the spider along with its venom, but there’s little evidence for this. 'It’s the same as any scratch or puncture to the skin — there’s a risk of infection and some people’s immune systems don’t shrug it off as easily,’ he says. My GP is increasingly concerned and we agree I should see a specialist. I get a private appointment with Peter Mortimer, professor of dermatological medicine at St George’s Hospital in London, who confirms a false widow spider is the most likely culprit. The first thing you should do is wash the area thoroughly with soap and water to prevent infection — and don’t scratch, as if you break the skin there’s more chance for bacteria to get in. Cover bites with a plaster and apply an antihistamine sting cream to calm any inflammation or itching, says Stuart Hine, from the Natural History Museum’s identification and advisory service. Any redness, pain or swelling should subside after three days. Be alert to potential signs of infection, such as weeping blisters or painful swelling, that continue to get worse after a few days. If this happens, seek advice from your GP. He recommends compression therapy — an ultra-firm leg bandage to squeeze my leg, encouraging blood flow to and from the area to promote healing. I also have to elevate my legs as much as possible. He warns I’m still looking at a minimum of three months for my (now chronic) ulcer to get better — apparently just above the ankle is the worst area for healing. The ulcer also has to be regularly debrided (where they clean out the gunk and dead tissue) at hospital. It’s not as painful as it sounds. The weeks go by and the ulcer has decreased a little, though I now have to wear a blue surgical boot as I can’t get any other shoes over the bandage. It means that filming of my new TV series, Crafty Beggars, is postponed. I spend the next couple of months keeping my feet up wherever I go. Finally, at the beginning of March, three months after the bite first appeared, I cast boot and bandages aside. The ulcer is shrinking — it no longer weeps, and neither do I. With my leg on the mend at last, we can begin filming. Dr Dawn Harper, from TV’s Embarrassing Bodies, thinks I got off lightly. ‘Bacteria in the bite can cause nasty ulceration and I have heard of amputations as a result of false widow spider bites,’ she says. The only fly, or should I say spider, in the ointment (sorry) is a conspicuous 2cm round brown scar. But at least I haven’t been left with a permanent dent in my leg, which Maggie and Jacqui, the specialist nurses in London who applied my bandages, had warned me was a distinct possibility. All of which means that I’m free to return to panto in Grimsby this year. I can say with all honesty I really have been bitten by the panto bug . . .

"Bob Geldof said the new Band Aid single was inspired by the tragic story of a nurse who died of ebola after wiping away a child's tear . If Bob Geldof harboured any doubts about reprising his world-famous Band Aid song, they were extinguished by a single heartbreaking image from West Africa. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that he was spurred to mobilise today’s pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola. ‘The nurse forgot where she was, and what was happening, and wiped a tear from the child,’ said Bob. ‘The child died and the nurse died. You can’t get more tragic than that.’ After this, Bob – once disinclined to revisit Do They Know It’s Christmas after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song. And so yesterday, in the footsteps of George Michael, Sting, Duran Duran and others, whose 1984 efforts raised money for famine relief in Ethiopia, stars such as One Direction, Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran gathered in a West London recording studio for Band Aid 30. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday on the eve of the recording, Bob described ebola as pernicious and ‘anti-human’, rendering people ‘incapable of touching’. He added: ‘You have a five-year-old daughter in agony who is not even allowed to be comforted by her mother.’ Fixed in his mind, as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer Midge Ure, was the image of the nurse wiping away the child’s tear. Now the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ is replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear’. Yesterday’s recording received a boost with news that the Government will waive VAT on the charity single. Back in 1984, Bob had to twist then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s arm to agree to this, but Chancellor George Osborne didn’t need convincing yesterday. ‘Amazing that the Government has just said, “Fine, keep the tax,’ said Sir Bob after speaking to Mr Osborne. ‘The nurse forgot where she was, and what was happening, and wiped a tear from the child,’ said Sir Bob. ‘The child died and the nurse died. You can’t get more tragic than that’ We are family: Producer Midge Ure prepares to head into the studio in Notting Hill with his daughters, from left, Molly, Flossie, Kitty and Ruby . Bob Geldof was joined at the recording studio by his two daughters Fifi (left) and Pixie . ‘The next stage now is to turn this into a phenomenon like it was in the 1980s, and the only way to do that is to get people to buy the thing.’ Yesterday, just as their predecessors had done 30 years ago, the artists, bleary-eyed, started to arrive for the recording from 6.45am. They included Sam Smith, Coldplay’s Chris Martin, Elbow, Olly Murs, Seal, Jessie Ware, Sinead O’Connor, Ellie Goulding, Paloma Faith and electronic band Clean Bandit. Bono was the only artist taking part who sang on the original single. He arrived late and blamed airport fog. ‘I’d be happy just to stand in the background and wave,’ he quipped. Organisers hope the track will be completed in time for its first public performance during tonight’s edition of The X Factor. Sir Bob said: ‘It really doesn’t matter if you don’t like this song. It really doesn’t matter if you don’t like the artists, it really doesn’t matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording – what you have to do is buy this thing.’ Stars and stripes: Blonde singer Ellie Goulding turns up in biker boots – and matching bag and jumper – for the recording session, also attended by Bono (right) Where's Harry? Excitement builds as fans who turned up early await the arrival of heart throbs One Direction . He arrived with daughters Pixie, 24, and 31-year-old Fifi, who can be seen in the original video as a baby. Midge Ure posed for pictures with his four daughters, none of whom were born at the time of the first recording. Singer Emeli Sande said during a break in the recording: ‘Bob called me personally and talked through the severity of the ebola problem. ‘And he gave a really touching speech beforehand which really got everyone in to the right frame of mind… he was saying we shouldn’t see it as them and us because tomorrow it could be us all suffering. ‘It certainly made everyone sing with a bit more passion. It took a while to get the harmonies right but it was sounding great. It took about five takes.’ Col stare: Coldplay frontman Chris Martin seems to consciously uncouple from the task in hand to glance at the camera . Lady in red: Rita Ora in a billowing trouser suit and midrift-revealing crop top, waves to fans, while a bleary-eyed Harry Styles is one of the first to appear from the session at around 6.45am . She added: ‘Bono said it will be your hairstyle you remember in 30 years and regret.’ For One Direction heart-throb Harry Styles, it was the second big charity performance in a matter of hours – the 20-year-old performed during the Children In Need extravaganza on Friday night. The band had the privilege of singing the first line. Despite the early hour, dozens of fans were there to greet him. Some of the stars could barely contain their excitement and provided regular updates on social media. X Factor finalist and chart-topper Olly Murs tweeted: ‘Been hanging out with this lad Harry Styles’, and added: ‘Plus with these legends Bono, Chris Martin and Sir Bob Geldof.’ A spokeswoman said every penny raised from the sale of the download, CD and app will go to the ‘fight against ebola’.","Bob described ebola as pernicious and ‘anti-human’ to Mail On Sunday .

"Cuffed: A tearful Aisling Brady McCarthy enters the courtroom . An Irish nanny accused of killing a baby in her care broke down in tears as she begged a judge to grant her bail while she awaits her trial for murder. Wearing a dark knitted jumper and sobbing throughout proceedings, Aisling Brady McCarthy looked on as her lawyers called for her to be released. They argued that prosecutors have failed to turn over critical evidence they need to defend her against murder charges. The 35-year-old is accused of smashing Rehma Sabir's skull on the child's first birthday in January. The tot was rushed to hospital with severe head injuries but died two days later. McCarthy’s lawyers argued that the case against her is weaker than prosecutors claimed after she was arrested. They . cited notes of police interviews in which they say the baby’s mother . appears to have said 'no issues with nanny' when questioned the night . she was rushed to the hospital. Prosecutors . say McCarthy, 35, 'violently' injured the baby, whose family lived in . Cambridge, just outside Boston. McCarthy lived in nearby Quincy. Judge S. Jane Haggerty said she expects to rule on the bail request later today. The judge also said she expects to rule by the end of the week on a defense request to dismiss the charges against McCarthy. McCarthy’s . lawyers argued that prosecutors presented 'false and deceptive' information to a grand jury, including evidence about earlier bone . fractures the girl had with no accompanying evidence linking the . injuries to McCarthy. On . Tuesday, the defense told the judge that prosecutors still have not . turned over medical reports about the earlier fractures and other . evidence vital to their defense of McCarthy.

Fitzgerald didn’t comment directly on . the defense claim that the prosecution’s case against McCarthy is weaker . than what was presented to the grand jury that indicted her, but he . said he doesn’t think McCarthy should be granted bail. 'I see nothing that has changed relevant to the issue of bail,' he said. After . McCarthy’s arrest, immigration officials said she was in the United . States illegally after arriving from Ireland in 2002, when she was . authorized to stay only 90 days. During an earlier hearing, McCarthy, accused prosecutors of presenting 'false and deceptive' information to a grand jury. The defense attorney made the allegations against prosecutors as she asked a judge to dismiss the charges.

The nanny's lawyers also claimed . Boston prosecutors acted unethically in the way they presented evidence . to the grand jury that indicted her for the murder. They . were seeking the charges to be dismissed based on the alleged . prosecutorial misconduct as well as a general lack of probable cause.

The defense also contends the case is so weak that it does not meet the low legal threshold of probable cause.

"Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted surprise inspections on medical staff of at least three NFL teams on Sunday, the agency said. The ongoing investigation was prompted by a lawsuit brought by former players claiming that teams have mishandled prescription drugs for decades. The San Francisco 49ers were targeted after playing away against the New York Giants and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were checked at the Baltimore-Washington International after their game. Scroll down for video . Probe: The Drug Enforcement Administration began a probe into NFL teams' handling of prescription drugs with raids against three teams Sunday . The Seattle Seahawks confirmed their medical staff was also checked by the agency for compliance with prescription drug regulations while visiting Kansas City. The Washington Post reports that a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said there was a specific interest in the three teams investigated. There were no arrests Sunday, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Rusty Payne confirmed. Agents inspected documents from medical staffs for any controlled substances brought by visiting teams, along with records that the staff could practice in the home team's state. 'Our teams cooperated with the DEA today and we have no information to indicate that irregularities were found,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Associated Press in an email. In May, former NFL players brought a lawsuit against the league, claiming that teams and their medical staffs acted without regard for players' well-being, . Targeted: A law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity said there were specific reasons why the three teams were investigated during this round . Now with more than 1,200 players with careers going back to 1968, the plaintiffs allege that NFL staffs plied them with painkillers such as Vicodin and anti-inflammatories like Toradol  to keep them playing. The lawsuit claims that teams did this against regulations and often without players' knowledge or consent as to what drug 'cocktails' contained. One attorney for the players described staffs dispensing prescription drugs 'like candy at Halloween.' The New York Daily News reports that former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, a party to the suit, developed an addiction after medical staff gave him painkillers without getting prescriptions, keeping records or warning about side effects. His dependency is so strong that McMahon downs more than 100 pills of Percocet, an opioid pain medication, according to the lawsuit. A former teammate of McMahon, offensive lineman Keith Van Horne, sparked the ire of Bears' trainer Fred Caito after he was prescribed Percodan by a doctor not affiliated with the team. 'The problem was that the Bears ordered painkillers in advance of every season under a player’s name,' the suit reads. 'Van Horne had thus put Caito in a bad spot by obtaining the Percodan when there were already DEA records that hundreds of painkillers had been ordered in Van Horne’s name.' Other former players reported chronic muscle and bone ailments or claimed that they had nerve and organ damage related to prescription drug use, though the link is not definitive. In September, former NFL quarterback Ryan Leaf was sentenced to five years in prison after breaking into an acquaintance's home and stealing prescription painkillers in violation of probation. The once highly touted college talent who flopped in the pros developed an addiction to painkillers that earlier landed him in rehab, according to ESPN. The controlled substance act lays out rules that puts the distribution of prescription drugs in the hands of licensed doctors and nurses. It also outlines strict requirements for obtaining, storing and transporting drugs.","The San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks were investigated while visiting other NFL teams for away games .

Daniel, of Point Reyes but originally from New York, says: 'The blue heron first attempted to spear the gopher with its beak while the rodent retreated into its burrow. 'After failing to catch its dinner, the heron then used its beak to rummage further in the hole, before pulling the pocket gopher out by its front, left paw. 'The dangling gopher put up a good fight, however, and pulled his trapped paw free before attempting to escape.' Struggle: The gopher tried desperately to get away from the heron's clutches .

"Teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory, scientists say – in turn leading to poor academic performance. They believe the brain abnormalities last for ‘at least a few years’ after users have stopped taking the drug. The researchers also said there was fresh evidence the habit may cause mental health problems in youngsters predisposed to schizophrenia. Researchers found that the steroid hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain's sensitivity to THC, which is the chief high-inducing compound in cannabis . Marijuana is the most commonly used . illicit drug among adolescents in the UK, with more than four in ten . admitting having taken it. Almost 100 teenagers took part in the US research examining the effects of cannabis deep in the brain. It . found teenagers who smoked it daily for about three years had abnormal . changes in the brain structures related to remembering and processing . information and they performed poorly on memory tasks. The . brain abnormalities and memory problems were found on MRI scans when . study participants were in their early twenties – two years after they . had stopped smoking the drug. Memory-related . structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward and . the researchers said such damage was linked to poor academic performance . and everyday functioning. The study also shows the marijuana-related brain abnormalities look similar  to those seen in schizophrenia patients. Lead . author Matthew Smith, a professor in psychiatry and behavioural . sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, . Chicago, said: ‘The study links the chronic use of marijuana to these . concerning brain abnormalities that appear to last for at least a few . years after people stop using it. ‘With the movement to decriminalise marijuana, we need more research to understand its effect on the brain.’ A naturally occurring hormone called pregnenolone  can be used to stop the 'high' produced by cannabis and the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence, according to new research . He said chronic cannabis use may lead to changes in brain structure associated with having schizophrenia. Of . the 15 marijuana smokers who had schizophrenia in the study, 90 per . cent had started using the drug heavily before they developed the mental . disorder. A recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory as structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward, possibly reflecting a decrease in neurons . Professor Smith . added: ‘If someone has a family history of schizophrenia, they are . increasing their risk of developing schizophrenia if they abuse . marijuana. ‘If you have . schizophrenia and you frequently smoke marijuana, you may be at an . increased risk for poor working memory, which predicts your everyday . functioning.’ The study, . published in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, is the first to target . key brain regions in the deep grey matter of chronic marijuana users . with MRI scanning. It is . also the first time abnormalities in these regions have been linked with . an impaired working memory – the ability to remember and process . information in the moment and then transfer it to long-term memory. Participants . started using marijuana daily aged 16-17 for about three years – and . had been free of the drug for around two years at the time of the study. The 97 teenagers who took part included healthy people, those with a marijuana use disorder and schizophrenia patients. The . younger the individuals were when they started chronically using . marijuana, the more abnormally their brain regions were shaped, . suggesting parts related to memory are more susceptible to the effects . of the drug if abuse starts at an earlier age. Under . the Labour government cannabis was downgraded from class B to class C . in 2004, which critics argued gave the ‘green light’ to use by . youngsters. The decision was reversed in 2008 when ministers decided to overturn official scientific advice and return it to class B.","The younger the users, the more abnormally their .

"Tens of thousands of woman could suffer a rare cancer caused by a banned drug taken by their mothers or even grandmothers. The drug, Diethylstilboestrol (DES), was freely prescribed to pregnant women in Britain for three decades up to 1973, and was supposed to prevent miscarriages. But it was belatedly banned in Britain after it was found to increase the risk of miscarriage – and it is now feared that it can lead to a deadly cancer to a second and even third generation. Hundreds of thousands of pregnant mothers are estimated to have been exposed to DES but there is no confirmed figure . Some 2,000 women have already sought compensation in America, with payouts totalling up to £1bn from the numerous drug companies that sold DES, while scores more are launching more legal action. Now fresh compensation cases are set to begin here, with tens of thousands of British women to be asked if they could be potential victims of the drug nicknamed ‘the silent Thalidomide’. As well as causing a rare cervical and vaginal cancer, and possibly breast cancer, in the daughters, and potentially grandchildren, of the women who took it long ago, DES is also being blamed for causing fertility problems. The drug, a synthetic copy of the female hormone oestrogen, was created in Britain in 1938, and was soon being prescribed to millions of women around the world. Dominique Albert, 40, lives with her husband Dom and three daughters in Bristol. She found out she had been exposed to DES when she was a teenager and miscarried when she was 29. She told the Independent on Sunday it was tiring having to educate GPs on the effects of DES, and made her feel paranoid. 'It has been a battle for me,' she said. 'DES . daughters are at risk of (breast) cancer over 40, yet my GP said I . can't have regular breast examinations because I am not 50.' She will have to pay for private check-ups as a result. Mrs . Albert said her mother felt guilty even though she didn't know she was . putting her daughter at risk. She herself is worried that her own . daughters may suffer. Doubts about the wisdom of using it surfaced in 1953, when an American study showed it caused more, rather than fewer miscarriages. But it was not until 1971 that US authorities told doctors to stop prescribing it - after it was found that one in a thousand of the daughters of women prescribed DES had developed the cervical and vaginal cancer ‘clear cell adenocarcinoma’ (CCAC). And it was only in 1973 that British doctors were advised to stop prescribing the drug. The Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology has suggested 7,500 British women took DES, but there are other claims that up to 300,000 could be at risk. Figures suggest that daughters of women who took the drug are made 40 times more likely to develop the cancer CCAC, often when young adults. The cancer is fatal in more than a quarter of cases. One study suggested that breast cancer risk is also doubled. It will be impossible for many possible victims to find out, of course, whether their mothers or grandmothers used the drug. Research on rodents has lent weight to the fear that DES dangerously alters DNA not only in the individual taking the drug, but also that those changes are passed on at least two generations. Washington DC lawyer Aaron Devine, who is representing the 80 American women currently seeking compensation, is due in Britain in a fortnight to arrange a search for potential victims here. The first woman in Britain found to have suffered as a result of DES taken by her mother is Heather Justice, 59, of Jarrow in Tyne and Wear. She was diagnosed with vaginal cancer aged 25, then went through a hysterectomy and other surgery. Records showed her mother had taken DES in the 1950s, but because she did not know which company produced it, has been unable to bring legal action. Mrs Justice said: ‘One of the problems is that unlike Thalidomide, where you see the problem the minute the baby was born, women who took DES had healthy babies. ‘Problems were hidden until the teens and twenties, by which point we were forgotten about. When I asked my mum what she had taken, she didn’t even remember the name of the stuff. It is a complete and utter minefield.’ Among others who believe they have been afflicted in Britain are Janet Hall, 61, of Bournemouth - whose mother died from lung cancer aged 32 – who had to have much of her cervix removed when she was 20. She suffered a miscarriage, then had two daughters. One, Hannah, 26, has had pre-cancerous cells found in her cervix, she said. Mrs Hall said: ‘I feel guilty for my girls. It messes with your mind; it makes you ask why you had to have children.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health spoke of having ‘every sympathy’ for self-proclaimed victims, but said: ‘With regard to compensation for people who believe they have been adversely affected by this drug, this is a matter for the manufacturer(s) and/or the UK licensees of the drug.’","Recent study found drug doubled risk of breast cancer in DES daughters aged over 40 .

'The bus driver committed suicide, there is no other . indication other than it was a suicide case,' police spokesman . Micky Rosenfeld said. However, al-Ramouni's brother, Louy, said there was . no way his brother, the father of two young children, would have . killed himself and said there were marks on his body that . suggested he had been killed.

"Yes chef: Prue Leith has warned rare steak could be off the menu in British restaurants due to over zealous councils . The prospect of a rare steak could become even rarer in British restaurants, an influential British chef has warned. Food guru and critic Prue Leith blames local council officials for trying to enforce rules designed for factories and fast-food chains, which demand meat is cooked through, on small restaurants. She said: ‘I can see a day when you have to go to France to get a rare steak. 'The same for pink duck breasts, liver or kidneys.’ Miss Leith, a judge on the BBC’s hit cooking series ‘Great British Menu’, added: ‘If you have a really good chef, or course he is going to be good about making sure he is not poisoning anybody. 'Of course, he will be highly aware of hygiene and how bugs grow. 'Almost always when there is a food poisoning scandal, the reason is simple hygiene rules. 'People have left food sitting in a warm kitchen for four hours or have used the same knife - simple stuff.’ Her comments come as top chefs admit they are defying pressures from health inspectors to prevent them from serving rare meat to customers. Officials are instructing restaurants they should no longer serve duck breast or liver pink and that beef burgers and kidneys must not be bloody, to prevent food poisoning. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) states that poultry, as well as liver and other offal, should not be served pink or rare but be cooked thoroughly, and served steaming hot all the way through to kill off any bacteria. Critic Prue Leith blames local councils for trying to enforce rules designed for factories and fast-food chains, which demand meat is cooked through in restaurants . This advice is only guidance, as restaurateurs are required only to ensure their food is safe by law. But the guidelines are increasingly being raised by environmental health officers during restaurant inspections, putting pressure on chefs to comply. But chefs argue they are better qualified to judge when meat is safe and are continuing to serve the dishes to their diners’ request, despite the risk of prosecution. Alex Jackson, head chef at the Dock Kitchen, in Ladbroke Grove, west London, said he had ignored advice from council officers to stop serving chicken livers pink. He said: ‘It is a difficult issue. But you would have uproar if people were stopped from eating rare meat for the sake of a few dodgy restaurants. ‘It is frustrating to be told what . you can and can’t cook. We tend to ignore it. You often find that you . know more than the people who are telling you not to.’ Chef Michael Caines, of two Michelin star restaurant Gidleigh Park, on Dartmoor, said: ‘It is ridiculous, to be quite frank. Ridiculous: Michael Caines, head chef of Gidleigh Park in Devon, said we are living in a Draconian state . 'We are in a Draconian state where we are being told by everybody what to do because people don’t understand what it is we’re doing. ‘If you’ve got a nice piece of fresh liver, it is handled correctly and you are cooking it on the outside, if it is served medium rare I don’t see whey that would be a risk to anyone. Equally the customer has the right to choose.’ Richard Turner, head chef of Hawksmoor, the specialist steak restaurants in central London, said he was prepared to go to court to defend the right to serve steak rare. He said: ‘Westminster Council has told us we can no longer serve our burgers rare, which is possibly right. 'But . for meats that aren’t being played around with, as long as it is from a . good source, it is ridiculous to say you cannot eat it rare. 'To say we could not cook duck medium rare would be ridiculous - we have been doing it for 20 years now. 'If they tried to tell us we could not serve steak rare we would probably have to go to court - we would lose our business.’ Last . night the FSA defended its guidelines saying it was important to cook . poultry, pork and minced meat thoroughly to prevent food poisoning. Richard Turner, head chef of Hawksmoor, said he was prepared to go to court to defend the right to serve steak rare . An FSA spokesman said: ‘It’s safe to eat rare beef and lamb steak because searing the outside surface of a piece of steak will kill any bugs that might have contaminated the outside. ‘However, the same doesn’t go for minced products like burgers. 'This is because any bugs that may have been on the surface of the raw meat will be spread throughout the burger when the meat is minced, so any pink meat may still contain harmful bacteria, whether raw or in a burger that’s cooked on the outside.’ Andrew Wadge, chief scientist at the FSA, added: ‘While I love eating out and enjoy a rare steak as much as the next person, I also accept that there is a serious risk from eating some undercooked foods. ‘We don’t make up cooking times to frustrate creativity in the kitchen. They’re there for an important reason and are the result of careful consideration. ‘I think the FSA and local authorities to get the balance right between letting chefs do their jobs and protecting public health.’","Critic Prue Leith blames local councils for trying to enforce rules designed for factories and fast-food chains .

"Beefburgers cooked rare can remain on restaurant menus after a judge rejected claims by food watchdogs that they are a health risk. A wine bar and restaurant chain had been told to stop serving the burgers unless they took certain safety precautions. The ruling by Westminster City Council, backed by the Food Standards Agency, would have set a precedent across the country. Perfect serve: London-based restaurant chain Davy¿s had been told to stop serving rare burgers but appealed against the decision . But the company – London-based Davy’s – appealed against the decision and district judge Elizabeth Roscoe backed its policy. She said: ‘There is a balance to be struck between ensuring the safety of the public and allowing them the freedom of choice that they would wish and have a right to expect.’ The decision will be welcomed by food critics, such as Charles Campion and Prue Leith, who have lambasted efforts by Britain’s food police to ensure meat is cooked through. The council wanted Davy’s beef supplier to sear and shave the outside of whole cuts of meat to remove any harmful bugs. Good vet could save it: The ban was put in place as Westminster City Council, backed by the Food Standards Agency, ruled it was not safe to serve 'rare' meat . Davy’s argued that its suppliers could be trusted to supply beef that could be safely eaten. But Westminster council’s food safety chief James Armitage warned of a health risk. He said: ‘There is an emerging trend of eating beef mince raw or rare in all sorts of premises. Most of them don’t have the appropriate controls in place. ‘This is a ticking timebomb. Somewhere, someone is going to go down with E.coli O157 and there could be a very nasty  outbreak. We are not saying burgers should not be eaten rare  or medium – merely that they should be prepared in a way that makes them as safe as practicably possible.’",London restaurant allowed to serve 'rare' beef burgers again .
"Villagers scored a major victory over the wind farm and green lobby yesterday. A High Court judge ruled their right to preserve their landscape was more important than the Government’s renewable energy targets. Mrs Justice Lang said building four 350ft turbines would harm the character and appearance of a beauty spot on the edge of the Norfolk Broads. Artist's representation: THe proposed Hemsby turbines would have powered 5,000 homes . The proposal from Sea & Land Power and Energy had already been rejected by both council and government inspectors. In what will be seen as a landmark ruling, the judge agreed, saying lower carbon emissions did not take ‘primacy’ over the concerns of the people of Hemsby. Maria Ellis, a landscape gardener who petitioned against the turbines, said: ‘This has been hanging over us for ages because the company kept proposing it over and over again which just smacked of arrogance. ‘Norfolk is renowned for its open skyline which has inspired stories and poetry and literature. The site is on a hill between two villages and we already have wind turbines to the north, west and east. ‘It is overdevelopment, you can’t cover the hills and dales in turbines.’ Tory MP Brandon Lewis, who lives in Hemsby, said: ‘This decision should really set a precedent for planning officers, inspectors and courts to give weight to the feelings of local people in protecting their environment. It really shows that local people who are organised and feel passionately can have an impact and make a difference. Extensive: Hemsby residents already have to put up with the Blood Hill . Wind Farm near their homes in Norfolk . ‘In Great Yarmouth, we have several wind farms nearby, and renewable energy is a huge part of our economy. Wind energy is important but it has to be in the right place and should not have a negative impact on the community or the countryside we love.’ The proposed wind farm was fewer than 300 yards from the edge of the Broads national park and around 800 yards from homes in Hemsby. Villagers said they feared over-development because there were already three wind farms within three miles. Ministers have made onshore and offshore turbines a central plank of their plans to plug Britain’s looming energy gap. At least 340 farms are up and running with many more planned. Suffolk-based Sea & Land had said their four turbines could supply 5,500 homes – or around 14 per cent of the energy needs of the Great Yarmouth borough council area. But the local planning inspector kicked out the bid, saying: ‘The development would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area because of its scale and location and the cumulative impacts of other similar developments.’ The inspector said the existing wind farms were ‘visually prominent in this simple, attractive, tranquil landscape with its scattered villages and farmsteads’. Sea & Land took the case to the High Court in London, insisting that the East of England had failed to meet its energy targets for 2010 and was unlikely to meet the Whitehall target to generate 17 per cent of energy from low-carbon sources by 2020. Yesterday Mrs Justice Lang backed the inspector, saying Sea & Land’s point about its 2009 proposal was ‘unarguable’. ‘I do not accept that the inspector ought to have disregarded the local landscape policies in the light of the national policies,’ she said. ‘As a matter of law it is not correct to assert that the national policy promoting the use of renewable resources ... negates the local landscape policies or must be given primacy over them. ‘This is simply a case of policies pulling in different directions: harm to landscape and the benefits of renewable energy. The inspector was required to have regard to both sets of policies and to undertake a balancing exercise.’ Yesterday Roy Pinnock, an expert in planning law at the firm SNR Denton, said the case may bolster other villagers fighting wind farm projects. ‘It shows planning is all about balancing competing interests, and there will be a complex web of considerations in each case,’ he added. ‘There is a great emphasis on renewables, but this shows no one can claim that any particular outcome is preordained and it’s crucial that developers make an irresistible case for their development.’ Sea & Land can now take the case to the Court of Appeal. Cally Smith, of the Broads Authority, said the turbines would have had a ‘significant and adverse impact on the protected landscape of the Broads’. She added: ‘This is not acceptable. There are other places which are better suited to accommodate development such as this.’ But Robert Norris of Renewable UK, the trade body for the wind industry, said the judge was wrong to suggest the case would have a wider impact. ‘It is absolutely vital for any developer to look at the impact on the landscape and wildlife before they can even think about going ahead with a project, but planners also have to consider the need to keep the lights on by generating electricity from sources that are clean and meet our carbon targets.’","Proposal for 350ft turbines rejected by council and government inspectors .

"The Post Office has launched its first festive advert in five years in an effort to bring more people in to its stores. The one-minute advert features comedian Robert Webb as the 'minister of Christmas' walking round a Post Office branch explaining their preparations for Christmas, which include longer opening hours and bigger parcel sizes. As he strolls around the shop, he bumps into singer Pixie Lott, with whom he poses for a selection of 'elfies', as well as Downton Abbey's Jim Carter, Amanda Holden and chef Gino D'Acampo.

As he walks round the store, Webb bumps in to various celebrities including singer Pixie Lott (pictured) The 'Get Christmas all wrapped up campaign' opts for a more humorous approach than the tear-jerking adverts of John Lewis and Sainsbury's. The advert will make its first TV showing during the breaks of the X Factor on ITV on Sunday evening. The group says that its Christmas campaign is designed to show people what its new branches can offer. The group says its Christmas campaign is designed to show people what its new branches can offer . The advert is the first to be released by the Post Office in five years and takes a light and humorous approach . The number of post offices has halved since the 1960s to about 11,500 across the UK. Peter Markey, chief marketing officer, said: 'It’s the first time that we’ve advertised on TV at Christmas for more than five years. Over a third of our revenues on postage come at Christmas.' The campaign is the first concerted drive by the Post Office to communicate its fusion of the digital and in-branch experience. 'We did a smaller campaign in the summer,"" said Mr Markey. 'But this is the first where you can really see where we’re going. It’s more consistent in tone.' Post offices have been a staple of British life for decades, providing a place for people to pay their bills, collect benefits, get their car taxed and buy stamps locally. The number of Post Office's in the UK stood at 11,742 at the end of June 2013. But over the past 30 years the number of post offices in the UK has almost halved. In 1981/1982 there were 22,405 Post Offices. In 1991/1992 there were 20,160. By 2001/2002 this had fallen to 17,584. In 2011/2012 the number stood at 11,818. The previous Labour government claimed that 6,000 closures took place before 1997, and blamed changes in behaviour for this decline. In addition, where local post offices used to be the only place to buy stamps, there are now many thousands of outlets across England and Wales where this is possible. The network lost £4 million a week in 2006/07 and doubled its losses in 2005/06, despite an annual £150 million subsidy from the government. About 16,000 branches served less than 30 people a week, and all rural branches were losing money. As such the government decided to close 2,500 branches, . The present Coalition government has made it clear that it wishes to see 'a strong and sustainable future' for the Post Office network with no further closures.

"William Hague today compares the euro to a ‘burning building with no exits’ as he warns that Europe threatens to become a ‘dividing line’ in the Coalition. The Foreign Secretary labels the currency a ‘historic monument to collective folly’ and calls for the EU to give more powers back to Britain. His attack — reprising comments he first made in 1998 — comes after José Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, warned the EU was facing its ‘greatest challenge’ and called for closer economic unification to tackle the debt crisis. British Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) has warned that the Euro crisis is 'a burning building with no exits' while European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso (right) described it as a 'baptism of fire' Amid growing speculation that Athens might be forced to abandon the single currency, he insisted that ‘Greece is and will remain a member of the eurozone’. But a split has opened up among eurozone countries over the details of Greece’s second €109billion (£95billion) bailout, with up to seven members calling for private creditors to do more. In a sign of growing splits within the British Government, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will today deliver a fiercely pro-European speech calling for greater unity and co-operation between countries on issues such as defence. In an interview with The Spectator, Mr Hague says: ‘It was folly to create this system, it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly. But it’s there and we have to deal with it. Crisis: Mr Barroso, pictured with EU foreign affairs representative Baroness Ashton, said the eurozone should push forwards with integration to avert the debt crisis . ‘I described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it. But there are no exits.’ Mr Hague adds: ‘There should be powers returned to this country. We should be clear in the Tory Party that that is where we are heading.’ The Foreign Secretary goes on to predict that Europe could be ‘in 2015 one of the dividing lines between the Coalition parties’. It was in 1998 that Mr Hague first described monetary union as a ‘burning building with no exits’. He contrasted this with the exits available from its forerunner, the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which Britain pulled out of in 1992. In a speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday, Mr Barroso said: ‘Today we are facing the biggest challenges this union has ever had to face – a financial crisis, an economic and social crisis, but also a crisis of confidence. ‘If we do not move forward with more unification, we’ll suffer more fragmentation. I think this is going to be a baptism of fire for a whole generation.’ Mr Barroso added that monetary union should be completed by economic union, and he sent shivers down the spines of eurosceptic Tories by hinting that more Treaty changes were needed. ‘It was an illusion to think we could have a common currency and a single market with national approaches to economic and budgetary policy,’ he added. Dominoes: A graph shows how likely France, Italy and Spain would be to follow suit should one of the smaller nations default . At a summit in Poland today, Mr Clegg will warn it would be a ‘disaster’ for Europe to become torn apart by the economic crisis. He will say: ‘The danger we face is of change leading to fragmentation. That we become divided, turning away from each other, both within the European Union and with our partners who are not, or not yet, members of it… that would be a disaster.’ But Mr Clegg will also warn against any moves which would allow the eurozone to take decisions which would affect Britain. ‘We cannot accept arrangements that would privilege the Eurozone as a decision-making body over the European Council,’ he will say.

In the South-West of England rainfall is not expected to be as high as the end of last week but river levels will be sensitive to further rainfall, the Environment Agency said. Met Office forecaster Laura Corrigan said: ‘The rain will ease and fragment for most places as we move through the day, but it will be quite persistent in north-east Scotland. ‘There is also a chance of windspeeds in the north-east of England and up into Scotland reaching between 35 and 40mph.’ Later this evening the eastern and southern coasts are likely to see ‘a few showers’, she added.

But just before 11am today, there were delays being reported on almost a dozen train routes - including London-Peterborough, Leeds-York, Gillingham-Rochester in Kent, and Southampton-Eastleigh. Last week many parts of the UK had to deal with the fall-out of heavy rainfall, with residents in Somerset Levels seeing increased river levels.

Zebra crossing: A woman shields herself from the rain under an umbrella while walking in Birmingham today .

The Met Office forecast for the next five days says it will be wet and windy in north-east Scotland, but rain will ease elsewhere and it could be sunny in places. While Met Office experts suggest that more unsettled conditions are typical for autumn, its outlook for November to January says 'spells of wet and windy weather may be more frequent than is typical'. Last year's winter was the wettest on record, with the UK hit by 486.8mm (19.2in) of rain between December and February, narrowly above the previous record of 485.1mm (19.1in) set in 1995. Temperatures are likely to be milder than average for the first part of the outlook, although colder weather is predicted for January, with the outlook adding: 'The risk of occasional colder outbreaks increases later in the period'. Researchers have suggested that the jet stream, which carries weather systems to the UK from across the Atlantic has become stronger, bringing sea temperatures and windspeeds which could lead to a particularly wet winter.","Five flood warnings as well as 15 flood alerts in place for Britain today .

"An eyewitness at the violent argument between Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber has said that the 37-year-old actor took a running jump at the pop star before throwing the first punch. Model Anastasia Skolkova told the Daily Mirror that Orlando, who was dining with Leonardo DiCaprio at the Cipriani restaurant on Wednesday night, was 'very, very angry' when Justin, who didn't have a reservation at the eatery, approached their table to try to talk to the actors. The Wolf Of Wall Street star DiCaprio had proceeded to shoo away the pop singer with his hand, leading Bieber to provoke a fight which saw Bloom jump over a sofa to get at the 20-year-old Baby singer at the restaurant where Lindsay Lohan and P Diddy were also dining. Scroll down for video . Not the first time: An eye witness says there was more than one punch thrown during an altercation between Justin Bieber and Orlando Bloom in Ibiza . Bust up: Onlookers claim Justin Bieber provoked the fight with Orlando Bloom that led the actor to run and jump over a sofa to get at him . The eyewitness, who also took a video of the Bieber and Bloom fight, said: 'He got up and . started running. Then he jumped over the sofa.' Justin supposedly became angry when fellow diner Leonardo 'flicked . him away' with his hand as he approached their table. 'Bieber . said something to DiCaprio - I don't know exactly what, because it was . seven or eight metres away. Leo brushed his hands at him, like, I don't . care what you say. Yeah, he flicked him away.' Taking a minute before deciding what he . was going to do, Orlando wasn't going to let anything get in his way as . he made a beeline for the singer. Video phone: The eye witness says onlookers got their phones out to see Orlando throw another punch at Justin Bieber . Ding, ding: An eye witness told one newspaper that there was more than . one punch thrown between Lord Of The Rings actor Orlando Bloom (left) and pop singer Justin Bieber (right) 'When everyone thought . everything was quiet, they tried to fight again. Both tried to throw . punches,' she continued telling the Daily Mirror. Anastasia, who was quick to share her video of the . fight on Twitter and Facebook, says that the actor was being cheered on . by his A-list pals, including Dicaprio, when the fight broke out. She remembers the Baby singer provoking the first punch. Anastasia, . who had been sitting near to Orlando's table where he dined with Dicaprio and a large group of friends, filmed Bieber allegedly . yelling, 'What’s up, b***?' to Bloom in the video. She . added: 'When Orlando punched Bieber, everyone . started clapping. Lindsay was laughing. It was amazing. The whole table . he and DiCaprio were on were clapping. Afterwards, I don't know if . people were congratulating Orlando or trying to calm him down. 'When . security saw that when they got separated, Bieber and Orlando tried to . punch each other again, security were like, 'Bieber came, Bieber . provoked this fight', so they took his hands behind his back and took . him away from the restaurant.' Both men were clearly riled up and while Lohan intervened to calm the Baby singer outside when the fight spilled out onto the street, the Lord Of The Rings actor left after failing to settle down. Round one: Orlando Bloom can allegedly be seen to throw a punch at Justin Bieber, but the source says it wasn't the only one . Friends in high places: Lindsay Lohan and Leonardo DiCaprio, who are both currently holidaying in Ibiza, were said to be cheering Bloom on during the scuffle . She said: 'There were actually two moments when it turned violent, it wasn't just the one punch thrown.' The two men met by chance at the Spanish eatery, but appear to have a common connection in Orlando's estranged wife Miranda Kerr. One . version of the event hears that 20-year-old Bieber told Orlando he had slept with . Miranda, whom he first met at a Victoria's Secret show in 2012, to prompt him . to hit the singer. Justin told Orlando to 'Say hi to Miranda for me!' just moments after the actor tried to punch him, one onlooker told MailOnline. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Bloom 'never looked at her [Miranda] the same', after rumours of a hook-up between her and Bieber at the 2012 Victoria's Secret show in New York (a year before the couple announced their marital break-up). Squaring up: Justin has been accused of provoking Orlando to throw the first punch . Representatives for Bloom and Bieber have refused to comment on the restaurant fight, despite the in-depth eye witness accounts. Meanwhile, Bieber has continued to provoke the English actor by posting a picture of his former wife Miranda in a bikini with a crown symbol caption, followed by a picture of Orlando Bloom wiping his eyes as if to cry. Miranda on the other hand, has used Instagram to prove that she's not getting involved. Posting a series of model shots from recent campaigns and a sweet mother-son picture with the couple's little boy Flynn Bloom, the former Mrs Bloom can be seen to turn her back on the whole situation.

She added: 'The babies always have fun at the cake smash sessions, some may not like the texture of the cake but love the taste, others may love the texture and making a mess but prefer not to eat the cake, it's all part of the fun! 'The tub time at the end of the shoot is always a huge hit, all babies love the bubbly fun and always have lots of smiles for the camera.' Asked why she thinks so many parents have embraced the concept, Lauren said: 'Let's face it every parent loves to see their child having fun. This is exactly what cake smash and tub time sessions are about, parents love to watch their baby explore and taste the cake which always results in fun, creative and sometimes messy photos. 'Babies aged one have very short concentration spans therefore the cake smashes allow them to do what babies do best…explore!' Fun: Photographer Lauren Murphy believes the concept has been popular because the babies get to have fun while the parents get a memorable photo. Pictured is Macy Gordon . Caught on in the UK: The trend started in the U.S before coming here and has moved on to include bath time as well as cake smashing . The photographer charges £95 for her cake smash package which includes tub time and two prints. The cake, handmade outfits and balloons are included in the price and the shoots take place at her state-of-the-art studio. It might seem like a lot to pay on a one-year-old's birthday but parents who have done it said they thought it was worth it. They and their child had a fun experience, while they also have photos to last a lifetime. Jennifer Muir from Burnside, Glasgow, booked a session for her son, Blake. She said: 'I wanted do to something special to celebrate Blake's first birthday. I considered having a party however I just felt that at such a young age he wouldn't understand the concept that people were there for him. The bath element means babies can get cleaned up after getting covered in cake and provides the opportunity for more adorable pictures, as demonstrated by Orla Ogilvie, pictured . Double cuteness: Twins Callum and Connor celebrated their first birthday with a smash and splash party . Ready for action: Photographer Lauren Murphy captures the first birthday parties at her studio in South Lanarkshire . 'The cake smash and splash was perfect as he is so inquisitive so he didn't think twice about getting stuck into the cake. We all had a great day, the cake was delicious and I will have photographs which I will treasure forever.' Another fan is Claire McKinney, from Glasgow, who said: 'The cake smash and tub time was a fun way of capturing my daughter, Lottie, when she is happy - an enjoyable pleasant experience for both of us.' Meanwhile Amy Pearson from Coltness, Wishaw, whose daughter Orla Ogilvie had a cake smash and splash shoot when she turned one said: 'We loved the idea of something different rather than the original photos everyone gets done.'

"Painter Vincent van Gogh may have been murdered, according to a gunshot wounds expert who has analysed vital forensic evidence . Painter Vincent van Gogh may have been murdered, a leading forensics expert has claimed. The long-held theory that the troubled artist shot himself in a wheat field near Paris in 1890 may have to be reconsidered after the shocking claim. Dr Vincent Di Maio, an expert on gunshot wounds, reassessed vital evidence from van Gogh's shooting and believes the painter could not have shot himself in the chest. Dr Di Maio, a key witness in the trial of George Zimmerman - the man who was accused of shooting US teenager Trayvon Martin, used evidence and testimony from the time to come to his conclusion. According to Vanity Fair, the forensics expert told Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith - who have long believed that van Gogh did not commit suicide - that the painter's fatal wounds did not look as if they were self-inflicted. According to the son of van Gogh's physician Paul Gachet Sr, Paul Jr, the wound had a 'brown and purple halo around [it]'. Previously historians thought that the purple area was caused by the proximity of the gun to van Gogh's chest and that the brown colouring was caused by gunpowder burns. Speaking of the 'purple halo', Dr Di Maio said: 'In fact, this is subcutaneous bleeding from vessels cut by the bullet and is usually seen in individuals who live awhile. Its presence or absence means nothing.' He added that the brown ring was simply 'an abrasion ring and seen around virtually all entrance wounds. It just indicates an entrance'. Dr Di Maio also called into question how van Gogh would have been able to shoot himself in the left side of his chest with the revolver he is alleged to have used. 'It would be extremely difficult to shoot oneself in this location [i.e., on the left side] with the left hand. The easiest way would involve putting one’s fingers around the back of the grip and using the thumb to fire the gun,' he said. Vincent van Gogh, who painted The Starry Night a year before his death, was thought to have committed suicide . The troubled painter was believed to have shot himself with a revolver in a field outside Paris - until now (pictured: The Fields, by van Gogh) 'Using one’s right hand is even more absurd. You would have to put the right arm across the chest and again place one’s fingers on the back of the grip and use the thumb to fire the gun.' The forensics expert added that the painter would have had scorch marks on his hand if he had shot himself at such close range, which no testimony from the time suggests was the case. Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith previously claimed in a biography of the painter that he did not kill himself . Dr Di Maio's final conclusion read: 'It is my opinion that, in all medical probability, the wound incurred by Van Gogh was not self-inflicted. In other words, he did not shoot himself.' Mystery remains over who, if not himself, van Gogh's shooter was. It took 29 agonising hours for the artist to die, just days after he had ordered more paints - suggesting he had no intention on taking his own life. Police are believed to have investigated the shooting briefly but no records remain of what they found. Whispers around the village of Auvers-sur-Oise, where van Gogh lived and died, at the time of the painter's death suggested that he was killed by 'young boys'. In the 1930s, Scholar John Rewald travelled to Auvers to ask residents who lived in the village at the time of the death what they knew. Some said van Gogh was shot accidentally by a group of boys and that the painter chose to protect their identity by saying he had tried to commit suicide. Mr Naifeh and Mr White Smith put their theory to a curator at the Van Gogh Museum, in Amsterdam, who told them: 'I think it would be like Vincent to protect the boys and take the ""accident"" as an unexpected way out of his burdened life. 'But I think the biggest problem you’ll find after publishing your theory is that the suicide is more or less printed in the brains of past and present generations and has become a sort of self-evident truth. 'Vincent’s suicide has become the grand finale of the story of the martyr for art, it’s his crown of thorns.'","Forensics expert says Vincent van Gogh could not have shot himself .

"The murder rate in global violence hotspots has declined by more than 40 per cent in 15 years thanks to better policing and a lower tolerance for disruptive behaviour, experts have revealed. Murders in England and Wales have dropped by eight per cent, in Scotland by 19 per cent and in Northern Ireland by a staggering 61 per cent, new figures show. It means, the murder rate in England and Wales is now at its lowest level for 36 years, while the homicide rate in the United States is at its lowest in 40 years. Data by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reveals the vast number of countries where murder rates fell by 40 per cent or more between 1995 and 2010 (above, dark green) and those where crime increased (red) The graphic shows the top ten countries which have seen the biggest decrease in murder rates since 1993 . The data, which will be presented at the first Global Violence Reduction Conference in Cambridge this week, shows how murder rates have been declining since the mid-1990s in many parts of the world. Nations as diverse as Estonia, Hong Kong, South Africa, Poland, and Russia have seen average recorded murder rates drop by 40 per cent or more and out of 88 countries where trend data could be found, 67 showed a decline in homicide. Only 20 showed an increase between 1995 and 2010, the analysis of data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime revealed. Experts believe the drop in murder rates could be part of a wider trend which has seen improved policing strategies, tighter surveillance, and a lower tolerance for violent and disruptive behaviour from an earlier age, be rolled out in many countries. Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Centre for Violence Reduction at the University of Cambridge, said: 'Examples of successful homicide reduction over the past 15 years can be found across the world: from Canada and Italy to New Zealand and China. 'But if we want to achieve a worldwide decline in homicide we need to learn from these success stories and understand what they did right. Murder rates have been declining since 1995 in many parts of the world. The latest figures (displayed above in a graphic showing the areas with the highest murder rates) show how rates have dropped by about 40 per cent . 'Evidence from many places in the world suggests reductions in violence by about 2.3% per year - needed for a 50% drop in 30 years - are feasible and realistic.' He emphasised that the figures did not yet show an overall global decline because some countries - primarily Latin American - have seen recent increases in the number of murders committed which may offset the overall picture. However, he said that many European, Northern American and Asian countries have shown a steep decline in murder rates over the past two decades, and the lessons from these nations need to be built on. He added: 'In London, the risk of being murdered has declined by a staggering 99 per cent from the late Middle Ages to the present day. 'In the last ten years alone, the number of homicides in London has been cut in half, from around 200 in 2003 to less than 100 in 2013, for example - making it one of the safest cities in the world.' In England and Wales, the murder rate has dropped by eight per cent to 1.04 per 100,000 population since 1995. In Scotland, the rate has dropped by 19 per cent to 1.8 per 100,000 population and in Northern Ireland it has fallen by 61 per cent to 1.4, according to the data. Experts now believe that global rates of violence could be halved by 2040 if the right policies can be defined and implemented. Analysis shows that societies with the highest murder rates in Latin America, Africa and Asia – such as El Salvador, Congo and Russia – suffer from a mix of corruption, highly profitable illegal markets, low investment in public health and education, and an ineffective police force that is not trusted by the citizens. 'Making the state more legitimate in the eyes of its citizens, the police more effective and accountable, and promoting the rule of law will be critical to achieve a significant decline of violence,' Eisner said. Professor Lawrence Sherman, director of the University of Cambridge's Institute of Criminology, added: 'An accountable and effective police that are trusted by civil society is indispensable.'","Murder rates fell by  40 per cent in some countries between 1995 and 2010 .
Of 88 countries, 67 have shown decline in homicide while 20 have increased .

"The skeleton of a child lies inside a small coffin after it was washed out of the ground by heavy rain in Italy. The mangled ossuary was one of an estimated 70 coffins that were swept away from a cemetery in Genoa this weekend leaving bones and skulls strewn along the banks of the Polcevera river. And as the bad weather finally began to clear, workmen began the grim task of retrieving the bones and putting them back together so they can be re-interred where they were first laid to rest. Scroll down for video . Washed up: The skeleton of a child can be seen inside a small coffin washed out of the ground by heavy rain in Italy . It comes as at least four people were killed in landslides triggered by torrential rain in Swiss-Italian border, a day after floods in southern France killed five people. In the rain-drenched southern Ticino region of Switzerland, two people died and one was critically injured when a mudslide slammed into a small residential building. On the other side of the border, a pensioner and his granddaughter were killed when another landslide engulfed a house on the Italian shores of Lake Maggiore. Three other family members survived. Those landslides were the latest of many to recently have hit northern Italy and southern Switzerland amid incessant rainfall over recent weeks. The Italian Liguria region has been doused with as much rain in the first 15 days of November as it normally gets in an entire year. Grisly: The grisly image was one of an estimated 70 coffins that were swept away from a cemetery in Genoa this weekend leaving bones and skulls strewn along the banks of the Polcevera river . Bone collectors: And as the bad weather finally began to clear, workmen began the grim task of retrieving the bones and putting them back together so they can be re-interred where they were first laid to rest. Grim: About 70 burial niches and ossuaries ended up in the river after the wall of a cemetery collapsed following heavy rains . The tragedies also came a day after storms in southern France left five people dead, when their cars were swept away in flooding. In one heartbreaking case, rescue workers managed late Friday to drag a father from his car, lodged on a bridge submerged by torrential rains, only to see the vehicle with his wife and two young sons still inside torn away by the raging water. In Switzerland, the bodies of two local women, aged 34 and 38, were pulled on Sunday from the rubble of the three-story apartment building in Davesco-Soragno, near Lugano, after being hit by the mudslide, police said. A 44-year-old Italian man, who was living with one of the women, had been dug out and taken to hospital in a critical condition, police told reporters. Just across Lake Maggiore, a 70-year-old man died on Sunday after his house was partially buried in a 'sea of mud' unleashed after the rain-doused hill behind the building gave way. Another one: Firefighters recover a coffin carried away by the violence of water . Digging: But many of the coffins remain missing as the search effort continues . Collapse: This is the collapsed wall where the coffins had been interred. It comes as at least four people were killed in landslides triggered by torrential rain in Swiss-Italian border, a day after floods in southern France killed five people . Rescue workers managed to drag his 16-year-old granddaughter from the rubble after more than four hours of digging but she died later in hospital. Her parents and grandmother survived. The family's small, two-storey villa was the only property affected in Cerro, a hamlet on the outskirts of Laveno Mombello, a popular holiday spot. A neighbour described how he had been awoken during the night by a huge bang 'like fireworks', and seeing rescue workers and the girl's parents 'digging with spades, even with their bare hands'. 'It was a horrific scene,' the neighbour told Italian television. The tragedy means a total of 11 people have died in Italy in accidents related to the freak weather conditions in just over a month. That toll was expected to rise to 12 later Sunday as rescue workers continued to search for a man whose car was swept off the road by a torrent of water near the Italian Riviera's main city, Genoa. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking from the G20 summit in Australia, said the havoc wreaked by the heavy rain was the result of years of neglect of infrastructure. 'We have had 20 years of land management that needs to be scrapped,' he said.","Around 70 coffins were swept away from a cemetery in Genoa by storms .

"Morten Storm made headlines around the world after going public with his jihadist-turned-double agent life story, and now the Danish national claims that Australian jihadists should be prevented from returning to the country, labelling videos released by ISIS 'pornography'. Storm, 38, converted to Islam after spending time in prison and  falling in with controversial hate preachers such as Sheik Omar Bahri Muhammad in London and Luton, developing extreme jihadist views. 'I didn't have anything that I felt I belonged to because as a very young - in a very young age, I felt neglected by my parents,' he told ABC's 7.30. Former jihadist turned double agent Morten Storm claims that Australian jihadists should be prevented from returning to the country . 'I didn't have anything that I felt I belonged to because as a very young - in a very young age, I felt neglected by my parents,' said Storm . 'Islam was some kind of a structure, some - like a model way of life for me to follow, which I needed so badly. And I can tell you the first - when I just embraced Islam, I was a very, very happy person.' Storm then moved to Yemen in 2001 and grew close to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Anwar al-Awlaki. As he became trusted by fundamentalists, he met shoe bomber Richard Reid and, at one point, was offered the chance to meet Osama Bin Laden. 'This ginger-haired, white-skinned Westerner — a one-time juvenile delinquent, biker gang member and jailbird, now a convert to Islam — was a signed-up member of Al Qaeda, dedicated to the destruction of kuffars [infidels], particularly in the U.S. and Britain,' Storm said in his memoir.

'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world,' said Storm . Morten Storm helped intelligence agencies after a 'crisis of faith' led him to turn his back on radical Islamists and become an intelligence agent informing on jihadists within Britain. In an interview with BBC's Newsnight he said: 'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world.' 'I contributed to have some of the biggest terrorists removed from the face of Earth and many, many people have been imprisoned, evil people have been imprisoned because of my work,' Storm told 7 30. Storm has previously said that he was instrumental in helping track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, but that US authorities had denied the part he played, and refused to give him the $US5 million they had promised him, something Storm has been vocal about. After making headlines around the world with his story, Storm is now wary of being targeted by ISIS, who released a video declaring him a traitor. 'They will not give up. I mean, they will continue trying to get us. But they will fail, hopefully,' he told 7.30. Storm said that propaganda videos released by ISIS have a strong emotional impact on young Australian Muslims and that the Federal government should think about censorship. 'They are a extremely important propaganda tool and I hope that our governments will consider to ban them,' he said. These people get emotionally involved and emotionally motivated, and then once they see the victory and see how easily that ISIS is taking over villages and slaughtering their enemies, then they say, ""Well, that's - I want to be a part of that,"" and they feel that it's a religious duty to do that,' Storm said. 'They will not give up. I mean, they will continue trying to get us. But they will fail, hopefully,' he told 7.30 . 'They are a extremely important propaganda tool and I hope that our governments will consider to ban them,' Storm said . Storm said that the videos could be seen as a form of pornography for the gravity of impact they have on their intended audience in the Western world, as well as those already fighting. His words come on the heels of another verified video of the beheading of American aid worker Peter Kassig by ISIS. Storm said that the young men who have flown the country to fight with ISIS should be prevented from returning to the country. 'This is a war. These people have declared war against us. We are in a war… I think we should not allow them to come back,' Morten Storm told 7.30. Storm's life is rumoured to be brought to the big screen by Paul Greengrass, director of the Bourne Identity spy-trilogy, The Guardian reports.

"A company that operates at least 13 wind-energy facilities across three states is suing in federal court to block the U.S. government from releasing information to The Associated Press about how many birds are found dead at its facilities. Pacificorp of Portland, Oregon, is seeking an injunction in U.S. District Court in Utah to prevent the Interior Department from releasing information it considers confidential. The Obama administration has said it planned to turn over the material to The Associated Press, which sought it from the Interior Department in March 2013 under the US Freedom of Information Act. The government concluded that the industry's concerns were 'insufficiently convincing' to keep the files secret. No accounting: Dozens of eagles have been found dead at wind farms in Wyoming alone. Now Pacificorp, a major wind farm company, is working to keep the exact death toll secret . The information the AP sought was part of its larger investigation into bird and eagle deaths at wind farms and the administration's reluctance to prosecute the cases as it advocated the pollution-free energy source. The AP asked the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for data collected under federal permits given to companies to collect the carcasses of protected bird species, including eagles and migratory birds, found dead at their facilities. Using documents, emails and interviews with former wildlife officials, the AP in articles published last year documented more than four dozen eagle deaths in Wyoming since 2009, and dozens more in California, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and Nevada. Corporate surveys submitted to the federal government and obtained by AP showed at least 20 eagles found dead in recent years on Pacificorp wind farms in Wyoming. The wind energy industry has said more birds are killed by poisoning and collisions with cars, buildings and electrical wires. Wind energy companies objected to the AP's efforts to uncover more information about the numbers of bird deaths. The companies said the information was confidential, submitted voluntarily and should not be revealed under the government's open records law. Wind farm proponents argue that more birds are kill by cars and power lines than die colliding with wind turbines . Last month, the government informed Pacificorp and other companies that within days it intended to release some information to the AP. It said the harm the companies cited from the information's release was 'too general' and 'insufficiently convincing' to prevent its release. The lawsuit, filed October 17, said the disclosure will cause 'irreparable harm' to Pacificorp, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway. In the complaint, the company said withholding the information is in the public's interest because it will ensure 'open communication' between such companies and the government. A Pacificorp lawyer told the AP the company does not comment about pending litigation. Wind farms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30-story buildings, with spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet's wingspan. Though the blades appear to move slowly, they can reach speeds up to 170 mph at the tips, creating tornado-like vortexes.","Lawsuit brought against the US Interior Department after the Obama Administration said it planned to release bird kill records .

"British photographer Tim Plowden captures the diversity and wonder of Alaska's wilderness in his new series of photographs. From a peaceful lone moose to a river packed with pink salmon and the austere boreal forest to unpredictable glaciers, his month-long shoot offers the full spectrum of the Alaskan outback. Plowden, who grew up enjoying the Chiltern Hills of the south-east and volunteered as a nature reserve warden in Norfolk, travelled by boat, plane, four-wheel drive and campervan around the unforgiving 49th state of the US. English photographer Tim Plowden gets the attention of one of a herd of barren-ground caribou in his remarkable series of Alaska images . A brown bear appears relaxed just after plucking a salmon from the water beneath a waterfall in Alaska . Easy pickings for a hungry bear, beautiful pink salmon navigate a stream in strong numbers . A moose, officially the largest of the deer family with a potential height of more than two metres, quietly dines on native vegetation . He scoured the remote coastline, forests, mountains and tundra to shoot - with his camera, of course - some of the region's more elusive wildlife. Plowden's journey, which had no set itinerary, included encounters with feasting brown bear, a curious black bear, sea otters, a moose and a herd caribou up close and personal. While it all sounds like a fairytale for the young Englishman, and his images evoke the beauty and peace from the harsh environment, some less than tactical methods were sometimes employed, he admits. A spawned out fish carcass at the end of its journey will be food for a young fish or scavenger while a new day dawns over a rocky stream . A not-often-seen northern coyote, almost perfectly camouflaged by the vegetation, pauses for a brief enough moment to be photographed . This sea otter barely breaks the surface of the water as it swims through the cold Alaskan water . Sea otter's groom themselves diligently to remove salt crystals and excess oil from their dense coat . Plowden captures a salmon as it rises out of the running water of an Alaskan river . The caribou, not too dissimilar to the secretive roe deer which Plowden spent a year of early mornings and late evenings studying and developing his photography skills on in Nofolk in 2013, with one of his images winning the British Deer Society's 50th anniversary open photographic competition. 'I put my own knowledge and experience of photographing wild deer in England to the test in the high tundra of Alaska's interior wilderness,' Plowden said. 'Having driven a thousand miles in beautiful autumnal scenery I wanted to stop for a while and get out into the wild'. Tim stopped with a local family and headed out into the cold with the father, who was a licensed hunter and used to tracking the caribou. In a region dominated by the colours white and grey, the autumn colours of the boreal forest beam like the sun . The tale of a breaching humpback whale close-up as Plowden explores the remote coastline of Alaska . A harbour seal pokes its head above the water - while a cute creature the animal provides important meat and oil to native Alaskans . A curious black bear, not long out of hibernation, explores its surrounds in search of its next meal . At the other end of the mammal spectrum, a male Arctic ground squirrel surveys his surroundings on a pile of rocks . A river runs through this riparian coastal rain forest habitat . Tim comments: 'We came across a majestic bull and his harem of cows crossing one side of the mountainous valley to the next. 'As they were about to disappear over the other side of a ridge my host, who wanted me to get the shot I'd been talking about, used one of his tried and tested caribou calls: '""Hey a**hole! Stop!"" 'It did the trick; the bull stopped in his tracks and stared down as my host continued shouted out sporadic expletives as I tried not to collapse with laughter and to compose both myself and get the shot'.'

"'Enjoyed the attention': Helen Turnbull (pictured today outside court) admits kissing the 16-year-old boy during a brief affair as her marriage crumbled . A teaching assistant shared a passionate kiss with a 16-year-old boy in her Mini, a court heard yesterday. Helen Turnbull, 35, later told the pupil: ‘It was awesome – a proper turn-on. It made me shake.’ But she denied having sex with him during daytime liaisons in her car and said she lived in fear of her husband’s response if she was unfaithful. Turnbull – who allegedly groomed the boy with sweets and cuddles from the age of 12 – told a jury she was seduced by flirtatious messages from him during a low point in her marriage. He sent her messages on Facebook complimenting her figure and dress sense before she responded with images of herself wearing only underwear. Despite realising the developing relationship was ‘wrong’, the mother-of-two said she succumbed to the pupil’s advances when she shared the kiss with him in her Mini. Turnbull described the moment in a subsequent message to him as ‘explosive’, the court heard. She told the boy they looked ‘power’ when kissing, adding: ‘I checked us out in the car mirror.’ But when the schoolboy made it clear he was interested in having sex with her, she told him: ‘I am not like that.’ The victim was allegedly groomed by Turnbull at his Roman Catholic secondary school in Durham. In provocative messages, she allegedly asked him for ‘power sex’. Turnbull, wearing a plum-coloured suit, grey top, grey tights and grey shoes, admitted sending intimate messages when her children were in bed. She said she enjoyed the attention from the pupil, who is now 18. She told Teesside Crown Court: ‘There was no intention ever to act on the messages but it was what he wanted. ‘I wish now I had not sent them. It was just sexual chat, being able to flirt with somebody. I enjoyed getting the attention, especially when I was on my own. The children were in bed – it was the instancy of getting a message back and not feeling on my own. ‘The next day I would say it wasn’t right and try to end it.’ Trial: Teesside Crown Court (pictured) has been told that Turnbull and her husband Ben have since divorce . The tearful literary assistant denied that the relationship had developed into a sexual one, telling the court: ‘I have never had sex with him.’ ‘I have never done anything sexual other than kiss him. I have said this from the very beginning, it just has not happened.’ The court heard how her marriage broke down when her affair with the teenager came to light. Turnbull, from Haswell, County Durham, explained how her relationship with the boy developed in June and July last year during a study break at the end of the summer term. In a series of messages online, her conversation with him became increasingly flirtatious, with him writing: ‘I miss you so much.’ ‘He paid me little compliments about my clothes and about my physical appearance,’ she said. ‘I didn’t expect anything to happen. I tried to stop it and I would say for him to find someone his own age.’ She began to cry before continuing: ‘In terms of my job I knew it was wrong. I tried to stop it but sometimes I felt lonely and felt unhappy. ‘I just felt so low and it was nice to have someone to get a reply from and to go back and forth.’ Earlier, the court heard how the teaching assistant had changed her Facebook profile picture from one of her three-year-old daughter to an image of her ‘cuddling’ the boy during a drunken night at the school prom. Her husband also told the court he became suspicious after seeing a comment beside the picture in which she asked the boy whether she should wear an ‘itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini’ on a school outing. Turnbull denies three charges of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but has admitted a fourth, relating to kissing. The trial continues.

"New York’s latest spectacular riverfront attraction looks set to be a $170 million island park and open-air performance space on the Hudson River. The grand scheme, called Pier 55, was announced on Monday and the majority of the funding for the project will be provided by billionaire Barry Diller and his fashion designer wife Diane von Furstenberg. The 2.7-acre park will be built on an undulating platform jutting about 180-feet into the Hudson at West 14th Street, not far from the lower end of the highly popular High Line urban park. An artist's rendering shows the proposed park and performance space to be known as Pier 55, in the Hudson River on the lower west side of New York. The park will be built on an undulating platform jutting about 180-feet into the river . Pier 55 will look more like an island than a pier and will sit atop 341 concrete columns that will range in height from 70 feet above the water to 15 feet above - roughly the minimum required post-Hurricane Sandy . Pier 55 will look more like an island than a pier and will sit atop 341 mushroom-shaped concrete columns that will range in height from 70 feet above the water to 15 feet above, roughly the minimum required post-Hurricane Sandy. The undulating form is also an attempt to address environmental issues. It will allow more sunlight to come through for fish in an area that has been designated a marine sanctuary. Two pedestrian walkways from a widened West Street esplanade will take visitors to the free-to-all park which has been designed by British firm Heatherwick Studio and landscape architect Mathews Nielsen. The park will replace the narrow and crumbling, flat-topped structure of Pier 54. That is where the steamship Carpathia brought survivors of the sunken Titanic 102 years ago and the rusty Cunard arch that stands at the foot of the pier will be restored to maintain a link with the past. Diller, chairman of the New York-based media company IAC/Inter-ActiveCorp, and the Hudson River Trust made the announcement on Monday. He and von Furstenberg, have agreed to provide $140 million to build and maintain the attraction through their family foundation. The city will provide $17 million for the project while the state will offer $18 million for an adjacent esplanade. As well as grass and trees, the park will have three venues to play host to arts events and performances under the direction of a team headed by Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin .

The rusty Cunard arch that stands at the foot of the existing Pier 54 will be restored to maintain a link with the past . ‘We are deeply appreciative of the generosity of great New Yorkers like Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg without whom this visionary project would not have been possible,’ said NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. 'I have always loved public spaces,' said Diller. 'It’s entirely my fault that this has become so ambitious. We will fail in our ambition, outsized or whatever it may be, if this doesn’t feel completely like a park and completely like a performance space.' 'New York has always reminded me of Venice, so I am happy the time has come to properly honor its waterways,' added Von Furstenberg, 67. The park's three venues will host arts events and performances under the direction of a team headed by Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin, whose screen credits include The Social Network and Moonrise Kingdom. Most entertainment events will be free or low cost. No city approval is needed for work to begin on the park and the Hudson River Park Trust will now undertake a 60-day public review and comment period. The trust board is expected to green-light the plan in early 2015. Esplanade construction is to start in 2015 and on the pier in 2015, with completion in late 2018 or early 2019. Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg are also the single largest private donor to the High Line, the elevated park that has spurred residential development and international interest in the meatpacking district. The couple have both also built architecturally distinctive corporate headquarters in the area.

"A woman who fled with her eight-year-old daughter a decade ago during a custody dispute turned herself in Monday to face trial. Genevieve Kelley of Whitefield disappeared with her daughter, Mary, into Central America in the fall of 2004 after her attempt to prove her ex-husband had harmed the child backfired. The U.S. Marshals Service investigated numerous tips through the years. Shortly after her daughter turned 18 in February and was no longer subject to the family court, Kelley, 50, made contact. On the run: Genevieve Kelley, of Whitefield, disappeared with her daughter, Mary, into Central America in the fall of 2004 after her attempt to prove her ex-husband had harmed the child backfired . Back in the USA: Kelley turned herself in Monday in Lancaster, New Hampshire, and was arrested however it is unknown where her second husband, Scott, is. He believed to have been involved in the plot to fee . Her lawyer said she wanted to face a jury on her custodial interference charge. She said her daughter is safe. Kelley accused her ex-husband, Dr. Mark Nunes of abusing their daughter. Nunes has denied the allegations and charged his ex-wife was attempting to prevent him from contact with his daughter and seeking to damage his career. Local law enforcement came to believe Kelley had mistreated the child and awarded full custody to Nunes. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children requested the assistance of the U.S. Marshals in the investigation on behalf of the Whitefield Police Department and the Coos County Sheriff's Office. U.S. Marshals over the years have searched for Genevieve and Scott Kelley in the United States, Canada, as well as Central and South America. The effort to find Mary Nunes intensified early this year after she turned 18. In August, the case was featured as the U.S. Marshals 'Fugitive of the Week' here in New Hampshire. Fruitless: The U.S. Marshals Service investigated numerous tips through the years. Shortly after her daughter turned 18 in February and was no longer subject to the family court, Kelley, 50, made contact . The local effort coincided with the nationally televised story of Mary Nunes and her kidnappers being aired on the CNN program hosted by John Walsh, 'The Hunt' on August 31. In the end, police felt Kelley's ex-husband, Mark Nunes, was unfairly accused. He was never charged with a crime. Kelley turned herself in Monday in Lancaster, New Hampshire, and was arrested, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said. He said her lawyer and Coos County Attorney John McCormick were arguing bail. Mark Nunes hasn't given up hope of being reunited with his daughter and hopes to learn more about her. 'Is she alive? Is she safe?' he said Monday. It wasn't immediately known if Mary Nunes was in the courtroom. In an interview last week, Kelley's lawyer, Alan Rosenfeld, said his client would likely appear on her own first. 'She wants to be vindicated,' Alan Rosenfeld said. 'She wants a trial.' Rosenfeld, a Colorado attorney who specializes in child advocacy and domestic violence cases, had asked prosecutor McCormick twice this year if he would agree to recommend to a judge that Kelley voluntarily return and not be jailed unless she is convicted. He said she would not be a flight risk, but McCormick disagreed, noting she left in the middle of a family court proceeding in 2004. Caught in the middle: Kelley accused her ex-husband, Dr. Mark Nunes of abusing their daughter. Nunes has denied the allegations and charged his ex-wife was attempting to prevent him from contact with his daughter and seeking to damage his career . Still missing: The whereabouts of Mary Nunes, now 18, remain a mystery. Her mother claims she is 'safe' 'She fears there's a chance she'll be held, a fear that's probably well founded,' McCormick had said. Rosenfeld had said if things didn't work out, 'she's just going to show up unannounced one day.' Mary Nunes, presumably, would be a witness at the trial, he said. 'She was old enough to know what was going on,' he said. Mary was 7 when her father last saw her. 'I am happy that Genevieve Kelly is in custody and will face justice for these charges, but we will all be the happiest, when we know Mary Nunes is safe,' U.S. Marshal David Cargill Jr. said.","Genevieve Kelley disappeared with her daughter, Mary, into Central America in the fall of 2004 .

"The brutal video of the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig and at least 18 Syrian servicemen is being examined after an Australian is suspected to be have been involved in the latest ISIS attack. Australian counter-terrorism officials are carefully looking over the video and images which for the first time identifies the Islamic State executioners carrying out the mass execution - as previous culprits have disguised their faces with hoods. Foreign fighters were reportedly involved in the brutal atrocity as French officials have confirmed one Frenchman's involvement and a possible second executioner is yet to be confirmed.

The French executioner has been identified as Maxime Hauchard, 22, who left northern France to go to Syria in August last year. It is also believed that possibly an Australian, a Briton and also a Dane took part in the mass beheading, 7 News reported. Featuring in the video is an ISIS fighter speaking with a London accent who is believed to be Jihadi John - the man who is understood to be responsible for previous hostage killings. Welshman Nasser Muthana from Cardiff is also thought to be among the killing squad. The decapitation and moments before Kassig's death was not captured on the video - unlike the footage of Western hostages who previously suffered the same horrendous fate by the hands of ISIS militants. Another distinct difference to previous Westerns slayings was there were no direct threats made against other Western hostages. The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The confronting footage shows the prisoners marched out in a file line as the jiadists each take a military knife and make the prisoners kneel down before they are decapitated.

"Intelligence chiefs are poring over footage of Isis executioner 'Jihadi John' to establish if he really has been injured in a US bombing raid - but have received 'no evidence' so far that he was among those hit. The British killer, who orchestrated the horrific video showing the beheading of 16 Syrian soldiers and the severed head of American hostage Peter Kassig, was said to have been wounded in the air strike on a convoy reported to have included Isis mastermind Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But MailOnline understands that intelligence officers have no confirmation yet that he was on the convoy – or that he had been injured. The Foreign Office has said it was aware of the 'report' that he may have been injured but is awaiting confirmation. The news comes as new footage emerged showing Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - the London rapper who was suspected of being 'Jihadi John' until intelligence chiefs ruled him out - blasting police tactics while being interviewed by an Australian news channel during the 2011 London riots. Scroll down for video . Militant: Intelligence chiefs investigating claims ISIS killer 'Jihadi John' (pictured) had been injured in a US bombing raid have received 'no evidence' so far that he was among those hit . Murdered: The murder of American aid worker Peter Kassig (pictured) this weekend was reportedly in revenge for the air raid on November 8. In the murder video, Jihadi John appears not to be injured . Significantly the murder of former US ranger Kassig – the fifth killing of a Western hostage 'Jihadi John' is shown taking part in – appears to have been filmed after the US airstrike on November 8. The militant shows no obvious sign of injury and there has been speculation the killing of the Muslim convert was in revenge for the convoy strike. Security officials also say it is unlikely that 'Jihadi John' would be allowed to travel with the ISIS leadership because his voice is so well known from the death videos where he spouts sickening jihadist propaganda. Voice recognition technology used by both British and US Special Forces could potentially identify him in a convoy triggering drone attack. This weekend is was claimed that the masked 'executioner' narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group's leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday. Sickening: The latest ISIS video showed a group of Syrian soldiers being marched along a desert road in Dabiq and brutally murdered by a large number of unmasked militants . Unsettling: The video also shows the mass murder of Syrian military personnel by beheading led by Jihadi John at a desert location. Unlike the murder of Western hostages, the killing of the Syrians is shown in full . This weekend it was claimed that Jihadi John had been injured in an airstrike targeting a convoy driving near the Iraqi town of Al Qaim, close to the Syrian border the previous Saturday. It was claimed that both he and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been among a group of senior militants who attended a secret, heavily guarded meeting in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in the town. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to a well-placed Syrian source. A source speaking to the Mail on Sunday claimed that Jihadi John goes by the name Jalman Al-Britani and that he and the rest of those injured in the airstrikes - including Al-Baghdadi - were transported to a hospital in the city of Deir-ez-Zour. It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. ISIS members apparently issued urgent calls through the local mosque's loudspeakers, appealing for the town's residents to donate blood at the hospital. The raid on November 8 was also thought to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) Sickening: Jihadi John (right) was filmed murdering American journalists James Foley (left) in August, and Steven Sotloff (right) in September . Jihadi John was also responsible for killing British aid workers David Haines (left) and Alan Henning (right) The news comes as a new video emerged of  Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - the 24 year old Britain who was once the main suspect to be Jihadi John. Although Bary is known to be fighting alongside ISIS in Syria, and photographs have previously shown his posing with severed heads in the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, intelligence chiefs are understood to have since ruled him out as the man in the terror group's filmed murder videos. The footage - shot by 9News  on Saturday 6 August 2011 when rioting first broke out outside Tottenham police station - shows former rapper Bary in an agitated state as he rants to reporter Peter Stefanovic about police tactics. In footage aired today's 9News bulletin, Stefanovic is seen interviewing another man before Bary commands control of the microphone. 'Let me tell you something. The police are protecting the police station, they're not protecting the people,' Bary said. 'A policeman said it out of his own words when I asked him 'why are you here'...He said I'm here to protect the police,' the rapper turned Islamic extremist added. Nine News reporter Peter Stefanovic (right) spoke to Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (left) back in 2011 . Bary took over when Stefanovic was interviewing another man on the first night of riots in Tottenham . Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary abandoned his burgeoning career as a rapper after becoming increasingly radicalised by extremist Islam and is believed to have travelled to Syria last year . Stefanovic told 9News he met Bary on the first night of the riots on the streets of Tottenham in North London. 'There were hundreds of young people loitering near a burning building that police and firefighters were trying to control,' he said. 'There was a lot of friction and tension simmering on the streets and this group of young men crowded around me as I was filming a piece-to-camera.' Bary abandoned his burgeoning career as a rapper after becoming increasingly radicalised by extremist Islam and is believed to have travelled to Syria last year. Earlier this year, he posted a photograph on Twitter of himself holding up a decapitated head with the message 'Chillin' with my homie or what's left of him'. The photograph is understood to have been taken in the terror group's de facto capital city Raqqa. Bary is the son of Adel Abdul Bary - an Egyptian who recently admitted playing a role in the deadly Al Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. Appearing in an American court in September, the 54 year old pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make a threat to use an explosive device, making a threat to use an explosive device, and conspiracy to murder Americans.","Intelligence experts say they cannot prove militant was injured in US strike .

"A couple who spent five years living in a tent as they built themselves an eco-home have been allowed to keep it, despite not applying for planning permission because it was 'against their principles'. Matthew Lepley, 34, and his partner Jules Smith, 54, left their home in a north London tower block and moved to the Devon countryside after buying a 20-acre field near Beaworthy. Dreaming of 'living at one with nature', the couple spent five years sleeping in a tent and living off the land while they constructed a one-bedroom eco-cabin - complete with compost lavatory - from wooden crates, scrap metal and lorry tyres. Home sweet home: Jules Smith, 54, and partner Matthew Lepley, 34, have been told they won't have to tear down their Devon home, despite having no planning consent . The Government planning official who decided to allow the couple's home to stand said he was impressed by their dedication to and passion for sustainable living . Eco-friendly living: The couple's house, which took five years to build, lies in their own 20-acre field in Beaworthy, and has no electricity . Living at one with nature: The couple gave up their home in a north London tower block five years ago and moved to Devon in search of the good life . The couple, who shunned power tools and did all the work by hand to cut their carbon emissions, refused to apply for planning permission because they said the process wasted paper and used too much energy. But their dream was left hanging in the balance when neighbours complained the tumbledown timber dwelling was unauthorised. Mr Lepley and Ms Smith, both of whom were carers before they moved to Devon, were sent an enforcement notice from Torridge District Council ordering them to 'remove' it from their field in Beaworthy, Devon. But, in a landmark ruling, planners have praised their 'passion' and 'commitment' to sustainable living, and told them the cabin can stay. Despite previous cases of people shunning planning laws being prosecuted, the couple has now been granted permission to leave it untouched for at least three years. Government planning inspector Gareth Symons said the couple's approach 'sits very comfortably' with new rules issued by the National Planning Policy Framework, which encourage builders to use natural materials to minimise waste and carbon emissions. The house has an upstairs bedroom, outdoor compost lavatory, kitchen/diner and bathroom, as well as an underground food store because there is no fridge . Don't stand up! The couple, who were carers in Wood Green, north London, before they moved, have an upstairs bedroom lined with wood . Initially the couple were told by Torridge District Council that they would have to tear their home down, but they have now been granted a reprieve . Mr Symons described their efforts to live a frugal life at one with nature as 'admirable', and said forcing the pair to leave the handmade home could have a 'devastating impact' on them. He said: 'It would be very difficult to flaw the passion the appellants have to achieve their permaculture aim, a key part of which is living with nature on the land. 'I am convinced about the genuineness and commitment of the appellants. They are not individuals who simply wish to have a house in the countryside.' The pair run a smallholding on their land which, if it proves financially viable, may entitle them to retrospective planning permission when the three-year stay elapses. Their utopian dream to escape the rat race began five years ago when they quit their jobs as carers and Wood Green tower block and moved to their newly-acquired 20-acre field. They made foundations from old tractor tyres filled with gravel, while the walls and roof were built from discarded haulage pallets and railway sleepers. But their . refusal to use power tools meant that it took them five years to . construct the small dwelling which boasts one bedroom, a bathroom with . woodfire-heated bath, and an underground storage chamber.  It has no electricity, and food is kept underground to keep it cool. The . couple grow their own fruit and vegetables, have a compost heap for a . toilet, and draw water out of the ground with a bore hole. Neighbours . were initially supportive of their ambition to live a self-sufficient . lifestyle on the remote woodland plot, but when the couple revealed . plans to turn their rustic retreat into a conservation business, hosting . workshops in green engineering and 'permaculture', locals changed their . tune and complained to the local authority. Back to basics: The rustic bathroom in the Devon eco-home is supplied with water heated by a wood-fired tank . No en-suite here: The couple have an outdoors compost toilet which is accessible by a pathway made out of discarded wooden pallets . Build on-going: Mr Lefley and Ms Smith spent five years living in a tent while they constructed their eco-home without using power tools . The couple have won a three-year stay of execution at their remote, home-made home, which they have called Silent Haven . Mr Lepley said: 'We wanted to build a home that would let us truly live as one with nature.  This life is not for everyone but we love it - it enables us to live a therapeutic lifestyle and be self-sufficient. 'We took the decision to build without planning permission because the council's procedure is not environmentally friendly enough and it goes against our personal principles.' A separate application for Mr Lepley to pay the council's costs was also dismissed. Local residents are 'furious' at the decision to let the couple stay in the wooden house. One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'If that was me, and I built any sort of addition to my house, the council would come down on me like a tonne of bricks. I had to get permission for my conservatory and it took me so long, but I did it. 'Now this couple get to come along and just build what they want, with the council unwilling to do anything. It's disgusting how some people are treated one way, and others another.' Another said: 'It is all well and good them building this so called 'green home', but that doesn't mean they should be allowed to do it without permission. 'There are laws in place for a reason and for them to be completely ignored is unfair on everyone else who has stuck to them over the years.'","Matthew Lepley, 34, and Jules Smith, 54, left London five years ago to build their dream house in the countryside .

"A WOMAN died after accidentally shooting herself in the head while adjusting a gun she kept in her bra holster. Christina Bond, 55, a former US navy officer, was looking down the barrel of the .22-calibre revolver when she accidentally pulled the trigger and shot herself in the eye. She was airlifted from her home in St Joseph, Michigan, but died from her injuries in hospital. Fatal: Christina Bond, 55 (photographed), fatally shot herself in the eye on New Year's Day . Miss Bond, a body builder who won the Miss Michigan Figure Overall Championship in 2013, joined the navy from school. The accident happened on New Year’s Day, but police only released the details surrounding the shooting on Wednesday as part of a post-mortem inquiry. Mark Clapp of St Joseph Police, said: ‘She was having trouble adjusting her bra holster and couldn’t get it to fit the way she wanted it to. 'She was looking down at it and accidentally discharged the weapon.’ Carrie Lightfoot, owner of the Well Armed Woman store, told the USA Today newspaper that bra holsters were growing in popularity.

Leading pharmaceutical companies are 'giving up' on a cure for Alzheimer's after the failure of several high-profile trials. Drug firms are scaling down the search for new Alzheimer's treatments after spending millions on late-stage trials which have collapsed in the past five years. Last month Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson pulled the plug on the experimental drug bapineuzumab after the failure of two high-profile clinical trials. Scrapped: Drugs companies have lost millions in recent years on failed Alzheimer's drug trials . Both said they had scrapped plans for further studies of the drug in its injected form. Shares in the companies fell after the news was announced. Eli Lilly, which is developing a similar drug, also took a hit. Dr Eric Karran, science director at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, believes some form of public-private drug initiative may be needed to meet the massive cost of large patient trials. Dr Karran said pharmaceutical companies were becoming less willing to gamble on dementia treatments. A number had scaled down their neuroscience teams, notably Astra Zeneca. The company, which once had a 300-strong neuroscience task force, now ran a 14-person 'virtual' team in Boston that co-ordinated research done by others but conducted none itself. 'It's a legitimate concern,' said Dr Karran. 'A company's role is to have a return on investment. Its board and shareholders exercise certain pressures; that's capitalism. U.S. firm Pfizer, along with Johnson & Johnson, are just two companies who have scaled down their search for Alzheimer's treatments . 'On the other hand the medical need is just massive. There's a societal need for these drugs, clearly. 'I think, rather than big pharma doing this by itself, there will have to be more public-private ownership of these massive trials. 'It will require a different way of thinking to bring these drugs forward.' A major problem is that currently there is no way to diagnose early stages of Alzheimer's disease in people who show no symptoms. The changes taking place in their brains can only be uncovered by pathologists after death. By necessity, trials to date have involved patients in whom the disease has already made significant progress. Alzheimer's is believed to begin with sticky protein deposits called amyloid beta plaques accumulating in the brain. This causes a cascade of events, leading to the destruction of neurons and as much as 30% of the brain's weight being lost. The process may begin 10 to 15 years before symptoms appear, scientists believe. In certain inherited cases, the onset of symptoms is much earlier but follows the same pattern. Researchers have been looking at drugs that reduce levels of the dangerous 'long' form of amyloid beta and delay progression towards symptomatic disease - possibly for the whole of a patient's lifetime. But they would have to be administered early, at the unsymptomatic stage. This presents enormous difficulties for conducting patient trials, said Dr Karran. New Alzheimer's treatments were essential to curb the soaring cost of the disease as people lived longer lives, he added. Dementia was already costing the UK economy £23 billion a year. 'Care is critical but it's very, very expensive,' said Dr Karran. 'Until we have drugs or other interventions that delay the onset of or slow progression of the disease there will not be enough money or carers to look after the number of people who have Alzheimer's. 'There has to be another solution for society because otherwise dementia and the social costs will escalate and one wonders how the country will be able to afford that.'","Charity calls for public-private funded trials .

"A U.S. Army paratrooper returned to Afghanistan late last year for his second tour of active combat duty less than two years after his left foot was amputated. Lt. Joshua Pitcher lost the foot after it was blown apart two years ago by a roadside bomb. It has since been replaced with a carbon fiber prosthetic that allows him near full mobility. The heroic 25-year-old overcame depression, heavy drinking and a 40-pill-a-day Oxycontin habit to return to the battlefield. Pitcher’s injury occurred only two months after he arrived in the war-torn Middle Eastern country, in April 2012, when he stepped off the road to urinate, he told the Washington Post. Hero: Joshua Pitcher, pictured left and right, returned to active combat duty with a prosthetic leg . A sound similar to a firecracker went off just as he zipped up his pants. ‘I looked down at my foot, and I was like, ‘Uh-oh,’ he recalled to the paper. He was soon airlifted to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, and only days later – despite not having a left foot – posted defiantly to Facebook. ‘I will return,’ he wrote, and then confided in others that he planned to return as a paratrooper. Pitcher was then transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for rehabilitation. ‘And then I just spiraled down into complete depression,’ he recalled. His recovery was progressing along until he demanded to be temporarily released for his then-fiancee Michelle’s college graduation. Just another day in the office: Pitcher grabs a seat for a minute while deployed in Afghanistan . Just one of the guys: Pitcher (second from left) pictured in Afghanistan with his platoon . ‘They said, ‘Josh, it’s too early. You can’t go,’ his father Randy told the Post. ‘’No, I am going,’ Pitcher responded, according to his father. ‘Take the damn IVs out of my arm, and I will prove to you I can go.’ The trip sparked an infection in his left leg, but it soon cleared up. Pitcher had gotten up early and was lifting weights the June 2012 day he was due to receive his prosthetic leg when doctors delivered devastating news, he said. He had another infection in his left leg, and it would require surgery. ‘That meant I had to wait another month, and that took depression to a whole new level,’ Pitcher said. ‘You are so tired of being in a wheelchair, so tired of being on crutches.’ Stood by her man: Joshua and Michelle Pitcher at their wedding last year prior to him being redeployed . Their big day: Pitcher recovered to the point he had a wedding free from complications of his amputation . The downward spiral caused him to suffer severe mood swings including ‘extreme anger,’ now-wife Michelle lamented. Pitcher also started convincing friends to take him to nearby bars where he drank heavily. He also began downing dozens of powerful Oxycontin pills a day, as many as 40, he recalled. The pills and drinking left him in a ‘zombie-like’ state, said Michelle Pitcher. His prosthetic leg came in July 2012, he was walking on it within a week. Three sessions per day in the gym helped him recover to the point he competed in the Army Ten-Miler, an annual race to the Pentagon. Pitcher could not sprint, but strapped on a backpack with 50 pounds of weights and jogged the majority of the way, he recalled. His determination led him to complete the Army Physical Fitness Test – 80 push-ups, 80 sit-up and a two-mile run – in only 14 minutes, 23 seconds. Pitcher ranked in the top 10 per cent among all active-duty soldiers. He was asked to join the U.S. Paralympics Team during a January 2013 snowboarding trip to Colorado. ‘No, I am staying in the Army,’ he replied. He kept his word: Pitcher attending Michelle's Eastern Kentucky University graduation while still recovering . Decorated: Pitcher being awarded the coveted Expert Infantry Badge by brigade commander Col. Tim Watson during a ceremony last year . Pitcher’s first test jump from a C-17 plane June 16 of last year caused him to worry if the prosthetic would hold up as he plunged back to land. ‘Keep your feet and knees together,’ he kept reminding himself – one of the first lessons taught to paratroopers. ‘He landed pitch-perfect,’ his proud father said, recalling the afternoon he spent in the landing zone. ‘At that point, he walked over and said, ‘Okay, I can do this.’ Pitcher was soon recommissioned into the prestigious 82nd Airborne Division. He was then redeployed to Afghanistan in November, and has led a platoon of 21 paratroopers into battle as if nothing ever happened to his foot - as if the prosthetic blade was never attached to his leg just below the knee. He is one of only 57 amputee soldiers to return to combat, and only the second paratrooper. Grueling combat duty does take its toll on Pitcher – he is not allowed to take Oxycontin anymore, the pain can sometime be excruciating. ‘You just have to accept it’s going to hurt and deal with it your own way,’ Pitcher told the paper from his post. He then jokingly took a knife and held it at the end of his ‘blade’ – like a bayonet. ‘If we get attacked, I will just kick.’ But he has also promised to retire if he gets another purple heart – the medal awarded to soldiers injured in the line of duty. For now, he is just another soldier prepping for his next mission.He returned.","Joshua Pitcher lost his left foot after a roadside bomb went off during his first deployment to Afghanistan two years ago .

"A thoughtful husband has given his wife a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create works of art of his family. Ernst Berlin came up with the idea for the unique gift after discovering a community of artists on the website Reddit. Determined to give his wife, Agnes, something special, Ernst contacted between 45 and 50 artists who had some of the most successful submissions on the site. Scroll down for video . Ernst Berlin (pictured with his nine-month-old son Jacob), from Chicago, has given his wife Agnes a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create unique works of art of his family . The artworks were each based on various photographs of the family supplied to the 23 artists for inspiration . Mr Berlin, 33, asked 50 artists to paint a picture of his son Jacob (above) and was pleased that 23 responded . Mr Berlin filmed his wife's reaction to the works - created by a range of artists - and posted the video online . Baby Bond: The images came in over a period months - and Mr Berlin liked them all, so he hung them all up . To his surprise, 23 artists replied. Ernst, whose nine-month-old son Jacob would also feature in the pictures, said he liked all of their works so much he couldn't turn them down. As an amateur photographer, Ernst, 33, decided to send the artists a selection of 40 pictures of his family, allowing them to choose which they would like to work with. Over a period of a few months, the images kept coming in. When her birthday came around, Ernst treated Agnes, now 34, to a three-hour-long spa treatment - allowing him to hang the works on the wall while she was out. Agnes' reaction was one of shock, with Ernst filming her response and later putting it on YouTube for friends and family to see. Mr Berlin, an amateur photographer, found the artists on website Reddit, and after initially asking the group  if anyone was interested, was surprised when submissions kept coming in over a period of several months . Mr Berlin's nine-month-old son Jacob became the star of the show - and featured in the majority of the pieces . The artists chose from 40 pictures altogether, such as this cute image of Jacob resting on his mother's belly . After receiving the final artworks back from the artists, Mr Berlin hung them around the house for his wife . Mr Berlin, 33, said: 'I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out' One of the artists chose to recreate this picture of Agnes and Jacob in hospital just after he was born . Mr Berlin sent a selection of adorable pictures to the artists, including this one of nine-month-old Jacob . He then waited over a period of several months for the artists' own creations to be returned to him . Jacob features in the majority of the artworks, which were given to his surprised mother on her birthday . Mr Berlin said the response to his idea from his family and friends has been overwhelmingly positive . The idea to approach the artists was a 'light bulb moment', according to Mr Berlin. Pictured: A photograph of young Jacob (left) and a replica artwork supplied by one of the artists which Mr Berlin found on Reddit . Mr Berlin, his wife Agnes and their son Jacob could be seen having fun in a park in one of the photographs . The same photograph was transformed by one of the artists on Reddit (above) and returned to the family . Ernst, from Chicago, Illinois,  said: 'I completely forgot about Reddit until I sat down and started brainstorming ideas for a gift. 'A light bulb went off and I remembered the community of artists. 'I gathered a group of around 45 to 50 artists and got in contact with them to commission the work. '23 replied - which was more than I expected - but I loved all their previous work so much that I couldn't say no to any of them. 'Honestly, I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out. 'The response has been overwhelmingly positive from friends and family.'","Ernst Berlin, from Chicago, contacted dozens of artists on website Reddit .

"Thousands of desperate Syrians including women and children are being turned away from showpiece refugee camps including one visited by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall just two months ago. In scenes which will be of huge concern to the Royal couple, Jordan has been forced to shut its borders to many of those fleeing its war-torn neighbour. It means those trying to escape remain stranded, and vulnerable to multiple dangers including shelling, disease and starvation. Charles, Prince of Wales, visited the King Abdullah Refugee Camp for Syrian refugees in March . The Prince of Wales and the Duchess came face to face with the huge human cost of the conflict at the King Abdullah park camp near the Syrian border on March 12. It was Camilla who described the situation as 'heartbreaking' but she praised camp staff, saying: 'They are doing a fantastic job'. Referring to almost two years of conflict in Syria, Prince Charles added: 'They have managed to cope with and deal with all these hundreds of thousands of refugees and it's very nearly the second anniversary. It's a desperate situation and the Jordanian people are so fantastic.' Now, however, there are clear signs that the humanitarian effort is falling apart, with the camps accepting just a handful of refugees a day. Jordan closed its northern border with Syria around 10 days ago, meaning the victims of President Bashar Al-Assad's murderous regime have to stay where they are. Oum Mhamad, a mother of six originally from the town of Deraa who did manage to get across two months ago, said: 'No explanation has been given to us for the closure by the Jordanians, but thousands of people are stranded in terrible conditions. My husband has been stopped repeatedly.' The Duchess of Cornwall joins young Syrian children on the third day of the couple's visit to the country on March 13 . The Royal couple were invited into a Syrian families container home, during a walking tour through the camp in northern Jordan, near the Syrian border . The desperately ill and the dying are among those being turned away, as well as those with serious battlefield wounds, said Mrs Mhamad. Many of those arriving at border villages like Nasib and Tel Shehab are young families with children including babies. 'They are under fire from the Syrian army all the time,' said Younes Abdallah, another refugee who had to leave the rest of his family behind. 'Food is running out very quickly, along with medical supplies,' added Mr Abdallah, saying that Jordan had even stopped providing basic foodstuffs like flour to southern Syria. Martin Cottingham of Islamic Relief UK, one of the charities working in Jordan, said: 'The number of Syrian refugees Jordan is hosting relative to its size is almost equivalent to the United States absorbing the entire population of Canada. 'The Jordanian people have been extraordinarily accommodating but the relief effort is stretched to breaking point, with aid workers forced to choose which refugees get help and which are left to fend for themselves.' So far, around half-a-million Syrian refugees have reached Jordan, with up to 1500 a day arriving since the start of the year. Jordan denies breaching international obligations by shutting its borders to refugees, while the United Nations and aid agencies have avoided public criticism of the kingdom.","Jordan forced to shut its borders to those fleeing its war-torn neighbour .

"Attacked: Patricia Hughes, 77, said she was knocked unconscious after thieves cut through a mosquito net attached to her bedroom window and sprayed her with a chemical . A British widow claims she was gassed by armed raiders at her holiday home in Goa before they stole £25,000 of money and jewellery. Patricia Hughes, 77, said that she was knocked unconscious after thieves cut through a mosquito net attached to her bedroom window and sprayed her with a chemical in the town of Cavelossim, in Goa, India. The widow has regularly holidayed at the destination over the past 20 years after her husband Brian, 56, suffered a fatal stroke, and she has stayed in the same apartment in the town for the last five years. On Saturday night, two weeks into her latest stay, she says thieves attacked her with the chemical spray and raided her safety deposit box. They stole £1,600 cash and valuable jewellery, the Express reports. Mrs Hughes, from Swansea, said: 'It's terrifying to think they were right by me, they took the keys off my bedside table to open the locked box which had all the money I have here. 'When I realised they had sliced through the mosquito netting and climbed into my room with a knife in their hand right next to my bed it shook me up a little. 'It could've been so very nasty.' The former council worker was unharmed in the incident and intends to continue her holiday despite the robbery. She said: 'I'm not going to run away just because of this.

"Bureaucrats in Europe could push the price of petrol up in the UK by 4p a litre by dictating 'green' fuel targets to member states. Under tough energy targets in a Brussels directive, 10 per cent of the energy used in the transport sector across the EU will have to come from biofuels or other 'renewable' energy sources rather than fossil fuel by 2020. But campaigners argue that the green initiative will just penalise motorists and taxpayers in Britain who are already struggling to keep their head above water in the current economic climate. Price hike: An EU directive forcing member states to cut down fossil fuel usage could cause add 4p a litre to petrol and diesel . Peter Carroll, of the FairFuel UK campaign, said: 'The absolute priority at the moment is getting petrol and diesel to an affordable level and anything that stops that from happening should be resisted. 'Many of our supporters have the environment at heart but before we can concentrate and invest in more environmentally friendly forms of transport, such as electric cars and better public transport, we need a secure economy that is stable and growing. Campaigning: Peter Carroll, of FairFuel UK, is calling for fuel duty to be cut . 'Environmentalists do themselves a lot of harm by beating motorists with a stick on price. All this does is harm the hardworking individual without bringing in any realistic form of long-term change. 'How does this help the nurse who needs to dig in to her own pocket to pay for petrol to visit patients in rural areas because her fuel allowance won't cover the cost of the journeys? It's very naive.' He added that as well as campaigning against the EU directive, FairFuel UK is also calling for the government to scrap the planned 3p price hike in August. Mr Carroll argued that the level of duty on fuel in the UK should be brought down to the significantly lower level of other European countries - around 26 per cent - before any further costs are landed on motorists. He added: 'Adding 3p per litre when the economy is on its knees, families are struggling to survive week by week and UK businesses are struggling borders on economic madness. 'A cut of just 2.5p per litre would boost growth by a much needed 0.33 per cent, create 175,000 jobs and crucially not harm Treasury revenues – the tax take on the stimulated economic growth compensates for the loss of Fuel Duty.' Biofuels come from a range of sources including plants, fermented organic matter, bacteria and bio waste and it is considered to be the most viable way of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. But the process is also very costly. A Brussels directive in 2003 first insisted that 5.75 per cent of the energy used in the transport sector across the 27 EU member states should be 'green' by 2010 but it then increased the target again in 2009 to 10 per cent by 2020. EU officials hope the tough targets will reduce dependency on oil-based fuels and help encourage an increased use of more environmentally friendly fuels. Hard hit: Critics argue it is average hardworking people who will be hit by the price hikes . But critics still argue now is not the time to be putting more pressure on EU member states that are trying to revive their economies. The move was described as 'insanity' by a leading campaigner for cheaper fuel Tory MP Robert Halfon. He told the Daily Express: 'This is insanity. This  stupid directive would force the Treasury to put another 3 or 4p on a litre. 'The Government is trying to keep fuel duty down, but now we have these European bureaucrats meddling to force up the price. Frankly, the Government should tell them where to go. 'How can we get our economy moving again when Brussels keeps inventing new taxes to destroy growth and jobs?'","10 per cent of transport energy must be 'green' by 2020 .

"A 10-year-old boy from Pennsylvania has been charged as an adult in the beating death of a 90-year-old woman who was in the care of his grandfather. Prosecutors in Wayne County said the boy, Tristen Kurilla, was visiting his grandfather, Anthony Virbitsky, in Tyler Hill Saturday, when county emergency responders got a call reporting the death of an elderly woman who has been in his care, Helen Novak. District Attorney Janine Edwards said in a statement that Kurilla's mother, Martha Virbitsky, brought him in to the state police barracks at Honesdale the same afternoon and reported that her son had told her that he had gone into the woman's room and she yelled at him. Scroll down for video . 'Pint-size killer': Tristen Kurilla, 10, pictured left and right with his mother, has been charged as an adult in the death of 90-year-old Helen Novak, whom he allegedly hooked by the neck with her cane . Crime scene: Helen Novak was killed inside her caretaker's home in Damascus Township, Pennsylvania . Tristen told his mother 'he got mad, lost his temper and grabbed a cane and put it around Novak's throat,' police said. Advised of his rights and interviewed by a trooper, he said he 'pulled Novak down on the bed and held the cane on her throat and then punched her numerous times,' authorities said. State police said the 10-year-old told them that he went to his grandfather and told him that the woman was 'bleeding from her mouth' but denied he had harmed her, but later told him that he had punched the woman and put a cane around her neck. Police said an autopsy performed Monday at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale indicated blunt force trauma to the victim's neck, and the death was ruled a homicide. Dr. Gary Ross also said the boy's account to police 'was consistent with the injuries he observed.' Tristen was charged as an adult with criminal homicide and aggravated assault, with the prosecutor's office noting that the crime of homicide 'is specifically excluded from the juvenile act' and therefore 'a juvenile who commits the crime of homicide is charged as an adult.' Tristen Kurilla was visiting his grandfather at his home in the 340 block of Sky Lake Road in Damascus Township when at around 10am Saturday he entered the room of Helen Novak to ask her a question, police stated. According to the child, the elderly woman yelled at him and ordered him to leave, reported The Times-Tribune. Difficult child: Tristen's mother told police her son has been having mental issues . The 10-year-old became upset at the woman's reaction, grabbed a wooden cane, came up behind her and hooked it around her neck, using the staff to pull her backwards unto the bed, police said. Anthony Virbitsky, 69, Tristen’s grandfather who has been looking after Ms Novak, went into her room at around 10.30am and found her breathing heavy and looking terrified. About 30 minutes later, the caretaker checked up on her again and found the 90-year-old unresponsive. When interviewed by police Saturday, Tristen Kurilla reportedly told a trooper: 'I killed that lady.' Temper tantrum: The 10-year-old (center) reportedly told police he flew off the handle when Novak, who has been in the care of his grandfather, yelled at him to get out of her room . Confession: The boy allegedly told police he 'killed that lady,' even though he was only 'trying to hurt her' The 10-year-old boy reportedly described how he pushed the cane into Novak's throat for several seconds and then punched her five times in the throat and the stomach. ‘I was only trying to hurt her,’ Kurilla allegedly told detectives. According to court documents cited by WFMZ, the boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, told police she ‘has had a lot of trouble with Tristen and that he has had some mental difficulties.’ Kurilla is being held without bail pending an October 22 preliminary hearing.","Tristen Kurilla, 10, charged as an adult in the beating death of 90-year-old Helen Novak .

"After being chauffeured to the University of Georgia in his luxury SUV and entering the football stadium to screams from the crowd, this star is given the best seat in the house. This isn't one of the players but someone far more important: Uga the dog. The English bulldog has been UGA's official mascot since September 2012 and with his notoriety comes a life of unimaginable luxury. Uga wears personalized Nike jerseys, travels in his own SUV with his own license plate and enjoys air-conditioned kennels - as well as plenty of attention from cheerleaders, players and fans. Scroll down for video . Celebrity: Uga the dog is the University of Georgia's football mascot - and a very pampered pooch . Life of luxury: Uga watches games from next to a bag of ice inside his air-conditioned kennel on the field . But he's not the first - he's from a long line of English bulldog mascots. One of his ancestors first became the school's mascot when former student Sonny Seiler, who was then at Georgia's law school, put a homemade jersey on his puppy and took him to a game in 1956. After the pooch appeared in the stands, the team asked him to be their official mascot. 'And so we named him Uga' after UGA, Seiler told CBS Sunday Morning. Following Uga's death, the Seiler family got a second dog - Uga II - and have been sharing their pets with the university football team and fans ever since. They do not get paid for lending their dogs to the team, although the pets do enjoy the perks of sponsorships. Today's Uga - Uga IX - lives with Seiler's son, Charles, who grew up with the dogs. All his: Uga has his own SUV at his owner's home in Savannah - in red to match the team's colors . Spoiled: The SUV has a personalized license plate for the dog, who is the ninth Uga to support the team . At home: He has his own bedroom, which is decorated with photos of his mascot ancestors . Wardrobe: He has a selection of personalized UGA jerseys that have been made by Nike . 'A lot of people say Uga's my brother,' he said. At his home in Savannah, Georgia, the dog has his own room with access to a yard through a doggy door. There are photos of his ancestors across the walls and football showing on a flat-screen TV. In his bedroom, he has an extensive collection of Nike jerseys made from the same material as the players' uniforms. Outside, he has his own red SUV with a personalized license plate, reading UGA IX. The vehicle is air conditioned so that he can travel the four hours to Athens, Georgia for home games in comfort. After arriving in Athens, he meets his fans before heading to the Uga suite, where he has a bath using baby shampoo before every game. He then rides onto the field in a golf cart before settling down in his air-conditioned doghouse next to a bag of ice - where his view of the game is only interrupted by a cheerleader popping by to pet him. Ancestor: Today's Uga is the ninth - the first ever Uga is pictured with his owner Sonny Seiler, who put the dog in a jersey and took him to a game in 1956. Afterwards, the team asked him to be the mascot . Family tradition: Seiler is pictured today, left. His son Charles, right, now owns the team's mascot . Fan favorite: Cheerleaders pet the popular pooch during a home game in Athens, Georgia . If his team wins, grinning players and fans line up to thank him - but if they lose, he's never the one who gets the blame, CBS reported. Although he is known as Uga IX to fans, he also goes by the name of Russ. He was first seen on the field in 2009 when he stepped in for his brother Uga VII, who became sick. Uga VIII then took over and passed away in 2011. Uga IX was ultimately named the official mascot in September 2012. 'Russ has endeared himself to the Georgia people over the last three years,' UGA Director of Athletics Greg McGarity said on the team's website. 'His dedication to duty when called upon has been exemplary and it's fitting that he takes his place in the official line of Georgia mascots.' When CBS asked the Seilers if they could appreciate that some people might find the dog's lifestyle silly, they were blank-faced. 'I don't understand your question,' the older Seiler said.

"She's only 14 days old but baby Azra has seen enough drama to last her a lifetime. Rescuers clapped and cheered as they pulled the infant alive from the rubble of the Turkish earthquake – almost 48 hours after the disaster struck. The youngster, whose name means 'maiden' in Arabic but also ‘help’ in Hebrew, survived despite being naked in freezing conditions. Her mother and grandmother were later plucked alive from the same collapsed building. Safe: Medics cradle Azra after she is plucked from the rubble . The tiny baby was wrapped in a blanket and taken to hospital . Television footage showed emergency workers applauding as the baby, Azra Karaduman, was removed from the hulk of crushed concrete and metal. A rescuer cradled the infant, who was then wrapped in a blanket and handed over to a medic amid a scrum of emergency workers and journalists. The baby was said to be in good health but was flown to a hospital in Ankara. And this afternoon, a ten-year-old boy was pulled alive from the rubble after an incredible 54 HOURS. Authorities yesterday said the death toll had risen to at least 432 in Ercis and the provincial capital, Van, as a result of the 7.2-magnitude quake on Sunday. There was a race against time to free dozens trapped inside mounds of concrete, twisted steel and construction debris. At least nine were rescued yesterday, although many more bodies were discovered. Authorities have warned survivors not to enter damaged buildings and thousands were spending a third night outdoors in cars or tents in near-freezing conditions, afraid to return to their homes. The baby’s mother, Semiha, and grandmother, Gulsaadet, were huddled together with the baby clinging to her mother’s shoulder when rescuers found them, emergency worker Kadir Direk said. There was a bakery at the ground floor of the building, which may have kept them warm, he added. He said Azra’s mother was semi-conscious but woke when he reached her. Amazing survival story: Baby Azra - 14 days old, naked and trapped in a collapsed building for 47 hours - is rushed to a waiting medical unit in Ercis, Turkey . Carefully carried to safety: A doctor carries Azra away from the ruins this morning. Her rescue gives hope to others whose loved ones remain missing . Double delight: Rescuers finally release the mother after plucking the baby from her arms . Family joy: Amid the terrible loss of life, Azra's grandmother is also rescued from the devastation . Azra’s uncle Senol Yigit watched the rescue from outside, sobbing: ‘It’s a miracle.’ He said: ‘I’m so happy. What can I say? We had lost hope when we first saw the building.’ Rescuer Oytun Gulpinar added: ‘Bringing them out is such happiness. I wouldn’t be happier if they gave me tons of money.’ But workers could not find the baby’s father and there were no other signs of life in the shattered building, he said. It was reported the family live in Sivas, central Turkey, but were visiting the girl’s grandmother and grandfather. Nine-year-old Oguz Isler was also rescued along with his sister and cousin, but last night he was waiting at the foot of the same pile of debris that was his aunt’s apartment block for news of his parents who remain buried inside. Freed: Rescuers free a teenager from a collapsed building in Ercis. Mesut Ozan Yilmaz, 18, who survived for 32 hours under the rubble of a tea house, said it was like 'the judgement day' Cutting through: Rescue workers spent a second night cutting and digging their way through shattered buildings in the hope of freeing survivors . Tale of two cities: Residents of Ercis, made . homeless by the quake, sit around a fire as lights illuminate a damaged . building behind them, while rescuers dig their way into a collapsed . building in Van . Still trapped: Yunus, a 13-year-old survivor in Ercis, remains caught in the rubble as rescuers work to free him. He was later successfully removed from the rubble and taken to hospital . Criticised: CNN Turk reported that emergency services, especially the Red Crescent service, had not provided enough shelter for displaced residents in Van and Ercis . Growing effort: Much-needed aid is being provided by several aid organisations. Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay, overseeing relief operations in Van, said: 'From today there will be nothing our people lack' Young survivor: A boy cries after being pulled from the remains of an internet cafe in Ercis. While the toddler sustained minor injuries, others in the cafe were not as lucky . Quake prone: Turkey is particularly susceptible to seismic activity, with four tectonic plates within its borders.

"Black Friday sends bargain-minded shoppers into a frenzy each year, but it's not even among the four best days for holiday deals, according to a new study. The experts at Savings.com analyzed more than 1.5 million deals offered by 25,000 retailers online and in store over the past five years, and found that the days with the most and deepest discounts vary according to what type of item you're shopping for. The prime time to purchase toys for your favorite child this year is November 26, two days before Black Friday, which falls on November 28. The second and third best days are December 8 and December 19, respectively. Scroll down for video . Best time to buy: Savings.com, a website that offers promotional discounts at retailers, analyzed more than 1.5 million deals over the past five years to determine the best days for holiday bargains . Fashion fanatics, meanwhile, should hold off on making clothing purchases until December 1, as Cyber Monday is the recommended day for apparel, followed by December 11 and December 18. However, those in the market for tech gadgets have already missed their prime shopping opportunity. November 1 had the best sales for electronics, with November 26 as the second best day and Black Friday as the third. But there's hope for procrastinators too. December 15 is the ideal day to snap up 'novelties', a category that includes popular gifts such as books, candy, wine and flowers. There are more bargains to be found in the days leading up to Christmas, with December 22 and 23 as the runners up. Meghan Heffernan, a Savings.com spokesperson, told MailOnline that deals have started earlier and earlier due to competition, with holiday promotions now peaking six to seven days before Thanksgiving. 'We believe we see items peak at different times based on proximity to Christmas and Black Friday and based on retailers leveraging the fact that lots of consumers are shopping for deals earlier in the season,' she said. Shop talk: Black Friday sales, such as this one at a Texas Walmart in 2013, may cause a frenzy, but new research has found that the annual event is not among the four days with the best holiday bargains . 'For novelties and gifts, shoppers often get the best deals as they typically peak closer to Christmas. Many of these types of gifts are usually purchased for co-workers and often times holiday travel forces consumers to buy these items earlier.' Although Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving, is generally regarded as the biggest date on America's shopping calendar, recent years have seen stores begin their sales on Thursday night. Macy's and Kohl’s have previously led the way for promotions to start early - opening on Thanksgiving rather than Black Friday. However, some leading stores have announced that they will not open on Thanksgiving amid anger that traditional time at home is being lost to shopping. A Facebook page called Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving and various other online petitions were formed to stop shopping on the holiday, and stores such as Costco and Nordstrom will now close so that staff can enjoy the day with family.","Savings.com looked at more than 1.5 million deals over the past five years .

"Belgians are known for their chocolate and waffles, while Hungarians are famous for their rich goulash. But now, a global study has revealed they are among the nations with the worst diets in the world. Meanwhile, Chad and Sierra Leone, in Africa, have the best diets, consuming the most fruit, vegetables, nuts and wholegrains. The study, which assessed the quality of diets around the world, found a rise in consumption of fruit and vegetables worldwide. Belgians are known for their waffles and their chocolate - and now a global study has revealed Armenia, Belgium and Hungary have the worst diets in the world . But this rise was outpaced by an increase in the consumption of junk food. The study, published in The Lancet Global health journal assessed the quality of diet in 197 countries, covering almost 4.5 billion adults, 90 per cent of the global population. Between 1990 and 2010 researchers found the greatest improvements in diets in high-income nations, with small reductions in the consumption of unhealthy foods and increased intake of healthy foods like fruit and vegetables. Despite this, people living in many of the wealthiest regions – such as the U.S. and Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand still have some of the poorest quality diets in the world. This is because they have some of the highest consumption of unhealthy food worldwide, researchers said. In contrast, some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in Asia – such as China and India - have seen no improvement in the quality of their diet over the past 20 years. The authors warn the study found a worrying picture, in which unhealthy eating habits outpaced increases in healthy eating patterns across most world regions. The countries with the healthiest diets overall were: . 1. Chad . 2. Sierra Leone . 3. Mali . 4. Gambia . 5.Uganda . 6. Ghana . 7. Ivory Coast . 8. Senegal . 9. Israel . 10. Somalia . The countries with the least healthy diets overall were: . 1. Armenia . 2. Hungary . 3. Belgium . 4. Czech Rebublic . 5. Kazakhstan . 6. Belarus . 7. Argentina . 8. Turkmenistan . 9. Mongolia . 10. Slovakia . As part of the study, a team of international researchers analysed data on the consumption of 17 key food items and nutrients related to obesity and major diseases like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and diet-related cancers. They looked at the changes in diets between 1990 and 2010 in countries around the world. They looked at three different diet patterns and gave each a score. The first was based on 10 healthy food items: fruit, vegetables, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, whole grains, milk, total polyunsaturated fatty acids, fish, omega-3s, and dietary fibre. The second was an unfavourable diet based on seven unhealthy items: unprocessed meats, processed meats, sugar-sweetened drinks, saturated fat, trans fat, dietary cholesterol, and salt. The third was an overall diet pattern based on all 17 food groups. The researchers assessed differences by country, age, sex, and national income, and gave each country a score between 0 – 100, with a higher score indicating a healthier diet. They found high-income countries ate more healthy foods than low income countries, scoring 2.5 points higher on average. However, overall, they had substantially poorer diets due to a higher intake of unhealthy foods – the average difference in score was -33 points. On average, older people and women seem to consume better diets. People in Tunisia, Barbados and Cape Verde eat the most fruit and vegetables, while Azerbajan, Slovakia and the Czech Republic eat the most unhealthy and processed foods, the study found . Several low income countries – such as Chad and Mali scored the highest for healthy foods, while European countries like Belgium and Hungary and republics of the former Soviet Union – including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan – scored lowest for healthy foods. Previous studies on the quality of diets worldwide had revealed large differences in quality between nations, but researchers noted such large differences were not seen in the new study, when overall diet was scored. The countries who scored highest for healthy foods were: . 1. Tunisia . 2. Barbados . 3. Cape Verde . 4. Mauritius . 5. Israel . 6. Quatar . 7. Cyprus . 8. Seychelles . 9. Mali . 10. Grenada . The countries who scored highest for unhealthy foods were: . 1. Azerbajan . 2. Slovakia . 3. Czech Republic . 4. Belgium . 5. Heilongjiang, a Chinese province . 6. Iceland . 7. Belarus . 8. Lithuania . 9. USA . 10. Russia . Dr Fumiaki Imamura, of the University of Cambridge, who led the research, said: 'By 2020, projections indicate that non-communicable diseases will account for 75 per cent of all deaths. 'Improving diet has a crucial role to play in reducing this burden. 'Our findings have implications for governments and international bodies worldwide. 'The distinct dietary trends based on healthy and unhealthy foods, we highlight, indicate the need to understand different, multiple causes of these trends, such as agricultural, food industry, and health policy. 'Policy actions in multiple domains are essential to help people achieve optimal diets to control the obesity epidemic and reduce diseases in all regions of the world.' Dr Dariush Mozaffarian, of Tufts University, U.S., and senior author on the paper, said: 'There is a particularly urgent need to focus on improving diet quality among poorer populations. If we do nothing, under-nutrition will be rapidly eclipsed by obesity and non-communicable diseases, as is already being seen in India, China, and other middle-income countries.' This analysis was performed by the Global Burden of Diseases Nutrition and Chronic Diseases Expert Group (NutriCoDE). NutriCoDE is an ongoing project assessing dietary information from more than 300 dietary surveys and UN Food and Agriculture food-balance sheets across the world.","Global study assessed diets and eating habits of 197 countries worldwide .

"In personal injury lawsuits, it can be notoriously difficult to establish whether a victim deserves compensation. Currently doctors are used to decide whether an individual has sustained injuries that have left them unable to work again, but soon, wearable devices such as Fitbit could partially inherit this difficult task. And a law firm in Alberta, Canada, is using the device to show what effects an accident has had on a client, marking the first time a wearable has been used in a courtroom. One law firm in Alberta, Canada, is using a wearable fitness device - the Fitbit (pictured) - to show the effects an accident has had on a client, marking the first time a wearable has been used in a courtroom . The idea is that a victim wears a Fitbit for a period of time, which monitors their activity, collecting quantifiable data that can be used by lawyers. Analytics firm Vivametrica has launched a service that involves the use of a wearable fitness device  in personal injury litigation, in order to count steps taken by a victim and formulate a ‘quantitative representation of the claimant's activity during their normal weekly routine.’ The person’s activity is compared to a database showing the average activity of the nation, with datasets weighted by age, gender, body mass index and wait circumference. ‘This offering provides quantifiable data backed by clinical research to support legal cases involving personal injury claims,’ it said. The data will not be used in isolation, but will instead be used alongside other legal assessment tools, the client’s perceptions in their own abilities, and other medical findings. Vivametrica claims that the method is non-invasive and provides ‘valid, objective and individualised information' for personal injury cases, which may be caused by car accident (illustrated) for example . A claimant wears a Fitbit for several months. Data is extracted, including the number of steps taken, elevation and sleep patterns. The person’s activity is then compared to a database showing the average activity of the nation, with datasets weighted by age, gender, body mass index and wait circumference. Data is used alongside other legal assessment tools, the client’s perceptions in their own abilities, and other medical findings. The company claims that the method is non-invasive and provides ‘valid, objective and individualised information.’ ‘The Functional Activity Assessment is objective and represents a real-world assessment of function,’ said Dr Richard Hu, founder of Vivametrica. ‘Appropriate use of individualised activity data collected by wearables provides the legal profession with methods for the early assessment of the strength of their clients' cases. However, MailOnline has asked the company if the method is completely fool proof, and whether a claimant could be deliberately less active than usual to try and tip the outcome of a case in their favour. McLeod Law in Calgary is using a wearable device in a bid to prove that a personal fitness instructor, who was injured in an accident four years ago, is forced to lead a less active lifestyle than someone of her age and profession, Forbes reported. Her lawyer, Simon Muller, said the device will support her story and instead of relying on clinical interpretation, it will gather hard data for entire days. She has been wearing a Fitbit for several months. Analytics firm Vivametrica has launched a service that uses a wearable fitness device in personal injury litigation, in order to count steps taken by a victim and formulate a ‘representation of the claimant's activity during their normal routine'. This can determine if their injury has negatively affected their life (illustrated) ‘We’re expecting the results to show that her activity level is less, and compromised, as a result of her injury,’ Mr Muller said. ‘Prior to this, legal teams representing personal injury cases had to rely on subjective, personally reported data from clients. ‘The Functional Activity Assessment closes the gap between what a client perceives and what is objectively verifiable. ‘Now that we have access to this invaluable health data, we anticipate that it will become an expected part of our practice.’ If the technique proves useful in court, wearables could one day be used in other types of legal cases, especially where insurers risk paying out large sums of money. This could lead to parties demanding data from Fitbit, or another wearable companies, to provide information about an individual. Matthew Perarn, of Claims Canada told Forbes that wearables could become a ‘black box’ for the human body over long periods of time.","Law firm in Calgary, Alberta is using a Fitbit to show effects of an accident .

"A dispute over organ donation is delaying the death of a brain-dead two-year-old girl who was taken off life support on Friday, two days after her stepfather fatally shook her, police said. Thaiya Spruill-Smith was pronounced dead on Friday night after suffering severe head injuries and internal wounds allegedly at the hands of her mother's 25-year-old husband David Adams. But the toddler remains hooked up to machines keeping her organs alive as her mother Teoka Spruill, 24, and father Terrell Smith, 26, argue over whether or not to donate her organs. Tragic: Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support on Saturday after suffering a brain hemorrhage . 'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. 'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.' Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.' There will be an autopsy on Thaiya's body as her death is the subject of a criminal investigation. Her death certificate will state Friday as her date of death, regardless. The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive. The two-year-old was rushed to Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, shortly before 7am on Thursday after her  mother noticed she was struggling to breathe. Despite numerous operations, doctors concluded Thaiya's injuries were too severe to overcome and she was taken off life support. It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of her stepfather that was investigated by New York City social services. Relatives have made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl as her mother's husband David Adams, 25, appeared in court charged with inflicting the fatal wounds. Anger: Her father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband . 'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable. 'She was very smart - very, very smart.' According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned. And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. Judge Michael Gerstein plans to upgrade Adams' charge from assault to attempted murder once Thaiya's autopsy has been carried out, the New York Daily News reported. Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died. 'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse. She was returned and the case was dropped, he said. The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions. Paramedics were called to the home in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn shortly before 7am on Thursday. According to Smith, she had already had the injuries for days. Spruill, Thaiya's mother, is the half-sister of Tiona Rodriguez, who was caught carrying her dead baby son in a plastic bag in Victoria's Secret last year, then aged 17.","Thaiya Spruill-Smith, 2, died on Friday after 'shaking on Wednesday'

"Mystery: Somerset County Council chief executive Sheila Wheeler has not been to work for three months, but the council is refusing to reveal why . Anger was growing today over a council's refusal to reveal the whereabouts of its £160,000-a-year boss who has not been to work in her flood-stricken county for three months. Pressure groups and politicians have called on Somerset Council Council to explain the absence of chief executive Sheila Wheeler after councillors revealed they had been threatened with legal action if they talk. Mrs Wheeler was first said to be on sick leave but it has since emerged that a row with a senior staff member could be a factor. She has been away from her desk since mid-November and has not played any part in the handling of the flooding crisis, the council's biggest ever peace-time emergency. But the chief executive and the council has been cricised after it refused to offer any explanation for the absence of Mrs Wheeler, who earns more than the Prime Minister. Councillors have also remained tight-lipped, saying they have been ordered not to reveal the reasons behind her absence. Justine Baker, the Lib Dem councillor for Bishop's Hull ward, said: 'We know part of the reason, but not the full reason. 'But . we've been told we're not allowed to tell anyone for legal reasons to . the extent we could be individually liable for legal action. We don't . know when to expect her back. 'Residents are angry that they're not being told anything and are accusing the council of a cover up.' Andrew Govier, Labour councillor for Wellington ward, added: 'All councillors have been told it must remain confidential.' It is understood the situation would be discussed tonight in a confidential session at the end of a full council meeting. Residents in flooded towns such as Moorland (pictured) have been told it make take until Christmas before their properties are repaired . Submerged: The flooded village of Moorland in Somerset, where the county council has faced its biggest ever peace-time emergency without its leader, who has been absent from work for the last three months . Call for action: Somerton and Frome MP David Heath (left) has asked Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (right) to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mrs Wheeler's absence . Questions have been raised as to the reasons behind her absence with a rumoured conflict with the Conservative leader of the council, John Osman, thought to be a factor. A request was made under the Freedom of Information Act in November asking the council to reveal e-mails between the pair, but they shed little light on the alleged row. It comes as a survey today suggested that flooding had cost businesses in Somerset more than £1.2million in just six weeks, according to the Chamber of Commerce. Somerton and Frome MP David Heath asked Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mrs Wheeler's absence. Mr Heath asked the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrew Lansley for a Commons debate on transparency and the use of public funds in local government. He said members of the council have been gagged by a confidentiality clause in their contracts. Just above water: A series of buildings almost completely submerged on the A361 to Burrowbridge, Somerset . Mr Lansley said he would not comment on the specific case, but said the Government was taking steps to simplify the process used for resolving disputes with senior council staff. The Taxpayers' Alliance said it was not fair to taxpayers or Mrs Wheeler for so many questions to remain about 'this sorry state of affairs.' 'Explanation needed': Yeovil MP David Laws (pictured) says the council needs to give a clear reason for Mrs Wheeler's absence . Somerset County Council originally said Mrs Wheeler was on sick leave and wished her a speedy recovery. In January, it said she 'continues to be away from the office', adding: 'This council has a strict policy of not commenting on employees and this continues to be the case.' This week the council said there was no change to its previous statements on the matter. Councillors today said they had been sworn to secrecy Mrs Wheeler's absence. Lib Dem Yeovil MP David Laws said: 'Given that public money is involved a clear and honest explanation from the council is needed.' Mrs Wheeler, who is on a permanent contract, joined Somerset County Council in 2009 after previously working in local government for Adur District Council, Surrey County Council and the London Borough of Hounslow. Her time at Surrey also included a secondment to central Government and she moved one of her authorities from a rating of 'weak' to 'excellent'. Mrs Wheeler's remuneration for 2012-2013 is listed as £160,000 in salary with an employer pension contribution of £21,600. Pat Flaherty, the deputy chief executive and director of operations, is acting chief executive in her absence. Mrs Wheeler and Mr Osman have declined to comment.","Councillors say they have been threatened with legal action if they speak .

"A jobless 'alcoholic' has been awarded extra benefits money by his local council to help finance his heavy drinking. Peter MacDonald was stunned when he received a letter from Doncaster Council awarding him the additional payments, having never made an application for them. The 51-year-old was told by benefits chiefs that he would be paid an additional £9.06 on top of his £120-a-week allowance to help cover his rent because of the money he spends on alcohol. Peter MacDonald has been awarded extra benefits money by Doncaster Council to help finance his drinking . 'I know it’s a nanny state but I’d no idea they looked after you this well,' said the former boiler cleaner. Benefits manager Marian Bolton wrote to Mr MacDonald after he fell into arrears with his rent. The letter stated: 'We can see that you are struggling to pay the shortfall between your rent and housing benefit due to the large amount you spend on alcohol. 'We understand that you spend this as you are alcohol dependent. Mr MacDonald, who suffers from a bipolar disorder, insists he did not apply for any extra cash and disputes being branded an alcoholic by the council, although he admits drinking about five pints a day . 'We have decided to award you a discretionary housing payment and from 6/10/2014 we will pay you an extra £9.06 a week.' The payments from the South Yorkshire council will last until next April, but Mr MacDonald has been told he may be able to apply for them to continue. The 51-year-old was told by benefits chiefs that he would be paid an additional £9.06 on top of his £120-a-week allowance . Mr MacDonald, who suffers from a bipolar disorder, insists he did not apply for any extra cash and disputes being branded an alcoholic by the council, although he admits drinking about five pints a day. 'I didn’t ask them for more money. I don’t know how this happened. 'I’ve a nurse comes to see me because of my condition so perhaps her department asked the council to help me out. 'They must have told them I like a drink or something but I didn’t think I was that bad. 'It’s not like I go out on sessions every Saturday night or anything,' he explained. Mr MacDonald, whose ill health forced him to give up a job as a boiler cleaner at a power station in 2011, receives £120 a week in employment support allowance because of his medical condition. Confirming the £9 payment was correct, Doncaster Council’s director of finance and corporate services, Simon Wiles, said: 'We are committed to supporting our most vulnerable residents, in particular when it comes to housing. 'We followed national guidance.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of pressure group Taxpayers' Alliance, said the council's decision to award the extra money was 'staggering'. 'It's staggering that taxpayers' money is knowingly being handed out to fund alcohol dependency,' he said. 'Most people would love to have a few free rounds bought for them at the pub, but that's not a reality for those in work. We have to simplify and reform the welfare system to make sure we ease the burden on taxpayers, but also so that people get the support they need.'","Peter MacDonald, 51, was awarded extra money by Doncaster Council .

"One of Australia’s most iconic photographers has released a stunning new set of images, capturing the sunburnt country in a series of glorious panoramic shots. Ken Duncan has been working as a professional photographer for 35 years, but still considers himself an average photographer- who happens to be blessed with an amazing job. However, as his new book shows, his ability capture the spirit of a place and tell a story with the beautiful images he creates, proves his titles as one of Australia’s most accomplished and pioneering photographers. 'Reggie's Hut', taken in Burra, South Australia is one of the many stunning photographs which tell the story of Australia . 'Glass House Rocks', taken in Narooma, NSW: Mr Duncan said that his love and appreciation of photography as a powerful means to tell a story grew, until his main passion became conveying different stories to the best of his ability. 'Ethereal Dawn', taken at the Twelve Apostles in Victoria . Mr Duncan said that his love of photography began at a very young age, when his father, ‘a wonderful man’, would take too long to take a picture. ‘My dad used to take forever to take photos,’ Mr Duncan told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I used to get frustrated and take it off him, and snap-snap, just take the picture.’ Since then, he said that his love and appreciation of photography as a powerful means to tell a story grew, until his main passion became conveying different stories to the best of his ability. ‘When I was 16 I began developing black and white photos, and processing them in the tray, I had an epiphany,’ he said. ‘The pictures emerged and that’s when I realised, wow, here lies magic.’ While Mr Duncan said it was impossible to choose his favourite image in Chasing the Light, ‘how do you choose your favourite child?’, he asked, he said that ‘Organ Pipes’, taken at Glenhelen Gorge (above) was one that stood out to him . 'Mongomery Reef', in Western Australia. Mr Duncan said that he believes connecting to the land is all the more important the busier we are . His new photographic endeavour, a book called Chasing the Light, is not just about the story that he wants to tell, but about gently encouraging people to consider how digital media has changed the way ‘their story’ is told. ‘We are all so hooked up to digital media and social platforms, and all our images are online,’ he said. ‘That’s not a permanent story, and the sites that your photos are on hold your life story in their hands.’ Mr Duncan said he is passionate about reminding people of the importance of storing their photographs permanently and properly, so that they can tell their story well. ‘When my father died I only had seven days to be able to locate photos for the eulogy at his funeral, and luckily he had all of his photos in an album, but it made me think that most people won’t have that,’ he said. ‘If your photos are all over the place and in different formats, how will those who come after you locate and tell your story well?’ Mr Duncan asked. The images within Chasing the Light express the veteran photographers love of telling stories in a series of stunning panoramic shots taken around Australia. ‘I want to show the beauty of creation and give people peace,’ said Mr Duncan. Mr Duncan said that he would often spend hours just waiting for the right lighting or walking around to find the right shot, and so was delighted to capture a sunrise at King George Falls in the Kimberley (above) 'Kata Tjuta Sunrise' taken in the Northern Territory: ‘I want to show the beauty of creation and give people peace,' said Mr Duncan . ‘It’s important to share the story behind a photo, because that gives it meaning,’ he said. Over the years Mr Duncan has invested a lot of his time into educating young Indigenous Australians in remote communities, which he said gave him precious insight into the need for modern society to reconnect with the land. ‘The land holds the story of the passing of humanity, and if you slow down long enough, the land will reveal a story,’ he said. ‘My job is to go out there and try to connect with the land and listen to it tell a story, and then to capture that and bring it to people.’ ‘If the images evoke something in the viewer I know I’ve succeeded.’ While Mr Duncan said it was impossible to choose his favourite image in Chasing the Light, ‘how do you choose your favourite child?’, he asked, he said that ‘Organ Pipes’, taken at Glenhelen Gorge was one that stood out to him. The site was an Indigenous site sacred to women, which he was given permission to visit. One of his other favourites was ‘Heaven Declares’, shot at Mullimburra Point in NSW, a spectacular shot of the night sky over the beach.

I try to bring that beauty to people because hope is the antidote,' said Mr Duncan . 'Sunset', taken at Desert Oaks, in Uluru, Northern Territory . One of the remotest areas in Australia, Mr Duncan said he camped there overnight to ensure he got the right shot, and thought that many people would never have seen an image of the sight. Spending so much time ‘out bush’, he said that he’s forced to look at nature, and is convinced that there is a much larger force at work in the world which created it. ‘If we open ourselves up we will see there’s something bigger than ourselves,’ Mr Duncan said. ‘People need the story of hope, which is hard in a world that keeps being fed with fear. I try to bring that beauty to people because hope is the antidote.’ Mr Duncan said that he loves Australia, and is convinced of its special place in the world. ‘We still haven’t stuffed up our environment, and people are starting to realise that we are all here together on this planet.’ ‘We should never get so busy living that we forget to make a life. I want my photographs to inspire people to get outside into nature, and restore balance in their lives.’ Chasing the Light: Australia Wide is available now.

"The UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne said the cash pledge will 'improve access to low carbon energy' in developing countries . Hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash is to be poured into Africa to help it cope with the impact of climate change. The £330million handout will be spent over the next four years on schemes to install solar power plants and encouraging investment in low-carbon transport. One of the main beneficiaries will be South Africa, a country which is prosperous enough to have its own space agency. Chris Huhne, the Lib Dem energy secretary, will unveil the foreign aid package at a United Nations summit on climate change which opens today. The largesse will fuel criticism from Tory backbenchers over David Cameron’s promise to increase UK spending on aid at a time when public services in Britain are facing swingeing cuts. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘It is completely unjustifiable to spend so much money at a time when we’re  reducing the number of police officers in this country.’ Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘What makes it worse is that much of the aid budget is spent on things that are not really benefiting developing countries. The answer is trade, not aid.’ In a sign that the Government is pulling in different directions on environmental policy, George Osborne will announce tomorrow that the Treasury will offer £250million in tax breaks to firms hit by Mr Huhne’s climate change policies. He will use his Autumn Statement – effectively a mini-Budget – to help companies that use large amounts of energy after being warned that Britain’s plans to cut carbon emissions faster than our competitors was driving business abroad. Heat is on: Solar panels are powering homes in southern Sudan . Energy-intensive firms such as cement, aluminium and steel makers will get 95 per cent relief from the climate change levy as well as tens of millions of pounds to offset new carbon levies. Mr Osborne insists Britain should not seek to lead the world in cutting emissions and that he is not prepared to bankrupt British businesses by putting them at a competitive disadvantage. But Mr Huhne is pressing ahead with spending taxpayers’ money promoting green policies in the rest of the world. In the second week of the UN climate change conference in the South African city of Durban, he is expected to say the aid will go towards a variety of anti-climate change schemes, such as helping African farmers protect their crops against flooding and drought, installing solar panels in villages, and building slurry pits to produce gas for generators. Projects to target illegal logging in tropical forests will also get cash. Ethiopia and Rwanda are expected to benefit, as well as South Africa, the most developed country on the continent with an economy which grew far faster than Britain’s last year. It is not known whether  the money will go straight to  governments or whether it will  be channelled via charities  and companies. Some £282.5million has already been allocated towards aid for  foreign climate-change projects. But next week’s announcement will see hundreds of millions more allocated to African climate-change projects by 2015. Last night critics questioned whether so much money should continue to be ploughed into Africa, where aid money has a history of disappearing as a result of corruption. Just last week, an independent watchdog found that the rapid expansion of Britain’s international aid programme has left it increasingly exposed to fraud. Julian Morris, president of the London-based think tank International Policy Network, said Mr Huhne’s announcement would be seen as a ‘bribe’. A NASA thermal satellite image shows the world's arctic surface temperature trends. Experts have warned that levels of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change have reached a record high . ‘The timing seems to be a cynical move by the British Government,’ he said. ‘It suggests this is an attempt to bribe African governments to sign up to whatever deals the British Government wants them to sign up to in Durban. The money will almost certainly go to foreign governments and do little to improve the lot of the poor.’ Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The Government should be freezing international aid, not increasing it. ‘Rather than throwing money away on corruption and programmes that deliver little of real substance, aid should be targeted at the world’s poorest who really need help.’ A spokesman for Mr Huhne’s Department for Energy and Climate Change would not confirm the total amount, and said it was not new money as it will be drawn from the Coalition’s fully- funded £2.9billion International Climate Fund. Last night Business Department sources said Vince Cable had been instrumental in raising his concern about the cost of energy and climate change policies on manufacturing businesses, writing to the Prime Minister and George Osborne on the issue in April. ‘They have made considerable capital investment in their British plants to make sure they are energy efficient. This investment shows their commitment to the UK,’ said one. ‘That’s why it’s so vital we don’t repay their faith in Britain with the introduction of a hefty tax, which could see them relocate and result in the loss of British jobs and do nothing about reducing global carbon emissions.’","South Africa will be one of the main beneficiaries .

"A top aide to Bill de Blasio's wife who lives with her convicted killer boyfriend is taking a leave of absence after her son was arrested for trespassing. Rachel Noerdlinger, 44, is the chief of staff to the New York Mayor's First Lady Chirlane McCray. On Monday she announced she would be taking a leave of absence after her 17-year-old son Khari was arrested for allegedly trespassing in a building which is known as a drug hot spot in Washington Heights, Manhattan, at the weekend. High-ranking: Rachel Noerdlinger, 44, is the chief of staff to the New York Mayor's First Lady Chirlane McCray. Pictured: Noerdlinger and her 17-year-old son Khari . He was apprehended with three friends, two of which had small amounts of marijuana on them, law enforcement sources said. The leave from her $170,000 a year role is unpaid, according to a City Hall source, reports the New York Post.  It wasn't immediately clear when or if Noerdlinger would return. 'Today I am announcing that I have decided to take a leave of absence to spend more time with my son,' Noerdlinger said in a statement. Dangerous liaison: Rachel Noerdlinger (center), chief of staff of the first lady of New York City, has been living with convicted killer Hassaun McFarlan (right) since 2010 . 'These past two months have been extremely difficult for both of us, and his arrest on Friday heightens the need for me to devote my full attention to Khari, my number one priority.' She added that her son 'has been subjected to attacks' which she said had nothing to do with 'public interest, and everything to do with derailing this administration. In response to her statement, Rebecca Katz, a special adviser to Mayor de Blasio said: 'The Mayor and first lady thank Rachel for her service.' 'She has been a great asset to the administration and the people of New York City over the past year, and everyone wishes her all the best during her leave.' Khari, who hit the headlines recently after he posted explicit messages about cops and women on his Twitter page, was taken to court on Saturday - a day after his mother's 44th birthday. 'While he is still a teen, he is entering into adulthood, and he must take responsibility for his actions,' Noerdlinger said in a statement. 'This issue is now a family matter that we will address privately at home.' Noerdlinger has been in a serious relationship with ex-convict Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010. Friends in high places: Noerdlinger (center) pictured with her current boss, Mayor Bill de Blasio (left), and her former employer, Rev Al Sharpton (right) Last month he hit the headlines after reportedly leaving explicit comments on a hip-hop blog touting his love for violent sex. McFarlan's criminal past, includes drug-trafficking and driving offenses and in September he was linked to distasteful and explicit posts on a music blog, in which he allegedly solicits women to talk about violent sex with him. The comments, posted on the Hip Hop News 24-7 blog, ask female users whether they are 'turned on when a man plays rough with you'. the New York Post reported. Another post complains about the sexual abilities of black women. It says: 'Trying to find the right black woman with a mean [sex act] game is like trying to find a black woman with good credit.' The words were posted in 2011 under the pseudonym 'stop end frisk'. They have since been deleted but can be seen in search engine data for old versions of the pages. Noerdlinger has rounded on the comments - which she acknowledged as coming from her boyfriend - describing them as 'reprehensible'. The chief of staff joined Mayor de Blasio's team in January as an aide to McCray, and has attended high-level NYPD meetings. This has raised some eyebrows given her live-in partner's attitude to police, whom he has described as 'pigs'. His criminal past, dredged up last week by DNAInfo, goes back to his first arrest at age 15 for shooting to death an older boy in a dispute over a goose-down jacket in Harlem. Most recently, he got in trouble with the law last year when he nearly ran over a New Jersey state police officer while driving his girlfriend's Mercedes-Benz, according to court records obtained by the news site. Two of McFarlan's five arrests on charges ranging from driving on a suspended license to drug trafficking took place while he was dating Rachel Noerdlinger. The 43-year-old chief of staff got her start as a publicist representing attorney Johnnie Cochran and prominent civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton, who later hired her as a public relations adviser for his organization the National Action Network. All the while, Noerdlinger's live-in boyfriend has been raving against police officers on social media. In one post, which has since been removed along with McFarlan's Facebook account, he reportedly wrote: 'I cant come outside without the pigs f***ing with me in the hood.' When asked whether the bombshell revelations could result in her dismissal, de Blasio's spokeswoman Rebecca Katz said: 'Rachel's not going anywhere.' Single mom: The 44-year-old chief of staff, pictured here in November 2013 - around the time of her boyfriend's latest arrest  - is a single mother of one . Katz, however, pointed out that 'no one at city Hall condones criminal behavior or disparagement of the NYPD, including Rachel.' The spokeswoman went on to say that Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother of one, was 'a strong and independent woman' whose core values and believes are in line with the de Blasio administration. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, however, expressed concern regarding Noerdlinger's access to sensitive police information and called into question the aide's judgement. 'It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,' he told the Post. 'She should not be in that position.' Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Hassaun McFarlan and Rachel Noerdlinger, hit out at her critics saying that she performs her duties as a chief of staff without any input from her boyfriend. 'To her credit, she's a loyal woman and a strong woman and she would not put her career ahead of people she cares about,' said Lichtman. When approached over the comments, McFarlan refused to respond.","Rachel Noerdlinger, 44, is chief of staff to New York Mayor's First Lady Chirlane McCray .

"Childhood obesity in the UK has reached ‘alarming’ levels with up to a third being dangerously fat, warn doctors. They claim Britain is ‘the fat man of Europe’ and the problems have set in by the age of nine. A report also says the UK’s child death rate is the second worst in western Europe, with an estimated five extra deaths a day compared with the best performing country. Scroll down for video . British girls under 20 are the fattest in Europe – topping a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe . One in 10 children – around three in every classroom – has a diagnosable mental health condition but even those identified are often not treated properly. In a wide-ranging report, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which represents doctors specialising in children and young people, issues a wake-up call to politicians. It says childhood obesity statistics ‘continue to cause alarm’ with 26 per cent of boys and 29 per cent of girls overweight and obese ‘storing up serious health problems for the future’. British girls under 20 are the fattest in Europe – topping a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe. British boys under 20 are 10th in the league table, with Greece at the top where one-third of boys are ranked as fat. British boys are 10th in the league table, with Greece at the top of the list as one-third are ranked as fat . Recent research for the period 1980-2013 says there has been a substantial increase in overweight and obese children and adolescents in developed countries, including the UK. The RCPCH wants a ban on advertising of foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt before 9pm, and restrictions that stop them being advertised on internet ‘on-demand’ services. Food and nutrition training should be mandatory for teachers as part of a bid to improve children’s diet in schools, along with more activity for children promoted via more cycle lanes and 20mph speed limits. The Vision2015 report says death rates of children under five are second to bottom in a league table of 21 nations, at 4.9 deaths per 1,000 children born compared with 7.0 in Malta. The RCPCH wants a ban on advertising of foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt before 9pm, and restrictions that stop them being advertised on internet ‘on-demand’ services . The number of needless deaths among preschool children is similar up to the age of 14, with five extra dying each year who would not die in Sweden, among the best performing countries. The number of children dying needlessly each year in the UK compared with Sweden amounts to almost 2,000 each year. RCPCH President Dr Hilary Cass said there would be ‘serious consequences’ if no concerted effort is made by the next Government to improve children and young people’s health. She said politicians must give a similar priority to young people that had been awarded to the elderly. She said ‘The main focus of health and social care policy from successive Government has been on meeting the needs of an ageing population. ‘Many of the big ticket policies – such as pension increases, winter fuel allowances and free TV licences - have made a welcome difference to many older people We now want to see equal focus given to our younger population. ‘Not only should this be done because it directly benefits children and young people but also because it will improve the health of the nation as a whole. ‘Healthy children are more likely to be healthy adults – and of course the reverse is also true.’ Lisa Murphy, a member of the RCPCH’s Youth Advisory Panel, said the health of young people in the UK has been falling behind the rest of Europe’ for too long’. She said ‘There is an overwhelming body of evidence which highlights the need for early intervention in ensuring good health - through integration of health and education, reduction of socioeconomic inequalities and mandatory provision of paediatric training for all those in community health services.’","Experts say Britain is 'fat man' of Europe and problems set in by age 9 .

"Scientists said 'safe' levels of dietary sugar - found in a can of fizzy drink, for example - could be having invisible adverse effects on people's health . Even 'safe' levels of sugar could be having invisible adverse effects on our health, American researchers. Researchers gave mice the equivalent of a healthy human diet plus three cans of fizzy drink a day and found the female animals died twice as fast as those whose food was not largely composed of sugar. Male mice consuming the sugary diet were less able to hold territory and reproduce, leading scientists to speculate that sugar has a damaging effect on the health of mammals, including humans. Scientists from the University of Utah said the mice showed no sign of suffering serious physical changes in their bodies. Writing in the online edition of the journal Nature Communications, the researchers said: 'Our results provide evidence that added sugar consumed at concentrations currently considered safe exerts dramatic adverse impacts on mammalian health.' Mice on the experimental diet received 25 percent of their energy intake in the form of added sugar, no matter how many calories they ate. In human terms this was equivalent to a person eating a normal healthy diet plus three cans of sugar-sweetened fizzy drinks a day. After 32 weeks, more than a third of the female mice fed extra sugar died - twice the number fed a non-sugary diet. The death rate of males was not affected, but their survival behaviour was. Males on the sugary diet acquired and . held on to 26 percent fewer territories than their normal diet . nest-mates and produced 25 percent fewer offspring. Researchers gave mice the equivalent of a healthy human diet plus three fizzy drink cans a day and found the female animals died twice as fast as those whose food was not largely composed of sugar. Male mice consuming the sugary diet were less able to hold territory and reproduce . Study leader Professor Wayne Potts,at the university, said: 'This demonstrates the adverse effects of added sugars at human-relevant levels.' To observe the mice in a more realistic setting, the researchers kept them in room-sized pens rather than cages. This allowed them to compete more naturally for mates and desirable territories. Despite the effects on the mice, the sugar-fed animals showed only minor metabolic changes, including raised cholesterol. The study found nothing unusual in terms of obesity or insulin and blood sugar levels.

"Encouraging 'good' behaviour in youngsters definitely makes parents' lives easier. It is also assumed to instill positive personality traits that will help them grow in to well rounded adults. And now new research has revealed that a person's behaviour as a child could have a startling impact on their waistline in their future. The longitudinal study observed a group of Hawaiian schoolchildren in the 1960s and then compared their vital statistics today as 50-year-old adults. The research found that children who acted in an irresponsible and careless manner compared to those who do not were prone to adult obesity, with the children who exhibited lower conscientiousness also generally experiencing worse overall health as adults. Children exhibiting lower conscientiousness are more prone to adult obesity and other health issues . The Oregon Research Institute (ORI) study examined the relationship between childhood personality and adult . health. It showed a strong association between childhood . conscientiousness (organised, dependable, self-disciplined) and health . status in adulthood, as reported in Science Daily. ORI scientist Sarah Hampson, Ph.D., and colleagues at the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health, Hawaii report these findings in the August issue of Health Psychology. 'These results are significant and . unique because they show the far-reaching effects of childhood . conscientiousness on adult health. 'Others have shown that more conscientiousness children live longer. Now we have shown that these conscientious children are also healthier at midlife' noted Dr. Hampson, while on a panel on personality and health at the national American Psychological Association meeting in Honolulu. Hawaiian school-children rated by their teachers in the 1960s as less conscientious had worse global health status as adults. They also had significantly greater obesity, high cholesterol, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Childhood conscientiousness was significantly associated with decreased function of the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. People who are more conscientious have better health habits and less stress, protecting them from disease . This association was independent of the other big five personality childhood traits  (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and intellect/imagination), adult conscientiousness, childhood socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender. This is the first study in which all the big five personality traits assessed in childhood have been used to predict objective health status assessed by multiple biomarkers over 40 years later in older adulthood. More than 2,000 children from entire classrooms in elementary schools on two Hawaiian Islands were comprehensively assessed on their personality characteristics. The National Institute of Mental Health funded the ORI researchers in 1998  to locate and examine the health-related behaviors and mental and physical health status of these individuals. Researchers managed to convince almost 75 per cent of those in the original group who could be located (mean age 51 years) to participate. More than 800 individuals completed a medical and psychological examination supported by subsequent grants from the National Institute on Ageing. The physical examinations included biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic systems such as height, weight, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting blood glucose. 'These findings suggest avenues for further research that may lead to interventions. 'People who are more conscientious tend to have better health habits and less stress, which protects them from disease. 'Self-control is a key part of being conscientious, so our findings confirm the importance of teaching children self-control to enable then to grow up to be healthy adults,' said Hampson.","Study compared group of Hawaiian children from 1960s and now as adults .

"A popular Christmas parade held ever year for four decades has been cancelled for health and safety reasons - because of fears it would attract too many people. Officials say the Santa's Parade through Poole, Dorset, has become too popular and that crowd safety could not be guaranteed. The decision to cancel the event, put on every year since the 1970s, has been branded 'crazy' and 'outrageous'. Christmas cancelled: A popular Christmas parade (last year's event pictured) in Poole, Dorset, has been banned because officials say it would attract too many people . Banned: Officials said crowd safety could not be guaranteed because there would be too many people in a confined space . Goodbye Christmas: The event, which has taken place every year since the 1970s, sees Father Christmas arrive at the seaside town on an RNLI boat . The event, organised by Poole's Dolphin Shopping Centre, has been cancelled after concerns that there will be too many people in a confined space with moving vehicles going past as part of the parade. A petition demanding the tradition is reinstated gathered nearly 1,500 signatures in just a day. Town councillor Charmaine Parkinson said: 'The children are devastated, parents are angry - they just don't see the sense in it. It is an outrageous decision.' Daniel Carrington, who lives in the seaside town, said: 'It's crazy. This is something local children look forward to every year. It's not exactly getting behind the true spirit of Christmas by doing this is it?' One mother wrote on Facebook: 'What utter guff. Other towns run such events with 'health and safety' risks managed. It's taken place for decades without incident, what do they think would happen this year?' Several thousand people normally attend the parade, which involves Father Christmas arriving at Poole Quay in an RNLI lifeboat. Tradition: Councillors and angered residents branded the decision by Dolphin Shopping Centre 'crazy' and 'outrageous' Christmas miracle? More than 1,500 people have signed a petition calling for the decision to be reversed . After Father Christmas' arrival, he is taken on a procession around Poole before heading to his grotto to meet the town's children . He is then transported on a slow-moving, Christmas-themed float around the streets of the town centre before taking up residence in his grotto inside Dolphin Shopping Centre. Ryan Stiggants, 18, who has helped launch the petition, urged the organisers to bring it back. He said: 'Using health and safety as an excuse is not on, they can make this happen if they want to.' John Grinnell, the manager of the shopping centre, said the parade had become too popular. He said they had failed to find any alternative routes in order to keep it going.

"The Queen asked if it was true that Richard III was really found buried under a car park. A 3D model of the king is pictured . Richard III is to make history by becoming not only the last English king to die in battle, but also the first to have his genetic code sequenced. Scientists want to map the king’s DNA before his remains, and any samples taken from them, are reinterred. They hope the work will reveal information about the dead monarch’s hair and eye colour and shed light on his ancestry and links to people living today. Researchers are also hoping the sequencing will provide more details about the king's susceptibility to diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. Experts have already learned that besides being a hunchback, the king was badly infected with roundworm, a once common parasite in the UK. A battle-scarred skeleton with a twisted spine was unearthed by archaeologists in a Leicester car park last year. It was later identified as that of Richard III. Dr Turi King, from the University of Leicester, who is leading the gene sequencing project, said: 'It is an extremely rare occurrence that archaeologists are involved in the excavation of a known individual, let alone a king of England. 'At the same time we are in the midst of a new age of genetic research, with the ability to sequence entire genomes from ancient individuals and with them, those of pathogens that may have caused infectious disease. 'Sequencing the genome of Richard III is a hugely important project that will help to teach us not only about him, but [stir up] discussion about how our DNA informs our sense of identity, our past and our future.' A battle-scarred skeleton with a twisted spine, pictured, was unearthed by archaeologists in a Leicester car park in 2012. It was later identified as that of Richard III . Scientists will also sequence the genome of one of the king’s confirmed living relatives, Michael Ibsen. The Canadian-born cabinet maker, from London, is a descendant of Richard III’s sister, Anne. Only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before, and none with Richard III’s noble pedigree. They include Otzi the iceman, whose mummified 3,000-year-old remains were found in the Italian Alps in 1991, as well as various Neanderthals, a Denisovan - an early human from Siberia - a Greenlandic Inuit and a Spanish hunter-gatherer. Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in . Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm . for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry . Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key . lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil . taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life. Advanced techniques may make it possible to detect DNA from other organisms, including infectious bacteria, in the samples taken from Richard III’s bones. Whole genome sequencing of Otzi’s remains, for example, revealed evidence of the first known human Lyme disease infection. Results from the analysis of King Richard III's bones will be made available to historians, scientists, and interested members of the public. Only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before, and none with Richard III's noble pedigree. They include Otzi the iceman, pictured, whose mummified 3,000-year-old remains were found in the Italian Alps in 1991 . Dr Dan O’Connor, head of medical humanities at the Wellcome Trust, which is part-funding the research, said: 'By making this genome available to all, we will ensure that we can continue to learn about Richard’s past - both personal and historic - even once his remains have been interred.'

She decided to go after the world record when one of her teammates suggested it . So last December Marie started training to beat the record, completing 20 back handsprings at every basketball game, across the length of the court. During the summer she pushed for more, practicing in her backyard and marking her spots on the high school football field. On September 6, before Walsh Jesuit's sold-out game against St Vincent-St Mary high school, Marie took to the field for her chance to break the record. The crowd cheered Marie on as she performed 40 straight back handsprings, going more than half the field to the opposing 35-yard line for a total of 65 yards of back handsprings.

Dizzying: Marie says she felt like passing out, but kept going until number 40 . She did it! Marie completed 40 back handsprings - traveling all the way to the opposite 35-yard line . While initial reports said Marie completed 42 back handsprings, the video shows she completed 40. A Guinness World Record official was on site to verify the record, and says that Marie did indeed beat the prior record of 36. Marie has been cheerleading since she was 10-years-old, and is now setting her sights on beating her record. 'It was crazy,' Klein told the Akron Beacon Journal. 'I loved the way the crowd reacted. My mom was crying. It didn't feel real at times as I did it. I almost passed out, but I kept going. I am real excited to have the record. Now I want to break my own record.'

New guidance for teachers will advise them to avoid accepting friend requests on Facebook from current and former students and not to connect with them via Twitter. It will also say that schools have a legal duty to protect their teachers from online abuse. The advice comes as it is revealed that one in five teachers have been targeted with derogatory comments by pupils online, the Independent reported. Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, said teachers need to be comfortable that their schools would take action if they fell victim to cyber bullies. She said: 'We all know the dangers children face from online bullies but we – but we sometimes forget that teachers are not immune from abuse which impacts on them professionally and personally.' The guidance, due to be published by the Department of Education, aims to safeguard both teachers and their students from online trolls. A survey by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, recently found that one in five teachers had been subjected to abuse online. This may have been in the form of derogatory comments and in some cases had affected their teaching careers. In one example a pupil had tweeted: 'You are a paedo and your daughter is a whore.' Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said cyberbullying can have a 'pernicious impact.' The guidance urges teachers to ensure their security settings online remain high, as well as those of family and friends to avoid embarrassing photographs and information being accessed by pupils and their parents. Teachers are also advised to search for their names online to see what has been posted about them - including photographs and comments and ensure snaps of them drinking or at parties are not readily accessible. Department of Education advise urges teachers to avoid befriending current and former pupils on Facebook . In some instances teachers can fall victim to the actions of scornful parents who search for compromising photographs online and then send them to headteachers in revenge for their children being disciplined or left out of sport teams. The guidance will say this type of abuse could constitute a crime. Teachers can be particularly vulnerable to the abuse via RateMyTeachers - a site which allows pupils to post derogatory remarks about their appearance and performance in the classroom.","Department of Education will publish guidance to protect teachers online .

"A young woman who was told she might not see her 30th birthday if she didn't slim down has lost an incredible 20st – nearly two thirds of her body weight – and dropped 10 dress sizes. At just 27 Bríanán McEnteggart weighed 32st 11lb and wore a dress size 34. It was at a routine health check that her GP warned her that if she didn't tackle her weight she could be less than 18 months away from a heart attack. Now, after losing 20st 5lb, Bríanán has started a new job she loves, has just set up home with her boyfriend and been named Slimming World Woman of the Year 2014. Scroll down for video . Slimming World has named Bríanán's McEnteggart as their Woman of the Year 2014 after she dropped from 32st 11lb (left) to 12st 6lb (right) Bríanán, now 31, says she feels like she's entering a new chapter in her life: 'When I look back at old photos of myself I can see that even though my mouth is smiling my eyes aren't smiling. 'I was a very unhappy girl – I would walk everywhere with my head down looking at the ground and I hated looking in the mirror. Now when I smile my whole face smiles, and I walk everywhere with my head held high. I feel like I've got a second chance at life and I'm looking forward to everything the future holds.' Bríanán, from Dundalk in Ireland, wore a dress size 20 at just 15 and had to have her clothes specially made. As she got older she avoided social situations and used food as an emotional comfort. She says: 'Like most big kids I was picked on at school, I put up my defences so no one would ever know they'd hurt my feelings but when I got home I'd cry. Not much changed as I got older. At 27 you should be out living your life, but I didn't want to be seen by anyone so I'd just stay home and read a book or watch television.' Brianan used to use junk food as a comfort, becoming increasingly isolated due to her size . She tried to shed the weight by attending slimming clubs and even visiting a hospital dietician: 'I felt the diets I followed were always too restrictive for me. I was hungry a lot of the time and I couldn't fit them into my life because they didn't let me have any treats. 'My experience at the dieticians was even worse, they said their scales couldn't weigh me and I had to sit in something called 'the obesity chair' – it was mortifying. It's experiences like that that crush your self-confidence bit by bit.' As Bríanán's weight increased she began to worry about her health as heart problems run in her family. In October 2011 she visited her doctor and received the grim diagnosis. Just days later, she was dealt another blow when the bath at her family home cracked beneath her heavy weight. She says: 'Hearing something like that from the doctor scares the living daylights out of you. A few days later I was taking a shower as usual when I heard a noise and realised the bath had cracked. I couldn't believe it. 'I didn't want to have to come out and tell my parents I'd broken the bath, I wanted that bath to swallow me up. Both of these things were wake-up calls and I knew I really had to do something. Within days I was at my first Slimming World group.' Bríanán had heard about Slimming World from a friend, Mary Murphy, and joined her at the local Dundalk Slimming World group, run by Consultant Fiona Pepper. Bríanán says: 'I felt sick and was absolutely petrified because I felt I had such a long journey ahead of me. I didn't need to worry though – Fiona came running over to offer me a cup of tea and everyone was so friendly. 'Now I sail into the group, they're like my second family and I tell people that there's no reason to ever feel scared because everyone – no matter how much weight they've got to lose – is there for the same reason. 'I think I get as excited when other members lose weight as when I do, it's amazing to think we're all helping each other as well as ourselves.' She began following Slimming World's Extra Easy eating plan and started enjoying more regular meals. Gone were the super-size bags of crisps and jumbo bars of chocolate and she took over the cooking at home, whipping up healthy recipes like turkey stir-fry for her parents, sister and nephew. She lost 11lb in her first week and 4st 7lb in just three months. Brianan has now swapped staying in for nights out on the dance floor with friends and loves shopping . As she slimmed down Bríanán, who suffered from painful knees and legs as a result of her size, began walking more. She says: 'Before I would struggle to walk even 500m so I couldn't do too much to start with. I began by walking between one lamppost and another and building up slowly. Now I can walk three miles a day and I'm hoping to take up Zumba and start shaking my hips a bit.' Bríanán's recently reached her target weight, dropping from 32st 11lb to 12st 6lb, and was named Slimming World Woman of the Year 2014 at a ceremony in Birmingham on Saturday November 8. What she's lost in weight, she's gained in confidence; she successfully applied for a job with an online training company, discovered a love of shopping and has swapped staying in for nights out on the dance floor with friends. It was on a night out in summer 2013 that she met fellow Slimming World member Keith Lynch, who has lost 5st himself, and the pair soon became a couple. They have recently moved in together and are planning a future. Bríanán says: 'I honestly believe that if it wasn't for my Slimming World group I wouldn't be alive today, I would be six-foot under and my parents would be visiting my grave. 'My doctor is over the moon and so am I. 'I've always loved reading but now instead of burying myself in a book all the time, I feel like I'm finally starring in my own fairy tale. These past three years have been the best years of my life and I can't wait for everything that's still to come.'","At her largest, Brianan was told she could be dead in 18 months .

"Paul Kohler, pictured, was assaulted at his home in Wimbledon, south west London on Monday . A lawyer beaten to a pulp by four masked men inside his £2 million London home said he could not stop thinking about his wife and daughter despite the horrendous nature of his injuries. Speaking for the first time since the attack, Paul Kohler from Wimbledon, south west London said he was almost blinded within moments of the attack, but tried to land his own punches to protect his family. Academic Mr Kohler revealed the gang, who spoke with an Eastern European accent, kept asking 'Where’s the money?' during the home invasion. He said: . 'The first punch in the hall took my eye out, I thought I had lost the . eye at that stage because it stopped functioning. 'But I just kept thinking of my wife and daughter and her boyfriend upstairs. 'They got me on the floor but I managed to stand up and at one stage and trade blows with them.' Mr Kohler told the Evening Standard: 'I got a few blows in, but these were thumps like I never had in my life - they could really punch.' Police are now investigating whether the attack was linked to a cabaret bar Mr Kohler, 55, owns in central London. Detectives . searching two men who assaulted an academic and bar owner inside his . own home on Monday have released new CCTV footage of one of the . suspects. Father-of-four Paul Kohler, 55, was beaten by four masked men at his home in Wimbledon, south west London at 10pm on Monday. Police are currently searching for two men in connection with the assault, who escaped from the scene on foot. Two other men were arrested after the attack and have been charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated burglary. Police investigating the violent burglary want to speak to this man who was seen moments after the attack . The man can be clearly seen removing surgical gloves as he walked through Wimbledon Theatre car park . The suspect, pictured, looked anxious as he walked through the car park according to detectives who have scrutinised the CCTV footage . Mr Kohler and Samatha, centre, married at Jesus College Cambridge in April, with their daughter acting as bridesmaids, from left, Eloise, Saskia, Paul, Samantha,  Bethany and Tamara . His brother, Marcus Kohler, a charity worker from Cambridge, said: 'Paul is an incredibly strong man. 'The vision in his left eye is coming back and doctors are confident his sight will improve. 'His face has been so swollen he hasn't been able to have surgery yet. 'The hospital were going to let him out yesterday but he's had to have a blood transfusion because his haemoglobin is so low. 'We just want to get him home again but I think he might stay now until surgery as the swelling is going down. 'He never lost consciousness so has been able to speak to his family in hospital. 'We are determined to get through this and not let what happened change us.. 'You can't help but be a bit paranoid now though. 'Samantha and his daughters are doing OK. It's been hard for us but we are not losing hope. 'He'll be OK eventually, we just need to find out how this happened and see those other two men arrested.' One . of the remaining suspects fled down King's Road towards Wimbledon town . centre. He was spotted crossing the car park of Wimbledon Theatre a few . minutes after the attack. It is not known which direction the final man went. The third suspect removed 'surgical gloves' worn during the attack as he crossed through the theatre's car park. The two remaining men are believed to be from Eastern Europe, possibly Poland and are in their 20s or 30s. Officers are also seeking information on a silver-coloured Volkswagen convertible which may have been used by the gang. Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, of Merton Burglary Squad, said: 'This new piece of CCTV is crucial in the identification of one of the outstanding suspects, and we are calling to anyone who recognises this man to come forward. 'It is my firm belief that this man and his other outstanding associate, would have been stained with blood spatter from the violent attack inside the house. 'Both were also wearing white surgical gloves when they fled. Whilst they attempted a quick exit, I'm sure that members of the public would have seen them. 'The victim currently remains in hospital and is awaiting surgery to an extreme eye injury which has lead to the fracture of his socket. Police believe that passing motorists may have spotted one of the suspects, pictured, fleeing the scene . Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan believes that the men will have been covered in 'blood spatter' The attackers repeatedly asked Mr Kohler where he kept the money during Monday's burglary . Detective Inspector O'Sullivan continued: 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough and we believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 'We continue to appeal for information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. 'However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. 'Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.' Officers believe the suspect fled from King's Road and through the car park of the New Wimbledon Theatre . Mr Kohler, left, was at home with his wife Samantha, right, and daughter Eloise, centre at the time of the attack . Two men have so far appeared in court in connection with the incident. Polish nationals Pawel Honc, 23, of no fixed abode and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, from Tooting in south London both appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court where they were charged with aggravated burglary and grevious bodily harm. Both were remanded to reappear at Kingston Crown Court on August 27. At the time of the attack Mr Kohler and his wife Samantha were playing a board game with their daughter Eloise and her boyfriend. Moments before the gang approached, Eloise and the boyfriend went to her room, where they locked themselves in as they heard the shouting and dialed 999. Earlier Detective Inspector O'Sullivan described the attack as the most brutal assault he has seen in more than 20 years of policing. Detectives believe Monday night’s robbery – as the family played a board game – was well-planned and targeted but are perplexed by the motive behind the ultra-violent attack. One line of inquiry is that Mr Kohler, who is head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, is the victim of mistaken identity or that the gang simply struck at the wrong house. Mr . Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Central London with his wife . Samantha, centre, and business partner Gordon Anderson. The popular . venue is located in a converted underground toilet frequented by Oscar . Wilde . Mr Kohler is part owner of The Cellar Bar, pictured,  which is located in a former underground gents' toilet . DI O'Sullivan said: 'The victim and his family are distraught and they cannot understand why they were targeted in this way. We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.' He will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead. Mr Kohler’s wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as ‘cowardly and wicked’ and praised her husband’s bravery. The couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids. Miss MacArthur, 50, said: ‘This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat him for no reason?’ ‘He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating him up and he didn’t stop. He fought the whole way and I’m sure if he hadn’t it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.’ Mr Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Aldwych, central London, with Gordon Anderson, who told the Daily Telegraph that he had no idea why his colleague was set upon. He told the newspaper: 'Paul is a beautiful human being. I can't understand how anyone could do this to him.' The 52-year-old explained that the bar was part of the London cabaret and drag seen and that the venture was 'successful and fun'. Asked whether he believed the assault may have been linked to the bar in some way, he added: 'I have no idea. That is a matter for the police.' Anyone with information is urged to call the incident room on 020 8649 3159; Or if you with to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

"If you always have room for dessert – and maybe even a second helping – you are about to be handed the perfect excuse. It may be in your genes. Scientists say that millions of Britons carry a rogue stretch of DNA that stops them feeling full  and leaves them craving sugary and fatty foods. The FTO gene, carried by more than half of the population, was discovered several years ago. But while researchers knew it made people fat, they didn’t know how it did so. Scientists have shown that a rogue stretch of DNA carried by millions of Britons stops them from feeling full after eating. The 'hunger gene' prevents a drop in the hunger  hormone ghrelin after eating . Now they have learned that it keeps people feeling hungry, it could lead to new ways to tackle the obesity crisis. The 16 per cent of the population . that carries two copies of the rogue DNA are 70 per cent more likely to . become obese than those without the gene. A rogue stretch of DNA - the FTO gene - carried by millions of Britons stops them from feeling full after eating. People with this DNA particularly crave sugary and fatty foods. Half of Britons carry the gene and they are 30% more likely to be obese. 16% of Britons carry two rouge copies of the rogue DNA and they are 70% more likely to be obese. They eat up to 200 extra calories  a . day and are almost half a stone heavier than their average counterparts. And for those with the ‘hunger gene’ dieting is doomed to failure. Even those who have inherited just . one flawed FTO gene – 49 per cent of the population – are 30 per cent . more likely to be obese. The British-led research team asked . young men with and without the genetic flaw to rate their hunger before . and after a meal. Volunteers’ blood samples were then tested for . ghrelin, a hormone that triggers feelings of hunger. Levels of ghrelin are usually high before we eat, and fall afterwards. But in the men with the ‘hunger gene’, levels remained relatively high after eating. They also felt hungrier than the others. Next, the volunteers were shown . pictures of various foods after they had eaten and asked how appealing . they seemed. And despite just having had a meal, those with the gene . still found cakes, pastries, chips and burgers highly tempting. The scientists then used MRI scanners to peer into the volunteers’ brains. Those with the ‘hunger gene’ lit up . more at the thought of fatty and sugary foods, the Journal of Clinical . Investigation reports. People with the FTO gene particularly crave sugary and fatty foods - explaining why some people find dessert irresistible, no matter how much they have already eaten . Study leader Dr Rachel Batterham, of . University College London, said that some of us were simply . ‘biologically programmed to eat more’. She added: ‘Not only do these people . have higher ghrelin levels and therefore feel hungrier, their brains . respond differently to ghrelin and to pictures of food. It’s a double . hit.’ The work, which was funded by the . medical research charity  the Rosetrees Trust and the  Medical Research . Council, could speed research into new obesity treatments. Despite the scale of the obesity crisis, there is only one prescription-strength weight loss drug available in the UK. But drugs are not the only weapon against the hunger gene. Dr Batterham said: ‘We know that . ghrelin, and therefore hunger, can be reduced by exercise like running . or cycling or by eating a high- protein diet.’ Professor Steve Bloom, an obesity . expert from Imperial College London, agreed the research would spur on . the search for new treatments. It could also help in targeting any drugs . to those who would benefit the most, he said.","A rogue stretch of DNA stops millions of Britons feeling full after eating .

"They say that politics is showbusiness for ugly people. But voters seem willing to give politicians the benefit of the doubt, casting some of Britain’s most popular leading men to play our political leaders. In a new survey Hugh Grant is cast as David Cameron and Colin Firth is likened to Nick Clegg, although Ed Miliband is tipped to be played by Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson. A new survey shows how 27 per cent of people think Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson should play Ed Miliband in a film, while David Cameron gets Love Actually star Hugh Grant . Tony Blair has been portrayed in films several times, most notably by Michael Sheen in three movies, including in the 2006 film The Queen. But today’s crop of politicians have so far failed to catch Hollywood’s eye. All that will change in the New Year when Nigel Farage will be portrayed in a Channel 4 drama about what would happen if Ukip won the 2015 general election. Producers have not yet cast an actor to play the Ukip leader. According to a new ComRes survey for the Independent on Sunday, 13 per cent of people think Alan Rickman could play Mr Farage. 27 per cent of voters said that Rowan Atkinson (right) should play Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) 18 per cent of voters think Love Actually star Hugh Grant should play David Cameron in a movie . A further 21 per cent favoured Atkinson, but he is already cast to play Mr Miliband by 27 per cent of voters. Mr Miliband has struggled to shake-off criticism that he does not look like a prime minister, with the same survey suggesting just 20 per cent saying they can imagine him as PM. While the other party leaders each get paired with good looking actors, rubber-faced Atkinson is best known for playing the socially-awkward Mr Bean who struggles to communicate beyond incompressible noises. Some 18 per cent of people thought Hugh Grant could play David Cameron. Grant has form in the role of a prime minister called David, a part he played in the 2003 Richard Curtis film Love Actually. And in a moment of art imitating life, Mr Cameron last year delivered a speech in Russia declaring: ‘Britain may be a small island, but I would challenge anyone to find a country with a prouder history, a bigger heart or greater resilience.’ Colin Firth, who withdrew his support for the Lib Dems over tuition fees, is tipped to play Nick Clegg . Ukip leader Nigel Farage was also likened to Rowan Atkinson, and Alan Rickman (right) It echoed a scene in Love Actually in which Grant’s character told a press conference: 'We may be a small country, but we are a great one too.’ Grant was also tipped to play Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg by 17 per cent of voters, followed by 12 per cent who opted for Colin Firth. Firth famously supported the Lib Dems before the 2010 election, but withdrew his backing later that year in protest at the hiking of tuition fees. Earlier this month Mr Clegg’s wife Miriam set her sights even higher. Asked on ITV’s Lorraine who would play her husband in a film, she joked: 'Is George Clooney on offer?'","ComRes survey asked voters who should play party leaders in a film .
