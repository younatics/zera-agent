"By . Chris Pleasance . They may be known as fast and vicious killers, but it seems even the king of beasts needs a cat nap every now and again. These pictures show the soft side of one of nature's deadliest predators as a lion has a nap in a tree. The shots were taken in the Maasai Mara national reserve in Kenya by designer Mark Bridger. This lazy lioness is pictured taking a nap in a tree in the Maasai Mara national park in Kenya . British photographer Mark Bridger captured the sleeping cat while on safari in the country . Mark, 45, was in Kenya for seven days after winning a photography competition and was amazed to get these shots of a the lazy lion. Mark, from West Malling, Kent said: 'I was on safari for seven days and I was waking up at 6am every day and staying out for about ten hours in order to take the perfect shots. 'We were in a safari jeep with no sides when I spotted the lionness up the tree. 'Maasai Mara is one of the only places on the planet where lions sleep in trees. It just doesn't really happen outside of Kenya so it was great to see.' Mr Bridger says he woke up every morning at 6am and stayed up for ten hours in order to get the perfect shots . Lions sleeping in trees, while not unheard of, is not common. They prefer to sleep in packs on the ground . Mark took his photographs of the lazy lionness from the safety of the Jeep, and the docile big cat didn't even notice. Mark said: 'If I had stepped out of the Jeep I am told she would have jumped out of the tree and killed me for sure. 'It was amazing to see such a power creature looking so lazy, hiding up in the tree. I'm glad I managed to capture the moment.' Lions are mostly active around dusk, when they hunt, or at night, and spend most of the day time asleep . Mr Bridger took the pictures from a Jeep while in the Maasai Mara, one of the few places lions sleep in trees . Lions are most active at night, or just after dusk when they hunt in short sharp bursts of activity, and spend up to 70 per cent of the rest of the day asleep. In order to escape the heat of the savannah where they live, they will often lay down in long grass or shelter under dense shrubs. Sleeping in trees in unusual behaviour for the species, which prefers to nap in packs on the ground.","Mark Bridger, 45, was on safari in Kenya when he took the pictures .

"By . Wills Robinson . Controversial: Martin McGuinness will be a special guest of the Queen during a state banquet at Windsor Castle . Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness will be a special guest of the Queen during a state banquet at Windsor Castle, it has been confirmed. Northern Ireland's First Minister will also attend other events organised by Her Majesty in London during the historic official visit by Irish president Michael D Higgins to the UK next week. The Sinn Fein politician, who refused to sit in the House of Commons as an MP because it required an oath of allegiance to the Queen, snubbed a gala banquet in her honour at Dublin Castle in 2011. Last month, it was reported he was considering whether to accept the offer, but in a statement, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams confirmed Mr McGuinness would be visiting Windsor Castle. 'While Martin McGuinness's involvement in President Higgins's state visit may not be welcome by opponents of change, it is yet another example of Sinn Fein's commitment to an inclusive future based on tolerance and equality,' he said. 'This decision may cause difficulty for some Irish republicans in light of ongoing difficulties in the north (of Ireland) but I would appeal to them to view this positively in the context of republican and democratic objectives and the interests of unity and peace on this island.' A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'There is a long-standing practice of not commenting in individual invitations. 'That said, Her Majesty is greatly looking forward to this historic state visit and welcoming all guests to Windsor Castle.' The Queen met and shook hands with Mr . McGuinness in Belfast two years ago, a gesture that would have been unthinkable just years earlier. Host: The former Sinn Fein leader will also attend a number of events organised by Her Majesty in London . Mr Adams said next week's state visit by the Irish president needed to be viewed against the backdrop of huge political changes over recent years. 'Sinn Fein seeks a new and positive relationship between Ireland - all of Ireland - and Britain based on equality and mutual respect for the first time in our troubled history,' he said. 'We also seek an agreed, united Ireland which accommodates those who define themselves as British. 'It is within this context that I can confirm that Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness will accept an invitation to attend all events as part of the state visit.' The Queen is said to have taken a keen interest in the preparations for next week's events - the first time an Irish head of state has been formally invited to the UK by a British sovereign. Opposition: Lord Tebbit (left) said he 'would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting Mr McGuinness to my home' while MP Patrick Mercer (right) said the invite was 'going too far' The highly successful state visit to Ireland by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in May 2011 paved the way for the latest milestone. In remarkable scenes, the Queen paid her respects to republican dead at Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, visited Croke Park - site of the 1920 Bloody Sunday massacre - and made a widely praised speech on Anglo-Irish history at Dublin Castle. Since then, a number of meetings between Mr Higgins - a former Labour government minister, a poet and academic - and members of the Royal Family have taken place. Although the Irish head of state has travelled to events in London, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland last year, these were not official visits. Likewise, previous meetings between the Queen and then-president Mary McAleese and her predecessor Mary Robinson at various functions in the UK were not official state visits. 'Difficulty': Andrew Rosindell MP said he would feel 'very uncomfortable' sitting next to him at dinner, but said it was a step forward in healing rifts between the two countries . Highlights of the visit will include an address the president will make to both Houses of Parliament - another first for an Irish head of state. The Queen will stage a traditional state banquet in honour of her guest at Windsor Castle, Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina will visit the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and he will attend another major dinner at the Guildhall in the City given by the Lord Mayor. Northern Ireland will be recognised with the Queen hosting a reception for leading figures from Ulster's cultural, political and business life. Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell said: 'Whilst the man concerned has engaged in things in the past which have created appalling mayhem and tragedy, today we are looking at healing those rifts. Diplomacy: The pair shook hands during a visit to the Lyric Theatre in Belfast in June 2012 . 'I would feel very uncomfortable sitting beside him at dinner. I would have great difficulty doing that myself, but in terms of building a democratic foundation in Northern Ireland, I can understand why people feel this is what we need to do. 'But would I want to sit beside him at dinner? No, I certainly would not.' Last month, when rumours of the invite emerged, there was a furious reaction by a number of politicians condemning the invite. Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, who . survived the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984 which . left his wife Margaret paralysed, said: ‘Were I the Queen, I think I . would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting Mr McGuinness . to my home.’ Newark MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army . colonel who also served in Northern Ireland, said: ‘The IRA was . responsible for killing and injuring many of my colleagues and, while I . fully appreciate the need for conciliation, I feel this invitation is . going too far.’ A former Parachute Regiment member, who . was involved in Lord Saville’s long-running and costly Bloody Sunday . inquiry, said: ‘The thought of this former IRA commander walking into . Windsor Castle makes me feel physically sick. People should remember . what the IRA did and how many innocent lives have been lost.’ Confirmation: Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Mr McGuinness would be visiting Windsor Castle and other official events in London during the four-day state visit beginning on Tuesday .

"By . Lee Moran . These are the 'Ghost' killer thugs pumped up on steroids who are proving key to keeping Syria's brutal President Bashar Assad in power. Covered in tattoos of images of their leader, they are blamed for roaming the nation massacring children and women by slitting their throats or shooting them at point-blank range. Wielding AK-47s and machetes, they are said to carry out the government's dirty work so officials can claim the rampages are not being sponsored by the state. Pumped up: Areen Al Assad, with a tattoo of Bashar Assad on his bicep, is said to be one of the 'Ghost' killers roaming Syria . Meat-head: Known as the 'Shabiha', they wear combat trousers and black t-shirts and are paid the massive sum of £130 per day . Known as the 'Shabiha', translating to 'Ghosts', they wear combat trousers and black t-shirts and are paid the massive sum of £130 per day. Their modus operandi sees them swarm in to towns after the army has stopped shelling. A source said: 'Their mission is to terrorise the civilian population and conduct ethnic cleansing.' A massacre of 108 civilians in Houla two weeks ago, including 49 children, has been blamed on the group who fanatically follow the Muslim Alawite sect. They are also reported to have shot dead 12 workers in Qusayr and 78 villagers in Qubair last week. Messing about: The 'Ghosts' modus operandi sees them swarm in to towns after the army has stopped shelling . Muscle man: Emergence of the death squad pictures comes after William Hague said yesterday he may have to send troops to Syria if the country spirals into a  Bosnian-style civil war . Dr Mousab Azzawi, who runs the Syrian . Network for Human Rights from London but had treated some of the Shabiha . in Latakia, said recently: 'They were like monsters. 'They . had huge muscles, and big bellies and beards. They took steroids to . pump up their bodies. I had to talk to them like children as they like . people with low intelligence. Syria's large chemical weapons stocks could be trained on Israel, the latter's deputy military chief has warned. According to Maj. Gen. Yair Naveh, Syria has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons in the world. If the Syrians had the chance, he said, they would 'treat us the same way they treat their own people'. Syria has not declared its chemical weapons stocks so their exact size is not known. Among other things, Israel is worried that such weapons could fall into the hands of anti-Israel militants should the Syrian regime crumble. Israeli radio stations and newspapers carried Naveh's remarks today. He delivered them Sunday night at a ceremony in Jerusalem commemorating fallen soldiers. Syrian activists estimate more than 13,000 people have died since an uprising against the Syrian regime erupted 15 months ago, drawing a bloody crackdown. Israel has been watching the carnage in neighboring Syria with increasing concern. The two countries have fought major wars and multiple attempts to reach a peace deal failed. Syria has strong ties to Iran, Israel's most fearsome enemy, and to Palestinian and Lebanese militants that have warred with Israel. 'That is what makes them so terrifying — the combination of strength and blind allegiance to the regime.' Emergence of the death squad pictures . comes after William Hague said yesterday he may have to send troops to . Syria if the country spirals into a  Bosnian-style civil war. The . Foreign Secretary said Britain would have to 'greatly increase our . support for the opposition' if the current United Nations plan for a . ceasefire fails, as his office now fears. Mr Hague repeatedly refused to rule out military action yesterday if Syria descends into 'terrible' sectarian violence. And he twice compared the violence raging in the Arab state to the conflict in Bosnia, where 12,000 British soldiers were eventually sent, rather than Libya, where the Government resisted sending in ground troops. Mr Hague told the BBC: 'The reason I don’t rule things out is because we really don't know now how this situation is going to develop or how terrible it is going to become. 'Increasingly the analogy is not with Libya last year but with Bosnia in the 1990s. 'We are on the edge of that kind of sectarian murder on a large scale. So who knows what may be required from the international community to try to deal with that, if it gets going in that way.' As violence continued to rage yesterday, claiming at least 38 lives, Mr Hague reiterated his message on Sky News. He said Syria is now 'on the edge of a sectarian conflict in which neighbouring villages are attacking and killing each other so I don’t think we can rule anything out'. The Foreign Secretary's words will fuel concerns that Britain risks being sucked into another Middle East war with potentially devastating political and humanitarian consequences. Enforcers: Film footage shows the 'Ghosts' walking out and about . Action man: Pictured with guns, the Ghost poses for this photograph . But some diplomats believe the West will be compelled to act if the situation deteriorates and risks dragging in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Turkey. Security sources said one scenario under discussion would see troops deploy to protect aid convoys entering Syria, a task Western soldiers also carried out in the early years of the Bosnian war. Mr Hague gave credence to that theory by stressing the problems of providing aid to Syria yesterday. 'One of the great difficulties here is getting aid to them where fighting is going on and where the regime doesn’t provide access,' he said. The UK has already provided £8.5million of medical supplies and emergency aid via international agencies. Battered: The Ghosts filmed beating activists . Violence: A massacre of 108 civilians in Houla two weeks ago, including 49 children, has been blamed on the group who fanatically follow the Muslim Alawite sect . Mr Hague said he 'welcomed in principle' a Russian proposal for an international conference on Syria, but warned it must 'lead to a change and not just buy time for the regime to kill more people'. He said it would be hard to see how Iran could attend the conference - one of Russia's demands - as it had already given Syria technical support and advised the regime on how to suppress protests. Instead, he said the way forward was to adopt the peace plan of former United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan. Most diplomats, however, believe that plan is dead in the water, and the Foreign Secretary conceded: ‘Every other solution to the Syrian crisis involves a lot more death.’ Today Syrian troops attacked a rebel-held town in the centre of the country with helicopter gunships and shelled other restive areas across the country, activists said. The aerial assault targeted the strategic river crossing town of Rastan that has resisted repeated government offensives for months, they added. It is part of an escalation of violence in recent weeks that comes despite an internationally-brokered cease-fire that was supposed to go into effect on April 12 but never took hold. Destruction: Syrians sit next to a damaged house at the northern town of Ariha, on the outskirts of Idlib, yesterday . Patrol: Syrian troops deployed in Duma, in a suburb of Damascus . 'The regime is now using helicopters more after its ground troops suffered major losses,' said Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 'Dozens of vehicles have been destroyed or damaged since the end of May.' Syria's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi recently said rebels are now using sophisticated anti-tank missiles. Videos posted by activists over the past week have shown many destroyed tanks and armored personnel carriers. The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees also reported government shelling in the central provinces of Homs and Hama, the southern region of Daraa, the northern province of Aleppo, and suburbs of the capital Damascus and Deir el-Zour in the east. The Observatory reported the deaths of four civilians and an army defector in shelling in the area of Ashara in Deir el-Zour, and said another eight unidentified bodies had been discovered nearby. It reported three dead in the Hama shelling. In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will visit Iran on Wednesday. Russia and Iran are Syrian President Bashar Assad's strongest allies. Moscow and China have vetoed two Security Council resolutions that threatened possible sanctions against Syria. The ministry said in a statement that Russia is not playing the role of advocate for certain Middle East regimes. 'We are speaking for the strict observance of the norms and principles of international law in the interest of supporting regional stability and security in the Near and Middle East and North Africa,' it said. Syrian activists say the violence has claimed the lives of more than 13,000 people.  UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said on the killings of children in Syria: 'How many more children need to die? 'Repeated calls for the protection of children by all parties in Syria have not yielded positive action. But we must voice again our outrage when seeing the murder of innocents, especially children and women, as reportedly the case in Al-Qubair village in Hama. 'UNICEF appeals once more: spare and protect the children who are in no way responsible for the violence and must not be its victims.'","They wield AK-47s and machetes to carry out the government's dirty work .

"By . Mark Nicol . An angry row has erupted after a historic chapel used to honour the dead from elite Guards regiments was taken over by mercenaries. More than 200 employees of Aegis, a private military contractor founded by Colonel Tim Spicer, gathered at the Guards Chapel, at Wellington Barracks, near Buckingham Palace, to pay tribute to 32 colleagues killed in Iraq. Afterwards they attended a lunch in the Household Division’s Sergeants’ Mess. Controversial: Aegis founder Colonel Tim Spicer, left, under arrest in Papua New Guinea in 1997 . Ten years ago, Aegis was heavily criticised by John Kerry, now the US Secretary  of State, after the firm won a £160million contract from the American Government to  co-ordinate security in Iraq. He claimed Colonel Spicer  had a ‘history of supporting excessive use of force against  a civilian population’. Colonel Spicer came to prominence in 1997 after his intervention in Papua New Guinea saw him arrested when the army launched a coup. He was also mentioned in a 1999 report into the flouting of a UN arms embargo on Sierra Leone. One senior Guardsman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘The chapel should be reserved for honouring those who have sacrificed their lives for Queen and Country. 'They have been remembered at the chapel for centuries, and the Guards regiments are the most historic in the British Army. ‘Guardsmen have died in the line of duty and for a fraction of the sums paid to employees of private military companies such as Aegis. So for this event to take place at the chapel... is a smack in the mouth to us.’ 'A smack in the mouth to us': A senior Guardsman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the chapel should be 'reserved for honouring those who have sacrificed their lives for Queen and Country' Built in 1838, the chapel is the spiritual home of the seven regiments of the Household Division – the Life Guards, the Blues and Royals, and the Grenadier, Coldstream, Irish, Welsh and Scots Guards. According to the Army’s website, it is the only remaining military chapel in London. An Aegis spokesman declined to say whether Colonel Spicer had attended the event. ‘The service was held on March 30,’ she added. ‘It was a poignant memorial service led by a senior serving military chaplain of the Guards Chapel.’","Aegis employees gathered to pay tribute to 32 colleagues killed in Iraq .

"By . Becky Evans . and Eleanor Harding . A detailed picture of how ‘Mr and Mrs  Average’ live has been built up using data from Facebook. The study shows how men and women develop new interests as they mature – and how the genders are often out of sync. While women tend to take exercise seriously from the age of 34, for  example, the average man waits until  his 45th birthday before working hard to  get in shape. The average woman spends more time talking about sports, politics, career and money as she gets older . Women’s interest in books peaks aged 22, while men become most into literature as they reach their 50s. And men start to shift their focus . away from the workplace after age 30, while women do not do so until . eight years later. Both sexes, however, care most about fashion aged 16. The research used anonymous data . donated by thousands of Facebook users, recording the statuses, ‘likes’ and ‘interests’ they had posted on their profiles. It found the average woman talks about television most at 44, while men peak much younger, aged 31. Men are also most likely to see a film in a cinema at 31 – but women go out to see films most aged only 19. Men are most interested in travel at 29, women at 27, while women talk most about food and drink at 35, and men at 38. And if you are middle aged, a fail-safe topic for any audience is the weather – a key  interest for many as they approach 60. Stephen Wolfram, the British . scientist who carried out the research, also created the Wolfram Alpha . search engine used by Apple and Microsoft. He recently said: ‘It’s almost shocking how much this tells us about the evolution of  people’s typical interests. ‘People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics. The Facebook study found women are most interested in fitness aged 34 while for men they are aged 45 . ‘Men typically talk more about sports . and technology than women – and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also . talk more about movies, television and music.’ Experts say tracking such details could mean social change is spotted sooner. Carl Miller, of think-tank Demos, said such monitoring if done in ‘real . time’ could also detect changes in the public mood. He added: ‘You could . produce a social media version of the “worm” that ran alongside . speeches [on TV screens] in the leaders’ debates during the last general . election, but relying on millions of voices.’ But it may alarm others who feel we . are already monitored too much online, for example with ‘cookies’ tracking browsing and tailoring online adverts to our tastes. Tracking key words that users post on . their Facebook walls, a picture is being created of what interests . people depending on age and gender. Mr Wolfram said in his blog: 'Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. 'And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. The age of men and women when their interest peaks on Facebook . Books:    Men - 50                 Women - 22 . Fashion: Men - 16                 Women - 16 . Fitness:  Men - 45                Women - 34 . Health:    Men - 54                Women - 43 . Tech:       Men - 34                Women - 22 . Sports:    Men - 14 and 18                 Women - 48 . 'But what to me is remarkable is how . we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail [and through . data analysis create] a kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they . go through life.' The . study revealed that people talk more about politics as they get older . and are generally more interested in family and friends when in their . early teens. But not all subjects split the genders. Men and women's interest in politics and weather both peak at 60 - the age where the study ends. There . is only a six year gap on the subject of pets and animals where women's . interest peaks on Facebook aged 37 and men aged 43. Carl Miller, from the think tank Demos, said the live tracking used in this study could be used on a wider scale - from politics to exercise. The different ages men and women are most interested in books is the biggest gender gap - 28 years . Mr Wolfram was also optimistic about what could be achieved using these methods of live tracking and data science. He . said on his blog: 'Over the decades I’ve been steadily accumulating . countless anecdotal “case studies” about the trajectories of people’s . lives—from which I’ve certainly noticed lots of general patterns. 'But . what’s amazed me about what we’ve done over the past few weeks is how . much systematic information it’s been possible to get all at once. Quite . what it all means, and what kind of general theories we can construct . from it, I don’t yet know. 'But it feels like we’re starting to be able to train a serious “computational telescope” on the “social universe”. 'And it’s letting us discover all sorts of phenomena. That have the potential to help us understand much more about society and about ourselves. 'And that, by the way, provide great examples of what can be achieved with data science, and with the technology I’ve been working on developing for so long.' One in eight social media users make up things to tweet or put on Facebook . One in eight social media addicts make up things to put on their tweets and status updates, new figures reveal. And it is because they want to keep up with the star-studded lifestyle of the rich and famous from Justin Bieber to Stephen Fry it seems. Most reckon their own lives are too humdrum so exaggerate, fib and cheat to make themselves sound more interesting, said the study by Barclaycard Bespoke Offers. The survey of 2,000 social media users found 12 per cent of social media users regularly 'big up' what's happening in their lives to sound more interesting. Many are so determined to be on a social media site that they will be economical with the truth when nothing interesting is going on in their lives or they cannot think of something funny to say. Four in 10 (39 per cent) of social network fibbers put their dishonesty down to pressure from friends and colleagues to have a good time or sound upbeat in their Facebook or Twitter updates. More than a quarter (29 per cent) admit that their lives are simply too boring without a bit of embellishing on their profiles.Eight in 10 people have made their Facebook updates more colourful, 40 per cent on Twitter and five per cent on other social media web sites. Examples of fibs include moaning about still being at work while on your way home, claiming to have spotted a celebrity, boosting culture credentials by pretending to visit a museum or art gallery, embellishing restaurant visits and claiming someone else's Twitter joke as your own. Barclaycard brand ambassador Tom Fletcher, of boy band McFly, said: 'This research shows that social networkers are almost embarrassed by not having a good time. 'But people should not be disappointed by their lives. It's not just about the money. The real social currency lies in going to amazing events and having great experiences you can then share with friends and followers online.' The research was commissioned by Barclaycard to launch its new 'bespoke offers' personalised shopping service.","The unique study follows the interests of 1million Facebook users .

"By . Damien Gayle . The Big Bang and the subsequent expansion of the Universe did not need God to set it off, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking suggested to an audience in California this week. A combination of quantum theory and the theory of relativity would a better explain our existence than divine intervention, he told a packed auditorium at the California Institute of Technology. And he suggested that turning to the dark side could illuminate fundamental questions about how the Universe began. Scroll down for video . No need for God: Stephen Hawking, pictured at an earlier event in California this month, drew thousands of science fans to hear him speak on the origins of the Universe at the California Institute of Technology . 'The missing link in cosmology is the nature of dark matter and dark energy,' the LA Times reported Hawking as saying. Easily the world's most famous theoretical physicist - perhaps the only one the most people can name - Hawking more then filled the 1,100-capacity auditorium laid on by Caltech for the event. Queues to hear the Brief History Of Time author started forming a 8am, 12 hours before his talk was scheduled to begin, the LA Times reported. By 6pm, those eager to see him in person stood in a line a quarter-of-a-mile long, according to Space.com, and still many were forced to sit in an overflow space. And when that was filled, a thousand more say on a lawn outside the lecture theatre which had been equipped with a big screen and sound system, in a manner after Wimbledon's Henman hill. In a wide ranging talk, the former Cambridge professor recapped various theories of the beginning of the Universe, caricaturing the religious position with the myth of an African tribe whose god vomited the Sun, Moon and stars. He also discussed theories which suggest that existence in fact had no beginning, and claimed that Edwin Hubble's observations of an expanding Universe and Einstein's theory of relativity had disproved those. Best seller: Hawking's 1988 book A Brief History of Time spent a record-breaking 237 weeks in the Sunday Times UK best-sellers list . He also had time for a few jokes, one of which paraphrased Martin Luther's response to a young man who dared to ask what God was doing before he made the world. 'If one believed that the universe had a beginning, the obvious question was what happened before the beginning?' he asked. 'What was God doing before He made the world? Was He preparing Hell for people who asked such questions?' Attempting what could be seen as a kind of Copernican Revolution in cosmology, Hawking tried to explain his point of view that such questions were nonsensical. 'The problem of what happens at the beginning of time is a bit like the question of what happened at the edge of the world, when people thought the world was flat,' he said. He suggested that the idea of time running in only one direction 'like a model railway track' was misconceived and that combining of general relativity and quantum theory can allow time to act just like another direction in space. 'This means one can get rid of the problem of time having a beginning, in a similar way in which we got rid of the edge of the world,' he said. Hawking asked his audience to imagine the beginning of the Universe is like the South Pole, with the role of time being played by degrees of latitude. Just as asking what is south of the South Pole makes no sense, he argued, to asking what happened before the beginning of the Universe would become a meaningless question. Stephen Hawking at Caltech . Moreover, conceiving of the Universe in this way also removes 'age-old objections' to the idea that the Universe had a beginning; that it would be a place where the normal laws of physics could not hold. Instead, Hawking claimed, the beginning of the Universe could be governed by laws of science, which justifies a picture he and fellow physicist Jim Hartle developed as like the formation of bubbles of steam in boiling water. This claims that the most probably history of the Universe is like the surface of such bubbles, a few of which grow to such a size that they are safe from collapsing. 'They will correspond to universes that would start off expanding at an ever increasing rate' like the expanding Universe we live in, he said. The wonders of space: A picture from the Hubble Space Telescope. Hawking said the observations of an expanding galaxy made by the astronomer after which the telescope is made refuted the idea the universe had no beginning . Quantum theory could best understand how the state of the Universe at the initial point of its formation gave rise to the Universe we live in today 13.5billion years after the Big Bang, Hawking claimed. He said: 'General relativity on its own cannot answer the central question in cosmology: Why is the universe the way it is? 'However, if general relativity is combined with quantum theory, it may be possible to predict how the universe would start.' Small fluctuations in the initial state of the Universe would lead to the formation of 'galaxies, stars, and all the other structure in the universe,' he said. His theory could be tested when science develops the ability to detect gravitational waves by accurately measuring the distance between spacecraft. These waves, he said, originated in the earliest times of the universe and have not been altered by their interactions by 'intervening material'. Hawking, now 71, has been battling degenerative motor-neurone disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, for more than 50 years. His works of popular science have acheived great success, despite the arcane nature of the cosmology he investigates. A Brief History of Time stayed on the Sunday Times best-seller list for a record breaking 237 weeks. He has been spending a month at Caltech, as he does every year, always drawing huge crowds to hear him speak.","Quantum theory and general relativity combined could best explain the beginning of the Universe, Stephen Hawking tells audience at Caltech .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron issued a coded warning yesterday that Britain is prepared to sue Spain over its treatment of Gibraltar. As a day of telephone diplomacy descended into name calling, the Prime Minister called Spanish leader Mariano Rajoy to warn him that Spain must back down or the UK ‘will be forced to do more’ to defend the people of the Rock. Officials admitted this could go as far as legal action in the European Court of Justice. Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron made clear his unhappiness to his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy, warning controls at the border with Gibraltar were 'disproportionate and unacceptable' After the call, Mr Cameron vowed: ‘Britain will always stand up for the people of Gibraltar.’ But hopes he had won concessions from Mr Rajoy were dashed as officials continued to impose draconian border controls. Last night Foreign Secretary William . Hague was harangued in a phone call with his Spanish counterpart, Jose . Garcia-Margallo, who has threatened to impose tolls at the border and . ban Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spain’s airspace. Spain imposed border controls at the . weekend after the government of Gibraltar sank concrete blocks in the . waters off the Rock to deter Spanish fishermen. But the skipper of one of the Spanish . fishing boats involved said yesterday that he was being ‘used’ by his . government for political purposes. Mr Cameron warned that UK-Spanish relations could be damaged ‘unless the situation at the border improved’. This week Gibraltar's chief minister asked Britain to send Royal Navy warships to the area in a bid to stop Spanish boat police making unauthorised incursions into the Rock's territorial waters. Fabian Picardo accused Madrid of 'sabre-rattling' and behaving like North Korea after Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo's suggested introducing a levy on people crossing the border between Gibraltar and Spain. Mr Cameron decided to intervene in the row after returning to London on Monday after a holiday in Portugal. He called Mr Rajoy to ‘raise serious concerns about actions by the Spanish at the border with Gibraltar’. At the start of the conversation Mr Cameron made clear that his deep unhappiness at suggestions by Mt Garcia-Margallo that they may introduce further measures. Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘Constructive call with Spain's PM Rajoy. I made clear my concerns re Gibraltar and that our position on sovereignty won't change.’ Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work . A Downing Street spokesman added: ‘The . PM made clear that our position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar and its . surrounding waters will not change. ‘He . also reiterated, as the PM and Mr Rajoy had previously agreed, that the . issue should not damage our bilateral relations. However, there was a . real risk of this happening unless the situation at the border improved. ‘Mr . Rajoy agreed that he did not want the issue to become an obstacle in . the bilateral relations and that we needed to find a way to de-escalate . the issue. As a next step, the Foreign Secretary should speak to Mr . Garcia-Margallo to discuss a way forward. ‘In . the meantime, Prime Minister Rajoy committed to reducing measures at . the border. Both leaders agreed that there should be a solution to the . fishing dispute.’ Accused: Spanish Foreign Minister Jose . Garcia-Margallo (left) has suggested introducing a 50 Euro charge for . people crossing the border between Spain and Gibraltar while (right) Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo urged the UK government to . 'demonstrate the waters are British by filling them with British assets' The latest row began after Mr Picardo ordered the dumping of 70 concrete blocks into a small bay around the Gibraltar airport runway in order to prevent Spanish overfishing of the area. Spain hit back by introducing time-consuming security checks at the border post leading to huge queues and long delays for people travelling from Gibraltar into Spain. Britain's ambassador to Spain made a formal protest over ‘disproportionate’ checks at the border. In his meeting with Spanish foreign secretary Gonzalo de Benito, ambassador Giles Paxman also sought an official explanation for Spanish threats to levy a charge on vehicles crossing the border and to close airspace. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Giles Paxman visited the Spanish secretary of state (for foreign affairs), Gonzalo de Benito, to formally protest at the disproportionate border checks at the weekend and to seek an explanation of foreign minister (Jose) Garcia-Margallo's comments that he intends to target Gibraltar with future punitive measures. ‘The ambassador reiterated that the UK would stand shoulder to shoulder with Gibraltar in face of threats from Spain.’ The fisherman caught in the diplomatic row over Gibraltar has said that he feels he has been 'used' by his government. The Spanish skipper of the Divina Providencia, Francisco Gomez Elias, has said that he just wants to be 'left alone to fish' after the agreement allowing Spanish vessels to fish off the Rock was revoked. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I am a pawn in the hands of politicians using me to make a point that that has little to do with my right to earn a living as a fisherman.' Trouble: The row erupted after an agreement allowing Spanish trawlers to fish off the coast of Gibraltar was revoked . Gibraltar authorities sunk 70 concrete blocks to form an artificial bay off the Rock, preventing all but line fishing. In retaliation, Spanish guards carried out searches which led to queues of up to seven hours at the border. But Mr Gomez refused to give up his fishing ground and has earned himself his own Spanish police marine guard. The 50-year-old has been accused of breaching Gibraltar's nature laws with his method of dragging shellfish off the floor. He will face court later this year. He said that the irony is that he is fishing to supply restaurants in Gibraltar but is no longer allowed to fish in its waters. 'I am just trying to make a living and now I am having to fish further away where I can't find the same catch and spend more on fuel so it just isn't economically viable,"" 'I don't want to get involved in the politics of it all, I just want to be left to fish in peace.'","Spanish threat to charge thousands of workers £43 to cross border .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and David Mccormack . The mastermind behind Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, is a tough taskmaster who at just three years of age took his own crib apart with a screwdriver because he wanted a real bed, reveals a new book. He is the subject of a new biography that gives a number of fascinating insights into the bullish management style of one of the key architects of the internet age. The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos And The Age Of Amazon was released on Tuesday and tells the story of the creation and amazing growth of the online retailer, which launched in 1995 and sold $61billion worth of goods last year alone. Scroll down for video . Bullish, driven and determined: Bezos founded Amazon.com in a bid to live life without regrets . Author Brad Stone, who also writes for Businessweek, approached Bezos and asked if he could tell his story. Although Bezos refused to be interviewed for the book, he encouraged friends, family and company executives to talk to the author. The amazing success of the company has . earned Bezos a reputation as someone who can be unsparing in his . criticism and isn’t an easy man to work for. ‘If . you’re not good, Jeff will chew you up and spit you out. And if you are . good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground,’ is one . quote about Bezos’s management style in the book. Amazon has earned a reputation for being an incredibly ruthless negotiator with the companies that it does business with. The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos And The Age Of Amazon' was released on Tuesday and tells the story of the creation and amazing growth of the online retailer . Stone . describes Amazon’s culture as 'notoriously confrontational, and it . begins with Bezos, who believes that truth springs forth when ideas and . perspectives are banged against each other, sometimes violently'. In the book it is revealed that Bezos . once suggested that Amazon approach small publishers in the same way . that a cheetah approaches a sick gazelle. The . environment isn’t for everyone and turnover among top executives is high, writes Stone. He quotes one observer as saying that . Amazon executives 'have an absolute willingness to torch the landscape . around them to emerge the winner.' Stone also writes that . Bezos can be kind to people, but is well-known for going on rants that . other employees refer to as 'nutters', and that he has a reputation for asking his employees . provocative questions, such as 'Does it surprise you that you don’t know the answer to that question?', or 'Why are you ruining my life?'. After graduating from Princeton in 1986, Bezos worked at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw before deciding to setup his own company. Since launching in 1995, Amazon has become the world's largest online retailer and last year it sold $61billion of goods . In . the book it is revealed that he was so eager to get started on his own . that he left before the end of the financial year and so walked away . from a very large financial bonus. The . gamble has certainly paid off, but it hasn’t been plain sailing and the . company suffered a dramatic downturn during the dot-com bubble at the . turn of the century. Amazon’s . stock hit a high of almost $107 a share during the first dot-com . boom, but then plunged below $6 after the market collapsed. It . has since soared to more than $300 a share. Stone writes that Bezos had an ordinary childhood with his mother and stepfather, but that his real father, Ted Jorgensen, was a one-time circus performer whom his mother told to stay out of their lives when Bezos was just four years old. Jorgensen has revealed that he plans to contact the billionaire Amazon founder after only learning about who his son had become from author Stone. His own family: Bezos married his wife MacKenzie in 1993 (seen together at the Met Ball in 2012) and they have four children . Then and now: Ted Jorgensen was a teenage unicyclist (left) when his son Jeffrey was born, and he only learned that the boy grew up to be Jeff Bezos last year (pictured right this year, at age 69) Jorgensen was an 18-year-old unicyclist who was a rising star on the niche circuit when his girlfriend, Jackie Gise, became pregnant. The pair traveled to New Mexico to get married - because she was too young under American law - and then returned and had a makeshift ceremony at her house, where both of their mothers signed their marriage application form. Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born on January 12, 1964, and 17 months later, Ted and Jackie got a divorce. Both Jackie and her father told Ted never to contact the family again, and he agreed. She then started dating her co-worker, Mike Bezos, who she eventually married. Gise asked Jorgensen's legal permission to allow her new husband to adopt their son, Jeffrey, and he agreed. Fast forward 47 years and reporter Stone . went to the small bike-repair shop in Glendale, Arizona, that Jorgensen . owns and he found the 69-year-old working behind the counter. Parents: Jeff's mother Jackie (left) married his step father Mike Bezos (right) when Jeff was four-years-old . 'I’d considered a number of ways he might react to my unannounced appearance but gave a very low probability to the likelihood of what actually happened: He had no idea what I was talking about,' Stone writes. 'Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO.' It was only after the author brought up Jeff's mother Jackie Gise and their infant son Jeffrey that he saw the wheels in Jorgensen's head begin to turn before seeing his eyes fill 'with sorrow and disbelief'. Stone then met with Jorgensen and his current wife Linda, who has four children that he helped raise. 'I wasn’t a good father or a husband,' Jorgensen said of his first marriage. 'It was really all my fault. I don’t blame Jackie at all.'

"By . James  Nye . Under mounting pressure to speak out about the controversy that has engulfed the department store this week, the rap mogul released a lengthy statement on his website after an online petition called for him to bow out of his upcoming partnership with Barneys. The Manhattan superstore stands accused of profiling two young black people, calling the police on both after they purchased expensive items. The rapper has signed a contract to design an exclusive line for Barneys that will be available next month. But Jay-Z - whose real name is Shawn Carter - defended himself, saying that he hasn't spoken about it because he's still trying to figure out exactly what happened. 'I move and speak based on facts and not emotion,' the statement said. Scroll Down for Video . Speaking out: Jay-Z has faced claims of supporting Barneys in the wake of their racial profiling scandal. The rapper says he is waiting to receive all the proper information before commenting or taking action, and that he has been demonized for doing so . Defending himself: Jay-Z reacts to increasing pressure in a statement on his website . 'I haven't made any comments because I am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and Barneys. 'Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?' 'I am not making a dime from this collection ... I need to make that fact crystal clear. The Shawn Carter Foundation is the beneficiary ... This money is going to help individuals facing socio-economic hardships to help further their education at institutions of higher learning. 'I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgements, no matter who it’s towards, aren’t I committing the same sin as someone who profiles? 'I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position.' The statement came after residents of Marcy House, in Brooklyn, where Jay-Z grew up, called on the '99 Problems' rapper and husband of Beyonce to think about those who have not become as succesful as him.'Jay Z and my son grew up together,' said Effie Hardy, 74, to the New York Daily News. 'That could be his family Barneys is profiling. They would’ve done the same thing to him back in the day, before he got to where he is now. He should remember that.' The luxury and exclusive collection that Jay-Z has lent his considerable clout to is named 'A New York Holiday,' and the cheapest item is a $70 cotton T-shirt, while a Shawn Carter watch by Hublot with alligator skin straps will cost $33,900. Expensive: Items available from Jay-Z's new exclusive line at Barneys called 'A New York Holiday' - which has products available for tens of thousands of dollars . Another Marcy resident, Annette Rush, 40, told the New York Daily News that as a role model, Jay-Z should think about the ramifications of the two shoppers allegations. 'My money is as good as anybody else’s money. It’s all green,' said Rush. 'From someone that came from the hood, he should know all that. He knows how hard it is. I don’t think he should sell his things there, not at a place where there’s racial profiling going on. It’s ridiculous.' The controversy began when two black customers came forward to say that they had been stopped and detained after buying expensive items from the luxury store. Anger: Social media vented its dismay towards Jay-Z and one user attempted to link the Trayvon Martin case and the profiling of two customers at Barneys . Evocative: This Twitter user tries to invoke Jay-Z's paternal instincts by questioning how he would feel if his daughter was racially profiled as it is alleged the NYPD and Barneys profiled two black customers . On Tuesday, Trayon Christian, 19, from Queens said that he was suing the city and Barneys after he was accosted by two undercover NYPD detectives after he had bought a $349 Ferragamo belt. And then on Wednesday, Kayla Phillips, 21, a seven-month pregnant mother from Canarsie, Brooklyn, said that she too had been stopped. The young mother, from Brooklyn, New York, said she experienced similarly shocking treatment from staff at the Madison Avenue store in February when she bought a $2,500 Céline handbag. She has now filed a $5 million notice of claim with the city showing her intention to sue the NYPD. 'As I was walking into the train station, four undercover police officers attacked me,' Phillips told the New York Post. 'They were very rough,' she added to the New York Daily News. 'I didn't know what was happening.' She explained to the cops that she had used a temporary Bank of America card to make the purchase - and they demanded to know why her name was not on it. Complaint: Kayla Phillips, 21, says cops demanded to know how she could afford to buy a $2,500 Céline bag from Barneys in New York - in a case that echoes that of a teen accusing the store of racial profiling . Shock: She called her mother Wendy Straker (right with Kayla) who said she heard police ask her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?' She called her mother, Wendy Straker, who said that the police officers had asked her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?' Straker added that the police were on the phone with a Barneys employee about the transaction. Police finally let her go after she showed them her ID and new debit card, which arrived that morning. 'Jay Z is getting ready to do a campaign with Barneys, but they’re looking at these African-American kids like they're thieves,' Straker said. The case comes after it emerged that another shopper, Trayon Christian, was stopped and handcuffed after he bought a $350 Salvatore Ferragamo belt in the store. Treat: She had just bought a $2,500 orange suede Céline handbag when she was stopped by cops . Christian, 19, has now filed a lawsuit for unspecified damages against the Madison Avenue store and the NYPD who wrongly accused him of fraud. Mr Christian, who lives with his mom in Queens, had decided to splash out on the belt after seeing one of his favorite music stars, Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, wearing the accessory. However once he had paid for the belt and had left Barneys on April 29 this year, the fashion-loving teen was grabbed by undercover officers on the street. According to the civil rights lawsuit, the 19-year-old was asked 'how a young black man such as himself could afford to purchase such an expensive belt'. Mr Christian's lawyer Michael Palillo told the New York Daily News: 'He's never been arrested. His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt.' Trayon Christian, 19, has brought a lawsuit against Barneys and the NYPD after they wrongly accused him of fraud when he purchased a designer belt . Barneys department store is facing a lawsuit after a 19-year-old black student claims he was wrongly grabbed by store detectives because of his color and accused of stealing a designer belt . A Barneys store employee had asked the 19-year-old for ID when he used his Chase debit card to buy the belt. Mr Christian showed the clerk his state ID. Harlem rapper Juelz Santana (pictured right) wearing the belt coveted by his teenage fan . The store cashier then subsequently called the police to claim that the purchase was a fraud, according to the lawsuit. Officers took the teenager to a local precinct. Mr Christian once again showed his ID, debit card and receipt for the belt. Officers still refused to believe the teenager. Finally Chase bank was contacted who verified that the debit card belonged to Mr Christian. It was only then that he was allowed to go after spending two hours in a holding cell, the suit claims. The NYPD denied this and said the student was only held for 42 minutes. The student, who has no history of arrests, said that he will never shop at Barneys again following the incident. A Barney's New York spokesman said: 'Barneys New York typically does not comment on pending litigation. 'In this instance, we feel compelled to note that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale. 'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights.'","Rapper under attack for sticking by Barneys - who will soon release a line he designed called 'A New York Holiday' - after they allegedly called police on two black customers who bought expensive items .

"By . Hayley O'keeffe . Historic riverside trees which were admired by Elizabethan diarist Samuel Pepys have been cut down on orders from university bosses. The 300-year-old cherry trees in the grounds of Cambridge University's Magdalene College, blossom in the spring, and the sight is popular with punters on the river. But locals say the once picturesque scene is now an eyesore after the trees, which were growing in a conservation area, were cut down. (Left) The cherry trees enjoyed by punters along the River Cam and (right) the trees have now been removed prompting angry locals to brand the area and eyesore . One punt operator said: 'This is . usually one of the most beautiful places on the river in the spring time . when the trees are in bloom, but now it looks terrible. 'We often get requests to punt past the blossom trees, but now it looks an eyesore, with just bare concrete, it's such a shame.' Magdalene College alumni include Samuel . Pepys, who wrote parts of his historically significant diary during his time studying for a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1654. The famous Elizabethan was also briefly an MP for Cambridge and his diaries document such key events as the Great Fire of London and the plague. Actor Sir Michael Redgrave who appeared in The Great War and The Dambusters also studied at Magdalene. And CS Lewis, who famously wrote Narnia series of books was a fellow and tutor of English literature at the university. The riverbank beside the Cam now looks bare after historic cherry trees, which were admired by Samuel Pepys and CS Lewis were chopped down . College chiefs applied to Cambridge City Council to remove the trees saying that they were damaging walls and drains and were in poor condition. The council approved the plans, but the college will re-plant between five and seven new trees as part of a refurbishment at the site. Cambridge resident Caroline Hannoway, 53, said: 'I always look forward to seeing the beautiful cherry trees in blossom and they have become quite famous with tourists. 'It looks bare and ugly along the river there now and even if they do plant new trees they will take years to mature.' Neither the college or the council were available for comment at the time of publication.","Locals say that the riverside walk is an eyesore now that the blossoming trees have been chopped down .

Dr Stone, 44, and a group of friends . were on a three-day festive break and had been at a ceilidh on Sunday . evening before being invited back to local musician Jim Hunter’s home at . Lochailort, near Fort William. The group were laughing and chatting, said Mr Hunter. ‘We had been to the pub up the road and were coming back to my house through the gate', he went on. 'It was pitch black and we were using torches to navigate our way back and the big stag must have got trapped in the garden as we have deer fences around it. 'It must have panicked when it saw us and the only way out was through the gate that we were standing at. It just ran at us and went straight through us. ‘Kate was at the back of the group and its antlers must have caught her in the neck. The stag then made for the hills. It was a completely freakish accident, I’ve never seen the like of it before. Dangerous: The animal's antlers pierced Dr Stone's throat, leaving her in critical condition (file picture) ‘I think I know the one it is, it’s . been hanging around. It’s a three-year-old stag, around 150kg. These are . big fellas, you don’t mess with them, they’ll take your car out.’ The group initially thought Dr Stone had simply been knocked over but quickly realised that it was more serious. She was rushed to hospital in Fort William but then flown by air ambulance for specialist treatment at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital, where she is understood to be in intensive care. Dr Stone, who has two children, is a research engineer in the Institute of Manufacturing at Cambridge and has set up her own technology company, Novalia. She was part of a group of three men and four women visiting the area – hill walking and enjoying the scenery – and staying at the Mo-Dhachaidh Guest House. Holiday: The group had been at a ceilidh at the Lochailort Inn (pictured) before being invited to Mr Hunter's home where the attack occurred . The group was approaching this gate when the stag seemingly panicked and charged Dr Stone who was the tallest in the group . A young stag pictured crossing the road in Fort William where Dr Stone was staying with friends before the attack . Owner Gary Burton, 51, said: ‘No one here has heard of anything like this in their lifetime, it has shocked the community. ‘It’s a cornered stag with no alternative exit route, it would have just been in a panic. It had nowhere else to go but through the group and unfortunately it seems Kate was in the way. ‘The force of the attack and impact must have been ferocious. I went to the scene later and found Kate’s mobile phone smashed into tiny bits. ‘I understand the type of injury Kate has suffered can cause quadriplegia or paraplegia. She was telling me she enjoyed the . outdoors in the hills and camping on her own in remote places, so any . form of paralysis to such an active person will be a disaster.’ One local gamekeeper with more than 40 years of experience with Highland stags said he had never heard of such an incident. He added: ‘For a stag to come out of the darkness like this and go for someone is highly unusual – a chance in a million.’ In November, a deer farmer died after being attacked by a stag. Kenneth Price, 75, was gored in Llandysul, Wales.","Dr Kate Stone is critically ill and has undergone trachea operation .

"By . James  Nye . and David Mccormack . Justin Bieber's live-in pal Lil Za, who was arrested on Tuesday morning at the superstar singer's California mansion for alleged drug possession rounded off a day to forget as he was released from Lost Hills Sheriff's station late last night. However, before he was let go, he found the time to get arrested again - this time for vandalism inside the jail. According to a law enforcement source, Za, whose real name is Xavier Smith, was preparing for his release at the station when he lost his temper and damaged a phone inside the holding cell he had spent the entire day in. Minutes away from posting the $20,000 bail for possession of felony narcotics found during a raid on Bieber's home, Za was re-booked for vandalism according to Lt. Michael Williams after he apparently furiously banged the handset against the dial and and his bail was readjusted to a reported $70,000. Scroll down for video . Long day: Lil Za released from Lost Hills Station on a reported $70,000 bail. He was escorted by bail bondsmen and taken back to Justin Bieber's home . Twice in one day: Bieber's close friend Lil Za was arrested on charges of cocaine possession at the singer's home during Tuesday morning's raid - he was later arrested and charged with vandalism inside jail just moments before he was due to be released . 'Zavier Smith was additionally charged with an incident that resulted in felony vandalism concerning a phone located in the holding cell this afternoon at the Lost Hills Sheriff’s Station,' said Lt. Michael Williams to HollywoodLife.com. Williams confirmed to MTV News that Za was released from prison late on Tuesday night and that contrary to other reports he damaged 'not destroyed' the phone in his holding cell. Earlier in the day, according to TMZ, Los Angeles law enforcement officials revealed that the drug found 'in plain sight' at Justin Bieber's mansion in a Tuesday morning raid was molly, a form of ecstasy, and not cocaine as originally believed. The drug was found along with the prescription sedative Xanax as police executed a felony warrant to search the sprawling Calabasas property. Explanation: Lt Dave Thompson kept reporters informed through the day on the developments following a police raid on Justin Bieber's Californian mansion which led to the arrest of Lil Za on felony possession of drugs . According to a law enforcement source, Za, whose real name is Xavier Smith, was moments away from release at the Lost Hills/Malibu Sheriff's station when he lost his temper and damaged a phone inside the holding cell he had spent the entire day in . The warrant was related to allegations that the singer had been responsible for throwing eggs at a neighbor's home in an exclusive gated community in Calabasas, California, last Thursday - causing more than $20,000 worth of damage. The singer's good friend, rapper Lil Za, was arrested after officers found the drugs during the raid on the 19-year-old singer's home. TMZ reports that what police originally believed to be cocaine was actually the drug molly, or MDMA. 'You have to analyze any evidence to see what comes forward,' spokesman Steve Whitmore said. 'It may not be that particular narcotic,' said LA County Sheriff Steve Whitmore. 'Let’s just wait and see, but we’re fairly certain it’s a controlled substance,' Whitmore said according to the LA Times. For Lil Za, the difference is about two years in the slammer. Watch Video Here: . Police arrive to raid Justin Bieber's Calabasas mansion after Los Angeles law enforcement executed a felony search warrant early on Tuesday morning . Lesser crime: Sheriffs haul away Lil Za. If the drug that was allegedly in his possession was MDMA and not cocaine as was originally believed he faces a far lesser jail sentence if convicted . Whereas the cocaine could have landed him in prison for three years, the molly possession could mean closer to one year for him. Officials says Bieber was 'not connected' to the drugs. Aerial images showed the rapper being led away by several officers before being driven to the police station in the back of a cop car. Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been widely regarded as a 'bad influence' on Bieber for over a year. He was supposed to have been moved out of the singer's home but according to reports he has been 'staying at Bieber's Calabasas home for months.' Eleven L.A. County Sheriff's patrol cars were spotted entering Bieber's gated community to look for 'video surveillance or other relevant evidence' to link him to the incident. Eight people, including the singer, were detained in the property’s garage as deputies executed the warrant. In a press conference following the raid, an L.A. Sheriff's Department official said the singer 'had not been arrested nor exonerated' in the egging case. Bieber was one of eight people detained in the garage of his property while deputies executed their warrant on Tuesday morning . Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been widely regarded as a 'bad influence' on Bieber for over a year. He was supposed to have been moved out of the singer's home but according to reports he has been 'staying at Bieber's Calabasas home for months' It is estimated that a dozen deputies, who brought a battering ram, carried out the search looking for any evidence to might link the singer with the egg assault. Bieber was not questioned at the scene regarding anything except standard search-warrant inquiries and would likely handle any questioning through his attorney later, said Whitmore. Police later issued a press release about the raid on Bieber's home. It said: 'Search Warrant Served at Calabasas Home after Estimated $20,000 Vandalism on January 9. 'At about 8am on Tues, Jan. 14, 2014, detectives from Lost Hills/Malibu Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department began service of a search warrant at the Calabasas home of Suspect Justin Bieber. 'The purpose of the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014. The vandalism damage is estimated by the homeowner to be approximately $20,000.00. The investigation is ongoing.' Lil Za was arrested for drug possession following the L.A. County Sheriff's department raid, the drugs were clearly visible when cops raided Bieber's home . Thompson declined to describe what evidence detectives took from Bieber's home, but said the emphasis wasn't on what was in the pop star's refrigerator. He said the house Bieber allegedly egged had custom wood and other expensive features and that several thousands of dollars in damage occurred. Thompson added that a judge authorized the search warrant. 'I get that the eggs don't seem that significant, but it does rise to the level of a felony,' Thompson said.

Eleven cop cars were involved in the raid on Justin Bieber's mansion in an exclusive gate community in Calabasas, California . 'But a felony crime is a felony crime, no matter how you commit it,' he said, 'and this crime rose to the felony section, and a judge signed a search warrant saying we should go get evidence related to the felony crime.' 'There is a victim in this case who has extensive damage done to their home. And that's a serious incident.'

"By . Mark Prigg . and Victoria Woollaston . Samsung is believed to be preparing to unveil its much anticipated Galaxy S5 smartphone ion February 24th, it has been claimed. The firm has sent journalists invites to a 'Samsung Unpacked event at the Mobile World congress show in Barcelona. It is expected to reveal the Galaxy S5 and a new, curved version of its Gear watch. Scroll down for video . Samsung's invite: The firm is expected to show off the Galaxy S5 handset, along with a new version of the Gear watch . The handset is expected to be announced on February 24th, and go on sale worldwide in April . Source: Sammmobile . It has been claimed the new handset could have a new 'smart' home screen that changes depending on the users location, or what they are doing. This image, obtained by website @evleaks, show a home screen displaying a series of cards. Similar to the Google Now system, it shows nearby locations as well as information gleaned from apps about what the user is doing. For example, it shows details of their latest run, a flight they plan to catch and text messages from friends. The image could reveal a major look for Samsung's flagship handset if it is legitimate. The specs for Samsung's new Galaxy S5 have already leaked online, amid claims the handset will come in both metal and plastic versions. The handset, which is is expected to have a 5.25inch screen and iris scanning to recognise users without a password, will also have a new superfast Snapdragon processor. There will also be a mini version of the S5, and a camera version called the Zoom, according to the Sammobile web site. First, let’s get the most mysterious thing about the Galaxy S5 out of the way: Yes, it will come in both metal and plastic versions as has been rumored, with the metal version costing around 800 Euros ($1080) and the plastic model coming in at around 650 Euros ($880),' the site says. The move is identical to Apple's decision to launch a plastic iPhone 5C alongside its flagship 5S model last year. The site also claims to have an almost complete set of specs for the handset. 'As expected, the Galaxy S5 will sport an AMOLED display of 2,560×1,440 resolution; we were unable to confirm the size, though it should be around 5.25-inches as has been rumored often.' It is also expected to be the first mass market mobile to use a new super-fast Exynos 6 Snapdragon 805 processor, which could give the handset a major speed boost. Leaks of Samsung's new menu system show a series of 'smart cards' showing information to users than can change depending on where they are or what they are doing . It could also allow the handset to run in 64bit mode - although the site believes that, again like Apple, only the metal version will do this. Recent reports also claimed the handset could feature an iris scanning system designed to recognise users without the need for a password. It will also boost a 16MP rear camera, and run KitKat, the latest version of Google's Android software. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas last week, Lee Young Hee announced that the firm is looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April - and admitted it will be called the Galaxy S5. Seeing double: Two version of the S5 are expected to go on sale in April, a metal and a plastic version . Lee also discussed the possibility a future model of the phone could feature iris recognition technology, yet did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not. Rumours have suggested Samsung is working on a follow-up to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch since last year, too, and this could be unveiled at the same time as the S5. Lee told Bloomberg: We’ve been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time. ‘When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved.’ Lee is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in September last year. Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner. The Myris device can register up to five different users. Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code. The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately. Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile. Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access. According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans. Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $250 (£150) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced. Some analysts claimed the Korean firm had rushed the production of the gadget in order to beat Apple to releasing a smartwatch, and the design suffered. However, Apple has still not announced its rumoured iWatch. Regarding the iris recognition technology, Lee said during Samsung’s press event at the Consumer Electronics Show: ‘Many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology and we are studying the possibility but can’t really say whether we will have it or not on the S5.’ Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple’s iPhone 5S. Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured . Samsung is also set to unveil a second-generation Galaxy Gear, original model is pictured, along with the S5 at Mobile World Congress in February . Iris scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning, and the technology involved is cheaper, making it a more obvious choice to add to future models. Iris scanning involves a simple charge-coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near-infrared light to take a clear, high-contrast image of a person’s iris. When the camera takes the image, a scanner plots the centre of the pupil, edge of the pupil, edge of the iris, eyelids and eyelashes. It then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code. Next time the eye is scanned, this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match. The iris scanner would not be the first time Samsung has introduced eye-tracking technology. Its Galaxy S4 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user’s eyes. The phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen, for example, or lock the screen when the user looks away. Both of Samsung's new devices are expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. They will likely then go on sale in Korea in March, before being rolled out worldwide in April. Samsung is set to release its next flagship phone - the Galaxy S5 - between March and April. The Korean firm also hinted that either the S5, or a future model, could be fitted with an iris scanner, stock photo of an iris is pictured, that would be used to unlock the device .","Invites sent for 'Samsung Unpacked' event, where firm traditionally revealed new version of its handsets .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Martial arts isn't something normally associated with ultra orthodox Jews - but two brothers from Jerusalem are convinced that people who practice the religion can get a real kick out of it. Capoeira (pronounced 'cap-wearer') is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics and music. The Hayat brothers - 24-year-old Miki and 20-year-old Yehuda - are the first in their conservative community to teach the technique, and have set up a Dojo (training room) in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, where they tutor nearly 200 students. The ultra orthodox Jewish Hayat brothers practice capoeira . The brothers teach around 200 ultra orthodox Jews in a training room near Tel Aviv . The brothers work in an effort to promote the martial arts in the ultra orthodox sector in Israel. So far their love of the martial art has not caused any issues with ultra orthodox community leaders. And it's not likely to. Dr Yaakov Wise, an academic expert on Orthodox Judaism at Manchester University, told MailOnline: 'Whilst Judaism forbids any form of aggressive behaviour not connected with self-defence, participating in martial arts per se is not forbidden.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . This hypnotic image is what the human body looks like when you break it down into its smallest parts. It might seem like a piece of abstract art, but in reality these intricate patterns are the tiny scaffolds and components that make up a human cell. Inside each cell is a huge range of molecular machinery that can resemble a busy construction site, with different types of these tiny cellular workers coming and going. This ultrasharp image uses a new method to simultaneously resolve microtubules (green), mitochondria (purple), Golgi apparatus (red), and peroxisomes (yellow) from a single human cell. Each of these components works together to make the cell function . Researchers in Boston were able to capture these tiny structures using strands of custom-built DNA in a microscopy technique dubbed ‘Exchange-PAINT’. The new technique could enable scientists to generate snapshots of dozens of different biomolecules at once in a single human cell. This is the first time researchers have been able to develop an imaging system that can capture structures less than 10 nanometres apart - or the size of an antibody. Scientists hope images like this will help uncover new ways to diagnose disease, track its progress, or monitor the effectiveness of therapies at a cellular level. To test Exchange-PAINT, the researchers created 10 unique pieces of folded DNA, or DNA origami, which resembled the numerals 0 through 9. The team was able to use Exchange-PAINT to capture clear images of the 10 different types of miniscule DNA origami structures in one image . Exchange-PAINT relies on the fact that DNA strands with the correct sequence of letters, or nucleotides, bind specifically to partner strands with complementary sequences. The researchers label a biomolecule they want to see with a DNA tag, then add to the solution a partner strand carrying a fluorescent dye that lights up only when the two strands pair up. When that partner strand binds the tagged biomolecule, it lights up, causing the biomolecule to ‘blink’ at a precise rate the researchers can control. The researchers use this blinking to obtain ultra-sharp images. They then repeat the process to see a second target, a third, and so on. Researchers overlay the resulting images to create a composite picture in which each biomolecule - each cellular worker - is assigned a different colour. This allows them to create false-colour images that simultaneously show many types of biomolecules . And these false-colour images allow them to spot enough cellular workers at once to capture the entire scene. Today's methods typically only spot at most three or four types of molecular machinery simultaneously. But to truly understand complex cellular functions, it's important to be able to see most or all of those workers at once, said Peng Yin, assistant professor of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. ‘If you can see only a few things at a time, you are missing the big picture,’ Dr Yin said. To capture ultra-sharp images of biomolecules, researchers had to overcome laws of physics that hindered microscopists for most of the last century. When two objects are closer than about 200 nanometres apart - about one five-hundredth the width of a human hair - they cannot be distinguished using a traditional light microscope. The viewer sees one blurry blob where in reality there are two objects. Since the mid-1990s, scientists have developed several ways to overcome this problem using combinations of specialised optics, special fluorescent proteins or dyes that tag cellular components. Ralf Jungmann at Harvard Medical School helped develop one of those super-resolution methods, called DNA-PAINT, as a graduate student. DNA-PAINT can create ultra-sharp snapshots of up to three cellular workers at once by labelling them with different coloured dyes. To visualise cellular job sites with crews of dozens of cellular workers, Dr Yin's team modified DNA-PAINT to create a new method called Exchange-PAINT. This is the first time researchers have been able to develop an imaging system that can capture structures less than 10 nanometres apart (about the size of an antibody). One nanometre is a millionth of a millimetre or around the size of a glucose molecule . Exchange-PAINT relies on the fact that DNA strands with the correct sequence of letters, or nucleotides, bind specifically to partner strands with complementary sequences. The researchers label a biomolecule they want to see with a DNA tag, then add to the solution a partner strand carrying a fluorescent dye that lights up only when the two strands pair up.

The team was able to use Exchange-PAINT to capture clear images of the 10 different types of miniscule DNA origami structures in one image. They also used the method to capture detailed, ultra-sharp images of fixed human cells, with each colour tagging an important cellular component. Dr Yin expects the method, with further development, will be able to visualise dozens of cellular components at once. ‘I expect insights from those experiments to lead to new ways to diagnose and monitor disease,’ said Wyss Institute Founding Director Don Ingber.","The structures were captured using a technique dubbed ‘Exchange-PAINT’

Selfies were the photo trend of 2013 and the term was crowned word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries. Belfie, . which stands for ‘bottom selfie’, is a photo taken deliberately a . person’s own behind. Healthselfies, or healthies, are selfies taken by people while exercising. Felfies are self-portraits taken by farmers with their livestock. Couplies are photos taken in the style of a selfie that feature two people, either a couple or a pair of friends. The couplie featuring Kylie was taken by celebrity hair stylist Panos Papandrianos and posted on his Instagram account. The post said: 'And it's a wrap. What a great shoot! Time for a #couplie ❤️ @kylieminogue #kylieminogue.' In many situations, couplies are taken so people don’t have to ask someone else to take their picture. According to personalised gift card firm, One4all, 60 per cent of all uploads over the Christmas period featured couple-style photos.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . You might be fooled by tricks of the eye, but how about tricks of the ear? While it’s easy to mishear sounds when first heard, these auditory illusions are persistently misleading. For instance, the Shepard tone, also known as a ‘sonic barber's pole', seems to continually rise or fall in pitch. Scroll down for more audio clips... AUDIO: The Shephard Tone . It the audio version of the Penrose stairs optical illusion which depicts a ‘continuous staircase’ in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend. The sound of the Shepard tone is, in reality, a cycling between a limited set of tones, each separated by an octave, according to The Atlantic. Each tone in the scale is made up of several notes played simultaneously, and at each moment different notes in the tone are played at different volumes. The Shephard Tone is the audio version of the Penrose stairs illusion which depicts a continuous staircase . The trick involves not only which tones are played, but also the volume of the individual notes in the tones. Changes in volume cause the listener to focus on certain notes while ignoring the others. The illusion works because each tone seems to sounds lower than the preceding. The listener judges subtle changes in tone by comparing it to the preceding note, not to tones from twenty or thirty seconds ago. A similar audio illusion, featured on Meara O’Reilly’s Tumblr and discovered by Diana Deutsch, reveals how the human brain tends to automatically group similar notes together. AUDIO: The scale illusion . Scale Illusion from Meara O'Reilly on Vimeo. The Shepard tone seems to continually rise or fall in pitch. The sound of the Shepard tone is, in reality, a cycling between a limited set of tones, each separated by an octave. The trick involves not only which tones are played, but also the volume of the individual notes in the tones. Changes in volume cause the listener to focus on certain notes while ignoring the others. The illusion works because each tone seems to sounds lower than the preceding. The listener judges subtle changes in tone by comparing it to the preceding note, not to tones from twenty or thirty seconds ago. This audio must be listened through stereo headphones, or stereo separated loudspeakers. In the illusion two major scales are played with one ascending and the other descending. On its own, neither melody gives the impression of an ascending or descending pattern. But when the two melodies are played together most people hear this combination as being two scales that either ascend or descend in unison together. This is because the brain reassigns some of the notes to a different ear in order to make a coherent melody. People perceive these sounds differently, but the most commonly they group the high and low notes together. Right-handed people tend to hear the high melody in the right ear, and the low one in the left, while left-handers have a varied response. AUDIO: The Wessel illusion . The Wessel Illusion from Meara O'Reilly on Vimeo. In Meara O’Reilly’s blog, a number of other audio illusion are highlighted including The Wessel illusion. This demonstrates how tone can determine the way in which we perceptually group notes in a melody. Three notes, alternating in tone, are played slowly and most people hear a sequence that is rising in pitch. When this sequence is repeated faster, it’s no longer possible to hear the trajectory of the melody change. 'At a certain point we are forced to perceptually cut our losses—we begin to group the notes solely based on their timbre,' said Ms O'Reily. The Wessel illusion was discovered by David Wessel of U.C. Berkeley’s Centre for New Music and Audio Technologies.","Illusions include the Shepard tone, also known as a ‘sonic barber's pole'

"Mould and buildings are usually an undesirable combination. But one architect is set to transform a New York landmark by building a giant tower made of fungus. It will be built from blocks composed of corn and fungus which will grow and mesh together. Scroll down for video . Called Hy-Fi, the building (illustrated) will be built predominantly fugus bricks - as well as some light-reflecting ones -  and is set to open in June. It was designed by New York architect David Benjamin . The bricks will be composed of corn husks and mycelium - the vegetative part of fungus. They will be grown in block-shaped moulds where roots will knit together to keep their shape. Once used in the eco-friendly building, the 'self-assembling' fungus bricks will carry on growing and bond together to strengthen the overall structure. The building will incorporate reflective bricks to throw light downwards onto the organic blocks so that they can carry on growing. The Museum of Modern Art PS1 will host the eco-friendly organic structure, which has been designed to generate no waste and provide shade and seating for visitors to the gallery’s summer music concerts.

"By . Jamie Redknapp . When you look at the players in midfield at Manchester United and Chelsea, it’s hard to see anyone from United making it into Jose Mourinho’s side. They will think that’s a slur but unfortunately for them it’s a fact. Michael Carrick is a very good player and would have made it, but Nemanja Matic makes that tough for him now. Adnan Januzaj could become world class, but you still wouldn’t pick him ahead of Eden Hazard at the moment. United are not short of good players, they’re short of great players. They won the league at a canter last season, so this is not a bad squad, but every other side improved over the summer and United got left behind. Superstar: Eden Hazard has been in blistering form for Chelsea in the past few weeks . The return: Nemanja Matic trains for the first time since coming back to Chelsea, and tops Michael Carrick . United they stand: But would Michael Carrick (left) and Adnan Januzaj get a game at Chelsea? Splashing out: Chelsea have spent a staggering £229.9m since summer 2010 . They are missing that stardust and, particularly when Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie do not play, they are missing match-winners. Januzaj has been sensational and one of David Moyes’s most productive players, but, him apart, United lack creativity in the middle. Chelsea’s midfielders have scored 26 Premier League goals this season while United’s have scored just seven. Only Januzaj and Antonio Valencia have any assists (two each) and the entire United midfield has made just 96 chances. Between them, Eden Hazard, Oscar, . Willian and Juan Mata have created 122 chances and across the squad, . eight Chelsea midfielders have assisted goals. It’s that kind of creativity United are crying out for. It’s . a shame for Marouane Fellaini that he’s injured, because with Rooney . out, Moyes could have used him further forward as another option. Even . so, I’m still not sure he is a United player. Towards . the end of my career, when I lined up in the tunnel against them, you . would look across and see Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and Ryan . Giggs. They were the game-changers but it’s hard to see that in the . current United midfield. Playmaker: Brazil star Oscar has emerged as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League . Hair apparent: Willian (left) has staked his claim for a place in the Chelsea starting Xi in recent weeks . Creative force? Japan star Shinji Kagawa can barely get a game in United's midfield . Big-money move: But is Marouane Fellaini really a top-quality United player? Instead, it’s Chelsea who have the exceptional talents. Hazard is the form man, but anyone in football won’t be surprised by his progress. Joe Cole said he was the best player he’d played with while he was on loan at Lille and now, with extra experience, he is performing out of his skin. Willian has really impressed me, too, and is a lot tougher than I thought he would be. We all know how good Oscar is. Then you look at the rest of Chelsea’s midfielders and the strength in depth is obvious. Any club that can afford to leave Mata on the bench is a contender for the title. And Mata is exactly the kind of player Moyes would love. Making his point: Jose Mourinho will finally have to concede his team are serious title contenders . Under-fire: David Moyes wants to be able to call upon the kind of star quality that Chelsea can . Strength in depth: The Blues can afford to leave quality like Andre Schurrle and Juan Mata on the bench . The re-signing of Matic will only improve Chelsea. He’s a real thoroughbred and will protect that back four. In any other business it would be madness to let go of an asset and then buy it back for a much greater price, but football plays by different rules and the best players come at a cost. Mourinho is the master of playing the underdog, but I hope he finally admits his squad are now capable of challenging. He talks about how much firepower Manchester City have, and they do, but if you look at the money Chelsea have spent, they are no paupers. I hate to say ‘transition’ — it’s an overused word — but that’s where United are. It will take time and money to rebuild the midfield and the rest of the squad, but it is something they need to address quickly. While Manchester United continue to crave for the players to fill the boots of Roy Keane and Paul Scholes, rivals Chelsea have been busy snapping up the game's best midfielders. Indeed, since 2010 the Blues have splashed a staggering £229.9million strengthening their midfield options, this in comparison to United's £98m. It is the area of the park open to most fierce criticism at Old Trafford and, say many observers, the reason behind their decline. Bring it on home: Nemanja Matic re-joined Chelsea this month after a spell at Benfica . Samba star: Ramires signed for Chelsea in 2010 . New kid on the block: Bertrand Traore is one of two midfielders Chelsea have signed this transfer window . When United and Chelsea meet at . Stamford Bridge on Sunday, the disparity between the two engine-rooms . will be highlighted still further as the hosts unveil £21m new boy . Nemanja Matic, the midfield general they re-signed from Benfica this . week. What would David Moyes do for such a . signing? The Red Devils boss has been trawling the continent this past . fortnight in a bid to unearth the man to remedy his midfield woe. The Scot has been forced to field . 40-year-old Ryan Giggs at the heart of his team this season, as well as . on occasion defender Phil Jones. That they have been selected ahead of . Marouane Fellaini – Moyes' sole midfield acquisition – speaks volumes . for the faltering form of the £28m deadline-day purchase. Champions League winner: Raul Meireles holds the blue shirt after signing in 2011 . New boy: Marco van Ginkel's debut season at Stamford Bridge has been blighted by injury . Moyes will again be reliant on teenager Adnan Januzaj for midfield inspiration this weekend. Jose Mourinho, in comparison, will boast an embarrassment of riches. Since the summer of 2012 alone, Chelsea have now spent upwards of £15m on five midfield players. Eden Hazard was a £32m arrival from . Lille, Oscar a £25m recruit from Internacional, Leverkusen's Andre . Schurrle cost £18m, Willian was a £32m steal from under the noses of . Spurs and now Matic. Short stay: Yossi Benayoun made a £5.5million switch from Liverpool to Stamford Bridge . Marquee signing: Andre Schurrle holds his Chelsea shirt up at the Cobham training base . Rising star: A fresh-faced Oscar proudly holds up his home shirt at the Cobham HQ . In that same period United have . signed four midfielders; Shinji Kagawa, a player who has struggled to . impact, Nick Powell, currently on loan at Wigan, Wilfried Zaha, an . outcast under Moyes, and, of course, the disappointing Fellaini. But perhaps most galling of all for . Moyes and followers of United will be the sight of £23m Juan Mata . warming the bench; how they would long for the Spaniard to fill the . playmaker role once populated by Scholes. Mega money: Willian joined from Anzhi for a whopping £32million last summer . Then there is John Mikel Obi, . Chelsea's in-form anchorman who was all set for a move to United in 2005 . before the west Londoners intervened and prised him from their grasp. It all leaves Moyes casting envious eyes towards Mourinho and his midfield men. The United chief will seek to strengthen this month but that will not come in time for Sunday's battle at the Bridge. If that game is won or lost in the middle of the park, then there will surely be just one victor. Injury prone: Oriol Romeu is unveiled by former manager Andre Villas-Boas . Young gun: Victor Moses joined Chelsea from Wigan but has since been loaned out to Liverpool . On his way out? Kevin de Bruyne looks set to leave Chelsea this window for the Bundesliga .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . IAN LADYMAN: Chelsea star Mata set to complete £37m move to United on Friday . After such a miserable season, Manchester United fans have been crying out for a hero. In Juan Mata, they might just have one. With confidence at an all-time low after the Sunderland defeat, Mata’s signing is a glimmer of hope at Old Trafford. He’s a magician of a player, has a fantastic attitude and he can thread a pass through the eye of a needle. He’s a match-winner, but make no mistake, he’s not the answer to all of United’s problems. His arrival is a statement of intent but it’s just papering over the cracks at the moment. Waving goodbye: Juan Mata looks to be on his way from Chelsea to Manchester United . Needs more: It is a good start for David Moyes, but the signing is just papering over the cracks . United need an overhaul to get back to the top and they are still short of five or six top-quality players. With the likes of Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand all potentially leaving in the summer, it will be a big rebuilding project. But signing Mata is a good start. When Robin van Persie joined, United had won nothing the previous year. He was the catalyst, the player who made the difference and fired them to the league title. Mata could have a similar impact and if he gets United into the top four, it will be just as big an achievement. The problem for David Moyes is getting his players fit, because a team sheet with Van Persie, Mata, Wayne Rooney and Adnan Januzaj on it starts to look very dangerous. I’ve always said  lining up in the tunnel at Old Trafford was nerve-racking because of the number of superstars they had. They miss that aura now but with those four they’ll be able to hurt teams. Dribbler: Mata has proved his quality at Chelsea, and now he can make United fearsome again . Link up: Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney have been crying out for a creative force behind them . Potential: Adnan Januzaj has burst onto the scene and could help Mata . Trophy after trophy: Teams used to be scared visiting United, Moyes needs to find a way to replicate this . People say he’s not a United player or doesn’t fit their philosophy but what is their current philosophy? Good players adapt and United can be flexible to get the best out of their attacking players. They could easily go with a midfield diamond with Mata at the top of it behind Rooney and RVP, or he could play in a wider role. As long as Moyes restores his confidence he could play Mata anywhere across the front because he is expert at playing in between the lines. In football we have very short memories. All it takes is a bad six months and suddenly you’re a bad player. That’s just not true with Mata. He played 64 games and scored 20 goals last season and was Chelsea’s Player of the Year, again. He has always been good enough for Chelsea, he was just never good enough for Jose Mourinho. Failures: The current crop have suffered unacceptable cup defeats at home... amongst others . Window of opportunity: Robin van Persie arrives for training and United will hope to have him back soon . Not looking clever: Tom Cleverley arrives the day after the semi-final penalties defeat by Sunderland . Arrival: Nemanja Vidic, suspended for the Sunderland debacle, drives into the training ground . A tough gig: Ryan Giggs looks lees-than impressed as he arrives at Carrington . In the shadows: Marquee summer signing Marouane Fellaini is recovering from injury . Coach in the car: Phil Neville arrives for what surely will be a chastening day at training . Flops: Shinji Kagawa (left) and Alexander Buttner both played in the semi-final loss . Mourinho is the kind of  manager who can make you feel a million dollars, but equally he can suck the life out of you with just a few words. That’s what happened with Mata this season. Clearly he didn’t fit the Mourinho mould and he looked totally drained. That’s not to say Jose is wrong, it’s just his opinion and if Chelsea win the title, his decision will have been entirely vindicated. But now Mata has a chance to play regular football again and he will want to impress. It’s up to Moyes to put an arm round him and get him back to his best, because an on-song Juan Mata is the first step towards getting the fear factor back at Old Trafford. Lacking confidence: Jose Mourinho not fancying Mata doesn't mean Chelsea didn't . No Juan there: Mata trained alone in Chelsea's fitness centre and away from the first team on Wednesday .

Around 85 per cent of Brits, admit to having at least one habit but less than half say they do it daily. However, these habits are things which Brits do without even realising they're doing it. For example, nearly half of us said we sit in the same place to have dinner at home every day. What's more, 37 per cent of Brits always fold toilet paper rather than scrunching it. At work, just over one in ten of us use . the same cup at work every day while one in five always re-read an email . three times before sending. Around 23 per cent of Brits shudder when they hear others cracking their knuckles . Not surprisingly, men and women disagreed about their partner's habits. Over half of women would like their man to change a habit with 17 per cent wanting them to stop leaving the toilet seat up. But considering these could be habits of a lifetime, 90 per cent of Brits are prepared to change if it provided them with new experiences. Professor Kevin Dutton, an expert in the science of social influence, said: 'We all do daily things in a habitual way without thinking. 'In fact, a lot of the time we ""sleep-walk"" through our daily lives. 'Even the most obvious habits show a desire for order but we'd all jump at the chance to learn something new.' Bing commissioned the research into habits as a way of promoting its Bing It On campaign. The idea is that many people use rival search engine Google as a habit and a new site has been set up to test whether people prefer Bing or Google, and to highlight that Google may not always be best. The Bing It On challenge shows two sets of search results for the same phrase and people are asked to choose which they prefer.","4 in 10 want friends to stop updating Facebook with meaningless rubbish .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . A British businessman who lost his nose to cancer is growing a new one – in his arm. If all goes well it will eventually be removed and sewn on to his face, with experts at University College London hoping he will have feeling and a sense of smell. The new nose, the first in the world to be grown from scratch, will also look just like the 56-year-old man’s old one – slightly crooked. UCL scientist Professor Alex Seifalian, . who is behind the pioneering treatment, said: ‘His nose was a little bit . bent to the left and we asked if he wanted it straight but he said no, . he wanted it exactly the same.’ The new nose began as a glass mould, based on the original, which was sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb-like material to create a framework for stem cells to cling to. The mould was then removed and the honey- comb covered with millions of these ‘blank cells’ which, with the right nutrients, can turn into the cartilage of the nose – a process which took place at UCL in a rotating jar called a bioreactor. Meanwhile, the skin on the man’s arm was gradually stretched by a small balloon placed under the surface and inflated until it was loose enough to accommodate the nose. Professor Alex Seifalian hopes to eventually grow a whole face in the lab and says procedure could help car crash victims and wounded soldiers . Around two months ago, when the framework was ready, it replaced the balloon under the stretched skin. The new nose is now bulging out of the man’s arm, where it is acquiring networks of nerves and tiny blood vessels, as well as a covering of skin from the arm. As Professor Seifalian told BBC Focus magazine: ‘We can make the nose but we can’t make the skin.’ After at least three months there, the . nose will be removed and sewn in place on the man’s face in an . operation that should not leave any scars. The arm should return to . normal, with the skin stitched back together. The . man, who wishes to remain anonymous, had his nose removed after skin . cancer started to eat it away. Treatment to stop the tumour returning . compounded the damage, and psychological scars left him virtually . housebound. Similar patients, car crash victims and wounded soldiers could all be helped if the operation is a success. The . landmark project has echoes of a US attempt in the 1990s to grow ears . on a mouse for transplant. That failed, but there have been many . advances in science since. Professor . Seifalian, who hopes eventually to grow a whole face in the lab, said: . ‘We have got all our fingers crossed until they are breaking.’ The pioneering treatment is being done by experts at University College London, pictured .","British man, 56, who is being kept annonymous, lost his nose to skin cancer .

"By . Christian Gysin . and Arthur Martin . in Transylvania . On his arrival at Luton airport on Wednesday, Romanian migrant  Victor Spirescu was warmly greeted by Labour MP Keith Vaz amid a fanfare of publicity. Mr Spirescu, 30, insisted he was in Britain ‘to work and not to steal’ and yesterday he was true to his word, arriving at an Aldi supermarket in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, at 8am to clean cars until 6pm. Asked by the Daily Mail how he was enjoying his first week in the UK, he said: ‘Like I said at the airport, I have come here to work. I stay in the town with other workers and all is good at the moment.’ Scroll down for video . You might not ever get rich: Romanian migrant Victor . Spirescu, left, working at the car wash in the car park of the Aldi . supermarket in Wiggleswade, Bedfordshire, just days after he arrived in . Britain through Luton airport . But as Mr Spirescu starts his new life, his 19-year-old fiancée is fending for herself on the small, rundown holding they own in a  village in Transylvania. Each day, Catalina Curcean chops enough wood to burn so she can stay warm in temperatures as low as minus 25c. She then has to clean out a sty where a pig is being reared. It will be killed to eat next Christmas. The slightly built teenager also feeds her six chickens three times a day, in the hope they will regularly lay eggs. There is no running water in the crumbling one-bedroom house she bought with Mr Spirescu for £2,000 two years ago in the  village of Pelisor, which is 200 miles north of the capital Bucharest. But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch:  Mr Spirescu with his fiancée Catalina . Curcean, who he has left fending for herself on the rundown holding they . own in a village in Transylvania . Miss Curcean has to repeatedly lower a bucket on a winch down a well on the mud lane outside her home for cooking, cleaning and drinking. There is an outside toilet which consists of a hole in the ground covered by a wooden hut. Her only luxuries are a TV and a laptop. Two dogs and a couple of scrawny cats play among the wood chippings and rubbish on their small plot of land. Only a handful of the villagers have cars – the rest travel on horse-drawn carts or bicycles. Like many of her neighbours, Miss . Curcean does not work because she cannot find a job. Instead, she hopes . her fiancé will earn enough at the car wash in the market town of . Biggleswade to support her. Miss Curcean is hoping to follow Mr Spirescu to the UK once she has saved up enough money for a bus or plane ticket. Speaking . to the Daily Mail yesterday, she said: ‘I was really shocked when I . turned on the TV and saw Victor on the news. I couldn’t believe it. ‘There . was my fiancé looking like a star. He only found out he had the job two . days before he left so there was no time to plan. I don’t even know . where he is living. All I know is that it’s with Romanian friends. ‘He . told me that he will stay in Britain as long as possible and earn as . much as possible so that we can afford to renovate our house. ‘I would love to go to Britain and I would do any job I am offered. I’m not fussy. I just want to earn a proper wage.’ There's no telling who you might meet: There is . no running water in the crumbling one-bedroom house she bought with Mr . Spirescu for £2,000 two years ago in the village of Pelisor, 200 miles . north of Bucharest . Miss Curcean met Mr Spirescu two years ago when he moved from Bucharest to the Transylvanian village of Barghis to renovate a monastery. After a whirlwind romance they decided to buy a house in Pelisor using savings and contributions from their parents. During good weeks, Mr Spirescu was able to earn £30 a week, largely through construction work. But the offers of work were sporadic and each job usually did not last beyond a week. The couple managed to save up enough money to fix some of the leaks in their roof and insulate the walls from the bitter cold. Mr Spirescu also built a wood burner in a corner of the living room. The village is home to about 250 people, many of whom are elderly. There used to be more than 700 people living there, but many have moved to Western Europe in search of work. Miss Curcean added: ‘In Britain, Victor will be able to earn in a day what he used to earn in a week here. There are no jobs here. ‘I will miss him but I’m just so happy he has got a job in the UK. I know that there are more important things to do than car washing but it’s a start. ‘He’s hoping to find work in construction because that’s what he is good at.’ A movie star or maybe even a senior MP: Labour MP Keith . Vaz greets Mr Spirescu on his arrival at Luton airport on Wednesday, the . first day that Romanians and Bulgarians were allowed to move to the UK and take up work . Car washers are thought to earn about £25 to £30 a day and have accommodation provided. Mr Spirescu is hoping to earn more than £150 a week while in Britain. A family of one worker with a dependant wife and two children would get £70 a week, on the minimum wage in Romania. As if to stress his commitment to his new career, Mr Spirescu told the Mail: ‘I must go now – I have more work to do. Cars are coming in here all the time.’","Victor Spirescu was one of the first Romanian migrants to arrive in the UK .

"By . Julie Moult . and Lizzie Smith . The mother of Two and A Half Men star Angus T Jones . has spoken out to say he is being 'exploited' by his church after he branded his hit show 'filth' in an extraordinary religious rant. Carey Jones, 42, told MailOnline she was worried for her famous son. 'I'm concerned he's being exploited by the church,' she explained, but refused to comment further. The 19-year-old - who makes $350,000 per episode playing Jake - was seen urging fans to 'turn off' in a new video for the Forerunner Chronicles. In Angus Jones Testimony, he says: 'If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching. I'm on Two and a Half Men and I don't want to be on it.' Scroll down for video . Bizarre outburst: Angus T Jones calls his hit show Two and a Half Men 'Filth' in a video clip posted online . In the video the young star laughs as he admits his worried family have described the Seventh-day Adventist movement as a 'cult' Jones has been on the show since he was 10 and It is unclear if he has tried to quit the show. The exact details of his contract have yet to surface. His comments are likely to attract ire from the show's co-creator Chuck Lorre and his bosses at Warner Brothers, who are yet to comment. The teen's outburst continued: 'Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say itâ€™s just entertainment. 'Do . some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I . promise you youâ€™ll have a decision to make when it comes to television . and especially with what you watch on television ... it's bad news.' Regrest: Angus is contracted to the program and his comments are likely to attract ire from his bosses at Warner Brothers . Intense: A reflective Angus ones in his 'testimony' as a 'soldier of truth' He adds: 'If I am doing any harm, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be contributing to the enemy's plan. 'You . cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like . that. I know I can't. 'I'm not OK with what I'm learning, what the bible . says and being on that television show.' Jones . gives his testimony sitting with a representative of The Forerunner . Chronicles in his trailer on the Warner studio lot, where his series is . filmed. 'Filth': Angus is paid $350,000 an episode to star in the show, in which he is seen with guest star Miley Cyrus in a recent episode . In his younger days: A chubbier Angus with then co-star Charlie Sheen . New co-star: Angus with Ashton Kutcher, who replaced sacked Charlie Sheen as the new star of the show . In the video the young star laughs nervously as . he admits his worried family have likened his recent 'awakening' to . the Seventh-day Adventist movement to joining a 'cult'. 'Of course all my family, not all my family, but some of my . family were like ""he's going to a cult"" trying to tell me to get out of . there,' said Jones. 'But I didn't feel like I was being fooled, I could study it for . myself. Its there in the bible and there's no evidence for the opposing views.' Found a home: Jones' search for religion has seen him become a member of the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church in California's San Fernando Valley . Jones' comments are just the latest . crisis for the show, which was put in jeopardy when its original star . Sheen was fired and replaced by Ashton Kutcher after attacking Chuck . Lorre amidst a storm of bizarre behaviour. The show has since struggled to maintain its high ratings. Jones talks about his education in the 'basic messages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church', a Protestant Christian denomination which is marked by its observance of the Sabbath on a Saturday. Members are discouraged from purely secular activities on the Sabbath, instead spend the day worshiping. Preparations begin on the Friday night at sundown. The official teachings of the denomination are expressed in its 28 Fundamental Beliefs, which Jones revealed he was studying. Jones' 'testimony' was released by the ForeRunner Chronicles. According to a tweet for The Forerunner Chronicles Jones is now a 'soldier for truth'. They . state on their Facebook page: 'The Forerunner is dedicated to . proclaiming the truth that you need to know. ""To live and die for the . truth"" is the moto [sic] and Jesus Christ is our general. 'He gives the orders... we put in the work! No questions asked.' The . ForeRunner has previously released a series of 11 videos entitled the . Jay-Z Deception, which chronicle the 'darkness' of pop stars like the . Rihanna and argue that they are 'antagonistic to Christianity'. Having peeked at 28.7million viewers when . Kutcher made his debut, ratings have slipped hitting a recent series high of 13.6million when . Miley Cyrus guest starred in an episode. Jones has appeared on Two And A Half Men since 2003 and received a pay rise in May when the show was renewed for a tenth series. But he complained of reduced storylines, telling E! Online last month: 'My character does Skype calls. He only . does one scene Skype calls... It's easy . but it's boring.' In a further testimony on the . Seventh-day website the Voice Of Prophecy, Jones revealed that he felt his role in Two And A Half Men was an opportunity to spread his beliefs to a wider audience. 'I am confident I am there for a reason,' he said. 'I don't think I would . be on the show this year if God hadn't pushed me into it because . otherwise I genuinely didn't want to do another year of the show. 'I'm so . thankful to be there its a lot of fun and God will get the glory out of . it.' Jones also revealed that he found the . church during a difficult period in his life. With . his parents going through a divorce, he began spending as much time as . possible out of home and admits he experimented with drugs. 'When . I look back now I see that... the enemy was trying to push my in a . different directions but God... pulled me out right at the last second,' he said. 'I was running away from that situation. Slowly that led to drugs. I never drank. And I'm still a virgin so God protected me from those things.' He described how the Holy Spirit spoke to him through a friend and he accepted Jesus into his life. He then went about the process of finding a church. In his ForeRunner Chronicles video Jones explained that a schoolfriend . introduced him to the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church, where he felt at home. 'I really started to get into reading . the bible and I started to look for a church to go to. Every Sunday I . was going to like three or four churches, I was just looking for the . right church,' he said. And he added: 'I was looking to go to . a church with an all-black congregation,' explaining that he had . imagined himself as a member of a gospel church. 'The first day I went there I went by myself and I walked in and . sat down at the back... It was just like, that was my church. Special guest: Angus T Jones gives his testimony in a video posted online on Seventh-day website the Voice Of Prophecy . Speaking out: Angus describes how his parents divorce, coupled with doubts about his future, led to his life heading in a difficult direction until he was saved by finding religion . 'Then I started the bible work at the . church. And I was like this is really awesome, it seems so much more . appropriate and it was right from the bible. 'I just kept learning the basic . messages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and every single time I was . learning all this new stuff and I was just loving it.' Jones also explained that he had begun observing the Sabbath. A spokesperson for Jones was not available for comment on the status of Jones' contract when contacted by Mail Online. While he may have raised eyebrows with his outspoken views, by finding religion Angus T Jones has avoided following in the criminal path of close family members. The young actor's uncle, Eric Eugene Claypool, is currently serving a . 99-year prison sentence for murder after shooting a man he claimed had . sexually abused him. According to prison documents on . November 16, 1994, Claypool, now 38, stole a .357-magnum from . 31-year-old Jay Harlan and shot him in the back of the head. Criminal past: Police mugshots show Angus' parents Carey and Kelly Jones . And Jones' family made headlines when mugshots emerged of his parents, Kelly and Carey Jones, taken in their former home of Travis County, Texas. His mother Carey, Claypoolâ€™s sister, was arrested in 1992 for ripping the meter out of a taxi and then punching a police officer in the face while she was drunk. Then in 1997 she was arrested on a burglary charge after a woman woke to find Carey in her living room. Jones' father Kelly, now 50, was arrested in 1986 for possession of marijuana and carrying an unlicensed .45-caliber handgun after he created a disturbance in a bar. In 1997 Carey had Kelly arrested on an assault charge after he allegedly pulled her out of a car and pushed her to the ground. She later dropped the charge, but Kelly was ordered to complete an anti-violence class.","Teenager, who joined the show as a child in 2003, earns $350k per episode .

"By . Candace Sutton . The Queen has telephoned Australia's leading horse trainer Gai Waterhouse about her horse which races in Sydney tomorrow, with high hopes of a win for the royal stallion, Carlton House. Waterhouse, known as the 'queen of racing' in Australia, told Her Royal Highness Carlton House has been performing well in trackwork and was in great form for his race at Sydney's Royal Randwick on Saturday. Waterhouse's stable reported the Queen's horse had just 'shaded' or beaten the champion trainer's prize stallion, Fiorente, in an exhibition gallop at Randwick in late January. The Queen 'knows her horses' and is 'very much on the ball' about the Australian horse racing scene, says top Australian trainer Gai Waterhouse (right) who has prepared the monarch's stallion Carlton House for a race in Sydney on Saturday . Victory at last: after a two decade career as a horse trainer, which has been marked by sensational success and controversy, Gai Waterhouse, now the Queen's trainer, finally won Australian horse racing's most glittering prize last year, the Melbourne Cup . Fiorente won the Â£3.3m Melbourne Cup last November, giving Waterhouse her first victory in Australia's richest horse race. Waterhouse said the Queen - who has had a lifelong passion for horse racing - appeared extremely knowledgeable about Australian racing during their lengthy telephone conversation. 'She is well read, highly intelligent and knows her horses,' Waterhouse told The Daily Telegraph, explaining she addressed the Queen as 'Her Majesty or Ma'am'. 'Her Majesty knows what is happening down under and is very much on the ball.' Folllowing Carlton House's disappointing form at Royal Ascot, in late 2012 the Queen transferred the colt from leading British trainer Sir Michael Stoute to Waterhouse, who had previously trained horses for the Queen Mother, . Carlton House, named after a former royal residence at Pall Mall, came out of quarantine into the Waterhouse stable in January 2013 and has raced twice, unplaced, while he acclimatised to Australian conditions. The Queen transferred her horse Carlton House (right) from leading UK trainer Sir Michael Stoute to Australia after it showed poor form in 2012 at Royal Ascot where (above) it was pipped by favourite So You Think in the Prince of Wales stakes . At trackwork (above) in the Sydney stables of controversial but sensationally successful trainer Gai Waterhouse, the Queen's horse has behaved like 'a gentleman' and his gallops have been so 'outstanding' the stallion beat Waterhouse's recent Melbourne Cup winner, Fiorente, at an exhibition gallop at Royal Randwick, where he races tomorrow . Waterhouse is known in Australia for her sensational success on the track, but also for a recent controversy surrounding her bookmaker son and for the nation's greatest racing scandal, involving her husband, also a 'bookie'. Waterhouse told the Queen she was excited about the sparkling form she has managed to get out of the monarch's stallion. Carlton House has drawn barrier three and is currently fourth-placed favourite in Saturday's Expressway Stakes, which will be screened live on British television at 5.12am local time. Jockey Tommy Berry will wear the Queen's racing silks which have a purple body with gold braid, maroon scarlet sleeves and black velvet cap with gold fringe. Waterhouse said the Queen told her she won't watch the race live as it would be so early in the morning in Britain. However, she did intend to record it and watch footage later. The trainer said she and the Queen discussed the fact Carlton House's race this weekend was a 1200 metre sprint. 'I explained to Her Majesty this is what the horse has been working over and he is ready to handle it,' Waterhouse said. The Queen's horse trainer, Gai Waterhouse (left, at rear), had her own annus horribilus in 2013 when she ended up in a race stewards' inquiry after multimillionaire Australian entrepreneur John Singleton (right) accused her of misleading him over one of his horses and sacked her as trainer . 'The Queen was very interested to learn how Carlton House is doing here and I told her I'm over the moon with the horse. 'He is thriving, he is such a gentleman to train.He is all about trying to please you and his work has been first class.' The Queen's racing manager, Johnny Warren, was in Australia last month watching over Carlton House's race preparations. It was Warren who made initial contact with Waterhouse, to see whether she could take Carlton House into her stable. 'I trained for the Queen Mother. She had two horses with me, Life is Beautiful and Clarence House.' she said. At the time, Warren said the Queen was 'very enthusiastic about the prospect' of having the horse run in Australia 'where racing is top class' and where Waterhouse was known as a leader in her field. Scottish-born Waterhouse, a former actress and model who once appeared Dr Who is the daughter of TJ Smith, a top racehorse trainer in Australia from the 1950s to the 1980s. She is married to Robbie Waterhouse, scion of a famous Australian racing dynasty of bookmakers whose multi-million dollar business has been the subject of rumour and innuendo over decades. Allegations of illegal off-course betting and horse doping against family patriarch Bill Waterhouse went unproved. But in 1984, the Australian Jockey Club (AJC) revoked the bookmaking licenses of both father and son over their alleged 'prior knowledge' of a horse substitution ring-in, known as the Fine Cotton affair. It was never alleged Bill or Robbie Waterhouse were involved in the scam, in which a horse called Bold Personality was daubed with hair dye and white paint to resemble Fine Cotton, a lowly performing gelding, which it substituted in a race in Brisbane, Queensland, and won.Robbie Waterhouse was warned off racecourses for 17 years, before his reinstatement in 2002, and the incident stymied Gai Waterhouse's attempts to gain a trainer's licence, which the AJC finally granted in 1992. Winning the Melbourne Cup, as Gai Waterhouse did last year with jockey Damien Oliver on Fiorente (pictured) last year is akin to winning the lottery in Australia and was a last minute sweetener for Waterhouse and her family who endured a year of controversy in 2013 . Her hugely successful career since was marred by controversy last year involved Robbie and Gai's son, Tom Waterhouse, who with his grandfather and mentor became Australiaâ€™s largest on-course bookmakers in 2007. Tom and Gai became embroiled in public acrimony after it was alleged he had told told friends More Joyous, a horse belonging to a multimillionaire Australian entrepreneur, would lose its race on last year's Sydney Cup day, which it did. The horse's owner, John Singleton, sacked Gai Waterhouse as his trainer and stewards found Gai Waterhouse guilty of two race charges and fined her Â£3000. The incident has entered Australian racing legend as the 'More Joyous affair'.","The Queen's horse Carlton House racing in Australia with hopes of a win .

Both women were thrown from the quad bike, but Miss Oras suffered serious injuries and died at the scene of the accident. Loss: Jessica Oras, left, was on a quad bike with Rachel Gernaat, right, when she was thrown to the ground . The friends had been celebrating Miss Gernaat's 19th birthday at a lake on private property in Brooksville, outside of Tampa. At about 4.30pm Miss Oras told her friend and former roommate to hop on the back of the quad bike, then drove off round the lake. 'I just had a bad feeling,' Miss Gernaat told the Tampa Bay Times, as she recalled how her friend had said she was going to speed up just moments before the crash. Other party-goers called for help but the young woman, who loved spending time with her friends and family, died from her injuries.

Police said Miss Oras and some of the other people at the party had been drinking beer and driving the vehicles, but it is not clear if alcohol played a part in the crash. Miss Gernaat, who said Miss Oras was like a sister to her, said the 23-year-old 'put everyone at ease' and loved four-wheeling and going to the beach. 'I miss her.

"By . Adrian Durham . I was at Carrow Road to watch Norwich 0-0 Manchester City, and here is the Durham Dossier. Lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score. Blunted: Strikers Edin Dzeko (left) and Alvaro Negredo (right) were left frustrated at Norwich . Manuel . Pellegrini. He hasn’t won anything in Europe as a manager, but he’s . been gifted a golden opportunity to do something special and historic at . Manchester City. It looks to me like he was out-coached by Mourinho on . Monday and had no answer, and you could even argue he was out-coached by . Chris Hughton at Norwich. Expectations: Manuel Pellegrini will be considered a failure if he can't win a trophy this season . Nous: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho out-thought Pellegrini in their midweek clash . Read Mark Ryan's report from Carrow Road . Fernandinho has been brilliant but Pellegrini has struggled to cope . without the midfielder. The elite managers are made of stronger stuff . than that. And when you need a goal I’m not sure Aleksandar Kolarov for Alvaro Negredo was . the right substitution, and indeed City didn’t score and didn’t really . threaten after that substitution. In fact Norwich looked more likely to . win it. Martin Demichelis made Chico Flores look like Rambo at one point in the second half. Being useless, the Argentine centre back completely misjudged a bouncing ball and realised it was about to sail over his head to send Gary Hooper clear on goal. Back to your feet: Manchester City's Martin Demichelis spent too much time on the ground at Carrow Road . So after feeling the slightest touch of Gary Hooper’s fingertips on his back he threw himself forward to the ground, and somehow referee Jon Moss bought it and blew for a free kick. Demichelis was booed, I suspect by his own fans as well as the Norwich faithful. Maybe Yaya Toure was frustrated with his own dreadful performance but . that’s no excuse to kick out at an opponent who’s on the floor. Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Yaya went for a ball, for some strange reason . the Ivorian decided to flick a boot at the Dutchman. He should have . seen red, City are lucky he didn’t. Another one missed by ref Jon Moss, . who should have stuck to drumming with Culture Club. In pain! Ricky van Wolfswinkel is left on the deck after receiving a kick from Yaya Toure . Distraught: The pair went up for a ball together and Van Wolfswinkel was left incandescent with rage . Norwich fans were magnificent, getting behind their team, even if celebrating a home draw like they’d won a trophy was a touch over the top. But that song they sing – 'On The Ball, City' - is just plain wrong. Not giving up: A Norwich fan sings loud and proud during the uninspiring 0-0 draw . Its opening line probably didn’t make sense when it was first penned in 1902: 'Kick off, throw in, have a little scrimmage.' Does this only have meaning in Norfolk? Fair play to them, they sung it very loud and proud. Unfortunately the last line 'Hurrah we’ve scored a goal' (I’m not joking) had no relevance to this game. Nathan Redmond. The Norwich teenager has got pace and balance, his touch is usually excellent, but his final ball – be it a shot or a cross – needs improvement. He can play wide and in the hole, and Man City really struggled to keep him quiet. If his rate of progression continues I expect him to be in the England picture by the time World Cup 2018 comes around, if not Euro 2016. Prospect: Nathan Redmond flew down the Norwich wing on more than one occasion on Saturday . Tempted to give it to Ricky van Wolfswinkel who has now scored just once in his 17 appearances. For £8.5m Norwich City expect more, that’s big money for them. But it has to go to Stevan Jovetic. He cost £22m and he looks like the kind of striker who might have the occasional brilliant game, but at Carrow Road he looked lazy and languid, and not physically made for a dust-up with the Premier League’s centre-half beasts. He was a poor man’s Dimitar Berbatov. He was taken off, unsurprisingly. Must improve. Abysmal: City's Stevan Jovetic needs to pull up his socks and prove why they spent so much money on him . Joleon Lescott’s contract is running out and he’s failed to rediscover his title winning form under the new boss; Matija Nastasic has gone backwards; and Demichelis – a genuine Pellegrini signing – is frankly awful. City have one decent centre back, Vincent Kompany. That’s poor squad management. If Pellegrini wins the quadruple or a treble then he’s a genius. If he wins a trophy he’s done well in his first season. If he wins nothing with this City squad he’s failed. Reliance: Vincent Kompany is the only world class centre defender that City have . Joseph Yobo. 13-and-a-half years after first playing in the Premier League, he slotted in straight away and looked solid at the back for Norwich alongside Sebastien Bassong. He was David Moyes first signing at Everton, and was excellent for the Toffees. If he continues the form he showed on his Canaries debut then that will be a shrewd signing from Hughton, because defensively they’ve not been great this season. Solid: Joseph Yobo is back playing in England after a spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce . Chris Hughton may possibly be doing just that. In December 1982, as a 24-year-old full back at Spurs, Hughton was interviewed about his football philosophy. The subsequent article in a football magazine was titled: 'Less Attacking – More Success'. It seemed to be a philosophy he was pursuing rigidly at Norwich, but without the success bit. But at Cardiff last week (even in defeat) Hughton’s side attacked and created chances. Against Manchester City you’d have been forgiven for thinking he would send his side out to defend. But with Anthony Pilkington, Nathan Redmond and Hooper all starting, it was more 4-3-3 than 4-5-1. Unfortunate: Gary Hooper thought he had scored for Norwich but it was ruled out for offside . Even when Hooper was injured half way through the second half Hughton resisted any temptation to sit deep, making a like-for-like substitution bringing van Wolfswinkel on. Hopefully he won’t revert to negative, defensive ways because Norwich were good to watch.Now he just needs to teach his strikers to score.","Manuel Pellegrini was out-foxed by Jose Mourinho and now Chris Hughton .

"By . Louise Boyle . Seven people have been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of a 24-year-old man. Justin Barnard, 24, was killed at his grandmother's home in Norman, Oklahoma on March 28. His grandmother was also beaten and robbed by his killers who stormed the property. Mr Barnard's girlfriend Dianna Paige St Clair, 27, was arraigned on Monday in Cleveland County District Court along with Rusty Wooten, 31; Michael Tubby, 21; Jason Harris, 28; Gary Harris, 29; Montie Ray Jones, 45, and Isaiah Walker, 23. Dianna Paige St Clair (pictured left) has been charged along with six men for the murder of her boyfriend Justin Barnard (right) in Oklahoma City last month . Gary Harris (left) reportedly told police that he overheard St Clair on the phone to Rusty Wooten (right) where she said she wanted her boyfriend 'beat down' St Clair allegedly arranged the hit on her boyfriend. One of the accused Gary Harris told police that he overheard St Clair on the phone to Wooten last month where she said she wanted Barnard 'beat down' because he assaulted her. St Clair claimed that Barnard attacked her on March 26 during a dispute between the couple in Oklahoma City. It is then believed that Wooten passed on St Clair's message to a group of people who were at his home including Gary Harris, Walker, Tubby, Jones, Jason Harris and an unknown male. St Clair was put on speaker phone so that all the men could hear what she wanted. The 27-year-old is alleged to have provided the address of Barnard's grandmother, where he was staying. The relationship between St Clair, Wooten and the five other men remains unclear. According to affidavits, Barnard received a phone call from 'Rusty' saying that he was on his way to kill him on March 28. Jason Harris (left) is also charged with first-degree murder along with Michael Tubby (pictured right) Isaiah Wallker (pictured left) and Monte Ray Jones (pictured right) have been charged with first-degree murder and are being held without bond . Minutes later, two cars full of people in ski masks pulled on to the front lawn of the home. Mr Barnard's grandmother tried to stop six individuals breaking down her front door but she was struck in the head and knocked to the ground, according to an affidavit. She was threatened with a gun and one suspect took her wallet containing around $430. Justin Barnard then came into the living room, struggled with the suspect and was shot. He was later pronounced dead at a Norman hospital. The victim's father Marvin told News 9 that he received a chilling voice mail from his son in the minutes before he died where Justin claimed that men were coming to kill him. In addition to first-degree murder, the six men face first-degree burglary and robbery with a dangerous weapon charges. Jones and Walker are being held without bail. Bail for Jason Harris, St Clair, Tubby and Wooten was set at $2 million, and bail for Gary Harris was set at $1 million. A preliminary hearing is set for the seven individuals on April 15, according to KOKH. Norman Captain Tom Easley told MailOnline today that no further details were available at this time because the investigation is ongoing. The victim reportedly made a terrified phone call to his father saying that men were coming to kill him at his grandmother's home (pictured) last month .","Justin Barnard, 24, was killed inside his grandmother's home in Norman, Oklahoma on March 28 .

"By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.' The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal. New guidance issued Tuesday would prevent food companies from adding sugar or other sweeteners to pure honey and still calling it 'honey.' Funny honey: The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal . The agency said enforcement action is possible against U.S. food businesses or importers if companies try to cut those sweeteners into real honey and do not label the product correctly. If those sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup.' The FDA regularly detains honey imports and tests them after finding drug residues and unlabeled added sweeteners. Only manufactures that do not add sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners should label their products as pure 'honey,' the FDA said in draft guidelines posted online. The proposal aims 'to advise the regulated food industry on the proper labeling of honey and honey products to help ensure that honey and honey products are not adulterated or misbranded,' the agency wrote. Americans consume more than 400 million pounds of honey each year, according to U.S. government and industry estimates. New rules: The guidance, released Tuesday, would stop food companies from putting sugar or other sweeteners into pure honey and still referring to it as honey . But just 149 million pounds were produced in the United States last year, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. To feed America's sweet tooth, much honey is imported, and U.S. producers are worried about cheap substitutes. Pure honey is generally more expensive than those mixed with corn syrup and traditional sugar, and prices reached a record high of $2.12 a pound last year, according to the USDA. The FDA's review follows a petition from the American Beekeeping Federation and several other related groups seeking a standard U.S. definition for the natural sweetener to promote fair trade.While the agency rejected their request, it said it was willing to look at labeling. Sticky situation: If sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup' The FDA inspected imported honey to see whether it had been 'adulterated' with corn or cane sugars. In recent decades, it detained honey containing such substitutes from countries such as Brazil and Mexico, according to the agency. Manufacturers have 60 days to comment on the proposal before final guidelines are issued. Even then, however, guidelines are not mandatory.","U.S. Food and Drug Administration's new guidance prevents food companies from adding sugar or other sweeteners to pure honey and still calling the product honey .

"By . Associated Press . A once-prominent socialite was found guilty Tuesday in the 1996 Tucson car bomb killing of her ex-husband after spending years abroad living a lavish lifestyle across Europe. Pamela Phillips, 56, had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. During the trial that began in February, Phillips' lawyers told jurors their client had nothing to gain from the death of businessman Gary Triano and that she was the victim of overzealous authorities who failed to follow other leads. They said Phillips was already a successful real estate broker with her own money, and suggested that Triano had numerous other enemies. Guilty: Pamela Phillips, shown as her verdict was handed down on Tuesday, has been found guilty on Tuesday of murder in the explosive death of her ex-husband Gary Triano . Haunting past: Phillips smirks as the verdict settles in on Tuesday in a Tuscon, Arizona court . But prosecutors described Phillips as a gold digger who hired a former boyfriend to kill Triano to collect on a $2million life insurance policy in order to maintain her extravagant taste for the good life. It's been nearly two decades since Triano died when his car exploded as he was leaving a Tucson-area country club after playing golf. Authorities said Phillips paid ex-boyfriend Ronald Young $400,000 to carry out the hit. Young was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to two life terms in prison, but jurors weren't allowed to consider his case while determining Phillips' fate. 'The state went after the easy marks,' defense attorney Paul Eckerstrom told jurors during closing arguments, indicating that Triano had plenty of other enemies with better motives to kill him. 'You have to tell the state: ""You made a mistake.""' Prosecutors presented a portrait of a . woman who grew accustomed to the high life and found herself struggling . financially with an easy $2million way out. The . state's case against her hinged largely on the purported secret . arrangement between Phillips and Young, who the defendant dated while . working as a real estate broker in Aspen, Colo., after she divorced . Triano. While . Phillips claimed she had paid Young the $400,000 for assistance with . business ventures and financial planning, prosecutors argued the money . was clearly payment for the hit. Scene: The prosecution contends that while Phillips was not at the Tucson-area country club when her ex husband Gary Triano was killed in 1996, she paid Young to plant the bomb . Plot: Phillips had entered a plea of not guilty but jurors were convinced by voicemails she left for her ex-boyfriend-turned-hitman who was convicted in 2010 (seen in court last week) 'He's not getting paid for business . advice that she never takes â€” he's getting paid for murder,' prosecutor . Rick Unklesbay said in closing arguments. During . the trial, in addition to witnesses, prosecutors used financial records . and telephone conversations that Young secretly recorded during talks . with Phillips. In one recording, Young appears to grow angry over not . receiving his payments, telling Phillips, 'You're going to be in a . woman's prison for murder.' Defense lawyers said the calls were merely the ramblings of a con man. One prosecution witness, a longtime friend of Phillips, testified that Phillips once told her how easy it would be to hire someone to kill her husband. Back in the day: The prosecution painted . Phillips, seen left in an undated photo, as a gold digger who left her . real estate developer husband Gary Triano (right) after he lost much of . his fortune . The defense downplayed the testimony, noting Phillips was distraught at the time after having a fight with Triano during which he threatened her. Phillips' lawyers also called into question the witness' memory. Triano was a developer who made millions investing in Indian bingo halls and slot-machine parlors in Arizona and California before Congress authorized tribes to open full-blown casinos. But after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests, Triano went broke. Upset: On Thursday, the Arizona court heard recordings that Phillips' ex boyfriend Ron Young (pictured) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing . That's around the time Phillips filed for divorce, prosecutors said. The couple, who had two children together, separated, but Phillips remained the beneficiary of Triano's insurance policy, paying the premiums herself. She eventually moved to Aspen and worked in real estate before meeting Young, and prosecutors said the two would later hatch a plan to kill Triano and collect on the policy. After the killing, Young was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in Colorado on fraud charges while Phillips was sending him money for the hit, eventually adding up to $400,000, prosecutors told jurors. The investigation into Triano's killing stalled until Young's arrest in 2005 in Florida on the fraud charges. That's when both Phillips and Young became the key suspects in the killing. Authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial transactions with Phillips, including recorded telephone conversations and invoices. Prosecutors said police also found divorce records pertaining to Phillips and Triano in a van rented by Young. By then, Phillips had received the $2 million insurance payout and had left Aspen for a life overseas.She was arrested in Austria in 2009 and extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time. Phillips' attorneys argued throughout the trial that the evidence against her was flimsy, and that Phillips was already wealthy with her own money. They said Young didn't even kill Triano, raising the specter that it could have been a hit by a jilted investor. Jurors began deliberating last week. Sentencing has been set for May 22, and Phillips faces life in prison.","Pamela Phillips has been found guilty of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A Moroccan man who was plotting to fly bomb-laden toy planes into a school and a government building in Connecticut has been arrested. El Mehdi Semlali Fahti was planning on stuffing radio-controlled toy planes with explosives and flying them into different buildings in a now-thwarted terror plot. He was caught by an undercover FBI agent who had five recorded conversations with Fahti wherein the 27-year-old Moroccan explained how he researched his plan for months. He is now being held without bail at Wyatt Detention Center in Rhode Island. Dangerous plot: A man was arrested for plotting to fill up a radio-controlled toy plane like this one and then ram it into certain targets in order to wreck havoc and kill Americans . He did not specify the exact targets, but stated that he would fly at least one of the planes into a federal building in Connecticut and then fly another into an undisclosed school out of the state. Fahti has been charged with making false statements, falsely swearing under oath and falsifying immigration documents. He does not face any terrorism-specific charges yet but The Connecticut Post reports that Assistant U.S. Attorney Krishna Patel is taking the evidence to a federal grand jury which could lead to an indictment. The charge relating to his immigration documentation comes because he stayed in the United States for seven years after his student visa expired. He was originally allowed into the country to attend Virginia International University but he failed out of the school and never left. Possible target? The would-be terrorist did not name the exact spots that he planned to attack but said that it would be a federal building in Connecticut, which could include the statehouse (pictured), and a school out of the state . He was arrested twice- once in Virginia for trespassing, but those charges were dropped, and another time in California for an unspecified theft. Fahti spent time in jail in connection to that theft charge and was threatened with deportation but that is when he concocted a string of lies that helped him stay in the country. During his conversations with an undercover agent, the 27-year-old told how he researched issues in Morocco that would qualify him for refugee status and then used them to make his case to an immigration judge. He said that he was a part of the Jamaat Ansar El-Mehdi  and Western Sahara freedom movements, and claimed to have been beaten and jailed by Moroccan police as a result. 'Everything he wrote in his refugee application coincided with the actual events,' FBI Special Agent Anabela Sharp wrote in the affadavit, according to The Connecticut Post. He moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut in January and had been living with a man that he met while in jail in Virginia. Police arrested him at the apartment, and found wires that they believe may be connected to the bomb plot but had not released any information about possible explosives at the residence.","A Moroccan national named El Mehdi Semlali Fahti has been arrested and is likely going to face charges from a grand jury .

"By . Lydia Warren . A woman has turned to Facebook in a bid to track down her father, who met her mother in a Florida club three decades ago as he worked as a drummer in a band. Jennifer Coker, a married mother of three young boys living in Tifton, Georgia, posted an image to her Facebook page showing her holding a sign with the few details she knows about her dad. 'Please help!' she wrote on a poster. 'My name is Jennifer and I am searching for a . needle in a haystack, my biological father.' In the image, which has been shared . more than 34,000 times since April 1, she explains that she has never met him, nor has . she seen a picture of him. Search: Jennifer Coker shared this image to Facebook in a bid to track down her biological father . Her mother, Lori, has only been able to give her scant information. She knows that he went by the name of 'Bobby Yaeger', but Coker worries that he could have adopted that as his stage name. She also believes he was in the band at the Imperial Lounge with a cousin named 'Mike Malarba' - but she is not sure of the spelling of the names. 'The only info I have . on him is he was in Tampa, Florida around June/July 1980,' she wrote. 'He is between . 55-65 years old and has a tattoo of a tweety bird.' Family: She is pictured in 1982 with her mom Lori, who met her dad in a Tampa bar when he was in a band . She did not reveal where the Tweety tattoo is - but her mother wrote on Facebook that 'it is NOT on his arm', without revealing further details. 'I have searched & searched for him,' her mother Lori wrote. 'I am TRULY sorry I know nothing more. I wish I would have gotten more info about him. I hate myself sooooooo much for this.' As Coker shared the photograph to Facebook, she asked that others help spread the word. 'Please share this and . help me,' she wrote. 'I feel like this is my last chance to find him. Thank you.' Speaking to WFTS, Coker explained that she wanted her father to know that he has a daughter and three grandsons. She also wants to fill gaps in her medical history knowledge - and her life. Today: Coker, a married mother of three, said she is looking for her father to fill a void she has felt since she was small. She also wants to let him know he has a daughter and three grandsons . 'I just want to fill that void, that emptiness that I have,' she said. She added that she has wondered who her father was since she was in kindergarten but that her previous attempts to track him down have been fruitless. She said she wants nothing from her father and simply wants to know who he is and what he looks like. Coker said she accepts that this effort may also not work out, saying: 'I may never know.' But so far it looks promising. After posting her picture to her Facebook . page, as well a special group set up for the search, it has been shared . more than 34,000 times. Scene: He once played at the Imperial Lounge, which was at this site in Tampa before it closed .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . Reverend Al Sharpton said today that reports that he was a 'rat' who spied on New York Mafia figures for the FBI in the 1980s is old news, while insisting that as he did the right thing he wasn't really a rat at all. 'Rats are usually people that were with . other rats,' he said in the animated press briefing. 'I was not and am not a rat, because I wasn't with . the rats. I'm a cat. I chase rats.' Sharpton had called a news conference at his Harlem headquarters to talk about a story The Smoking Gun website posted on Monday claiming he had recorded conversations with mobsters. The website said Sharpton was . recruited by a police-FBI task force to record conversations with Mafia . figures using electronic equipment hidden in a briefcase. It said Sharpton was known as Confidential Informant No. 7 in court papers. Defense: Rev. Al Sharpton speaks during a news conference in New York on Tuesday and says that a report saying he spied on New York mafia figures for the FBI in the 1980s is old news . Defiant: He said he was simply cooperating with an investigation and was not an informant . Sharpton . said he went to the FBI after he was threatened by mobsters working in . the music business. 'In my own mind I was not an informant,' Sharpton said. 'I was cooperating with an investigation.' The former child preacher turned civil rights activist insisted that he did the right thing. 'It is interesting to me, as we deal with . the whole criminalization of many in our community, that the premise of . a lot of this media is that I should have been with the mob rather than . with the government,' he said in response to the media reports. Sharpton said that he did indeed use a recording device in a briefcase but defended his actions. Not impressed: Sharpton reads from his 1996 book, Go Tell Pharaoh, in which he writes about the episode . 'I've done a lot of things in life. Some . that if I could do again, I would do differently,' he said. 'But in . this situation, I did what was right... The conversations were recorded. And I would record them today if somebody threatened.' He dismissed claims that he had met with some of the men mentioned in reports, including Vincent 'Chin' Gigante, who pretended he was crazy by wearing a bathrobe in the streets to escape responsibility for his crimes. Rev. Al Sharpton's denial . 'I have never met any of these guys in . the newspaper,' Sharpton said. 'The guy with the pajamas? I don't walk around with guys . that walk outside with pajamas! I never met him.' He read a passage from his 1996 book Go and Tell Pharaoh, which detailed his part in the investigation, on Tuesday and said: 'Nothing new about that story.' For the reporters gathered at the press conference, he had one simple request. 'The only thing I was embarrassed by was those old, fat pictures,' he said. 'Could y'all use tomorrow’s cover, the new slim [ones]?' 'Because a lot of my younger members didn’t know how fat I was,' Sharpton added. Caught: Vincent 'Chin' Gigante (C) was a Genovese crime . family boss who pretended to be mentally ill to escape arrest - but Sharpton helped foil his plot when . he taped other mob figures discussing the ruse . Locked up: Gigante died in 2005 while serving a 12-year sentence after admitting he wasn't insane. This mug is from 1960, when he was convicted of helping mob boss Vito Genovese run a narcotics ring . The . Smoking Gun posted dozens of pages of documents that it said showed . Sharpton's dealings with mob figures. Sharpton said his lawyers would . review the documents. Sharpton, who now hosts a show on MSNBC, said he was not an associate of mobsters but was threatened by mob figures who controlled the music business. He said he went to the FBI and said: 'I'm being threatened. These are the kinds of guys you should be going after.' The allegations published by The Smoking Gun had claimed that beginning in the 1980s, Sharpton worked as an informant for . many years on mob groups for an organized crime task force made up of . FBI agents and detectives with the New York Police Department. '[O]ne Gambino crime family figure . became so comfortable with the protest leader that he spoke openly – . during ten wired face-to-face meetings – about a wide range of mob . business,' it said. At the time: A heavier Sharpton (in blue track suit, center) is pictured during a march in 1998. Years earlier he had began informing against mob bosses, reports said . That . included everything 'from shylocking and extortions to death threats . and the sanity of Vincent ""Chin"" Gigante, the Genovese boss who long . feigned mental illness in a bid to deflect law enforcement scrutiny. 'As . the mafioso expounded on these topics, Sharpton’s briefcase--a . specially customized Hartman model – recorded his every word.' The Smoking Gun had reported that Sharpton denied his law enforcement ties on Saturday when it asked him point-blank about it. There . are strong personal ties between Sharpton and Barack Obama, including . several Oval office visits on topics as diverse as jobs and education – . mostly with other black community leaders. Sharpton . was also on hand for first lady Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party as . a guest of the Obamas. And he had a seat near the guest of honor at a .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The California Assembly is holding its first hearing on a bill that would have to end its killer whale shows and remove 10 orcas from their tanks. The bill, number AB2140, comes as a result of the CNN documentary 'Blackfish' which delved into the aggression of one of the male whales that led to a trainer's death. The bill's backers say killer whales are too large and intelligent for captivity, while SeaWorld says the animals are well treated and help conservation through research. Scroll down for video . Freeing the wales: A new bill up for debate in California could end the use of killer wales by SeaWorld, making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity . The 2013 film blames attacks and deaths of SeaWorld trainers on the mistreatment of the animals, increasing their aggression. SeaWorld calls the film anti-captivity propaganda. The bill was put forth by Democratic Assemblyman Richard Bloom and also bans the import and export of orcas. Under his measure, SeaWorld could keep the animals it has in a larger sea pen until they die. The Tuesday hearing comes days after a seperate court hearing in Florida connected to their ongoing battle against rival Marineland revealed that the animals have been put on psychoactive drugs akin to Valium. Under scrutiny: A documentary released last year has led to a flurry of accusations of animal cruelty as well as the dangers of keeping the killer whales in captivity . The orcas are dosed with benzodiazepine, which is designed to quell anxiety and commonly causes users to become drowsy. Prolonged use has been proven to cause panic attacks, out-of-body experiences, and muscle spasms. The allegations were confirmed by former SeaWorld vice president, now president and CEO of Pacific Research Laboratories Inc, Dr Lanny Cornell in a statement to the court. Dark side: The documentary detailed a number of trainer deaths through the years . PETA told MailOnline 'the end is near' for SeaWorld. In a statement, the animal rights organisation said: 'SeaWorld is in deep trouble and hot water since Blackfish showed the mental anguish of orcas taken from the great oceans and trapped for eternity in SeaWorld's swimming pools â€“ and now court documents have revealed that SeaWorld also pumps these marine slaves full of psychotropic drugs in order to force them to perform stupid tricks. 'If SeaWorld executives were locked up within our prison system, they would experience luxurious accommodation in comparison to those of the highly social, intelligent marine animals they imprison, which cause them to lash out, chew their own teeth to the nubs and attack their trainers. The park suffered long-term damage after the release of the 2013 documentary, which set out to investigate how animals react to life in captivity and became a critical examination of SeaWorld's treatment of whales. For 12 months after the film's January release, the park was hit with cancellations from high-profile performers and school field trips, as well as aggressive animal activist campaigns. In December, the Orlando-based marine park attempted to salvage its reputation by placing full-page adverts in eight of the country's largest newspapers, rationalising their whale practices.","New bill up for debate would ban the import or export of killer whales and would force SeaWorld to keep the animals in a bigger pen .

"By . Alex Greig . A baby girl, believed to be five months old, was brought to a Texas fire station Monday by a woman who said she was babysitting the child and that the mother never returned. A woman who only identified herself as Alysha told firefighters she and a friend had agreed to look after the child named Lily for the evening. When morning came, the pair didn't hear from the mother and by the afternoon, Alysha decided to take the child to the fire station. Bouncing baby girl: The little girl was in good spirits and seemed to be in good health . Abandoned: Lily is now in the care of Child Protective Services while police search for her mother . She told Click 2 Houston that she and her friend met the baby's mother around 3am Monday. She asked Alysha and her friend if they could take care of her five-month-old baby. The women gave the baby's mother a ride back to the Cullen Inn Motel where she had been staying with her daughter. That's when Alysha realized the baby had been left alone in the hotel room all night. She said some medication indicated the infant is named Lily. 'We took the baby for the night and told her to give us a call in the morning and she didn't,' Alysha told Click 2 Houston. 'She hasn't called, hasn't tried to find out where her baby is.' Soft side: The firefighters were quite taken with their tiny charge . Babysitter: The woman who was caring for Lily, known only as Alysha . Left alone: Alysha said the mother and child were staying in this motel, and that the baby had been left alone in the room . 'Pretty much bringing her here was the last resort because we don't know where she belongs.' 'The word was that we would help the mom because she was supposedly trying to get money for the baby's diapers,' she told Click2Houston. On Monday afternoon around 2pm, Alysha took Lily to Fire Station 35 in southeast Houston, not knowing what else to do. She said the firefighters were surprised when she walked in the door but she was impressed by their offers of help. 'Well, . they were like a little bit shocked,' she told Khou. 'They were more than . willing to help and they jumped right into action.' Safe haven: Alysha took Lily to this fire station when she realized the mother was not going to return . Fire officials say Lily seems in good health and was clean and happy when she was dropped off. Texas's Safe Haven or Baby Moses Law states that a baby may be left in a designated safe place, such as a fire station, with no questions asked and without fear of consequence if its carers are unable to care for their child - but this law only applies babies 60 days or younger. Since baby Lily is believed to be about five months old, the law cannot apply to her. She is in the care of Child Protective Services as police search for her mother. They were still looking for leads on the mother Tuesday morning.","A five-month-old baby girl was dropped off at a Texas fire station Monday afternoon by a woman claiming to be her babysitter .

"By . James Rush . A five-year-old boy who was found severely malnourished and covered in bruises has been showered with toys and gifts as he recovers in hospital. The little boy, identified as Jordan Bleimeyer, has gained four pounds since being taken to Houston Hospital after he was discovered weighing just 29 pounds last month. The child's father Bradley Bleimeyer, 24, and stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, have been charged with felony child endangerment after allegedly keeping the little boy locked under the stairs. WARNING: DISTURBING IMAGES BELOW . The five-year-old boy discovered severely malnourished and covered in bruises has been showered with toys and gifts as he recovers in hospital . A picture posted on Monday to the Facebook page 'Toys for Jordan' showed a smiling boy in bed surrounded by toys. The page administrator wrote: 'The power of love and prayers bring us this amazing smile. 'Please help by sharing this incredible update around the world.' The boy was moved from the pediatric intensive care unit on Friday, the New York Daily News has reported. According to the Facebook page documenting his recovery, his dietary restrictions were lifted on Saturday. Last week, Tammie Bleimeyer claimed to be unaware of his horrific condition because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently. The child's father Bradley Bleimeyer, 24, (left) and stepmother Tammie, 33, (right) have been charged with felony child endangerment after allegedly keeping the little boy locked under the stairs . Police discovered a locked closet with a mattress after being called to a home following a disturbance on Thursday, March 27, between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old stepson . She claimed she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer. Her ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said, but took his five-year-old son to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed for divorce last Tuesday from her husband of two years. Tammie Bleimeyer told KHOU last week: 'I was shocked. I have never seen him look like that and I have never seen him with his shirt off recently.' The little boy was found weighing just 29 pounds last month . However she did not necessarily believe that her estranged husband caused the child's condition. The 33-year-old added: 'I don’t know what caused him to look like that. I don’t know if it’s a health issue or something else like that. I don’t want to be like everyone else and assume the worse.' Police discovered a locked closet with a mattress after being called to a home following a disturbance on Thursday, March 27, between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old stepson. The teenager raised the alarm and told police he had found his five-year-old stepbrother in a diaper under the stairs. The stepmother denied that the boy was kept under the stairs but had a room and slept in a bunk bed. However she admitted that the child could have fitted under the stairs. She also said that her 16-year-old son was lying because he did not respect his stepfather Bradley, who is only eight years older than him. The child's stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer had reportedly fled the home with the boy before officers arrived, according to click2houston. Bleimeyer, who is six months' pregnant, refused to return to the home when contacted by police. She was tracked to a motel in Humble by her cellphone where she was found with the boy. Last week, Tammie Bleimeyer claimed to be unaware of his horrific condition because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently . Tammie Bleimeyer and her husband Bradley appear in court charged with child endangerment of their five-year-old son . The pregnant 33-year-old told KHOU that she did not flee with the child but had simply gone to get pizza and that her husband was staying at the motel. His frail body was photographed covered in bumps and bruises with a deep cut on his right shoulder. Tammie Bleimeyer was charged with endangering a child and released on $2,000 bond. Bradley Bleimeyer, who was already out on bond for a burglary charge, was also charged with endangering a child. The 24-year-old, who has spent time in jail and has string of prior convictions, is being held without bond.

"By . James Rush . Kings of Leons fans have been put on alert after a woman went to a Seattle concert while contagious with measles. File picture shows the band's lead singer Caleb Followill . Thousands of Kings of Leon fans have been put on alert by health officials after a woman attended a Seattle concert while she was contagious with measles. The Washington State Department of Health has now issued a schedule of all the places the Whatcom County woman, who is in her 20s, visited after contracting the infectious illness. Health officials have said the woman became contagious on March 26 after visiting a family with the condition who have been linked to an outbreak in British Columbia. She then went to work at a bakery, visited a petrol station and went to the Kings of Leon concert. According to the schedule posted online, she also visited a Wasabi Bistro, a Starbucks and a Kmart. Anybody who was at any of the places listed in the schedule, and who have not been vaccinated or are not sure if they are immune, have been urged to seek a health care professional for advice. Dr Jeffrey Duchin, chief of communicable disease control for Seattle and King County Public Health, told NPR: 'The reason we're doing this is that it's so highly contagious. 'It can stay in the air for hours after the contagious person has left. If we don't treat these people, the chain of transmission can continue.' Measles is a highly contagious illness and is easily spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The woman, in her 20s, went to watch the Kings of Leon with thousands of others at the Key Arena, in Seattle (file picture) Measles is a highly infectious viral illness which can lead to serious complications. The initial symptoms develop around 10 days after a person becomes infected and can include cold-like symptoms, a fever, greyish white spots in the mouth and throat and red eyes and sensitivity to light. A rash will also appear after a few days, often starting behind the ears. It then usually spreads around the head and neck before spreading to the rest of the body. Anybody can get measles if they have not been vaccinated or have not had it before. It is most common in children between one and four years old. Once you have had the condition it is very rare to develop it again because your body builds up an immunity to the virus. Those who are not vaccinated are able to catch measles simply by walking into a room where a contagious person has been in the last couple of hours, the Washington State Department of Health has warned. Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common even in healthy people, and about 20 per cent of reported measles cases experience one or more complications. These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders. Whatcom County: . Wednesday, March 26 . 7am–4:30pm: work at Lynden Dutch Bakery .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The basketball star who led UConn to a decisive victory in the NCAA men's basketball championship last night has created as much buzz off the court as on it with his comments about college athlete poverty. Senior Guard Shazbazz Napier is now being put forward as an outspoken critic of the treatment of college athletes, and critics say his experience is evidence of the need to overhaul the college system. The athlete complained in a recent interview with Fox Sports that he is so poor he can't afford food beyond that offered by his school's cafeteria service. 'We as student athletes get utilized for what we do so well. We are . definitely blessed to get a scholarship to our universities, but at the . end of the day, that doesn't cover everything,' Napier told FoxSports. Scroll down for video . Critic: UConn's Shabazz Napier was named Outstanding Player as his team took the NCAA Championship. He has been outspoken in criticizing support for college athletes . Hungry: Napier scored 22 points in the game as well as taking six rebounds. He has complained he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food . 'We do have hungry nights . that we don't have enough money to get food and sometimes money is . needed.' 'When . you see your jersey getting sold -- it may not have your last name on . it -- but when you see your jersey getting sold and things like that, . you feel like you want something in return.' 'To some credit, you feel like you want something in returnâ€¦ Like I . said, there are hungry nights that I go to bed and I am starving. So . something can change, something should change,' Napier said. And on Monday night as his team crushed the Kentucky Wildcats, Napier was still acknowledging his complaints. 'Ladies and gentlemen, you're looking at the Hungry Huskies,' said the man named Most Outstanding Player. 'Two years and hungry. Hungry Huskies!' Bright career ahead: This was Napier's last game as a college student . Celebration: Napier told the crowd they were the 'Hungry Huskies' Local politicians supporting a move to unionize college athletes are putting him forward as an example of a need for action. Last month, the National Labor . Relations Board ruled that football players at Northwestern have the . right to form the first ever labor union in college sports. The ruling will now be voted on and the school is appealing the decision. But it hasn't stopped campaigners who are now demanding a similar option for students at public universities like UConn. Public schools are governed by state labor laws and therefore may face an additional legislative burden. 'He says he's going to bed hungry at a . time when millions of dollars are being made off of him. It's obscene,' State Rep. Matthew Lesser said. 'This . isn't a Connecticut problem. This is an NCAA problem, and I want to . make sure we're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well.' Supported: Connecticut point guard Shabazz Napier, left, with head coach Kevin Ollie, said he sometimes can't afford food as a student athlete. His comments have been backed by local politicians . Last night Napier's criticism was being reconsidered in light of his success on the court. In . the final game of his college career there was never a moment in the . game that the Huskies trailed Kentucky, taking their rivals down 60-54. Napier scored 22 points and grabbed six rebounds while teammate Ryan Boatright drained 14 points and had three assists. This is the fourth national championship for UConn. They have never lost a title game. The outspoken player also used his . post-game interview to hit out at the NCAA's decision to ban his team . from the 2013 postseason due to poor academic standing. Should state law prove to be a barrier for Connecticut's college athletes to form unions at public schools, State Rep. Patricia Dillon said she would propose legislation to allow for their unionization. 'We shouldn't be preventing them. They should have that voice,' Dillon said. 'If state law is the barrier, then we should remove it. It . should be up to the players.' Dillon may not have a chance to introduce a bill this year as only four weeks remain in the legislative session. Big change: Napier is hopeful efforts to form a student athlete union at Northwestern will lead to unions at other schools . UConn spokesman countered that Napier is given food as part of his athletic scholarship. 'Shabazz Napier, like all our scholarship athletes, is provided the . maximum meal plan that is allowable under NCAA rules. UConn does not . have a cafeteria devoted specifically to student-athletes, but they have . access to the same cafeterias which are available to all our . students,' Phil Chardis wrote. The university's athlete handbook notes that students with a meal plan have access to all-you-can-eat dining facilities open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Lori J. Pelletier, leader of the state's labor union, believes there is good cause for a college athletes union. 'Many of these athletes end up injured and no longer have the . opportunity for an athletic career. These athletes deserve to be . protected from career-ending injuries just as any 'worker' is covered. The ruling by the NLRB will allow for serious discussion on how we treat . these performers,' the Connecticut AFL-CIO executive secretary . treasurer wrote. Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations leaders said it has yet to be determined whether state law permits student athlete unions and that college athletes have yet to petition the board seeking a ruling.","Shabazz Napier led UConn to victory in the NCAA championship last night .

"By . Louise Boyle . 'Pot princess' Kayla Mendoza, 21, was charged with DUI manslaughter on Monday in Florida . A self-proclaimed 'pothead princess' who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' hours before she killed two young women was charged on Monday with causing their deaths. Kayla Mendoza, 21, was wheeled into Broward County Jail, Florida on a stretcher as she is still recovering from injuries five months after the crash which killed Marisa Catronio and Kaitlyn Ferrante, both 21. Mendoza covered her face with a sheet while the families of the victims gathered outside the prison gates. Mendoza faces two counts of DUI . manslaughter while impaired, two counts of DUI manslaughter with an . unlawful blood-alcohol level, two counts of vehicular homicide and two . counts of driving without a license and causing death. Her blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit at the time of the 2am crash, according to highway patrol. She also had traces of marijuana in her system. The 21-year-old sales assistant is being held without bond. Mendoza suffered a brain injury and broken legs in the crash. The grieving families said on Monday they were glad to see Mendoza being brought to justice. Miss Ferrante's mother Christine Ferrante told the Sun-Sentinel that she believed Mendoza covered her face so she would not have to look at them. However she added: 'All this time I wanted to see those gates close behind her, and now I have.'

"By . Zoe Szathmary . The California family of a Vietnam veteran is suing a mortuary, claiming its loved one was buried without being notified. Jamilah Pitts, daughter of Edward Pitts, claims she paid Simpson Family Mortuary nearly $1,700 to bury her father with full military honors at Riverside National Cemetery, KCAL9 reports. The trouble began when family members reportedly received a date for the service which they could not attend. They say that Dr. Reginald Black, a contact at the mortuary, told them the date of Edward's ceremony could be changed. The family claims that it followed up on the request - only to be told Edward had already been buried and the ceremony had not been paid for. Scroll down for video .

Jamilah Pitts told KCAL9 that they are not even sure if it's Edward's body that was buried. 'It’s just so, so hurtful,' she said. '[The funeral director] Dr. Black lied to us and promised us we could be there. Simpson’s robbed us of the chance to give papa our final goodbyes and they don’t even care. They don’t care. I can’t even visit the grave because I don’t know if my father is even really in there.' The family is seeking $250,000 in damages for fraud, negligence and emotional distress, according to KTLA. Trouble: this is not the first time Simpson Family Mortuary, pictured, has been accused of making a serious mistake. Two different women were reportedly placed in the wrong caskets in 2013 . Dr. Black issued a statement on Monday denying that the company made a mistake and that its directors 'stand firm in our convictions that we will prevail.' This is not the first time the mortuary has been accused of making a serious error. In March 2013, Evan Davidson looked at an open casket meant to hold his late wife Darlene -- only to find the wrong woman inside. Morticians told him he was mistaken, but later admitted they had their wrongdoing, KABC reported at the time. Davidson was called in three days later to confirm that Darlene's body had been placed in a casket for a different family.","Jamilah Pitts says she paid Simpson Family Mortuary nearly $1,700 to bury her father Edward with full military honors .

A Virginia tattoo enthusiast is facing child abuse charges after he allegedly inked two children he was babysitting without their or their parents' consent. Alexander Edwards, 20, of Rustburg, was taking care of his family friend Melissa Delp's two daughters on December 22, 2013, while she and her boyfriend, Daniel Janney, were out. According to ABC News, he used a home kit to tattoo the pair, who were both under the age of 13. One of the girls reportedly had her name tattooed on her shoulder. It's not clear her sister got inked or what that tattoo was. When Delp, 35, and her boyfriend, Janney, 32, returned home to find out what had happened, they attempted to remove the tattoos, Major L.T. Guthrie of the Campbell County Sheriff's Office said. ABC reported that Janney tried to use a hot razor blade to remove the ink. They too are now facing charges. 'It didn't help the situation any,' Guthrie said of the parents' attempt to hide the inkings. 'It added more scarring.' The couple is charged with two counts each of malicious wounding and child neglect. Edwards is facing two counts of malicious wounding, two counts of abduction and two counts of felony child abuse.

The Capitol Police officers involved still remain on paid administrative leave.

'We still fell that there was maybe another story than what we're being told.'

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . History: The 300-page police file tells how Rebecca Sedwick had cut herself and been hospitalized in the past . A new police report reveals that a Florida girl, who authorities said jumped to her death because she was bullied, also had a spotty relationship with her father and had just broken up with an online boyfriend. The 300-page investigative file on 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick tells how she was concerned about her mother and stepfather's fighting, had been involuntarily committed and wrote in her diary that she cut herself to ‘ease the pain.’ In a diary entry dated two weeks before she leaped to her death in September 2013, the girl notes that on one particular day, she had been called ‘pretty, nice beautiful, funny, awesome.’ Yet she also had been called ‘ugly, stupid, slut, fat, not good enough.’ At the bottom of the page she wrote one word: ‘suicidal.’ However, the file contains scant evidence of cyberbullying, even though officials publicly described cruel text and social media messages as reasons for Rebecca's suicide. Two classmates were charged with stalking Rebecca because of in-school, in-person conflicts, and Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd has said the girl also endured a barrage of cruel text and online messages before her death. In spite of the public case against them, the prosecution ultimately fell apart because of a lack of evidence. ‘Rebecca was a very fragile child,’ Judd said in a recent interview. ‘Rebecca's wagon was already pretty heavily burdened with bricks. And we never said that bullying was the only reason Rebecca committed suicide. But what the bullies did, is that they continued to stack bricks on an already overloaded wagon, 'til finally it broke.’ An attorney representing Rebecca's mother did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Scroll down for video . 'Fragile child': Even though investigators were quick to place the blame on cyber bulliers, they did not mention anything about the alleged virtual taunting because they could not obtain records from the companies . Sheriff Judd has said in the past that the girl's mother did everything she could to end the bullying, including home-schooling her and informing school and law enforcement officials. After Rebecca's death, Judd said as many as 15 classmates had ganged up on the girl and sent her messages saying ‘You should die’ and ‘Why don't you go kill yourself?’ But no such messages appear in the case file, although detectives interviewed some students who said they had seen such messages. Judd said his detectives tried to obtain records from social media companies overseas without success. There are no chat transcripts between Rebecca and her alleged bullies. Deputies wrote that they saw screen shots of cruel messages and that some of the evidence was deleted, but it's unclear by whom, Judd said. Stories: Rebecca had told friends she was abused by her mother Tricia Noman (pictured) and child protective authorities were called but Rebecca later told adults that her claims were a lie . It's clear from the file that Rebecca had problems with kids at her middle school in December 2012 and January 2013. Interviews with several students said that one girl in particular picked on Rebecca, and Rebecca and another girl were suspended for fighting. Heartbreak: The report mentions that a relationship that she was having with someone online had just ended but they did not disclose any further information about the person in question . Rebecca had told friends she was abused by her mother and child protective authorities were called — but Rebecca later told adults that her claims were a lie. Rebecca was in counseling, where bullying and Rebecca's home life were the main topics of discussion, the records show. Rebecca's mother decided to home school her after January 2013, and in late August, Rebecca attended a new school. A friend of Rebecca's told detectives that she chatted with Rebecca on social media five days before she died. Rebecca didn't say anything about bullying, the report said, but Rebecca stated that she ‘hated her life and wasn't doing good.’ The case underscored the difficulty of prosecuting bullying cases, especially cases using online evidence. Rebecca's mother and others called for bullying to be criminalized, but a bill that would have done just that died in the Florida Legislature this year. Lawmakers and law enforcement officials — including Sheriff Judd — opposed the bill because they said cyberbullying in particular was difficult to prosecute.","Rebecca Sedwick's 300-page police file reveals that she had a history of depression and had been hospitalized before her September 2013 death .

Overdose death: According to the Indianapolis Star, two weeks before Irsay's arrest, a woman named Kimberly Wundrum, pictured, died of a suspected drug overdose at a townhouse given to her by Irsay last August . The Star's report states that the . Traders Point townhouse where Wundrum's body was found was purchased by . an entity called '2009 Blue Trust,' which was administered by Colts . executives, in June 2013. The . trust transferred ownership of the property to Wundrum at no cost just . weeks later. Irsay, who is worth $1.6billion according to Forbes, owns . the team outright. MailOnline reached out to Irsay's spokeswoman Myra Borshoff Cook for comment but has not yet heard back. According to the Star, Wundrum's sister Rhonda Wundrum worked as Irsay's personal masseuse. In an email to the newspaper, she described her client and her sister as 'former friends.' 'I . cannot speak for them, and Kim cannot speak for herself,' Rhonda . Wundrum told The Star. 'My sister was a kind, loving and gentle person . who had a long struggle, and her attempts to rise above her struggles . were not successful.' Kimberly . Wundrum was arrested twice on drug charges in the seven months before . her death - once on August 30, 2013, in Miami County, Ohio, and a second . time on January 4, 2013, in Boone County. In . both cases she was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated . and possessing drugs. In the latter she was also charged with criminal . recklessness, accoridng to the newspaper, because she almost hit a . police car while driving the wrong way on an interstate. Detectives searching the death scene found an 'orange plate (with) white powder, straw, razor' and photographs of Irsay. Struggle: Wundrum, pictured left and right, was described as a 'former friend' of Irsay. She had long struggled wit drug addiction . Gift: The Star reports that the Traders Point townhouse, pictured, where Wundrum's body was found was purchased by an entity called '2009 Blue Trust,' which was administered by Colts executives, in June 2013 and then transferred to her at no cost two weeks later . Colts . Chief Operating Officer Pete Ward told The Star that the Blue Trust . related to Irsay's 'personal life,' and refused to comment on it. Irsay's . ex, Meg Irsay, filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 . years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage. A . joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full . ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.  The couple, . who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the . parents of three adult daughters. Irsay was pulled over March 16 in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel. He . had the $29,000 stashed inside a metal briefcase, two laundry bags and . his wallet, along with a shocking amount of prescription medicines, . authorities said. The arrest report shows a dozen items listed as prescription drugs, but does not offer any further information, according to the Indianapolis Star. The arresting officer forced Irsay to . sit on the hood of his car while the Toyota Highlander was being . searched because he was unable to stand up, according to the report. Irsay took a breathalizer, but the results were redacted, and the cop said he 'believed Irsay to be intoxicated on a substance other than alcohol,' the Star reported. Social-media butterfly: Irsay is known to often interact with fans on social media websites like Twitter . Teetotal: Irsay, pictured leaving jail on March 17, told Twitter followers that he hasn't had an alcoholic drink in 15 years last October . Jailed: Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, right, was jailed overnight after his DUI arrest last month . In . an inventory of Irsay's vehicle, 'multiple prescription drugs were . discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV . prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles . found in the vehicle.' The . billionaire has been in and out of rehab over the years and has said he . kicked his addiction to prescription painkillers - but sources close to . the businessman say otherwise. Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise. 'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.' According to the Star, Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances. The . night of his arrest, Irsay drove at a slow speed, stopped in . the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, . Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release. 'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said. Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans . of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't . drink...haven't in over 15 years.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment. Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay. A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs. League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would. 'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said. Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion. Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.","The Indianapolis Star reports that Jim Irsay could be questioned about his relationship with Kimberley Wundrum .

"By . Associated Press . Only two of nine midsize SUVs got the highest rating in crash tests done by an insurance industry group. The Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, both made by General Motors, received the highest 'good' rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Toyota Highlander got the second-best 'acceptable' rating in tests of 2014 models. Scroll down for video . Crash test: A 2014 Chevrolet Equinox is pictured during a crash test study conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in this undated handout provided by the IIHS . Thumbs up: The Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, both made by General Motors, received the highest Good rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. But the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Toyota 4Runner and Ford Explorer got 'marginal' ratings, while the Kia Sorento, Mazda CX-9 and Honda Pilot all were rated 'poor.' The SUVs generally performed well on six crash test measurements done by the institute. However, only the Equinox and Terrain got 'good' ratings in a front overlap crash that mimics what happens when a car’s front corner collides with another vehicle or an object like a utility pole. In the test, 25 percent of a vehicle’s front end on the driver’s side strikes a rigid barrier at 40 mph. Failure: Most of the midsize SUVs did not fare well in a new small overlap front-crash test conducted by an influential U.S. safety group, in yet another jolt to the industry already shaken by safety concerns. The Mazda CX-9 (pictured) was among the worst . Bottom of the class: The Kia Sorento, Mazda CX-9, and Honda Pilot earned the worst rating in the small overlap crash test, despite doing well on traditional frontal and side impact tests. A Mazda spokeswoman said the CX-9 was designed before the Institute began its new crash test . The test, instituted in 2012, is more difficult than the U.S. government’s frontal crash test, in which a car strikes a rigid barrier head-on at 35 mph. IIHS says hitting only part of the front end makes it harder for cars to manage the energy from a crash. The test 'continues to challenge manufacturers more than a year and a half after its introduction,' the institute said in a statement. The institute uses its crash test scores to prod automakers into adding safety devices or making their cars more crash-resistant. The institute said the Equinox and Terrain, which are almost identical, were modified by GM in the new model year to strengthen their front structure and door-hinge pillars. Making the grade:  Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain from the General Motors Co were the only vehicles to earn the highest rating of ""good"" in the test, according to results released by the IIHS . In tests, the Equinox driver’s space was well-maintained, and the crash dummy’s movement was well-controlled, the institute said. The institute changed its requirements for vehicles to get the 'Top Safety Pick-Plus' designation this year. To earn that, vehicles must get 'good' ratings in four crash tests, 'good' or 'acceptable' in the overlap test, and they must have available a front crash prevention system that either warns the driver of a crash or stops the vehicle with automatic braking. Of the nine midsize SUVs, only the Equinox and Terrain and the Highlander qualified for “'op Safety Pick-Plus.' The Honda Pilot was the worst performer of the group, largely because the driver’s space was seriously compromised in the overlap test, the institute said. Honda said in a statement that with each redesign, the Pilot has been a leader in light-truck safety and driver-assist technologies 'and we are committed that it will continue to do so in the future.'","The new Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests looks at the safety of SUVs .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A two-year-old girl nearly mauled to death by a pit bull in a Texas apartment last week is recovering from her second round of surgery. Mackenzie Camp has severe injuries to her head and face after a dog being looked after by her mother, Chelsi, turned on the toddler on March 31. The attack was so harrowing that the first officers to arrive at the apartment, and the 911 dispatcher who took the call, visited the little girl in hospital to check on her progress. On the mend: Mackenzie Camp and her mother, Chelsi, right, are visited in hospital by 911 dispatcher Rhonda Barrow, left, and Officers Massey and Zavesky, who saved the little girl . Still smiling: Despite the bites to her head and face, two-year-old Mackenzie is keeping her spirits up . Mackenzie is out of intensive care but will face more surgery, prompting her family to start a fundraising campaign to help with the costs. Her mother was also injured in the attack, suffering bites to her arms and hands as she tried to protect her daughter. When police arrived at their League City apartment, they found the mother and daughter cowering in the bathroom, where the dog had corned them. The animal, which belonged to 23-year-old Miss Camp's boyfriend, was shot by police and later euthanized. Mackenzie's injuries were so extensive that she had to be airlifted to hospital and was in surgery for seven hours immediately after the attack. Despite her ordeal, her family say the little girl is sitting up in her hospital bed and smiling. A Facebook update from Mackenzie's aunt, Sheryl . Camp, said on April 6: 'I'm pleased to say she doesn't remember a . thing. It's amazing what they were able to do to put her back together. 'As she grows these scars will fade. If they don't, she is still beautiful like her mother.' Attack: Authorities said they do not know why the animal suddenly turned on Mackenzie and Chelsi Camp . Horrific: Mackenzie's face is covered in bite marks after the dog her mom was looking after turned on her . Several fundraising events are being held in the community and a Go Fund Me page has already raised more than $13,000 towards Mackenzie's medical costs. The pit bull attack was so vicious that the first emergency workers on the scene said it will haunt them for the rest of their lives. As soon as Mackenzie was out of intensive care, Officers Massey and Zavesky and 911 dispatcher, Rhonda Darrow, who handled the call, visited the little girl and her mom at Memorial Hermann Hospital. The group were pictured with Miss Camp, who had two bandaged hands, and Mackenzie, who looked frail in her hospital bed. A post on the League City Police Department's Facebook page said: 'Rarely do we get to know what happens after the emergency response is over. And there are some calls that haunt us for the rest of our careers.' Miss Camp frantically called 911, and spoke to Ms Darrow, after the dog unexpectedly turned on her daughter at about 8.45am. Shocking: Chelsi Camp and her two-year-old daughter Mackenzie are recovering after the attack on March 31 . Police said the dog was still attacking the girl when they arrived and an officer shot the animal so other officers could help the mother and daughter. 'It was a very bad scene,' Reagan Pena with the League City Police Department told KHOU, adding of Miss Camp: 'Obviously she was trying to prevent the dog from attacking her child.' The animal was shot once at the scene but did not die, authorities said. Animal control later euthanized the dog and it was carried away from the scene in a body bag. Killed: Footage shows the pit bull being carried away in a body bag after it was euthanized at the scene . Victims: Mackenzie was airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery; her mother was taken by ambulance . Authorities said that Miss Camp, who is an apartment manager at the Avana at South Shore apartments, had been looking after the dog for her boyfriend, who was not home. Neighbors became emotional as they spoke about the attack and the young family. 'She's a wonderful person and her little girl is a sweetheart,' neighbor Maria DuBose told Click2Houston. League City police told KHOU that charges are unlikely in this case and it may be instead considered a 'family incident'. Animal control will conduct its own investigation into the attack.","Mackenzi Camp and her mother Chelsi were attacked in their apartment .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Detroit police are investigating whether a mob attack on a white motorist who accidentally ran over a young black boy could be a hate crime, despite previously saying they had no evidence to suggest such an offense. Grandfather Steve Utash, . 54, was brutally beaten by a gang of men in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in . front of his truck on a busy street and got out to check on the young boy. Police have arrested so far four suspects arrested in connection with the attack which saw about a dozen vigilantes beat Utash, even stealing his wallet before leaving him injuries severe enough to cause bleeding on the brain - he is still in a medically induced coma. Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie Utash. He was brutally beaten by a gang of men in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood . Hoping and praying: A family member holds Steve Utash's hand as he is in a medically-induced coma at a local hospital . Detroit Police Chief James Craig said investigators were examining whether the attack should be treated as a hate crime. Detroit Police spokesman Jennifer Moreno previously told MailOnline: 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime. 'We're widening the scope of our investigation,' Chief Craig told The Detroit News. 'Both . our strategy and the prosecutor's strategy is widening, and those . factors are being looked into very closely. I can't reveal some things . about our investigation, but that (a hate crime classification) is . definitely something we're considering.' In . Michigan, ethnic intimidation is a felony that carries a possible . two-year prison sentence. Group of friends: Four individuals are shown . standing by the side of the road at left and Harris can be seen darting . head on into traffic at right . Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street . On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit . There are also federal hate crime laws. His son Joseph Utash previously hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I . think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s . been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same . company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Loving husband: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, was beaten into a life-threatening coma after stopping to help a 10-year-old boy he hit with his pick-up truck in Detroit. His family say he has no insurance . Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified . Detroit police Sgt. Michael Woody said a 30-year-old man was arrested Sunday night and a 24-year-old on Monday afternoon. That brings to four the number of people arrested in the assault of 54-year-old Steve Utash after the accident Wednesday. Bruce . Wimbush, Jr., 17, was charged Monday with assault with intent to commit . murder and do great bodily harm, and faces arraignment Tuesday. The fourth is a 16-year-old boy who hasn't been charged but was being held in a juvenile detention facility. Authorities have five days to determine whether someone is charged as an adult. Police initially said a group of at least six people descended on Utash, a tree-trimmer. Woody . said Monday that investigators are 'not trying to stick to one specific . number' as they receive more tips and other information. 'We . wouldn't have been able to get as far as we have' without help from the . public, Woody said, though he added, 'We're not done yet. We're still . very much at the beginning stages of this case.' He's going to survive: David Harris, 10, suffered a broken leg after running into traffic in the busy street . Released from the hospital: Harris suffered a broken leg and has already been sent home . The case has outraged the public, clergy and elected officials. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the attack 'senseless.' A . prominent black minister, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, had said . Saturday that it was important for community members 'to prove that we . equally deplore justice and unbridled brutality no matter what color the . victim is or of the one committing it.' Prosecutor . Kym Worthy said in a statement Monday that the case is 'unbelievably . tragic,' but declined further comment 'because this investigation is . continuing and widening.' Security . footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of . shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed . down by Utash's vehicle. Devastated: Daughter Felicia Utash (right) insisted her father (left) was only trying to do the right thing . Utash, from suburban Roseville, . immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from . their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained. But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation. 'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit. A . web page launched to accept donations for Utash's medical bills had . raised more than $120,000 by late Monday afternoon. He has no medical . insurance. The family have said they are grateful for the outpouring of generosity that has come from around the world. 'Mr . Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need, and, . appallingly, was punished for doing so,' said state Rep. Brian Banks, a . Harper Woods Democrat whose district includes the scene of the attack. 'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.'","Steve .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The dictator hated visiting the dentist right up until his death . A postcard sent during the First World War by Adolf Hitler after a visit to the dentist - in which he claimed to have had 19 teeth removed - has turned up in Munich. 'You can't imagine how nice I looked,' he wrote to a fellow soldier called Karl Lanzhammer who was stationed in France. 'Now I'm better.' The card, dated December 21, 1916, has been authenticated after it was found in the collection of a postcard collector. On the front of the card is a picture of Berlin's Landwehr Canal and it is marked with the stamp of the 2nd Bavarian Infantry Regiment, Hitler's unit at the time. The future FÃ¼hrer of Nazi Germany was known to hate the dentist. Research has proved he had 15 teeth removed during his lifetime, but not all at the same time. 'The postcard is written in his handwriting and signed by him. There is not doubt that it is genuine' said Ludwig Eiber, a professor of history at the University of Augsburg. Hitler was in Munich at the time he sent the card, recovering from a grenade splinter wound in his thigh. It is the second card Hitler sent to Lanzhammer that has been discovered in the past two years. In 2012, one was found sent from the same hospital at the same time, December 1916, in which Hitler griped that he was restless and wanted to get back to the front lines. Hitler, who recuperated in Munich from October 1916 until March 1917, expressed similar sentiments in the second postcard, adding after his dental report: 'Would that I could be back with you. Unfortunately there is no chance of me coming back to the front, at least not right now.' Hitler returned to the war in 1917 and fought on until October the following year when he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and saw out the rest of the war in a hospital north of Berlin. Adolf Hitler wrote the postcode while recovering from an injury during the First World War . Lanzhammer died in March 1918 while completing training to become a pilot at Oberschleissheim near Munich. Hitler remained terrified of going to the dentist until the day he died. His personal dentist Johannes Blaschke revealed how Hitler once insisted simple root-canal work was spread over eight days because he 'couldn't stand the pain.' Hitler also had 'terribly bad breath, abscesses and gum disease', according to Blaschke.","The postcard, dated December 21, 1916, has been authenticated .

An EF2-rated tornado – with wind speeds of between 111 and 135mph – struck Damian Barnes’ home near Collins, Covington County, in the early hours of Monday morning. The tornado completely destroyed it and Barnes, despite being injured, managed to pull his girlfriend and two children from the wreckage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flattened: Damian Barnes' mobile home in Mississippi was thrown 20 feet and destroyed during a tornado that struck the area on Monday . He told Hattiesburgamerican.com: ‘My left arm got broken.

National Weather Service forecasters in North Carolina say video indicates a tornado touched down near the town of Belhaven in the eastern part of the state. Authorities say a pickup truck was lifted off the highway, injuring a man and his son. The tornado struck Covington County in Mississippi on a night of severe weather across the U.S southeast . In Pelham, just south of Birmingham, more than four inches (10 centimeters) of rain fell from 7 p.m. Sunday to 7 a.m. Monday. Police and firefighters rescued people who became trapped in flooded townhomes and a mobile home park. Dozens of cars had water up to their roofs. Rescue workers wearing life jackets waded through muddy water nearly to their chests to reach stranded residents. Hundreds of people in mobile homes on higher ground were isolated because water covered the only entrance to the complex. Pelham Fire Battalion Chief Mike Knight said people realized at daybreak that the water, seven feet (2.1 meters) deep in some places, was surrounding their homes. Some people had to abandon cars after driving into areas where the flood water was deeper than expected.

Extreme weather: Firefighters rescue a family from their house, surrounded by floodwaters, in a mobile home park in Pelham, Alabama . A development of townhomes along a creek in Pelham also flooded, with some units getting four to five feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) of water. Some residents went to their second floors to wait for the water to recede, while others evacuated. Shannon Martin said she had water up to the top of her toilet bowl in her first floor. She and a friend waded through flooded streets to get inside and floated out some of her belongings in a cooler. Martin, a renter, said she had insurance to cover her belongings, but doesn't know where she will live. ‘I just moved here,’ she said. At an apartment complex in the suburb of Homewood, rescue crews used a boat to help several residents and pets get out of flooded first-floor units. Mudslides toppled trees and blocked several roads. Some roads in Birmingham became impassable due to flood waters and fallen trees, and schools delayed opening in many areas of central Alabama due to the heavy rains. At one point, Birmingham-based Alabama Power Co. reported 11,000 homes and businesses without electricity. That was cut to about 4,500 Monday afternoon. In Augusta, Georgia, where the Master's golf tournament is being held this week, practice round play was halted Monday two hours after it began.

"By . Damien Gayle . The U.S. is being flooded with cheap heroin from Mexico as farmers in the country find that their traditional cannabis crop is no longer as profitable north of the border. Mexican campesinos are turning away from growing marijuana after decriminalisation of the drug in many American states has led to steep falls in its wholesale price. Instead they are filling their fields with opium poppies, a crop more commonly associated with Asia, which offers them a far greater return on their efforts. Scroll down for video . A Mexican Federal Judicial policeman destroys opium poppies with a pen knife on a clandestine plantation high in the Guerrero Sierra during a routine anti-drug operation in this file photo . It comes as demand in the U.S. for . hard drugs increases, spurred by a crackdown on prescription painkiller . abuse which has made pills such as OxyContin more difficult to obtain. Rodrigo Silla, 50, a . lifelong marijuana farmer from Mexico's Sinoloa state, told the . Washington Post that growing the pungent-smelling herb was simply 'not . worth it any more.' 'I wish the Americans would stop with this legalisation,' he said. For decades a scourge of the back alleys of American life, heroin is once again spreading across the country. The . death of the Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in February only underscored a . problem many American communities were already facing, the rising use of . - and deaths from - heroin. Once . mainly a city phenomenon, the drug has spread - gripping postcard . villages in Vermont, middle-class enclaves outside Chicago and other . places. Cocaine, . painkillers and tranquillizers are all used more than heroin, and the . latest federal overdose statistics show that in 2010 the vast majority . of drug overdose deaths involved pharmaceuticals, with heroin accounting . for less than 10 per cent. A Mexican peasant harvests opium paste from a poppy: The plummeting price of the heroin is down to a huge hike in production in Mexico, now America's biggest source of the drug, says the Drug Enforcement Agency . But . heroin's escalation is troubling. Last month, U.S. Attorney General . Eric Holder called the 45 per cent increase in heroin overdose deaths . between 2006 and 2010 an 'urgent and growing public health crisis.' In . 2007, there were an estimated 373,000 heroin users in the U.S. By 2012, . the number was 669,000, with the greatest increases among those 18 to . 25. First-time users nearly doubled in a six-year period ending in 2012, from 90,000 to 156,000. Experts . claim that many users turned to heroin after a crackdown made . prescription drug painkillers such as OxyContin harder to find and more . costly. It can kill when the drug is extremely pure or laced with other powerful narcotics. That, coupled with a low tolerance once people start using again after . treatment, is catching addicts off guard. In . the Cleveland area, heroin-related overdoses killed 195 people last . year, shattering the previous record. Some Ohio police chiefs say heroin . is easier for kids to get than beer. In . Vermont, the governor devoted his entire State of the State speech this . year to heroin, which threatens to overwhelm courts with related crime. And this month, . Massachusetts' governor declared a public health emergency over heroin . and opiate abuse, directing that first responders be equipped with an . overdose antidote. On the rise: A drug addict prepares a needle to inject himself with heroin in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles . Overall, . use of the drug is believed to have increased 79 per cent . between 2007 and 2012, according to federal data cited by the Washington . Post. It claims . that high-grade heroin is available across rural America for as little . as $4 a hit, well undercutting the cost of prescription drugs that have . long been the drug of choice in such areas. That . plummeting price, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, is . down to a huge hike in heroin production in Mexico, now America's . biggest source of the drug. U.S. officials seized a record 2,162kg of heroin along the Mexican border last year, up from a mere 367kg in 2007. Much . of that is grown in Sinaloa, a state which has for decades been a giant . drug farm and whose home-grown Sinaloa Cartel is now believed to . control as much as half of the North American heroin market. A drug addict injects three bags of quality heroin, one after the other in Chicago, Illinois: Overall, use of the drug in the use is believed to have increased 79 per cent between 2007 and 2012, according to federal data . The . surge in heroin hitting the U.S. market has been blamed at least partly . on the fall in the profits available from the wholesale production of . cannabis. With new liberal . legal regimes in 20 U.S. states and the District of Columbia more of . domestic demand is being filled with strong, hydroponic varieties grown . in converted warehouses. That . has led to a collapse in the price Mexican growers can charge for their . marijuana crops, falling from $100 a kilo to less than $25 in the past . five years. Police in East Texas have arrested a woman after she called them to complain about the quality of the marijuana she had bought from a dealer. Lufkin police Sergeant David Casper said yesterday that an officer went to the home of 37-year-old Evelyn Hamilton, above right, to hear her complaint that the dealer refused to return her money after she objected that the drug was substandard. Casper says she pulled the small amount of marijuana from her bra when the officer asked if she still had it. She was arrested Friday on a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. Hamilton said Monday that she spent $40 on 'seeds and residue.' She says she called police when she got no satisfaction from the dealer's family. Mexico . researcher David Shirk, of the University of California at San Diego, . told the Post that this collapse in price was leading Mexico's . traditional marijuana farmers to diversify. 'The . wave of opium poppies we’re seeing is at least partially driven by . changes we’re making in marijuana drug policy,' he added. The . going rate for a kilogram of raw opium sap in the Sierra Madre is . $1,500 - nearly double its 2012 price - growers told the Washington . Post. Farmers can produce nearly eight kilos of that sap per acre, given . favourable weather, enough for a kilo of heroin that can reach a . wholesale price in the U.S. of a staggering $80,000. But what's good for the farmers is proving catastrophic for addicts in the U.S. On . a beautiful Sunday last October, Detective Dan Douglas stood in a . suburban Minnesota home and looked down at a lifeless 20-year-old - a . needle mark in the man's arm, a syringe in his pocket. Fresh . out of treatment, this man was Douglas' second heroin overdose that . day. 'You just drive away and go, 'Well, here we go again,'' the veteran . cop told the Associated Press. In . Butler County, Ohio, responding to heroin overdose calls is so common . that the EMS coordinator likens it to 'coming in and eating breakfast - . you just kind of expect it to occur.' A local rehab facility has a . six-month wait. One school . recently referred an 11-year-old boy. 'There are so many residual . effects,' the sheriff there says. 'And we're all paying for it.' Even for those growing it, like Rodrigo Silla, the new crop is fraught with danger. Blooming . radiant purple, red and white, the poppies are easily spotted from the . air. Last month the Mexican army roared in jeeps into his farm, seized . his crop and destroyed his equipment. Nevertheless, he adds: 'There’s no other way to make a living here.'","Use of heroin in the U.S. increased 79 per cent between 2007 and 2012 .

"By . Ashley Collman . It's not easy being ridiculously good looking. Just ask Rob Lowe. The 50-year-old actor made some controversial comments about how tough his career has been because of his attractiveness, while promoting his new memoir 'Love Life' in a New York Times interview. In the book, Lowe expresses preference for roles that transform his looks - like playing a plastic surgeon with a permanently surprised look on his face in Behind the Candelabra. 'There’s this unbelievable bias and . prejudice against quote-unquote good-looking people, that they can’t be . in pain or they can’t have rough lives or be deep or interesting,' Lowe told the Times. Tough luck: Actor Rob Lowe says he was too good looking in the 80s to get the roles he really wanted. Pictured on the left in 1983's The Outsiders, which turned him into a teen heart-throb. Now that his face has aged, he's able to tackle more meaty roles like the plastic surgeon in Behind the Candelabra . It wasn't until recently, Lowe confessed, that his looks tamed enough for him to get the roles he really wanted. 'They can’t be any of the things that you long to play as an actor. I’m getting to play those parts now and loving it. When I was a teen idol, I was so goddamn pretty I wouldn’t have taken myself seriously,' the actor added. When asked why people found his comedic . roles on TV shows 'Parks and Recreation' and 'Californication' surprising, Lowe said: 'Again, there's a historical bias that good-looking people are not funny'. Funny guy: Lowe says people found his comedic role on Parks and Rec surprising because of his looks. Above, another still from The Outsiders . Next steps: Lowe will next star in 'Sex Tape', a movie about a couple trying to get back copies of a personal video they accidentally sent to their friends (still on the left). His new memoir 'Love Life' is available for purchase on Amazon now (right) Lowe first became a heart-throb in 1983 with his role in The Outsiders. He went on to star in several 80s coming-of-age films like St Elmo's Fire and Oxford Blues, becoming part of the infamous 'Brat Pack'. However, his popularity with females came as a shock for a young Lowe, who always considered himself brainy. 'My deep dark secret is that I was a nerd in school,' he said. 'I liked the theater. I liked to study. I wasn't very goot at sports. It took being famous to make me cool, which, by the way, I never forget.' Lowe's will next star in 'Sex Tape', which follows a couple played by Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal as they try to get back a personal film they accidentally sent to all of their friends. Lowe himself is no stranger to the plot, having been the star of his own sex-tape scandal.","The 50-year-old actor says it took years for him to get the roles he wanted because he was too attractive .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . Kevin Sutherland has been accused of knowingly peddling phony examples of some of Damien Hirsts's signature themes . Prosecutors have accused a Miami pastor of knowingly peddling phony examples of some of artist Damien Hirst's signature themes. But Kevin Sutherland's defence claims he was just an art-market novice who couldn't read red flags about the pieces' authenticity. Jury deliberations were due to resume today in Sutherland's attempted grand larceny trial following the summing up yesterday. The case is one in a series of prosecutions surrounding counterfeit works by Turner Prize-winner Hirst. Sutherland, 46, leads the nondenominational, 200-members Mosaic Miami Church. According to his lawyer, he began dealing in cowboy-related art in 2010 and soon began buying Hirsts, or what appeared to be Hirsts. Part of a group dubbed the Young British Artists in the 1990s, Hirst is known partly for dotted, pharmaceutical-themed 'spot' paintings and circular, sometimes kaleidoscopic 'spin' paintings. Sutherland tried last year to sell two counterfeit spin paintings and three bogus spot prints for $185,000 to an undercover officer posing as a 'buyer', though Sotheby's auction house had told the pastor the authenticity of one of the paintings was in question, the Manhattan district attorney's office says. When the undercover officer asked about potential problems with the artworks, Sutherland said he wasn't aware of any issues, authorities said. Sutherland's defence claims he was just an art-market novice who couldn't read red flags about the pieces' authenticity. Pictured is the front and back of a counterfeit Damien Hirst spin painting in a photo provided by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office . 'He had choices he could have made that . would have brought him to a very, very different place,' Assistant . District Attorney Rachel Hochhauser said in a closing argument Monday. But Sutherland said Sotheby's never clearly told him the artworks were fake. He said he didn't ask Hirst's studio for clarification, as Sotheby's suggested, because the authentication process was pricey and because he believed he had an authenticity guarantee from the man who'd sold him the works — an admitted art scammer who testified against him. 'Kevin Sutherland believed the art to be real,' his lawyer, Sanford 'Sam' Talkin, said in his summation. British artist Damien Hirst is known partly for dotted, pharmaceutical-themed 'spot' paintings and circular, sometimes kaleidoscopic 'spin' paintings . The case against Sutherland grew from a Manhattan DA's office investigation that also ensnared three other men. The Laguna Beach, California, gallery owner accused of selling Sutherland the fakes, Vincent Lopreto — who had already served prison time in another phony-Hirst case — and business partner Ronald Bell pleaded guilty to charges including identity theft. They are awaiting sentencing. Richard Silver, a part-time art dealer who said he unwittingly bought phony Hirst prints from Lopreto but then doctored appraisals to resell them, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor forgery charges, in exchange for a 60-day jail sentence.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Skinnygirl millionaire and reality star Bethenny Frankel has denied she is dating billionaire Warren Lichtenstein after being named as his 'girlfriend' in a bitter legal suit. The 43-year-old mom-of-one, who is currently going through her own difficult divorce from husband Jason Hoppy, was named in court papers filed by Mr Lichtenstein's ex-girlfriend Annabelle Bond. Miss Bond, who has a six-year-old daughter called Isabella with Mr Lichtenstein, named the former Real Housewives of New York star as her former lover's girlfriend while suing him for $570,110.05 in child support. Bethenny and Mr Lichtenstein were pictured together on vacation in St Tropez in the South of France last July. However, today a source told MailOnline that Bethenny is still dating her financier toyboy Michael Cerussi - and is 'very happy'. Dragged in: Bethenny Frankel - seen on Saturday in New York with her daughter Bryn - has found herself at the center of a legal suit between her close friend Warren Lichtenstein and his ex-lover and the mother of his daughter, Annabelle Bond . At war: Billionaire Warren Lichtenstein and his ex lover and mother of his daughter, British adventurer Annabelle Bond, who has filed suit calling him a 'deadbeat dad' and naming Bethenny Frankel as his 'girlfriend' The source added: 'Bethenny and Warren have been friends and ONLY friends for many, many years.' According to the New York Post, the suit says Warren, who runs the $4 billion hedge fund Steel Partners, is 'traveling the world on private jets, expanding his . huge compound in Aspen . . . living in a beachfront mansion in . [California], and dating [former “Real Housewives” star and talk-show . host] Bethany (sic) Frankel.' But that Mr Lichtenstein, 'claims that he is . too broke to support his only daughter.' British adventurer and heiress Miss Bond, who is the daughter of former Vodafone and HSBC chairman . Sir John Bond, has conquered Everest and was the first woman to complete the Seven Summits by climbing the highest peak on every continent in record time. She filed the suit on March 28 in New York's Supreme Court claiming that Mr Lichtenstein is a 'deadbeat father' who owes her $570,110.05 in child support, while . living an 'extravagant playboy lifestyle.' The couple split in April 2007 when Miss Bond was five months pregnant, and following Isabella's birth, she told the Daily Mail: 'I am happy. He is happy. We're both thrilled about the baby, but we are no longer together. No one else is involved.' Miss Bond’s child support ruling was made in . Hong Kong, where she lives and is dating a Tampa Bay Rays owner, Andrew . Cader. Meanwhile, Mr Lichenstein last year accused Miss Bond in his own legal suit against Mr Cader of pursuing the massive child support . settlement against him to, “improve upon her own already extraordinary . life of leisure, luxury, privilege and modest fame.” He alleged Mr . Cader was conspiring to defraud him by giving Miss Bond millions in loans to . inflate her child support needs, but later withdrew the . suit. Bethenny and Mr Lichtenstein were first linked together in January 2013 - and Bethenny was said to have moved into his sprawling Upper East side home with her daughter Bryn. However, a friend said at the time there was NO romance between the pair, adding: 'Bethenny and Warren have been great friends for more than 20 years and he has really been a support system during this sad time. Happy together: Sources tell MailOnline that Bethenny Frankel is still happily dating Michael Cerussi. The pair are pictured together in Miami, where they enjoyed a New Year break . Cosy: Skinnygirl founder Bethenny Frankel has moved out of her $5 million Tribeca apartment - where her ex-husband Jason Hoppy still lives - as her relationship with Michael Cerussi grows . 'Bethenny stayed at Warren's apartment . one night earlier this month with her daughter Bryn as he was out of . town, so  that she and Bryn could have some girl time. However, as her romance with Michael 'Mac' Cerussi, who at 34 is nine years her junior, heating up, Bethenny HAS moved into a rented apartment while her ex husband stays in their $5 million Tribeca home during the divorce. Bethenny and Michael, the son of a prominent New York lawyer, were frolicking on the beach on a sun-soaked New Year's Eve trip to Miami. The couple were seen sharing a tender kiss on New Year’s Eve at the Mondrian Hotel in South Beach in Miami. A source told E! 'The reason Bethenny did it is that Jason is still living at the original home. 'On the weekends, his parents come and sleep on the sofas. It's incredibly uncomfortable for Bethenny and it gives her and Bryn no space to have one on one time.' In October, Bethenny, who is thought to have sold her Skinnygirl brand for $120 million, revealed on her talk show Bethenney that she and her ex were still living under the same roof. The brunette filed for divorce from Jason in January 2013 after two years of marriage, and in September, Hoppy was photographed still wearing his wedding ring, a whopping nine months after the couple announced their separation. 'Jason is still holding out on signing off on the divorce,' the source claimed.

"By . Meghan Keneally . The latest legal filing in the Bode Miller custody battle claims that the skier’s 13-month-old son had trouble recognizing his own mother because the Olympian has kept the boy away from his ex for more than a month. The custody battle between Miller and his ex girlfriend Sara McKenna over their son rages on over the boy- who is called Nate by his father and Sam by his mother. Miller and his wife Morgan Beck had custody of 'Nate' for the past five weeks and had originally agreed to allow McKenna to have custody of the boy for the whole month of April. Back in court: A New York judge ruled against Bode Miller and his wife Morgan Beck's request to extend their time with his son, who they call 'Nate', after having custody of him for the past five weeks (pictured today) Throwing claims: The California-based couple were in New York for a previously scheduled custody hearing but because his ex, the boy's mother Sara McKenna was sick it had to be pushed back by two weeks . Miller and Beck were seen walking out of the Manhattan courthouse on Monday after petitioning to change that earlier schedule. They wanted to extend their time with 'Nate' because his half sister- Miller's daughter from a previous relationship- has off from school for the week and they wanted the children to spend time together. Miller lives in California with his wife, a professional volleyball player. The last time they were in court, they were arguing over whether or not he would be able to take ‘Nate’ to Sochi with him for the winter Olympic Games- and the judge ruled in his favor that time, meaning that the boy was there when he won a bronze medal. Bronze: Miller was allowed to bring 'Nate' with him to Russia for the Sochi Games, where he came in third . Husband and wife: Miller married Beck (pictured above at Sochi in February) in October 2012 and the two lost a child in a miscarriage the following January . Trying for more time: Miller, seen here with 'Nate' earlier this winter, wanted to have more time with the boy so that he could overlap time in California with Miller's daughter's break from school . McKenna's lawyers said that the change should not be approved because 'my client has seen repercussions' of her son being away for so long already. 'Her son looked at her as if to say, ""Who exactly are you?""' McKenna's lawyer Bill Beslow told the court on Monday, according to The New York Daily News. McKenna, a former Marine and firefighter who is now a student at Columbia University in New York, had her lawyer argue that her son has been taken to 'a myriad of locations' during the past five weeks and did not need to go back on another cross-country flight. She also arranged to have her relatives visit her in New York next to spend time with 'Sam', working under the assumption that she would have custody of him for the whole month. Reunited: McKenna won custody of Sam back in November and the two are currently together in New York . The judge ruled against Miller's request to take the boy immediately, but did agree that he can take him to his home in California for a week on the 14th. The Daily News reports that Miller and Beck, who he met and married months after breaking up with McKenna, were in New York because a custody hearing was set for today but it has since been postponed until the 21st because McKenna has food poisoning. Miller's lawyer threw one final barb at the boy's biological mother saying that she was faking the illness in order to avoid today's court appearance, but her lawyer denied the claim.","Bode Miller was back in a New York court today asking for his time with his son to be extended so that the boy could spend time with his half-sister .

"By . Will Payne In Providence, Rhode Island . Hollywood blockbuster Frozen captured the hearts of millions around the globe with its touching story of two warring sisters who eventually reconcile and rediscover their deep love for one another. But few people realize the movie's theme of sisterly love has been plucked from the real life of director and screenplay writer Jennifer Lee. She based the tumultuous relationship between Snow Queen Elsa and sister Anna on the ups and downs she experienced with her own elder sibling, MailOnline can reveal today. Scroll down for video . Sister act: Frozen writer and co-director Jennifer Lee, pictured center left, was brought close to estranged sister Amy, center right, after Jennifer's 'true love' was killed in a swimming accident when she was 20 . Inspiration: Lee introduced the theme of sisterly tension and devotion between Snow Queen Elsa and Anna when she was brought on board to oversee the hit . The pair were incredibly close when they were youngsters growing up in Rhode Island, but drifted apart in their teenage years, before a terrible tragedy brought them back together when Jennifer was 20. Jennifer's college sweetheart, which her family describe as 'the love of her life' died in a tragic swimming accident, leaving Jennifer completely devastated. 'She lost the person she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with. It was incredibly hard for her and a real tragedy,' a source close to the family told MailOnline. The trauma of that event shook Jennifer, now 42, to the very core, but in her darkest hour Amy came through for her and became the rock she so desperately needed. From that moment they grew incredibly close and have remained so for more than 20 years. The parallels between Jennifer's real life experiences and the emotional journey traveled by her celebrated Disney characters are clear. Snow Queen Elsa, who possesses the magical ability to create ice and snow accidentally injuries her sister when they are younger. The pair grow apart and when Anna tries to reach out to Elsa when they are older the Snow Queen accidentally strikes her in the heart with her powers, freezing it. She learns it can only be thawed by an act of true love, which comes later in the film when Anna attempts to lay down her life for her sister, but survives. That act of love thaws her frozen heart, the pair reconcile and their relationship is stronger than ever. Speaking about the life-changing event that reunited her with her sister in a podcast recorded earlier this year the divorced mother-of-one explained: 'I have an older sister. And she was a big inspiration for Elsa for me, because I think there was a lot of the shutting out. Tearful: Lee, who took Amy to see the film pick up two Oscars, said: 'I had gone through something very tragic . and lost someone, and it was like she looked at me as a human being, an . adult, and I became real again to her' 'And like you said, it’s not that contrived. It happens even if it’s not for a big reason. It really does happen. And I remember a moment, too. 'We didn’t become close until I was in my twenties. And it was almost like one day, and I had gone through something very tragic and lost someone, and it was like she looked at me as a human being, an adult, and I became real again to her. 'It’s like I’d lost her, and then all of a sudden we kind of arrived at the same place together. And then from that moment on she was like my champion. 'She was always there for me. And it was — that scene, having to like lose each other and then rediscover each other as adults, that was a big part of my life.' Jennifer became involved in the film - which lat week became Disney's biggest grossing animated movie of all time four months after the movie was initially commissioned. Then there were no plans to center the story on two sisters. Originally it was going to be based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale The Snow Queen, which revolved around a little boy and a little girl and a fight between good and evil. Jennifer was still wrapping up production of another film, Wreck-it Ralph at the time, but she was asked to sit in on the development of Frozen to give notes and feedback. After showing an obvious passion for the project, she was brought in as a co-director with Chris Buck and completely rewrote the script, introducing Elsa and Anna. That decision was hugely influenced by her sister, something Jennifer recognized in spectacular fashion when she invited 45-year-old school teacher Amy to accompany her to the Oscars as her plus one. The pair walked the red carpet together and Amy looked on as her little sister's film won awards for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song, Let it Go. True love: Lee credits the death of her true love when she was at college as being the inspiration for her wanting to 'tell her own stories'. Little is known of the incident as she wants to keep it private . Proud father: Jennifer and Amy's dad, Sav Rebecchi, has even spoken of the parallels on his Facebook page . Writing about the touching moment on Facebook, their father Sav Rebecchi, 67, wrote: 'Just found out that my oldest daughter who is an English Teacher at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, NY will not be in class on March 3rd because... she is going to be the ""Plus One"" for her little sister at the Academy Awards on March 2nd. 'Jen credits her inspiration for the Elsa Character in Frozen to her sister and thought if she could have only one guest at the table... it had to be her. 'They will both be walking the Red Carpet together and just the thought of that and the road that brought them there makes it difficult to hold back the tears and... the unrelenting gushing that you all are putting up with. Thanks.' Mr Rebecchi from Jamestown, Rhode Island, a few miles from where the girls grew up in the East Providence area, reiterated this in an interview with his local paper the Newport Daily News in February. He said: 'It almost brought to me tears when Jenny called her sister Amy and told her there is no one else she wants to walk the red carpet with at the Academy Awards except her.' Talking about Jennifer's decision to base the story on the love of two sisters, he added: 'That is the moment the film turned into something incredible and wonderful. The film is about the love of two siblings and their willingness to make sacrifices for each other.' Our revelation helps to explain the inspiration behind Frozen, but the catalyst for Jennifer and Amy's reconciliation is still shrouded in mystery. Despite his profound effect on her life, the identity of Jennifer's boyfriend remains hidden and she is apparently keen to keep it that way. It is believed the lovers met at New Hampshire University where Jennifer graduated with a degree in creative writing. Amy also attended the college. What is completely clear is that his tragic and untimely death had a resounding and lasting affect on the life of the 20-year-old student, who went on to such incredibly success. Her Wikipedia page reads: 'After the loss of a dear person at age 20, she wanted to tell her own stories'. Frozen is officially the most popular animated film of all time. It has grossed over a billion dollars worldwide and scooped a number of awards. Aside from its incredible Oscars success, the movie won a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, five Annie Awards and two Critics' Choice Awards.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Bad blood? Millionaire founder of the Carrabba's restaurant chain Damian Mandola (pictured) was arrested twice in three days for allegedly breaking into a Texas winery he once co-owned . A millionaire restauranteur was arrested twice last week on charges he drove a golf cart to a Texas winery he once co-owned to settle a score by stealing a bottle of wine and taunting employees. Carrabba's Restaurants co-founder Damian Mandola was photographed Saturday carrying a hammer that Duchman Family Winery staff say he used to damage property and threaten them physically. Just two days before, cops booked and released the 61-year-old for driving his golf cart erratically before allegedly breaking into the winery to steal his former partner's stock. Mandola, who founded the national . Carrabba's chain with his nephew, was charged with burglary for the . incident on Thursday, for which police picked him up near his Trattoria . Lisina restaurant, which is adjacent to the Driftwood, Texas winery. Mandola . removed his name from the award-winning winery after a falling out with . the Duchman family in 2010 that has apparently left some lingering bad . blood. Whatever the reason for this most recent emotional flareup, Mandola was not satisfied with his first visit to the winery. He posted $5,000 bond and was released from the Hays county Jail on Thursday. On Saturday, a staff member who spoke to the Houston Press on the condition of anonymity said he came back. The worker said he noticed a damaged sign before he saw Mandola coming towards him with a hammer and a knife. Family feud: Mandola is charged with breaking into the Duchman Family Winery, which he once co-owned but removed his name from after a falling out with the Duchmans in 2010 . Tough times? The chain he co-founded with his nephew now has hundreds of locations across America. Nonetheless, he's accused of breaking into the Duchman Family Winery to steal a bottle of wine . 'I . headed outside,' said the employee 'and upon reaching the corner of the . building I heard a tire burst, which was the tire of my Toyota Tacoma. As I rounded the corner I witnessed Damian smash the back window of my . truck.' The employee . told police Mandola brandished his 'deadly weapons' at him and called . him 'a few choice names' before speeding away on his golf cart. Mandola . reappeared later that day while a wedding was being held at the winery, . when the employee said he continued to taunt him. Mandola was subsequently arrested and has since made $15,000 bail.","Damian Mandola was arrested April 3 and April 5 after visits to a Driftwood, Texas winery he once co-owned .

"By . Darren Boyle . One of the richest Asian businessmen . in Britain and boss of an £800 million hotel chain today won his High . Court battle to deny his elderly father’s claim to a share of his family . wealth. Jasminder . Singh the 63-year-old head of the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotels group . successfully defended his 87-year-old father Bal Mohinder Singh’s claim . that under Sikh tradition he was entitled to a third of the family . wealth. Father and . son still live in the same seven-bedroom country house Tetworth Hall . near Ascot racecourse, Berkshire, with their families. Bal Mohinder Singh, photographed alongside a carer in central London told the High Court his case was not about money but because his son Jasminder had abandoned his Sikh traditions . Jasminder Singh (above) claimed that he did not have a particularly religious upbringing and disputed his father's claim that he was entitled to a one-third share of the hotel empire . Despite living together in the same house, Mr Singh sought a one-third share of the family business. The father who is suffering from ill health and gave his evidence from a . hotel claimed that family property is covered by a constructive trust. His counsel John McDonnell QC told the judge Sir William Blackburne: 'The father is not claiming a share of any of Jasminder’s wealth . acquired by his own efforts. It is our claim that Jasminder’s wealth is . the family’s wealth. The only cash put into the family’s empire is that . put in by the father in the 70s.' Jasminder is said to be worth around £415 million. But the court claim was said to be worth about £50m. But the father has said the claim is not about the money but about . tradition and his son’s failure to abide by the 'Mitakshara' system from . Sikh and Hindu traditions which implies a sharing of family wealth. Mr Singh, pictured above with a carer, told a special sitting of the High Court that he his friends will be 'shocked' that his son is claiming credit for the family's success . The judge was asked to decide as a preliminary issue, if the family . property is subject to any constructive trust under English law, and if . so what the terms of such a trust were. If he decided that such a trust was binding there would be another . trial to decide how much is due, if agreement cannot be reached. But in a long written judgment the judge on what he described as a 'most unusual' case, dismissed the father’s claim. He added: 'Although I have rejected father’s claim, it by no means . follows that I regard him or mother as having in any way acted . dishonestly in making it . On the contrary , they struck me as having . advanced this claim in all good faith believing it to be well founded. 'The root of the difference between them was in their upbringings with . the father being raised in rural British India and the mother in Kenya. But Jasminder completing his education in the UK and taking “little . interest in the religious side of Sikhism.' Father . and son turned a small family post office business in Stamford Hill, . North London back in 1973 into the multi million hotel group. His . son helped in the business and after he qualified as an accountant they . moved into hotels, buying a rundown B&B in Kensington, West London, . which they refurbished and sold on at a profit. They . gradually traded up and bought a string of upmarket hotels, building up . a multi million pound group which includes the Vanderbilt and the Savoy . Court in central London. But the father claimed his son forced him to retire in 2010 and now . refuses to follow tradition by sharing the family wealth. The father lives at Tetworth Hall with his 81-year-old wife and Jasminder’s mother Satwant who is backing his claim. Jasminder also lives there with his wife Amrit and their four children. In a witness statement in the court proceedings his father said: 'Both I . and his mother are deeply ashamed that Jasminder should publicly . renounce his cultural heritage and the mutual rights and obligations in . which he was brought up. 'That . family system based on custom and religious teaching is widely . practised and universally understood by Hindus and Sikhs in India today . just as it was in British India where I was brought up. 'It . is also widely practised and universally understood in the Sikh and . Hindu communities overseas including East Africa and the UK. 'My . life has been devoted to winning respect for myself and family in those . communities and the respect which we have earned as a family has been . the basis for the success of our business in this country. Jasminder and his wife Amrit continue to live with his parents despite the dispute . 'For . Jasminder to deny that and claim all the credit and ownership for . himself will be shocking to wide sections of those communities . particularly our family friends - that is why his mother and I are so . ashamed.' But Jasminder . claimed in evidence that he did not have a particularly religious . upbringing, that neither of his parents regarded the family to be living . under an agreement to share property nor was there any such agreement. The . judge commented: 'If nothing else this litigation has highlighted the . extraordinary enterprise that has enabled the Singh family , in the . space of just two generations, to rise from obscurity and very modest . circumstances in what was then rural British India, overcome all manner . of difficulties, come eventually to this country and make a fortune for . itself. 'I . dare say it is not untypical of many such families but there can be few . whose rise has been quite so meteoric. The family’s story as it . unfolded in the course of this trial has a heroic quality to it. It has . made it all the more painful to have to listen to the tragic differences . that now divide its members.'The court was forced to travel to the May Fair Hotel off Piccadilly - which is owned by the family - to hear evidence from Bal Mohinder Singh. He was considered too frail to travel to the Royal Courts of Justice near Fleet Street. The Singh family said they would cover the costs of the special hearing so as not to cost the taxpayer any money. The court heard that Bal Mohinder Singh had grown up in rural British India while his wife was  from Kenya. His son Jasminder went to Christian mission schools in Kenya and completed his education in the UK. Jasminder Singh photographed outside the Savoy Court Hotel in the 1980s .

"By . David Kent . Pep Guardiola insists Bayern Munich have not practised penalties ahead of Wednesday night's return leg against Manchester United. The Champions League last-eight tie is finely poised at 1-1 after Bastian Schweinsteiger cancelled out Nemanja Vidic's header at Old Trafford last week. A repeat result at the Allianz Arena would see the tie head to penalties. But on the topic of spot-kicks, Guardiola, who was speaking at his pre-match press conference, claimed his side had not prepared for such a scenario.

The Bayern Munich manager, who was saw his team's 53-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga come to an end on Saturday after a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg, expects United to player on the break. 'I think United will be again waiting for us at the back. They will be waiting deep, deep in their own half,' Guardiola said. 'English teams defend and then wait for the quick break. David Moyes also has eight, nine players at the back. They are waiting for mistakes, set pieces and breaks. 'That is why we have to be disciplined. We are playing at home and that is important and we know exactly what to do to attack well.'

He is going to play, I bet you a big big glass of beer.' Guardiola described Rooney as 'a big player, one of the best I have seen in my career.'

"By . Joel Christie . What started as a random purchase of some vintage mugshots on eBay quickly transformed into a life-changing project for Diarmid Mogg. The Scottish man became interested in American crime stories after reading Least Wanted, a coffee table book that pulled together hundreds of mug shots, and then found about six genuine ones himself from a small town in Pennsylvania for 'a couple of pounds' online. The photos came with their respective arrest cards, dated between 1930 and 1960, and after researching each of the recorded crimes, he realized they told a wonderful story of New Castle, a bygone industrial boom town near the Ohio border, The Appendix reported. Snapshot: A Scottish man has used old mugshots that he obtained from all over the world that were all taken in the U.S. town of New Castle to tell a history of the place. This shot, taken on May 28, 1938, is of John Zuzow, who was jailed for stealing a car, burgling a store, getting into a fight in a bar and resisting arrest . Sophia Lyshooka was sixteen-years-old and married when she was admitted to hospital in 1942. Four years later, at the age of 20, she was arrested for the crime of abduction. Those two facts, and whatever can be discerned in this photograph, are all that is known of her, taken February 1946 . Vincent DeLillo was charged with pick pocketing 'citizens incapacitated by liquor' on November 17, 1937 . Lee Render was nicknamed 'Jack the Peeper' after being caught looking into someone's window on September 24, 1945 . Mogg set out to source more of these law enforcement portraits from the same town and bring together as many as he could. To his surprise he found them scattered all over the world. 'I always asked the seller how they had originally come by the pictures,' Mogg said. 'The usual answer was that theyâ€™d bought them from other collectors. 'No . one knew for sure how the photographs had first ended up for sale, but I . gradually worked out that, sometime in the 1990s, the police department . had cleared out its files and thrown hundreds- maybe thousands - of old . photographs in the trash. 'A few hundred images were surreptitiously . saved from destruction by a police officer nearing retirement.' Mogg then reconstructed the stories behind the pictures, mostly from old copies of the local paper, the New Castle News. He has spent years putting all these stories together, and has visited the town a few times, documenting everything in a website he has called Small Town Noir. 'The men and women in these pictures saw things that none of us will ever . see,' he said. 'All that we can do is look clearly at their faces, listen . carefully to their stories and let them tell us what they can about . their world, and what life was like in that long-gone town.' New Castle sits midway between Lake Erie and Pittsburgh, over by the Ohio border, and today has a population of 23,000 .

"By . Wills Robinson . Convicted: Angela Douglas, 49, was jailed for life after smothering her mother with a pillow when she went to take her tea and biscuits . A mother-of-two who cooked Sunday lunch for her family before going upstairs to murder her own mother was jailed for life yesterday. Angela Douglas had downed two-and-a-half bottles of wine when she smothered 73 year-old Anne Matthews with a pillow in Plymouth, Devon. The 49-year-old claimed she was acting ‘out of love’ after watching her elderly mother struggle with emphysema. But a court heard the pensioner, a former smoker who weighed less than five stone, was not terminally ill. Douglas, a former nursery nurse, admitted killing her but denied murder and claimed a stress-related illness meant she was not in control of her own actions. But a judge at Plymouth Crown Court told her she would be behind bars for at least 12 years after jurors found her guilty of murder in less than an hour. Judge Graham Cottle said alcohol 'was a major factor' in Douglas' decision to kill her mother, and was not a result of mental illness. The court heard how Douglas and her partner Shane had visited her mother and father David, 72, last April. She cooked the family Sunday lunch, drank wine and took her mother a cup of tea and biscuits in bed. Her father then went upstairs and found her kneeling and crying over her unconscious mother. An ambulance was called but, when paramedics entered her bedroom, Douglas told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything, she’s been through enough.' The medics also noted that Douglas was drunk and slurring her words. Further tests found she was heavily intoxicated. During the trial the jury was told that no one had heard Anne Matthews ever speak about euthanasia. Her husband David told the court she was a Catholic lady and would not have spoken of ending her life in that way. Judge Cottle added: 'There was no doubt that she was in failing health. Douglas, pictured arriving at an earlier court hearing, denied murdering her mother, saying she did it 'out of love' 'Her health had significantly deteriorated in the months or so before she died. 'Of much greater significance in the context of what happened later you were drinking and drinking heavily. 'Your were seriously under the influence of drink at the time you killed your mother, a factor which is significant in your decision to do what you did.' Judge Cottle said he had 'no doubt' Douglas was overwhelmed by the sight of her mum’s suffering and that her decision was spontaneous and not premeditated. But he told her: 'The fact that her lifespan was in any view short did not make her life any less precious. 'It was a life protected by the law and you took the selfish decision to end it. 'Your genuine remorse will live with you until the end of your days and that in itself is a very substantial punishment.' Trial: Plymouth Crown Court heard that, even though Mrs Matthews weighed less than five stone, she was not terminally ill . Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC said Mrs. Matthews, who had two other daughters, had been battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was released from hospital a couple of weeks before her death before being visited at home by a social worker and an occupational therapist. He said Douglas confessed to her partner that she had put a pillow over her mum’s face and killed her. Douglas, a shop worker, called the police herself within hours of the incident and was arrested. When questioned she told them she killed her mother 'out of love' because she didn’t want to see her suffer. She told them: 'I tried to kill my mother. I smothered her with a pillow. I love my mum, I can’t stand to see her like that.' Psychiatrist Dr Michael Alcock told the court that Douglas, of Plymouth, Devon, was suffering from a recognised mental disorder called 'adjustment disorder' when she 'snapped' and killed her mother. However a second expert, consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr John Sandford, said there was no evidence to suggest she was suffering from the stress-related medical condition. As Douglas was taken away to begin her sentence - gently supported on each side by court security - one of her sons cried out from the public gallery 'love you mum'.","Angela Douglas, 49, smothered 73-year-old Anne Matthews with a pillow .

He is devastated.’ Hari, . who attends Manchester Grammar School, was taken to hospital with . hypothermia while the 14-year-old was treated at the scene for cuts and . bruising. A third woman, who was part of their group, was saved by hotel workers and fishermen in Sunday evening’s tragedy. Victim: Dr Ramalingam (pictured) registered as a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology in November 2009, according to the General Medical Council . Rocky: The group got into difficulties off the resort of Playa Paraiso in the south west of the island . Adam . Cramer, a 49-year-old British father of three, rescued the girl. ‘She . told me I had saved her life,’ he said last night. ‘As I got her out on . to the rocks I could see that they had pulled a body from the water. ‘What . they had been doing was standing on the rocks looking at the waves . crashing in. 'Unfortunately one of those waves was so big it crashed in . and swept them out to sea. 'The girl I rescued wasn’t even in swimwear, . she was in shorts and a T-shirt.’ Dr Ramalingam lived in an £800,000 . house in upmarket Bowdon in Greater Manchester and worked at the Royal . Oldham Hospital women and children’s unit. Rescue: Tourists, hotel workers and local fishermen dived into the water and were able to save the lives of both children and one of the women . Neighbour Colin Skelton, . 79, said: ‘It’s a terrible shock. They are a lovely family and she was a . great mother doting on her son. ‘She was very hard-working and was coming and going at all hours. Her son Hari is very bright and bubbly.’ The . Indian-born obstetrician suffered tragedy seven years ago when her . first husband, Dr Kannan Palaniswamy, was killed in a car crash near the . Dundee hospital they both worked at. Dr Ramalingam’s close friend and former neighbour Graham Meade, 62, said: ‘She was quite simply a lovely woman. ‘Her . parents and brother, who is also a doctor, would visit from India and . we all knew each other because our street was a new-build development . and everyone was very close. Location: All of those involved in the tragedy are believed to have been staying at Playa Paraiso in south west Tenerife. The resort is about five miles west of the popular Playa de las Americas complex . 'She suffered tragedy in losing her first husband and for this to happen is just unbelievable. ‘My thoughts are with her son and her immediate family. ‘She moved away from Dundee to work in Cheshire as a fresh start and for this to happen now is just heart-breaking.’ Dr . Ravikumar’s husband Chinnusamy is a consultant in diabetes and . endocrinology for the United Lincolnshire Hospitals trust. The couple . were based in the small village of Reepham five miles north of Lincoln. A . family friend issued a statement saying the GP was the loving mother of . two young girls. ‘We are devastated by this shocking news,’ it said. ‘Barathi will be sorely missed by her family, friends, colleagues and . patients.’ The deaths were being investigated by local police and the Guardia Civil. Effort: A spokesman for the local emergency services said a rescue helicopter had been mobilised along with two ambulances, coastguards and firefighters had been called to the beach . Dr Ramalingam was a consultant obstetrician who worked across several hospitals in the Pennine Acute Hospital Trust catchment area - including Royal Oldham Hospital (pictured) and North Manchester General .","Dr Barathi Ravikumar, 39, and Dr Uma Ramalingam, 42, died on Monday .

"By . Mark Duell . Evidence: Glenis Freeman told police she tried to distract the animal from her husband . A widow described a fatal attack on her husband by a bull as a ‘complete and utter nightmare’, a court has heard. Glenis Freeman, then 67, told police she tried to distract the animal from her husband Roger when it attacked him as they walked on a public footpath running across Underhill Farm in Stanford-on-Soar, in November 2010. Mr Freeman, 63, died at the scene from multiple injuries, while his wife needed surgery for abdominal and chest injuries. Farmer Paul Waterfall, who owns the farm in Nottinghamshire, is on trial at Nottingham Crown Court charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. He denies the charge. Jurors were today played a DVD of the interview Mrs Freeman, now 70, gave to police two months after the attack once she had been discharged from hospital. Describing the attack, Mrs Freeman told the officer: ‘It was as though we were in a nightmare.’ She said her husband was floored by the bull’s attack and could not get up. ‘Roger said ""It’s got me in the groin. I can’t get up. I’m sorry Glenis, I can’t get up"".’ Mrs Freeman told the police she tried to distract the animal from her husband by putting down her rucksack but it charged at her twice. ‘One of the times it hit me in the chest’, she told the officer. ‘I don’t know how many times it charged Roger.’ She said the couple had left Nottingham that morning after seeing a show at the theatre the night before. They had planned to walk to Loughborough on November 12 and stay overnight at another hotel before walking on to their home in Glena Parva, Leicestershire. They were walking along the public footpath at around 4.30pm when the attack happened. Couple: Farmer Paul Waterfall, 39, denies manslaughter by gross negligence after Roger Freeman (pictured with his wife) died on a public path on Underhill Farm in Stanford-on-Soar in November 2010 . She told police she was walking ahead when she heard an ‘oof’ from her husband and turned around to see him on the floor with the bull over him. Mrs Freeman said she tried to distract the bull and at one point tried to get between her husband and the animal when it attacked her. ‘I felt like one time it was sitting on me. I think I was being rolled over as well. It then left me and went back to Roger.’ Describing the bull, she said: ‘He was brown. It was slobbering a lot. I think it looked at me straight in the face. Flowers: Mr Freeman, 63, died at the scene from multiple injuries, while his wife needed surgery for abdominal and chest injuries . ‘It looked as though, it wasn’t being playful, but it looked like it was wound up somehow, it looked excited. It wasn’t just a calm bull standing there... it looked excited.’ Denial: Farmer Paul Waterfall is on trial charged with manslaughter by gross negligence . Mr Freeman, who was by this point wearing just his underpants and walking boots, shouted to her to go and get help. ‘The last time Roger said . anything at all he shouted out ‘I’m sorry my baby, I can’t get us out of . this’,’ Mrs Freeman told the officer. ‘We both had said ‘This is like a . nightmare’. ‘The bull was attacking Roger. I think it was tossing him. It turned him around and that was when he shouted out. He was saying his goodbyes and I think he knew he wasn’t going to be saying...,’ Mrs Freeman then broke off. A keen walker since the age of 18, she told police she had walked through fields with cows in them many times before but said: ‘I had never been in a situation like that before - never. I was absolutely petrified.’ Mrs Freeman ran from the field and flagged down a female motorist who called for an ambulance. She was taken to Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham where she had surgery. Paramedics found Mr Freeman, a father of two, face down in the field. He was declared dead at the scene and . taken to hospital where tests confirmed he had died from multiple . injuries including fractures to his ribs and shoulders. Mrs Freeman told the police: . ‘I just keep thinking how could I have left him. How could I have walked . out of the field and left him but I know he (Roger) wanted me to go and . get help.’ Prosecutors claim Mr Waterfall, 39, . knew the bull, named Moonriver Zac Pi, posed a ‘deadly risk’ to walkers . who used the public footpath. Known . as Zac, the 19-month-old Brown Swiss bull had been involved in two . previous incidents just weeks before the alleged fatal attack on Mr . Freeman, prosecutor Andrew McGee told the jury yesterday. Mr . McGee told the court the bull had charged at three electrical engineers . who had come to carry out work on the farmland and Waterfall allegedly . told them that Zac was a ‘nasty and aggressive bull’ that ‘kept walkers . on their toes’. Underhill Farm: Prosecutors claim Mr Waterfall knew the bull, named Moonriver Zac Pi, posed a 'deadly risk' to walkers who used the public footpath . Trial: Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) was told the couple were walking along the public footpath at around 4.30pm on November 12, 2010, when the attack happened . During his opening, Mr McGee told the court: ‘As a farmer, Mr McGee had a duty of care to those who used the public footpath. Paul Waterfall had that duty of care and knew his bull posed a real risk of death to people using that path.’ 'One of the times it hit me in the chest. I don’t know how many times it charged Roger' Glenis Freeman . He added that Waterfall, of Underhill Farm, had been ‘grossly neglectful’ in failing to take any steps to prevent that risk. ‘The death was made all the more tragic because it was completely avoidable,’ Mr McGee told the jury. Waterfall was charged with gross negilgence manslaughter last year following an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive. It is alleged he breached his duty of care to the public by failing to ensure the bull was safely confined on his land. The trial continues.

The blog also tells the heartbreaking story of how they lost her 17th baby last September after a miscarriage. One . of the posts reads: 'I saw a friend in the ultrasound department who I . was talking to, we wished each other good luck and I wasn't thinking for . one minute that it would be a day that would change our lives. 'I . had my eyes fixed on it waiting to see our beautiful little baby and . the first thing I thought was 'oh wow' look how much bigger he/she is. 'We could see little arms and legs and then my heart sunk and the reality hit me that I couldn't see a heartbeat. 'I looked away at the wall praying that she was going to say oh look there's the heartbeat, but there was just silence. 'I have never felt such unbearable pain like it. 'Nothing . prepares you for those words 'there is no heartbeat' and I cannot get . the image of our baby on the screen out of my head and that will live . with me forever.' The couple, who married when they were 17 years old, had their first child in 1989, when Sue was aged just 14, and their latest in 2012 .

Vote for the Radford blog to win by going to www.theradfordfamily.co.uk. I have never felt such unbearable pain like it. I just sat staring at the wall in disbelief that our baby was gone. I have gone through so many emotions from overwhelming grief to feeling so down to thinking I never ever want to see another pregnancy test ever again because the thought would totally freak me out and emotionally I just couldn't deal with it to just so angry and wondering why? was it something I did? When I was at secondary school for the five years that I was there and also for the five years that Sue was there not once did the uniform change. We had a choice of a jumper or a blazer plus the P.E kit. So why now do schools- secondary and primary feel the need that they need to change these uniforms every couple of years. Our primary school changed theirs two years ago but to be fair we have used this school for 14 years and this was the first time that they had changed it. It’s a different story for the high school, we have just had yet another letter saying that they are going to change uniforms again, so we have gone from jumpers to blazers as they said they are smarter looking but oh no they have changed their minds again and we are now going back to jumpers with a new logo so I would imagine that the P.E kit will want changing also. This week has been fun in the Radford house, we’ve had Tillie with chicken pox, luckily she hasn’t really suffered with them and definitely hasn’t been as covered in them as what I remember last time ours got them. We haven’t had any children get chicken pox for over 8 years but it would be just before we are due to go on holiday!","Sue and Noel have nine sons and seven daughters, but receive no benefits .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Canoe fraudster John Darwin, 63, pictured leaving Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough, has only repaid £122 of the £500,000 he scammed . Canoe fraudster John Darwin has only repaid £122 of the £500,000 he cheated in an insurance scam – and has even been claiming benefits. The 63-year-old, who was jailed for six years with his wife Anne in 2008 for faking his death for a £500,000 insurance payout, has now been told he may have to repay more money. A judge had previously ordered he should repay £679,073 but the now divorced Darwin, who is claiming benefits, has only been able to hand back £122. The Crown Prosecution Service has now applied for him to repay more of the money he cheated out of insurance companies, as one of his pensions has matured. A hearing to decide the matter will be held in May. Darwin, 63, of Hartlepool, North-East England, did not speak during the brief Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough. Anne Darwin, now split from her husband, has repaid more than £500,000 under a separate Proceeds of Crime order. John Darwin was reported missing in a canoe in the North Sea in March 2002. His wife collected more than £500,000 in life insurance payouts, while he hid in their home, leaving their two sons to believe he was dead. In December 2007, Darwin walked into a London police station, claiming he had amnesia, and was reunited with his sons who were stunned to hear he was alive. His wife, who had fled with him to Panama, pretended to be shocked until a photograph emerged of them posing together after his supposed death. She was later jailed for six-and-a-half-years for fraud and money-laundering. John Darwin was reported missing in a canoe in the North Sea in March 2002.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A son stabbed his own 86-year-old mother to death then hanged himself, writing that he was unable to 'cope with life anymore', an inquest heard. Stephen Dohoney, 55, killed Ethel Dohoney in the home they shared after wrongly concluding that he had cancer, and that his mother would not be able to survive without his care. Investigators called to the scene of the murder in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester last November found a note Dohoney had written explained why he 'sent her to heaven'. Family: Stephen Dohoney, right, stabbed his mother Ethel in the neck and chest before hanging himself . They found three family photographs lying . beside the old lady’s body - one her late husband Jack, a second of her . late son Kenneth and a third of herself as a younger woman. An inquest in Manchester today heard how Dohoney, a civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions, was terrified of succumbing to cancer, which had also killed his older brother. However, he did not have any form of the disease, nor was there any medical evidence to suggest he did. After inflicting the stab wounds on his mother, who was also known as Olwyn, Dohoney left a suicide note signed ‘Stephen D’ which read: 'I can’t cope with life anymore. I’m going to have another breakdown. 'Mum would not have survived without me and would have said it was her fault so I have sent her to heaven. We have lived together all our lives so we should die together.' The coroner heard that Dohoney who had two degrees from Exeter University, had been a keen traveller who 'lived life to the full' and loved reading, films and going to the theatre. But he had taken extended leave from his job to care full-time for his mother, whose physical and mental health had 'rapidly deteriorated' following the death of her oldest son Kenneth from cancer in 2012 aged 62. The death had rocked the family and led Dohoney to worry about the disease. He visited his GP but the doctor had diagnosed the disease sarcoidosis, where tissue on the organs becomes swollen. Kenneth Dohoney's widow Christine said Mrs Dohoney, a former shorthand typist, sandwich-maker and cleaner had struggled since her son's death in September 2012 from leukaemia. Scene: Investigators were called to the house in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, which Dohoney shared with his mother . 'She thought that she should have died instead of him,' she said in a statement. 'Her health deteriorated and she became dependent on Stephen. She stopped going out on her own and spent more time at home. They had never been apart except from when Stephen was at university. 'When Kenneth died Stephen took it upon himself to take a career break to look after her. Kenneth’s death hit them both hard. 'She deteriorated both physically and mentally. He was also increasingly worried about his own health. From May of 2013 he was frightened he had cancer like Kenneth.' The murder scene was discovered by a friend of Christine Dohoney, who checked on the house after she returned from holiday. Mrs Dohoney snr was found in bed with multiple stab wounds to her neck and chest. Dohoney had surrounded himself with documents explaining the family's financial circumstances before killing himself. Detective Inspector Richard Eales of Greater Manchester Police said: 'In the weeks before his death he became very concerned about his weight and was weighing himself every day. 'He was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and had high blood pressure and was on a number of medications.” Recording verdicts of unlawful killing and suicide, coroner Nigel Meadows said of Mrs Dohoney: 'She was a very elderly lady with impaired physical and mental health that had been stabbed a number of times in the chest. 'The weapon used was discovered below Stephen. If there is no evidence of anybody else being involved - it can only be Stephen who killed his mother. 'Officially I have got to record that Ethel was unlawfully killed because she was murdered. Stephen took his own life and I can be satisfied that he killed himself and killed his mother. 'He might have been struggling with his mental health and had become preoccupied with his own health. 'He at some point described he had cancer but he didn’t and as far as I could tell from records he was investigated and no-one was telling him he had cancer. 'I suspect he did have some form of mental health problem. Obviously that does not give him any right to try and harm anyone else, particularly his mother. He may have been doing so for in his mind trying to do the best he could for his mum but that is unlawful.'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Robert Knott, 33, was jailed for a second time today for shooting student Kevin Bond, 30, with a sawn-off shotgun in front of his fiancee . A killer who shot a man dead in front of his fiancee as the couple drove to a wedding fair was jailed for life today after facing trial for a second time. Robert Knott, 33, shot student Kevin Bond, 30, in broad daylight with a sawn-off shot gun in September 2010. As the killer fled the scene, Mr Bond staggered back to his bride-to-be Natasha Haukedahl. He was then taken to hospital and sadly died later that day. Knott, who had been involved in a long-running feud with the victim, then went into hiding. He eventually turned himself in to police a month later. In April 2011, Knott, was found guilty of murder - but last September his conviction was quashed. He was ordered to face a retrial after his original barrister mistakenly suggested left-handed Mr Bond was right handed. But today the killer from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was convicted for murder again - and was ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years. Prosecutor Gordon Cole QC said the killing occurred as the couple made their way to a wedding fair on September 19 2010. The couple had stopped at a BP Petrol station on Rowlandsway in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, just before 2pm. It was there Knott  - who was leaving the garage at the time - spotted the couple, the court was told. Knott then parked-up down the road and waited for the pair to leave before following them. The victim, who was travelling in the passenger seat, realised they were being followed. When the cars stopped at some traffic lights, he got out to confront the driver. Within seconds of reaching the car, Mr Bond was shot in the abdomen by Knott. Mr Bond was driving to a wedding fair when Knott struck. The killer shot the student in the stomach with a shotgun after following the couple, a court was told . Giving evidence, fiancee Miss Haukedahl, . now 29, told the court, 'I remember seeing a gun coming up out of the . window. I turned to look at Kevin and he stumbled back. 'He told me he . was dying. I was just in bits.' She . told the court she began to drive towards the nearest hospital - but . managed to flag down an oncoming ambulance by pulling into its path. Natasha Haukedahl, pictured outside Manchester Crown Court. She told jurors she was 'in bits' following the shooting . Mr Bond died hours later. A post-mortem concluded he had died from a shotgun wound to the abdomen and indicated he had been shot from between three and five metres away. Knott was named as the shooter by witnesses - but when police went to his home he had disappeared. He turned himself on October 22. He later admitted he had bought a shotgun for £300 from a criminal contact in the days leading up to the killing. He denied he had been lying in wait for the victim and said he had not meant to kill him. He claimed to have been a former friend of Mr Bond - but said they had fallen out in 2008 and he had bought the gun as he felt intimidated by the victim. Knott claimed Mr Bond had pulled a gun on him, causing him to fire his own weapon. This was never proved.

'No mother should have to bury her child and I am still struggling to come to terms with his senseless death. 'It has left a perpetual void in all our lives which can never be filled and the grief made worse for every single one of us because we have had to endure the painful and demonstrated series of lies that Robert Knott has been allowed to present. 'I am so sad and angry that Kevin was taken from us, so shockingly. 'My son was the victim of a horrific crime and wasn’t able to defend himself yet he was portrayed as the aggressor by Knott in order to justify his own callous actions on that fateful day in September. 'I feel as though my son and my family have been on trial these past weeks and not Robert Knott. 'Kevin was devoted to his family and friends; it hurts so much that his daughter will grow up without her father who was so very proud of her. 'He absolutely adored his daughter and his two younger sisters. 'Natasha the love of his life will always be part of our family and it has given me immense comfort that Kevin had found true happiness with her.

"By . Ruth Styles . With Bryan May, the RSPCA and Bill Oddie among the people and organisations lining up to attack it, news of the Government's badger culling scheme proved controversial to say the least. But in one Somerset village, the culls proved nothing short of disastrous with one animal rights obsessed resident's poster campaign resulting in a horde of activists descending on the tiny hamlet. One young family was even forced to move away after being wrongly linked to the cull by neighbour Meg Sunningdale, 67, and subjected to a barrage of abuse. Outrage: Meg Sunningdale infuriated neighbours when her poster campaign led to a family being driven out . Noise: Her campaign also resulted in rowdy animal rights activists setting up camp in the village . But despite the dramatic repercussions, Mrs Sunningdale is unrepentant and says that as far as she's concerned, saving badgers is more important than the wellbeing of her neighbours. 'When we moved in, we were really . excited,' says Mrs Sunningdale, who moved to the village of Withycombe with her husband eight years ago. 'We're here in this lovely valley with woods, trees, open land, . this wonderful stream... It's just this wonderful environment. 'I had no . idea what to expect when I arrived because I've never lived in a small . village before but I did come in with a lot of enthusiasm.' But Mrs Sunningdale, a self-described 'spokesperson' for animals soon began to make enemies; loudly forcing her views on reluctant neighbours. 'You've got to be very careful about what you say in a small place like this because you could upset people,' explains long-term resident, Bill Calloway. 'When I met Meg for the first time, I thought she was a very interfering old lady.' Mrs Sunningdale's animal rights campaign began innocently enough with fairs to raise money for the RSPCA and a local dog show. But soon, she incurred the wrath of locals after treating them to her views on people who walk their dogs in fields where pheasants are nesting. 'I was standing by my house and there was . a gentleman up the road and he was walking his dogs in the field,' remembers the unrepentant Mrs Sunningdale. 'It . was pheasant breeding time and there were youngsters running around, and . when I saw him in the field, I thought, ""What are you doing? He can't let his dog do that."" 'A person walking is bad enough but a dog . running around ground nesting birds and chicks is worse. [The dog] was chasing them around, the pheasants were flying up and I couldn't . help myself - I didn't think, I just shouted.' Upset: Neighbour Tony Connolly was left furious after being kept awake by animal rights activists . Hub: Somerset was one of the test areas used for the first Government badger cull last summer . 'She was regarded rightly or wrongly as a . bit of a nutter with regards to animal welfare sort of thing,' adds neighbour Tony Connolly. 'But she . did take it to extremes. To come and live in a rural, small, farming . village and then expect people not to do things in the country that they . do - why would you want to go and live in the middle of it?' When the badger culls were mooted, and Mrs Sunnindale discovered that a neighbour was planning to take part, her one-woman animal rights campaign took a dangerous turn. Mrs Sunningdale, who had already irritated neighbours by leaving sandwiches and other food in her garden for badgers to eat, created a series of posters 'naming and shaming' her neighbour which she then attached to her gate and posted around the village. 'I just couldn't believe that he would be part of a badger cull and my natural instinct was to name and shame this person,' she explains. Protest: Mrs Sunningdale joined noisy animal rights activists protesting about the badger cull in the village . Furious: Animal rights activists descended on Withypool following Mrs Sunningdale's poster campaign . 'People . who were shooting badgers didn't want anyone to know and I don't think . that's right. I think they should be prepared to tell people.' But when a national newspaper picked up the story, the results were disastrous. Not only did the neighbour named on her posters receive a deluge of abusive phone calls and emails, he became so scared, he and his family felt they had no option but to move. 'I couldn't believe that someone would be that stupid - to do something like that is unbelievable,' adds Mr Connolly. 'I know he was getting abusive phonecalls, emails - they had all his . contact details. It was non-stop. 'He was that frightened for his family, his wife and children, he moved his family out of the village. He was frightened for his family all . because Meg had put those posters up.' Mrs Sunningdale, however, is unrepentant. 'I think badgers were a greater priority to me than being part of the community,' she remembers. 'I didn't feel bad about the phone calls . they were receiving. I thought that's a bit more ammunition. I didn't . feel any remorse at all.' Camp: The protesters set up camp in a copse just yards from the villagers, keeping them up most of the night . No remorse: Despite forcing a family out of the village, Mrs Sunningdale says she isn't sorry for what she did . Next, thanks to the publicity generated by Mrs Sunningdale's poster campaign, a horde of animal rights activists descended on the village, setting up camp in a copse 100 yards from her neighbour's homes. 'They had no worry about shining . spotlights in all of our windows,' adds Mr Connolly. 'They didn't usually start until about . 2.30 in the morning - just enough to let you get to sleep. 'They started . off with the lights, whistles, air horns. I don't need them out there . keeping me awake at night. I don't know what they were trying to . achieve. But what they did achieve was p***sing us off here.' 'My response to people complaining about noise in the village would be what about the noise the shooters have been making?' sniffs Mrs Sunningdale. Matters deteriorated further when her neighbours, enraged by her behaviour, responded by calling the police and, in one case, by leaving a bag of manure in her garden. 'We . were spotted by a shooter on his way home and he stopped, reversed and . shone a huge light on us,' explains Mrs Sunningdale. Support: Brian May was among celebrities who voiced opposition to badger culling . 'I said . to him, ""You're an absolute scumbag!"" and he didn't say a word, just drove . on. The next day I had three bags of dog excrement in my garden. I . thought, ""Hmmm, what can I do with this?""' Her solution was to return it to the person she assumed was responsible - with a nasty note attached. 'The . note said, ""If you feel the need to shoot living targets, maybe you . ought to join the army,' she remembers, adding: 'Oh, wait, you would probably be too cowardly to . be on the other end of a gun.' This time, she received a caution from police and, with her relationship with her neighbours damaged beyond repair, plans to leave the village of Withypool behind. 'I don't know what reputation I had to start with but whatever I had was ruined and I certainly have a very bad reputation now,' she admits. Neighbour Tony Connolly adds: Do I feel any sympathy for her? No I don't - she brought everything on herself. 'I don't think think it'll make any difference whatsoever except that I . won't be able to say we've got a nutter living in the village anymore.'

"By . Leon Watson . A disgraced darts star drove his estranged wife to the brink of suicide after he repeatedly harassed her, a court heard today. Chris Mason, known by fans as 'Mace the Ace', admitted breaching a non-molestation order which banned him from contacting his wife of 14-years Lorna. The former darts champion has previously been hauled before the courts after pleading guilty to assaulting Lorna, 39, and threatening to slit her throat. A court heard darts star Chris Mason drove his estranged wife to the brink of suicide after he repeatedly harassed her . Chris Mason pictured with his then girlfriend Lorna in happier times . He admitted breaching the order when he emailed Lorna three times in a month over a dispute about an insurance claim. Mason was handed a restraining order banning him from having any contact with Lorna - unless through his solicitors - until April 2016. Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court heard since he attacked her in October last year Lorna had suffered with depression and was suicidal. Prosecutor Jayne Youngs said: 'They are going through a divorce which he is making life difficult and the process has made her ill and she has had a nervous breakdown and is on depression medication. 'She does not think she is coping and says if it carries on like this she will have another breakdown. If it wasn’t for her daughter she would end her life because of this defendant. 'The three emails sent were not received until later on due to her internet being down and they were to do with insurance. Harassed: Lorna Mason, the estranged wife of top darts player Chris Mason . 'She has made a statement where she . says she was with her husband for 14 years and several of them she . suffered domestic violence and on one occasion he was arrested. 'On . October 10 she was issued a non-molestation order at the family court. He was not to contact her except through their solicitors. 'She says she does not feel comfortable with him contacting her and no matter what she does he will find a way to contact her.' As well as the restraining order Mason was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He was also told to carry out 50 hours unpaid work. The court heard Mason, from Hednesford, Staffordshire, breached the order by contacting Lorna three times between February and March this year. Chairwoman of the bench Catherine Hazenberg told him: 'We accept you were frustrated but you have breached the order three times. 'We will impose a restraining order on top of the non-molestation order and we want to make it certain you do not contact Lorna Mason in any way, shape or form, except through solicitors, it is your responsibility. Chris Mason throws as Phil Taylor looks on during the third round of The Ladbrokes World Darts Championship in 2006 . Lorna Mason girlfriend of player Chris Mason watches him in his heyday . 'This will be for a period of two years to protect Lorna Mason.' The court heard Mason contacted Lorna after he received an insurance claim relating to a car which they owned before he walked out on her in 2007. Richard Quinn, defending, said: 'My client has no issues with his relationship breaking down. When it did, he left the marital home and everything in it, including a motor vehicle to her (Lorna Mason). Top darts player Chris Mason pictured with his first wife Lisa . 'It is alleged that she has formed a relationship with another gentleman and that vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident. 'It is alleged the driver of that vehicle was the male that the complainant is with and was guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. 'An insurance claim, which is suspected to be fraudulent, was then made, I can’t say any more than that, but as the owner of the vehicle, my client was contacted by an insurance company daily to find out who the driver was. Chris Mason began his career in the British Darts Organisation making his World Championship debut in 1996. He lost 0–3 to Andy Fordham. After a brief stint in the World Darts Council in 1996, he enjoyed his best achievement in the 1999 World Championship to reach the semi-final. Mason's last appearance at Lakeside was a first round defeat to Mervyn King in 2001. In 2002, he decided to switch from the BDO to the Professional Darts Corporation in time to play at the PDC World Championships again in 2002, but he lost in the first round to Dave Askew. He took time out from the game to deal with his personal issues and his enforced absence caused him to miss most tournaments in 2003 and 2004 - but he returned to play in the 2004 World Grand Prix in October and reached the quarter-finals. 'After not being able to find out, purely out of frustration he e-mailed the claimant on three separate occasions in a non-threatening way to try and resolve the matter, although she failed to respond and that, ultimately was that. 'He has complied in the past and has been sober for six months and three weeks now, he is turning his life around.' Mason, of Hednesford, Staffordshire, was on the brink of stardom when he won the prestigious Scottish Open in 1995, Irish Masters in 2000 and English Open in 2001. But his life began to unravel after he reached the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championships in 2003. In 2003 Mason was jailed for three years after he attacked a father-of-two with a hammer after a row about a dog. He also caused a stir when he tried to fight darts rival Phil 'The Power' Taylor after a bust-up at a World Championship match in 2007. In the same year he was poised to appear on Celebrity Big Brother but pulled out at the last minute. In June 2010 he was exposed as a benefits cheat when he admitted failing to declare £45,000 of winnings while claiming housing and council tax benefit in Stoke-on-Trent. He retired from the sport in 2011 and now regularly appears as a darts pundit on ITV.","Chris Mason admitted breaching a non-molestation order .

"By . Richard Spillett . Stunning shots of these cliff-top cottages in East Sussex show the frightening pace of the coastal erosion now gobbling up Britain's coastline. A photograph taken just over a century ago shows a terrace of seven houses set well back from the sea with a stretch of land in between. But pictures from this week show all of the land between the homes and shore has now disappeared into the sea - with just two houses left hanging in the balance. Scroll down for video . Before: A photograph of cottages at Birling Gap, East Sussex in 1905 shows the third chimney from the left separated from the sea by four other houses, a garden and large stretch of land . After: But pictures from this week show the property with the same chimney now teetering on the cliff-edge after the sea cut its way through all of the other homes . The properties are at Birling Gap, near Eastbourne, where planners have beat a hasty retreat, demolishing houses before they fall over the cliff. The houses were built for coastguards ibetween 1800 and 1820 and allowed their occupants an unrivaled view of the English Channel. The photo taken around 1905 shows all seven properties within a large walled garden built with a brick shed on the perimeter. In that photo, many metres of cliff-top land lies between the garden's walls and the cliff edge, with a beach beyond. But one hundred years of storms have since battered the coastline, cutting away huge chunks of the cliff-top land. Demolition crews have since removed many of the ex-coastguard homes and destroyed the latest terraced property this week. Gone: The cottage is not being allowed to fall away naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach-goers . Demolition: The local council says more than three metres of cliff has been lost in the past four months due to the severe winter weather . Going: Authorities in the area have been fighting a running battle with the sea as they attempt to demolish properties in Birling Gap, East Sussex before they fall over the cliff edge . After some of the cottages had to be demolished in 1994 and more in the early 2000s, a cherry picker was used this week to remove the walls of the latest property, with what is left of the house expected to have disappeared by the end of the week. Wealden District Council have said that at least three metres of cliff has been lost along the seafront of Birling Gap in the past four months - which represents about seven years' worth of erosion at the usual rate. Experts say it is not possible to allow the cottage to fall away into the sea naturally because it is attached to other properties and would pose a danger to beach-goers below. A huge crack in the land has opened just yards from the cottages in recent week and the steps below which lead to the beach have also been closed off following collapses. Just last week, two sightseers were pictured standing close to the edge of the cliffs causing Eastbourne RNLI spokesman Bob Jeffery to warn people to steer clear of the crumbling chalk. The National Trust - which is responsible for the stretch of coastline - says winter storms have caused the kind of damage they had not expecting for years to come. The trust - which owns more than 740 miles of coastline around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, around a tenth of the total coastline for the three countries - has previously warned that with more extreme weather predicted, the rate of change on Britain's coastline will speed up.","Photos from Birling Gap, near Eastbourne, East Sussex show how the sea is cutting its way through terraced homes .

"By . Richard Spillett . Donna Galliott was forced to wait outside Winchester's St Clements surgery because poorly toddler Lily was crying 'too loudly' A young mother was forced to leave a doctor's waiting room after staff claimed her sickly toddler was crying 'too loudly'. Donna Galliott, 26, and her poorly 16-month-old daughter, Lily, were ordered to wait by a busy road outside the surgery after booking an emergency appointment. Miss Galliott said she burst into tears as she and distressed Lily left the practice on a receptionist's instructions. Miss Galliott, a school cleaner and self-employed hairdresser, said: 'I felt so humiliated, it was awful. 'We were thrown out of the waiting room - the receptionist said ‘You're making too much noise'. I couldn't believe it and asked if she was joking, but she said ‘no'.' The worried mother-of-one had phoned the surgery after spotting blistering on the roof of Lily's mouth and was told to bring her 'straight in'. But after the mother and daughter were forced to wait more than 20 minutes past their time slot, Lily started crying and staff told them to leave the premises because they were making too much noise. Miss Galliott, who lives in Winchester, Hampshire with her partner Daryl Brimfield, said she was humiliated by the incident at the city's St Clements Surgery. She said: 'Lily had been unwell with a temperature for days and, when I noticed blistering on the roof of her mouth, I rang the surgery. 'They gave me an emergency appointment and I was told to bring her straight in. After a good 20 minute wait past the time slot, Lily got distressed and started screaming and we were told to wait outside. Miss Galliott says her and her daughter's 'humiliating' treatment by surgery staff left her in tears . 'I could feel myself welling up. It was absolutely humiliating, so I just picked Lily up and walked outside and burst into tears. 'When they'd told me to take her down for an emergency appointment I thought we would be rushed straight in, especially given a child is involved.' As they stood outside in rush-hour traffic at 5.30pm, Miss Galliott decided she was too embarrassed to go back in and cancelled her appointment. They had originally been booked in to be seen at 5.10pm. She later took Lily to be seen by Winchester hospital's out-of-hours team instead, where medics discovered she was suffering from a viral infection. Miss Galliott added: 'Being told to leave was so utterly humiliating I just could not face going back into the surgery afterwards. 'If that's the surgery's policy, the situation needs to be dealt with. Waiting outside with a sick child is not an option - it's not fair on parents or children. The manager of St Clements Surgery in Winchester has since apologised for Miss Galliott's treatment . 'If the practice feel that strongly about noise, they need to consider having a child only waiting room. 'It's virtually impossible to tell a 16-month-old to sit down and be quiet, they're too young to understand. Another patient, who was shocked as the mother and child were ejected from the GP's practice, branded the move ‘disgraceful'. Julie Hicks said: 'I couldn't believe what was happening and really felt for them. There were only two other people in the waiting room who didn't seem bothered by having Lily there. 'Anyone with small kids understands they scream when they're ill - it's just the way it is. It was disgraceful and really out of order.' St Clements practice manager Kathy Bracher today apologised and said improvements would be made following the incident. Not wanting to stand outside with a sick child, Miss Galliott took Lily to Winchester Hospital, where the toddler was diagnosed with a viral infection . In a statement today, she said: 'St Clements practice prides itself on being a family-oriented practice where patients of all ages are welcome. 'We have to consider the needs of all our patients in our waiting rooms - some of whom may be very ill or frail - and endeavour to maintain a calm and safe environment. 'We may, rarely, have to intervene when a small child is running around the corridor and waiting room. 'Nevertheless, both the receptionist and the practice are very upset and sorry that this incident has caused distress to one of our patients. 'I personally apologised by telephone when Ms Galliott rang that evening and, again, to her partner the following day. 'It is never our intention to upset or cause embarrassment to any of our patients. We have discussed, as a practice, the way this incident was handled and agreed improved ways of dealing with similar situations in the future.'","Worried mother Donna Galliott brought in daughter Lily after days of illness .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Former Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne uses a new book to attack his own party for being too timid and not being bolder on tax and spending . Voters do not know what the Lib Dems stand for because Nick Clegg is too focused on trying to please his critics, a former minister has claimed. Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne warned people with liberal views do not see his party as their 'natural home' as he urged Mr Clegg to be more radical in the last year of the coalition. The Taunton MP called for the top rate of tax to be cut to 40p, said state schools should be able to make a profit and says the NHS should not be protected from spending cuts. In a new book, he claims the coalition has been paralysed by 'political procrastination'. He also takes a swipe at both coalition parties for indulging in a 'Dutch auction' of expensive, vote-winning policies at a time when the public is also being told to face many more years of austerity. Mr Browne, who was sacked last autumn, has written Race Plan to counter the idea that the Lib Dems stand for nothing more than being equidistant between the Tories and Labour. The former Foreign Office and Home Office minister warns that Britain is failing to prepare for the 'Asian Century' when China, India and other emerging economies in the East will dominate. In a preface to his book he said: 'We cannot afford the political procrastination that is too often our default mode when faced with big decisions. 'Instead of a new hub airport, we have a new hub airport commission.  Instead of returning the top rate of tax from 50p to 40p, we uneasily split the difference at 45p. 'Instead of addressing the real causes of low wages - low productivity and educational failure - we pretend that artificial distortions of the labour market will painlessly make everyone wealthier.' And in an interview to promote the publication he went further, and suggested the Lib Dems risk appealing to fewer voters by trying to please everyone. 'I regret if people don’t think the Liberal Democrats are liberal and I think that is a real challenge for my party, of why a lot of people who have liberal views don’t see the Liberal Democrats as their natural home,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He also suggested that Mr Clegg has failed to convince voters that he is a liberal, because he has sought to placate critics on the left of his party. 'I do think Nick Clegg is a natural liberal; I think he has sometimes felt forced to meet his detractors halfway and that has blurred his liberalism, but I think he is at heart a natural liberal and I think people who exhibit natural liberal tendencies tend to have the right answers to our national predicament.' His comments will be seen as a direct challenge to the authority of Mr Clegg, who is thought to have personally vetoed a further reduction in the top rate of tax. Mr Browne's comments will be seen as a direct challenge to Nick Clegg, who he warns has 'felt forced to meet his detractors halfway' obscuring his liberalism . Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander, the party's leading voice on economic policy, has ruled out a further cut in the top rate of tax. Speaking . in February he said: ‘I think it is right at 45 per cent. I wouldn't go . to cutting below 45 per cent. I would say that would happen over my . dead body.’ In the last weeks of the Labour government then-Chancellor Alistair Darling increased it from 40p to 50p. Tory Chancellor George Osborne then cut it to 45p in 2012, claiming the measure had raised ‘next to nothing’ for the Treasury. Ed . Balls has vowed to return it to 50p if Labour wins the next election, . but Tories are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander has insisted the top rate of tax will be cut 'over my dead body' But Mr Browne says opposing a further . cut was a major mistake which has left Britain with a top tax rate that . is 'still too high'. 'Authentic liberals should feel uneasy about confiscatory levels of taxation,' he writes. 'If a 40p top rate of tax was high . enough for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (until his last few weeks in . office) then it should surely have been high enough for David Cameron . and Nick Clegg. 'At a time . of real economic difficulty, the Government's priority has been to cut . income tax for people with low and middle rates of pay. 'It . has made commendable progress, but the timing of the cut in the top . rate was regrettable, and suggests the Government has a tine ear for the . politics of austerity and shared sacrifice.' He . says that the decision to cut the top rate of tax should have been . delayed until this year, when it could have been tied to the increase in . the personal allowance for ordinary workers. He also warns that it is 'unnerving' to see both sides of the Coalition unveiling costly spending pledges in the run-up to the next election despite the continuing need for austerity. He says Mr Clegg's plan for free school dinners for all infant children and David Cameron's introduction of a marriage tax break send out a 'confusing' message that the need for spending cuts is over. 'What would be a terrible let down now would be for the Government to wobble,' he says. 'It is confusing for the public to see child benefit and the education maintenance allowance being cut on the grounds of affordability, only for the Government to then announce a couple of lavish spending commitments.' Mr Browne is on the Right of the Lib-Dems, but denies he would consider defecting to the Conservatives.","Jeremy Browne urges his party to be more radical in last year of coalition .

"By . Wills Robinson . It was thought to have built by King Offa in the 8th century as border between England and Wales . But even though it has been part of the British landscape for centuries, the ancient Offa's Dyke may have to be renamed, after archaeologists discovered it could have been completed 200 years before the great Anglo Saxon leader was born. Experts used radiocarbon dating on the 177-mile dyke and revealed it could have been constructed as early as the 4th century. Ancient: Archaeologists have used radiocarbon dating on the dyke, which acted as a barrier between England and Wales. Results revealed it had been constructed at least 200 years earlier than first thought . It was installed to protect the Kingdom of Mercia, which is now known as the Midlands, from an invasion by Welsh forces. The group behind the project said it is a 'tremendously exciting discovery' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke. The Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust excavations were . carried out on a stretch of the dyke along the Shropshire border near . the town of Chirk. Paul Belford, director of the  Archaeological Trust, said: 'It's been known as Offa's Dyke for centuries but some sections may not have been built by Offa. 'It may be a bit late to change the name now - although it raises some interesting questions.' The dyke, an Anglo-Saxon earthwork up to 65ft wide in places, was built as a man-made border between England and Wales. It was built by Offa of Mercia, who came to the throne in 757 after the murder of his cousin Ethelbald. He ruled the area now know as the Midlands and historians say he was the most powerful Saxon ruler before Alfred the Great. Today it is a protected monument and The Offa's Dyke Path is one of Britain's longest walks - stretching rom Prestatyn in North Wales down to Chepstow in the South. Change: Experts believe the 177-mile Offas's Dyke, which runs from Prestatyn in North Wales to Chepstow, may have to be re-named because of the revelation . Monarch: A drawing of King Offa who reigned from AD 757 to 796 and was regarded as the most powerful Anglo Saxon leader before Alfred the Great . The material came from an ancient layer of re-deposited turf underneath the bank suggesting it was laid down as part of the construction process. Mr Belford said: 'This is the first time we have accurate scientific dates for Offa's Dyke. 'Certainly the dyke was built to make a statement about the power of the kingdom of Mercia.' Until now historians believed the dyke was built by King Offa of Mercia during his reign between 757 and 796. Natural beauty: The structure is a protected monument and is now one of Britain's longest walks . But the section of earthwork near Chirk have been carbon dated and revealed a 95 per cent probability it was built between 430 and 652. Mr Belford said: 'It is likely that parts of the dyke system was in place before Offa's time. 'But it is also likely that he would have consolidated the existing network into what we now call Offa's Dyke. 'It is now clear that it was not the work of a single ruler but a longer-term project that began at an earlier stage in the development of the kingdom. 'Further work is needed on other parts of this enigmatic monument before we can really say who built it and why.' Revelations: Archaologists said the new date was a 'tremendously exciting discovery' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke .

These shocking images show the moment a drunk thug tried to steal a bag from a disabled man - and ended up hauling him off his mobility scooter and onto the ground after the bag's cord got stuck around his victim's neck. Daniel Jones, 23, attacked the vulnerable 42-year-old when he spotted him outside a supermarket in Coventry, West Midlands, on February 18. CCTV footage released by police shows the moment the thug creeps up behind his victim and tries to snatch the bag from his back. Scroll down for video . Daniel Jones, 23, attacked the vulnerable 42-year-old when he spotted him outside a supermarket in Coventry, West Midlands, on February 18. CCTV footage shows Jones dragging his victim of the mobility scooter . Daniel Jones, 23, left, eventually admitted robbery after CCTV footage caught him snatching the bag of his disabled victim, right, outside a supermarket in Coventry, West Midlands, on February 18 . However, as Jones tries to grab the bag, the shoulder strap snags around the victim’s neck - leaving him gasping for breath. As Jones tries to yank the bag free, the force pulls the victim off the 50kg scooter which ends up toppling backwards and landing on top of the disabled man. The 27-second video then shows the moment the thug finally manages to untangle the bag’s cord - falling backwards as it breaks free - and flees leaving the vulnerable man trapped helplessly on the floor. A court heard Jones had approached his victim near a bus terminal at 2am and asked for a cigarette before making a callous grab for the draw-string bag. A security guard gave chase as he ran towards the canal bridge but backed off when Jones shouted threats to stab him. However, Jones was unaware the attack had been caught on CCTV and was arrested when he returned to loiter around the same car park just minutes later. Officers discovered the victim’s Ben Sherman watch hidden down his trouser leg and a police dog quickly found the stolen Adidas bag containing an inhaler and a crucifix at a nearby canal-side. Jones, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, refused to accept the attacker caught on camera was him even when he was shown the CCTV footage. But he was picked out by his victim and a supermarket security guard during an ID parade . A court heard Jones had approached his victim near a bus terminal at 2am and asked for a cigarette before making a callous grab for the draw-string bag . Jones, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, refused to accept the attacker caught on camera was him even when he was shown the CCTV footage. But he was picked out by his victim and a supermarket security guard during an ID parade and admitted robbery at Coventry Crown Court on April 2. Jones was jailed for a total of three years and four months - 28 months for the robbery and an extra 12 months for breaching a suspended prison sentence imposed at Warwick Crown Court last September for an assault on 27 December 2012. He told police he had visited a friend to smoke cannabis and drink strong home-brewed cider - which left him ‘nine out of 10 drunk’ and unable to account for his actions. After the case, Detective Constable Lee Buckler, from West Midlands Police, said the heartless attack was one of the worst he had seen in his career. Despite the shoulder strap snagging around his victim¿s neck - leaving him gasping for breath - Jones then drags him off the 50kg scooter as it topples over backwards on top . The 27-second video then shows the distressing moment the thug finally manages to untangle the bag's cord and flees leaving the man trapped helplessly on the floor . He added: ‘Claiming not to remember the incident was no defence. ‘The fact the victim didn’t suffer serious injury was down to luck rather than any conscious act by Jones. ‘The security team at Ricoh Arena did a marvellous CCTV job - directing officers to make a swift arrest and providing key evidence - and a security guard made a brave attempt to detain Jones despite him threatening violence. ‘This was a cowardly attack against a man Jones knew was not in a position to defend himself. ‘It’s one of the most shocking incidents I’ve investigated but thankfully attacks like this on vulnerable people are rare.’ After the case, Detective Constable Lee Buckler, from West Midlands Police, said the heartless attack was one of the worst he had seen in his career .

"By . Mark Duell . He might only be a tiny puppy, but when little Dexter became trapped in a garden gate he needed a crew of four burly firefighters to cut him free. The shih-tzu toy poodle cross had only been at home in Nottingham with his new owners for seven weeks when he managed to squeeze into the tiny gap in the gate to their front garden. Maria Nolan, 27, arrived home to find the 16-week-old puppy with his head and front paws stuck poking through the gate. Stuck: Shih-tzu toy poodle cross Dexter had only been at home in Nottingham with his new owners for seven weeks when he managed to squeeze into the tiny gap in the gate to their front garden . Her mother Anna Nolan had called the fire brigade as a last resort when neither greasing Dexter’s coat with oil and water nor the efforts of two neighbours helped to free him. She was washing her front door, with Dexter and her other dog Evie in the front garden, when suddenly they went quiet. On investigation, Anna Nolan found Dexter stuck in the gate. While he was squealing for help, she called the fire bridgade, and four firefighters soon arrived - managing to pull Dexter from the gate within a few minutes. Anna Nolan said: ‘He’s still a pup and such a friendly dog. When I looked round I could see Evie and I thought “Where’s Dex?” ‘I just kept looking round and there he was, stuck halfway through the railings. There was no way of moving the bars and I tried water and oil but that didn’t work.

"By . Mark Duell . A unique photo album of the great and good of Victorian England thought to have been owned by Lord Lucan is expected to fetch £1,000 at auction. The collection of 250 fascinating images of the aristocracy were put together in a 32-page scrapbook, which was once held by the fugitive aristocrat. Some feature famous faces such as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert while others show noble families in more informal poses on days out. The aristocracy at play: The Meade and Clanwilliam families pictured at the turn of the century, in one of many photographs from an album once owned by Lord Lucan . Monarch: Queen Victoria pictured laying the foundation stone to Mar Lodge a Scottish Highland Estate in Aberdeenshire on October 15, 1895 .

Some of the images in the book - put up for auction by a mystery 'photography dealer' - have been cut around like a scrapbook to fit them all into it. They date from 1872 to 1918 and John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan - known as Lord Lucan - is thought to have acquired the book after it was compiled. The photo album was passed down to him by his father George Charles Patrick Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, who was given it by his parents. Photography . expert Chris Albury, of Dominic Winter auctioneers in South Cerney, . Gloucestershire, said it was an impressive collection. He added: ‘The album is full of portraits from nobles and some royals from the turn of the 20th century.

"By . Hugo Gye . This luxury flat has been put on the market with a price tag of £9million - thanks to its view of London's hidden 'tropical' garden. The apartment block is situated on South Street in Mayfair, overlooking Mount Street Gardens, which was once a meeting place for Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower. Although the garden is open to the public, its entrance is tucked between two shops in the quiet area, and many locals who stumble across it are shocked to discover its existence. Luxury: A flat in this apartment block is going up for sale for £9million thanks to its position overlooking Mount Street Gardens . Tropical: The garden is believed to have an unusually warm micro-climate which allows trees such as palms to grow . Interior: The flat boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a large reception room and a dining room . The trees in the garden include several tropical varieties rarely found in Britain, including silver wattle from Australia, Canary Islands palm trees and Chinese willows. It is believed that the plants are able to flourish thanks to the garden's secluded location, which gives it an unusually warm micro-climate. This flat, which overlooks the garden from a luxurious apartment block, is being sold for £8.75million via Wetherell Estates. It features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a double reception room with very high ceilings and a dining room. However, the main attraction will surely be its location, as well as the view over Mount Street Gardens. Location, location, location: The apartment block is situated in the heart of Mayfair, overlooking the relatively little-known garden . Dining room: The lucky new owner will be able to host in style in the £9million flat, being sold by Wetherell Estates . Classy: The living room with its grand piano is reminiscent of the lifestyle enjoyed by fictional aristocrats such as Bertie Wooster . Corridors: The hallway next to the staircase is pictured left; on the right is another corridor with an ornate window . The land originally formed part of a huge fortification dating from the English Civil War, where Oliver Cromwell defended the capital against royalist troops. It then served as a graveyard and burial ground before being converted into a garden in 1889, at a time when Mayfair was rapidly becoming one of London's most fashionable areas. During the Second World War, Winston Churchill and General Dwight D. Eisenhower would walk in Mount Street Gardens while discussing how to defeat the Nazis. Eisenhower was based in nearby Grosvenor Square, headquarter of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied High Command. Fashionable: The block of flats as it appears from South Street, located in one of the most expensive areas in the country . Entrance: The building is entered through this striking antique doorway . View: The flat looks right over Mount Street Gardens, which is unknown even by many locals . Green: The master bedroom looks out onto a relatively rural scene, with trees crowding the landscape as well as other apartment blocks . In the intervening decades, the garden has become particularly popular with Americans, thanks to its location near the U.S. Embassy. Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell, said: 'These wonderful Mount Street Gardens are Mayfair's best hidden secret. 'Hidden behind the boutique shops of Mount Street and yet close to Park Lane and Oxford Street they provide a secret and tranquil oasis of greenery in the heart of London's West End. 'The views from the apartment onto the gardens are superb, and the view is simply priceless.' Ornate: The view of the drawing room, with a number of fine pieces of furniture upholstered in colourful fabrics . Facilities: The kitchen of the house is pictured left, as well as the hallway which opens on to the main drawing room .

"By . Wills Robinson . Admiral Nelson's warship HMS Victory could feature on the new 12-sided pound coin, it has emerged. The warship is an early front-runner to be used on the reverse of the new 'threepennybit'- stye coin after the city of Portsmouth launched a design bid. The warship, which is now a major tourist attraction, was victorious in the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, during which naval hero Lord Nelson was shot dead by a French soldier. Historic: The warship, which helped Britain to a decisive victory during the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar, has been included in a proposed design for the new 12-sided pound coin . Portsmouth City Council has announced its ambition to see the ship featured on the coin, which is expected to come into circulation in 2017. The south coast city's famous Spinnaker Tower is also incorporated into the design. Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council, said: 'I want Portsmouth to be first off the starting blocks for this competition. We'll push for a 'Pompey pound' with a design celebrating our city. 'HMS Victory is world-famous and symbolises our amazing heritage as the home of the Royal Navy, while the Spinnaker Tower has become an iconic modern image for the whole of the south of England. Warship: The HMS Victory is docked in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and is a popular tourist attraction . Battle: The stand-off between the Royal Navy and the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies took place on the Cape of Trafalgar, off the south-west coast of Spain . Modern architecture: The new design includes an engraving of the Spinnaker Tower next to the warship . 'Portsmouth has played a pivotal role in the history of this country. With two huge new aircraft carriers soon to arrive, and all the new investment coming into the city, it's entering a new era. Its significance as a city should be recognised in this way.' The decision to replace the pound coin . with a new 12-sided version was made after a Dutch smuggling ring . flooded Britain with £30million in fake currency. The £1 coin has been in use since 1983 – . much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – . and 1.5billion were in circulation as of March 2013. The outdated . technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated . counterfeiters. Out with the old: The present £1 coin, left, . will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting. Its replacement . will be a reworking of the old-fashioned threepenny bit, which last . circulated in 1971 . It is claimed the decision to replace the . familiar round coin came after Dutch police raided what was previously . thought to be a legitimate mint in Amsterdam and discovered . sophisticated machines which could produce hundreds of coins every . minute, and matched the standard of those used by the Royal Mint. But industry chiefs insist the bill for . converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to take the . new £1 coin could be as much as £100million. More . than 100,000 parking machines will need to be changed at a hefty cost . to local council tax payers, diverting cash from other work, such as . filling pot holes.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Afghan voters defied threats of violence to cast their ballots in the country's first democratic transfer of power today. The turnout was so high that some polling centres ran out of ballot papers as people queued up to cast their vote more than an hour before polls opened. Men in traditional tunics and loose trousers and women clad in burqas arrived at the polling stations with a sense of excitement over choosing a new leader for the first time. Scroll down for videos . Men lining up to register to vote at a Kabul polling station in the country's first democratic transfer of power . The poll is amid tight security as Taliban militants have vowed to disrupt the vote by targeting polling stations and election workers. Hundreds of thousands of Afghan police and soldiers fanned out across the country, searching cars at checkpoints and blocking vehicles from getting close to polling stations. Some voters were searched three times in Kabul, and text messages were blocked in an apparent attempt to prevent candidates from last-minute campaigning. At a Kandahar hospital-turned-polling station, the men's queue stretched from the building, through the courtyard and out into the street. An Afghan policeman stands by a gate at a polling station in Jalalabad, east of Kabul during elections amid tight security . Afghan women show their registration cards as they wait to cast their ballots in Kunduz . In Helmand province, women pushed, shoved and argued as they pressed forward in a long line. The Taliban threats came following several recent high-profile attacks in the heart of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Just yesterday, an Associated Press veteran photographer was killed and a reporter wounded when an Afghan policeman opened fire on their car. Today a bomb exploded in a school packed with voters in the Mohammad Agha district of Logar province, wounding two men, one seriously, according to local government spokesman Din Mohammad Darwesh . Rocket attacks and gun battles forced authorities to close an additional 211 polling centres, raising the total number which were shut because of security concerns to 959, according to Independent Election Commission chairman Ahmad Yousuf Nouristani. Some polling stations ran out of ballot papers due the large turnout of voters across Afghanistan . These women queued up to vote in the Afghan elections in the north western city of Herat today . There was tight security at polling stations as Taliban militants vowed to disrupt the vote by targeting election workers . But Mr Nouristani also confirmed that some polling centres had run out of ballot papers but that authorities were addressing the shortfall. They also extended voting by an hour, to accommodate everybody standing in the queue. Mr Nouristani said: 'We have received complaints about it and we have already sent ballot papers to wherever needed.' The vote will chose a successor to President Hamid Karzai, who is consitutionally barred from serving a third term. International combat troops are leaving Afghanistan by the end of the year. Afghans will be then left largely on their own to face what is likely to be an intensified campaign by the Taliban to regain power.

'Today for us, the people of Afghanistan, is a very vital day that will determine our national future. 'We the people of Afghanistan will elect our provincial council members and our president by our secret votes,' he said, his finger stained with the indelible ink being used to prevent people from voting twice. Electoral officials have taken extra measures to prevent fraud after widespread vote-rigging in 2009 marred Mr Karzai's re-election. Strict protocols include bar codes on the ballot boxes delivered by truck and donkey caravans to all 34 provinces and plans to tally the results immediately after the vote closes and post a copy of the results at each centre.","Voters started lining up to vote more than an hour before the polls opened .

"By . Martin Robinson . Golden contract: Cathy Butterworth was given a deal worth £900,000 for just three years' work . A senior police civilian worker was handed a golden contract worth almost £900,000 for just three years' work, it was revealed today. Cathy Butterworth was head of training and development for Greater Manchester Police on a £87,000 salary. But she also received a bonus of up to £8,700 a year, a 'termination payment' of more than £200,000 and a £400,000 pension pot when she hits 55. An internal report has revealed her 'unique' package, with its author admitting the deal was 'particularly well drafted from the employee's perspective'. The report details the 'unique characteristics' of her contract, which handed Ms Butterworth 10 years' worth of extra contribution into her pension pot. It was drawn up by her boss Andrew Marston - who himself had just been granted early retirement and a massive pay-off - and signed by David Whatton, the then Deputy Chief Constable of GMP, who went on to become the top officer at Cheshire police. GMP had considered taking action against now-retired Whatton but the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled he should face no action after hearing he had accepted professional advice. Ms Butterworth's overall remuneration package following her three years as director of learning and development - when her salary, her estimated £400,000 pension and 'termination' payments are added - amounted to £865,000. Report: A Greater Manchester Police report has revealed Ms Butterworth's deal was 'well-drafted' from an 'employees perspective' She left in 2011 after the force agreed a significant pay-off, even though GMP was embarking on a savage £134m cost-cutting exercise that would cost 1,500 jobs. Published accounts for the following year stated the 'termination payment' was £117,413 and GMP bosses insisted at the time it was a routine redundancy pay-off. But the real figure was £204,413 as an additional £87,000 payment was hidden in another section of the accounts, the report confirms. Ms Butterworth is now assistant head of people strategy at Oldham Council and has been warned 'not to count on' her GMP pension. She has declined to comment.","Cathy Butterworth had £87,000 salary, £200,000 pay-off and £400,000 pension pot .

She was referring to the network of elite universities from which are drawn candidates for the top positions of France's corporate and public sectors. The application provides 'simple effective advice, detailed and free,' she added, describing it as 'coaching for all'.

"By . Richard Spillett . Max Clifford arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where he denies 11 counts of indecent assault . Public relations guru Max Clifford was 'charming' and always acted with 'integrity', chat show host Des O'Connor has said. The 82-year-old entertainer appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court, where Clifford is on trial for a string of alleged indecent assaults against seven girls and women. O'Connor told the jury that Clifford, 71, was 'always pleasant and friendly' when he attended the filming of his Des O’Connor Tonight show. O’Connor, who hosted the programme from 1977 to 2002, said Clifford would visit ITV's Teddington studios when one of his clients was appearing as a guest. The pair first met in the 1980s and the publicist would often attend the show with comedian Freddie Starr, who was a regular guest, O’Connor said. Asked whether he ever witnessed Clifford act unprofessionally, O'Connor replied: 'Never. I don’t think he would ever need to in any shape or form. 'He was just there to accompany his client if there was any problem.' The Take Your Pick host told the court that Clifford was 'always pleasant, friendly - that was it'. O'Connor said he became friends with the publicist after he and his wife were invited to charity functions around 20 years ago. O'Connor said: 'It impressed me he cared. He was genuinely, genuinely concerned about the illnesses of the children.' He told the court that Clifford was 'always pleasant, always charming', adding: 'I find it hard to imagine him being anything other than caring, concerned and generally good company.' He added: 'I can’t imagine him being anything other than honest and with integrity. I always found him the man he appeared to be - pleasant, friendly, helpful, kind.' Scroll down for video . Giving evidence at the trial today, Des O'Connor said he never saw Clifford act unprofessionally . Four times married father-of-five O'Connor, wearing a dark suit, shirt and tie, said he had not had any dealings with Clifford's PR company. 'He's never booked me a date or got me any column inches in newspapers,' he said. Richard Horwell QC, defending, asked O'Connor: 'When he attended your shows, have you ever known him to behave inappropriately with a woman? Or heard of any suggestion he behaved inappropriately with a woman?' O'Connor firmly replied: 'No. Not at all, not at all.' Professor Ray Powles, who worked at the Royal Marsden Hospital in west London, later told the court that Clifford arranged for boxing star Muhammad Ali to meet his patients. In a statement read to the court, he said: 'This was a surprise visit. The effect it had on my patients was inspirational.' Clifford would attend the Des O'Connor Tonight show at ITV's studios when one of his celebrity clients was appearing on the programme . The publicist also raised a 'significant amount' for the cancer-specialist hospital and arranged for the boyband Westlife and former Wimbledon tennis champion Pat Cash to visit the children's unit, Prof Powles said. Clifford's first wife Elizabeth trigically died at the Sutton Marsden Hospital in 2003 after a nine-month battle with lung cancer. After a series of claims about the length of Clifford's penis were made earlier in the trial, the jury were today given the results of a medical examination. Richard Horwell QC, defending, told the jury that an agreed fact in the case was that a doctor had measured Clifford's penis at an 'average' length of five and a quarter inches. The jury has previously heard claims that Clifford has a 'micro-penis' measuring two-and-a-half inches, while one woman told the court the publicist's manhood is 'enormous'. Concluding the defence case, Mr Horwell said Dr Ann Coxon measured the celebrity agent's penis last month and it was 'within the average range' for a white male of Clifford’s age. The jury heard from a former doctor at the Royal Marsden hospital, right, that Clifford arranged an 'inspirational' visit by boxer Muhammad Ali, left . The jury then heard the closing speech of prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC, who said the alleged victims had 'no reason to lie'. She asked the jury: 'Can you imagine what courage was needed to speak out against a man apparently courted by the famous and wealthy, with newspapers and media hanging on his every word?' 'A man confident enough in the witness box to laugh at his accusers.' Ms Cottage pointed to the similar 'themes' of the allegations and said some of the women had spoken out 'long before Savile' and the resulting 'media furore'. She said: 'These are not wannabes in the witness box. They're here to give evidence in a criminal trial.' Ms Cottage said 'inconsistencies' about the size of Clifford's penis had been used by the defence to 'deflect' from important evidence. The jury at Southwark Crown Court in central London heard the prosecution's closing speech today . 'What was said about his penis and what he did with it is what's important, not the size,' Ms Cottage said. She added: 'One person's version of normal is another person's version of small. He said it was tiny, that's what he said, he took it out and said 'look at this, it's tiny'. 'He said that to two completely unconnected women who have never met each other before.' Ms Cottage said sex had taken 'centre stage' in Clifford's personal and professional life and told the jury that: 'In his words, ""sex sells"".' The prosecutor said Clifford 'reluctantly agreed' in court to the description in his book of 'sex parties' he attended in the 1970s and 80s and admitted covering up orgies for others in his PR role. She described Clifford as an 'arrogant character', adding: 'This patter, this daring, chancing patter is seen in allegation after allegation. 'He name drops. He does it all the time. He doesn't seem to notice and can't stop himself. In his evidence we got everyone from Simon Cowell to The Beatles. None have any relevance. 'But it is the defendant's way of re-enforcing his importance to his audience - whoever they may be.The police, you the jury, or the girls.' She added: 'He is a man who courts danger. Who is excited by the very risk of being caught.' Wearing a light grey blazer and striped shirt, Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, listened from the dock with the aid of a hearing loop. His daughter, Louise, who has appeared as a defence witness in the trial, sat in the public gallery. Clifford, who the court heard has no previous convictions, denies all 11 counts of indecent assault. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Police have released CCTV images of a suspect they wish to trace in connection with the attempted robbery of the mother and sister of Myleene Klass . TV presenter Myleene Klass is urging members of the public to help find the thug who dragged her pensioner mother along the floor and attempted to steal her sister’s handbag in a terrifying street attack. The distressing incident occurred as the former Hear’Say singer’s 67-year-old mother Magdalena and her sister Jessie, 33, were walking along a north London road on January 7. The suspect eventually fled the scene empty-handed but only after Klass’s sister was assaulted as she resisted the attack, Scotland Yard said. A police spokesman said: ‘The male assaulted her, he dragged her to the ground, pulling her along the pavement and continued to assault her. ‘A 67-year-old woman tried to hold on to the victim and was also dragged along during the violent struggle.’ Police have now released CCTV images of a man they are keen to trace in connection with the incident which happened at around 9.30pm in Whittingham Road, Wood Green. Singer-turned-TV presenter Ms Klass, who has recently joined the Loose Women panel, is hoping the images might encourage witnesses to come forward. She said: ‘I am horrified by what happened to my mum and sister, as anyone would be if this were a member of their own family, and I urge any person that knows anything or can help in any way to please come forward.’ Her sister received minor injuries from the assault but did not require hospital treatment. Both women were very distressed by the incident but no items were stolen, Scotland Yard said. No arrests have been made. Detective Constable Pat Dunne said: ‘This was a terrifying attack on two women on a main road. I’m confident someone will be able to identify the suspect pictured in the images released today.’ Anyone with information about the attempted robbery can contact police on incident hotline number 0203 2763070.

"By . James Rush . Lawyers for the last British prisoner in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre have filed a motion for his release after a medical evaluation diagnosed him with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other 'psychiatric symptoms'. Shaker Aamer has been imprisoned at the U.S. naval base in Cuba for 12 years, despite twice being cleared for release. The father-of-four, from Battersea, south London, was arrested by Afghan militias working for the Americans shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Shaker Aamer (pictured with two of his children) has been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following a medical evaluation at Guantanamo Bay . He has now been diagnosed with PTSD following an assessment by Dr Emily Keram at the prison. The doctor said Mr Aamer had 'additional psychiatric symptoms related to his current confinement... which also gravely diminish his mental health.' She said Mr Aamer also showed evidence of paranoia and depression during the five day evaluation. 'The length, uncertainty and stress of Mr Aamer's confinement has caused significant disruptions in his... ability to function,' she said. 'He is profoundly aware of what he has lost.' She concludes: 'The chronic and severe psychiatric symptoms described above have gravely diminished Mr Aamerâ€™s mental health. 'In order to maximize his prognosis, Mr Aamer requires psychiatric treatment, as well as reintegration into his family and society and minimization his re-exposure to trauma and reminders of trauma.' The medical evaluation, requested by Mr Aamer's legal team, including Clive Stafford Smith, the director of legal action charity Reprieve, also detailed physical disorders, including severe oedema, debilitating headaches, asthma and chronic urinary retention. Mr Aamer, who has never seen his youngest son as he was born after his capture in Afghanistan, has previously said his only desire is to be reunited with his family in London. Aamer has been imprisoned at the naval base in Cuba for 12 years, despite twice being cleared for release . Mr Aamer's lawyers filed a motion in a court in Washington D.C. yesterday requesting his immediate release in light of the report's findings. Mr Stafford Smith also sent a copy of the report to Foreign Secretary William Hague, requesting an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief in support of the motion. Mr Stafford Smith said: 'This desperate news about Shaker's mental and physical state comes on top of twelve years of abuse, and it's hardly surprising to learn from an independent doctor that he is suffering severe PTSD in Guantanamo. 'Shaker has described himself as a rusty old car that is falling apart. There is no reason he should not have come home to his wife and kids when he was cleared, seven years ago.' Mr Aamer's legal team filed a motion in a court in Washington D.C. yesterday seeking his release on the basis of the report's findings. Pictured are detainees at Camp Delta at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in July 2004 . A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Mr Aamerâ€™s case remains a high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency.' According to the BBC, the U.S. has reportedly only cleared him for transfer to Saudi Arabia. In July last year, comedian Frankie Boyle went on a hunger strike in solidarity with Mr Aamer in a bid to provoke debate about his human rights. Boyle was among a number of people who were taking it in turns to go for a week without eating to show support for Mr Aamer, who is a legal, permanent resident of the UK and is married to a British national. In October it was reported Guantanamo Bay prisoner Ibrahim Idris was to be released after being deemed severely mentally ill. Guards keep watch inside a cell block at Camp 5 maximum security facility, at Guantanamo Bay, in 2007. Mr Aamer was arrested by Afghan militias working for the Americans shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan . US District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a release order for Mr Idris, a native of Sudan who had been held as an enemy combatant but not formally charged. He had spent much of his time at a psychiatric ward on the US naval base since he arrived more than 11 years earlier. The decision came after the laywers for the US Department of Justice filed court papers indicating the government would no longer oppose his release. The filing did not specifically say why the government decided to drop its objection. Idris' lawyers had repeatedly argued his illness was so severe he could not pose a security threat.","Shaker Aamer diagnosed with PTSD following medical evaluation at prison .

"By . Hugo Gye . A woman who was crushed between two cars has spoken her shock at being hit by a stolen Volkswagen Golf as she was cleaning her own convertible in the drive of her home. Elena Berek suffered a broken leg and smashed pelvis in the crash - but she could have been much more badly injured as bricks from the garden wall flew towards her head. In the aftermath of the horrendous accident, she assumed that the driver would help her, but instead he tried to reverse the car and ended up running away. Scroll down for video . Horror: Elena Berek was trapped between two cars after one of them was struck by a hit-and-run driver . Injuries: Ms Berek was forced to spend three weeks in hospital with a broken leg and pelvis . Recovery: The businesswoman now says she is lucky to be alive after the terrifying accident last month . Ms Berek, 46, was cleaning her Chrysler Crossfire outside her home in Coventry on a Sunday morning last month when she saw a black Golf heading towards her at 70mph. The car smashed through her garden wall and hurtled into another vehicle, which careered into Ms Berek so she had to be freed by firefighters. 'I can't quite believe how dramatic it was,' she said. 'One minute I was washing my car and the next thing I was completely trapped. It could have been fatal and I just can't believe I got out alive. 'The driver was completely out of control. I was forced over the front of the bonnet and bricks from the garden wall came flying just over my head. The bricks missed me by just a few centimetres. I was so lucky. 'I saw the driver from a sideways angle and hoped he was going to come and help me, but after he couldn't re-start the car, he turned and fled on foot. 'It was an early Sunday morning so none of my neighbours were around to see it. I was jammed between the two cars and shaking like a leaf.' Drama: The incident was caught on camera by Ms Berek's brother Tony after she accidentally phoned him . Rescue: Firefighters pulled the victim out from between the two vehicles with the help of paramedics . Danger: Ms Berek says she was nearly killed by flying bricks after a stolen car crashed through the wall . Emergency services battled for an hour to free Ms Berek, in shocking scenes captured on camera by her brother Tony. She said: 'I was actually texting Tony at the time but the crash caused me to accidentally call him. All he could hear was my screaming and he rushed over within minutes. 'I couldn't feel any pain at first but as soon as I was freed by the fire crews it all kicked in. It was a miracle I got out alive. I just remember screaming my lungs out for help.' Ms Berek's partner Maggie, 59, who runs a green energy firm with her, was inside their home at the time of the crash. 'I was inside doing the ironing when I heard this huge explosion,' she said. 'All I could hear was Elena screaming my name. 'At first I thought a bomb had gone off, it was terrifying but my only thought was to go to Elena. I ran outside and it was carnage - she was trapped between the two cars.' Carnage: The stolen VW Golf pictured in the aftermath of the accident, when the driver had fled the scene .

Police are still hunting for the motorist who apparently stole the Golf and then fled the scene of the accident - he is described as a white man in his early 20s with black hair. 'It could have been so much worse so I am trying to stay positive about my injuries, but it is going to be at least six weeks before I can put any weight on my leg,' Ms Berek said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Peter Fincham has now admitted more needs to be done to embrace older viewers . He is the first to admit he is guilty of being besotted with chasing a youth audience. But ITV executive Peter Fincham has now confessed ‘the simple truth, not be resisted’. It is the older age group who drive viewing figures and they need to be given programmes they have an appetite for. From the BBC’s hit drama Last Tango in Halifax, a love story between elderly Celia and Alan, played by Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, to the box office smash hit film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which tells the tale of pensioners looking for a warm place in India to retire, are recent examples of the tremendous value of the Grey vote. Now ITV is to follow suit with the launch of it’s new family entertainment show Amazing Greys which will be hosted by 69-year-old veteran presenter Angela Rippon. The programme will see young contestants take on some of the country’s most talented pensioners and the decision to commission the show is a reflection of how important it now is to TV bosses that they are seen to embrace older viewers. A point not lost on Mr Fincham as the director of programmes for ITV he is regarded as the arbiter of what the nation views and has now admitted more needs to be done to embrace older viewers. In an interview for the Radio Times he said: ‘The simple truth, not to be resisted is that as people go through life they watch more television. There’s no point in swimming against the tide. So we make programmes that appeal to that audience – though not at the expense of others. ‘ . Mr Fincham admits there was a point when television was once fixated with youth. He said: ‘It looked as if it was the way TV was going. But it was never going that way, to be absolutely honest. And all those people who watched yoof TV  - an expression you never hear these days – are probably watching gardening programmes now because they are no longer young.’ According to statistics most of the people (54 per cent) watching BBC1 are over 55. BBC2’s audience is even older – 59 per cent over 55. ITV1 is broadly the same, though they are less public with their figures. Mr Fincham’s views are echoed by presenter Michael Burke. The former newsreader said he had also noticed a turn in the tide for elderly presenters and stars. He said: ‘Older presenters were cut down in droves, much as you would prune the raspberries to make way for new growth. Fair enough, in my view, though many cried ""Ageism!"" and several went to tribunals. ITV is to launch a new family quiz show Amazing Greys which will be hosted by 69-year-old veteran presenter Angela Rippon . 'Presenter, in any case, is a very recent job description dreamt up to describe somebody who fronts a programme without any special reason for being on it. 'And if you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice, I can’t see why you should keep it when you don’t. 'As the wonderfully acerbic Anne Robinson said, ""The viewers don’t want to watch ugly. 'She seemed to say it through gritted teeth, or at least a flawless but strangely taut face – a sign perhaps that she had taken her own advice to stop complaining and work on staying attractive.

"By . Neil Ashton . Tim Sherwood watched Tottenham thump Sunderland on Monday night knowing it was already too late to stop him losing his job as White Hart Lane manager next month. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy held a meeting to make it clear he has chosen to go in a different direction at the end of the season after what he sees as a failed experiment with his highly-rated academy coach. Levy, who did not attend Monday night’s game, wants current Holland coach Louis van Gaal to start work after this summer’s World Cup, having learned that the 62-year-old can now negotiate a pre-contract. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tim Sherwood's journey as Spurs head coach . On his way: Sherwood (centre) will leave Tottenham in the summer despite Monday night's win . Great Dane: Christian Eriksen was awarded man of the match on Monday night . No-show: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was not there to watch the 5-1 win . After the game, Sherwood said: ‘I don’t want anyone to feel  sorry for me. You’d rather have a pre-season, bringing in your own players, but that was not the case for me so I’ve just got on with it.’ Sherwood, 45, who succeeded Andre Villas-Boas in December, is determined to stay in charge for the last five games of the season but refused to be drawn on his future. ‘I can’t comment on anything about my employment, you’ll have to ask my employers,’ he added. ‘You’re never going to turn down the opportunity to take that job like I did. ‘I’m relishing this opportunity to manage such a big club. My record is second to none here.’ Sherwood is likely to make a clean break from White Hart Lane after nearly six years with the club and try to get another chance as a manager. The former Spurs midfielder was brought back by Harry Redknapp, initially as a first-team coach, and then impressively guided the youngsters. But just one win in six matches before . Monday night, combined with Sherwood’s outspoken comments criticising . the character of his players, persuaded Levy to go for more experience. Van . Gaal was always his first choice, but has been waiting to decide his . future while there were rumours that Manchester United might part with . David Moyes. The Dutchman accepts that will not happen now. Waiting in the wings: Louis van Gaal steps down as Holland coach after the World Cup . Starting chance: England Under 21 international Harry Kane celebrates scoring Spurs's third . Double trouble: Emmanuel Adebayor - rejuvenated under Sherwood - scored twice . Levy has also kept tabs on Southampton’s Mauricio Pochettino and Frank De Boer, who has just won the Dutch title with Ajax. Carlo Ancelotti was another option after a rocky spell at Real Madrid but he is now closing in on a Champions League semi-final. After scoring twice, striker Emmanuel Adebayor paid tribute to Sherwood, saying: ‘No matter what happens to the manager, I respect him. ‘He has been a big part of my life. When everyone forgot me he brought me back and gave me my life back.’ This was a damaging result for Sunderland boss Gus Poyet, who said: ‘I am the manager and I take responsibility. ‘Sometimes the table doesn’t lie. It would be a miracle to stay up.’ Smiles better: Sherwood has just five games left in charge at White Hart Lane .","Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood will be replaced at end of the season .

"By . Simon Jones . Oscar Garcia is poised to leave Brighton this summer. Brighton are eighth in the Championship and just five points off the play-offs yet the Spanish manager has grown frustrated with the club's transfer dealings and it's understood wants a different challenge. Swansea and Norwich will both be alerted by his decision as the former Barcelona youth coach has impressed with his style and ability to keep Brighton in the hunt for promotion despite losing players such as Liam Bridcutt and Ashley Barnes. Moving on: Oscar Garcia (left) is considering leaving his post at Brighton in the summer . Interest: Swansea are also understood to be considering Dennis Bergkamp (left) and Marcelo Biesla . Swansea are considering coaching changes in the summer. Although interim manager Garry Monk remains a key part of those plans, the club are weighing up alternatives with Ajax assistant coach Dennis Bergkamp and former Chile boss Marcelo Bielsa among them. Norwich will seek a new coach to take over from caretaker Neil Adams at the end of the season following Chris Hughton's sacking. Malky Mackay is among the favourites but will have to settle any outstanding wrangle with Cardiff owner Vincent Tan first. Garcia, 40, is young and suits the profile both clubs are seeking as they look to maintain and impose a possession and passing style to stay in the Premier League.","Oscar Garcia has grown frustrated with Brighton's transfer dealings .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . The owner of Britain's only super-size restaurant which served up food deemed 'unfit for human consumption' walked free from court today - after swindling £38,000 in benefits. Inside the kitchen of Sizzle and Grill in Cardiff lay rotten 'green slimy, smelly' raw meat, Cardiff Crown Court was told but despite the findings, the restaurant remains open. When food hygiene inspectors visited the site they found an opened bag of 'foul smelling' raw frogs' legs, dirt-encrusted taps and grease smeared walls and floors. Scroll down for video . Sizzle and Grill on Cowbridge Road in Cardiff served up rotting meat in dirty grease-smeared kitchens . Behind the doors of the Sizzle and Grill lay rotting foul-smelling green meat . Super-size burgers such as this one were served up to customers unwittingly eating food prepared in the filthy kitchen . Paul Stevens, 54, has owned the restaurant since 2009 where delicacies included kangaroo testicles. Stevens, who has been in the catering industry for 30 years, walked free from court today with a two year suspended sentence. Sentencing, Mr PK Lewis said that the fact that no customers had been taken ill after eating the food was a 'stroke of good fortune'. Stevens, from Splott, Cardiff, took on the restaurant in 2009 after a brief spell of unemployment but failed to declare his new circumstances - and continued claiming benefits. Over three and a half years he claimed housing benefit, council tax benefit, carers’ allowance and incapacity benefit as the main carer for his disabled wife Cheryl. The total sum racked up to £37,380, more than £10,000 a year. While he was profiteering from the benefits claims, Stevens' kitchen was serving up 'exotic meat challenges' with zebra, crocodile and camel on the menu. But inspections over at eight-month period revealed the kitchen on Cowbridge Road East, Cardiff,  to be a filthy pit, with pate past its expiry date, bags of rotting meat and only a dirty cloth for chefs to clean their hands on. When inspectors visited the site Mr Stevens admitted the restaurant was not the 'cleanest place'. His lawyer  Ruth Smith said: 'He said ‘I know our cleanliness is not up to scratch. We will get it done. I am not going to kid and say it’s the cleanest place.' Paul Stevens walked free today with a suspended sentence despite serving up food which was 'unfit' for human consumption . The filthy and messy restaurant was filled with rotting food and stacked with rubbish . Pate well past its sell-by date was rotting within the kitchen . Machinery at the restaurant was filthy, like this dirt-encrusted microwave used to warm food served up to customers . Customers ordered from this lengthy menu without knowing the conditions in which their food was prepared . The fast food restaurant - whose delicacies include kangaroo testicles, scorpions, ants, and mealworms - claims to be the only place in Britain that serves huge mega-meals inspired by American TV show Man v Food, where host Adam Richman takes on a series of gut-busting gastronomic challenges. Yet during the inspections, Cardiff council’s environmental health team found raw chicken stored alongside bread rolls, raw meat and fish stored with ready-to-eat foods and inadequate disinfectantand cleaning facilities. The kitchen was also filthy with floors and walls covered in grease and food debris strewn with out-of-date meat and duck pate. Cutlery was dirty, cobwebs lined the ceiling and meals were warmed in a food-splattered microwave. Staff were also failing to wash their hands while preparing food, but instead wiped them on a cloth left strewn on food surfaces. There was also no soap at the sinks in the men’s toilets and the toilet seat, pan and flush were described as needing a 'thorough clean' by inspectors. The women’s toilet was also found in a putrid state, with cracked, dirty tiles. Filthy tiles that were rarely cleaned at the Cardiff eatery . Bags of raw meat were stored alongside bread in the juice-filled rank fridge . The kitchen was also filthy with floors and walls covered in grease and food debris strewn with out-of-date meat and duck pate. Cutlery was dirty, cobwebs lined the ceiling and meals were warmed in a food-splattered microwave . Christian Jowett, prosecuting, said that Stevens had been 'confrontational and uncooperative' during a follow-up inspection despite serving food that was 'likely to be unfit for human consumption'. 'There was no cleaning schedule and there was no training procedure for staff, although Stevens said he was the only food handler,' said Mr Jowett. 'Meat was found out of date and green, slimy and smelly.' Inspectors gave the Sizzle and Grill a food hygiene rating of 0, which means urgent improvement is necessary. The restaurant was given a hygiene rating of 0, now raised to 2, but it still remains open . Junk was stacked up inside the restaurant where inspectors found the bathrooms filthy with cracked tiles . The restaurant, where Stevens still works and employ six members of staff, has now improved its rating to 2, meaning improvement is still necessary. Ruth Smith, defending, urged the recorder of Cardiff, Mr PK Lewis QC, to consider a suspended sentence for Stevens as he cares for his disabled wife and also his mother, who has Alzheimer’s. 'I don’t agree that he said he didn’t do anything wrong,' said Ms Smith. 'He said ‘I know our cleanliness is not up to scratch. We will get it done. I am not going to kid and say it’s the cleanest place.' The benefit cheat had swindled £40,000 in benefits over a three-year-period . Sentencing Mr PK Lewis ruled that it had been a 'stroke of good fortune' that no one had been taken ill after eating the food at the restaurant . Paul Stevens pleaded guilty to 18 breaches of food hygiene regulations and two counts of benefit fraud at Cardiff Crown Court . Raw meat was stored alongside bread in the filthy fridge at the restaurant where dishes such as these huge sundae were dished up to diners . Despite the squalor, the restaurant which employs six members of staff will remain open . Ms Smith, defending, told the court that no-one reported being ill after eating at Sizzle and Grill. 'He realises what jeopardy he’s put himself into and all those around him,' she said. Stevens pleaded guilty to 18 food hygiene offences and two counts of failing to notify changes in circumstances when claiming benefits. Mr PK Lewis, sentencing, said inspectors found his restaurant in a 'shameful condition'. 'The fact that no member of the public was made unwell was a stroke of good fortune.' Mr PK Lewis sentenced Stevens to a two-year suspended sentence for the food hygiene regulation breaches and a two-year conditional discharge for his benefit fraud. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of community service. Mr PK Lewis said: 'I bear in mind that you employ a number of people at the restaurant and if I were to send you to prison they would lose their livelihood and that concerns me.

"By . Candace Sutton . England has reclaimed rugby league superstar Slammin' Sam Burgess, one of the four remarkable brothers who have made a new life in Australia following their father's tragic and untimely death from motor neurone disease. Australian rugby league is in shock as the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) pulled off the coup, paying a rumoured £500,000 to buy Burgess out of his contract as captain of foundation club, the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The news is also a blow to Australian girls, who have gone mad for Sam and his three brothers, who have a been as big a hit on the playing field as they have on the Sydney social scene. Proud: Julie Burgess pictured with sons Thomas, George, Luke and Sam after a South Sydney Rabbitohs match . The raid is a setback for the club's main shareholder, New Zealand-born Hollywood star Russell Crowe, who took a personal interest in hiring all four Dewsbury-born brothers to play in Australia, which has the toughest rugby league competition in the world. However, the player's manager, James Erskine, said Crowe would not stand in the way of Sam Burgess's dream to play for his home country in next year's World Cup Rugby tournament in England. Crowe went 'out of his way' to help the brothers, followed by their widowed mother, Julie, to relocate three years ago to Sydney. Australian girls who have snapped up the Burgess brothers include catwalk model, here catwalk model Yolanda Hodgson and Luke, 26, eldest of the rugby league star brothers parade at  Sydney's Coogee Beach with the first baby, daughter Grace Luca . Sam, 25, elder brother Luke, 26, and 21-year-old twins, Tom and George, have been a footballing and media sensation for the club, known as 'Souths'. Tom and George have also been approached to play for England in the World Cup, but Sam is the only brother who is planning to switch codes entirely and leave South Sydney to play club rugby in the UK. Julie Burgess now works as a teacher for private Sydney boys school, The Scots College, and has revelled in her new life in Australia, six years after losing her husband. Huge star: Actor Russell Crowe, is a main shareholder of South Sydney and personally signed Sam Burgess in 2010 . Mark Burgess, a rugby league footballer who played for clubs in Manchester, Nottingham and Yorkshire, was aged only 45 when he succumbed to motor neurone disease six years ago. In a documentary made by Russell Crowe, Sam recalled the number of steps - 21 - he had to take when carrying his father upstairs to his bedroom while he was dying. It was a journey he made so often that the number is still etched in Sam's mind. The tragedy pulled the family closer together. When Russell Crowe head-hunted Sam to sign him over from the Bradford Bulls to South Sydney, the family soon followed and have taken well to life in Australia. Raid on Australia: English rugby's Steve McNamara wants three of the  four Sydney-based Burgess brothers in to play in his World Cup squad for 2015 . In the summer they go to the beach and were recently photographed in buff form on the sands. In the winter, they play football. Last year, with all four brothers on board, the Souths club scored its best season in decades, narrowly missing out on making the grand final. The Burgess brothers formed one of the strongest forward packs in the competition. Australian girls went mad for the brothers, who were snapped up by some of the country's most glamorous women. Luke and girlfriend Yolanda Hodgson, who made the top 10 on Australia's Next Top Model in 2011, last year welcomed their first child, Grace Luca Burgess. Sam Burgess romanced X Factor star, Joelle Hadjia, although the pair split last December. Tom is dating Miss Universe Australia, Laura Dundovic. The youngest Burgess brothers, 21-year-old Tom (left) and George (right) seen in top form on Sydney's Coogee Beach, are in huge demand among Australian girls and by English rugby union selectors who want them to play in next year's world cup tournament . Australians hearts went out to the boys when Fox Sports broadcast a documentary about the family, with footage of Sam recalling his father's slow painful death and footage of him visiting his grave in the UK. The film also features Russell Crowe presenting a tearful Sam Burgess before his first game for South Sydney with a Rabbitohs membership card bearing his father’s name. In the film, Crowe talks about how he admires the Burgess men's dedication to playing rugby league, and the special moment when all four brothers played together  last year for the first time. It was also a special moment for rugby league's proudest football mother, Julie Burgess. 'This weekend I’ve got just one game (to go to) in the same place for the first time ever,’’ she said afterward. From Yorkshire to Sydney and back again: English rugby union slecetors have swooped on Sam Burgess, pictured at the South Sydney Rabbitohs home stadium in Australia, and enticed him back to play for the UK, paying a rumoured £500,000 transfer fee . Sam's decision to part ways with his adopted country comes as he is in England with his brothers for the funeral of their grandfather. The 25-year-old advised Crowe that English rugby authorities had approached him to switch codes while he was in Britain for the Rugby League World Cup last year. He told Crowe he was excited about playing for England rugby union's biggest tournament. He has changed his Twitter profile to: 'just a Yorkshire lad living in Sydney right now. I've got the best family in the world'. Burgess has accepted an offer from an Aviva Premiership club — understood to be Bath — and his departure from league will be confirmed once financial terms have been finalised. Sam has spoken of the debt all four brothers owe their late father. ‘He was bulky, really big, with wide shoulders, just under six feet,’ recalled Sam. ‘A typical front rower with big, massive legs, like a square. My mum’s 6ft 1in, so we have some good genes.’ Mother Julie, 51, acknowledges they are a close knit family and living in Australia has been good for them . 'The boys are so close and they always have been,' she said. 'Luke has always been the bossiest, Sam the happiest and Tom did all his talking for his twin George, who is the quietest. Their bond is still the same. Losing their father in their teens was a traumatic experience and it has definitely brought them closer. ‘They really look after each other and they look after me now. We live within 10 minutes of each other and often get together for dinner, three or four times a week.'","English rugby steals back star from Australian league .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A couple who went through four failed IVF cycles have finally become parents after a friend offered to carry their pregnancy as a surrogate. West Virginia-based Sandi and Philip Palmisano, aged 46 and 44 respectively, were on standby as Andrea Rivas gave birth to their fraternal twins, EmmaLee and Grayson, on February 4 via a planned C-section. Mrs Rivas, 28, who has two-year-old twins herself via IVF, told the Today show that 'now we have four miracles between all of us' and she and her husband, Mark, 39, think of the Palmisano's children as 'cousins' to their own. Scroll down for video . Unbreakable bond: Sandi and Philip Palmisano (left) are now parents to twins after Andrea Rivas (pictured right with her husband Mark) decided to be their gestational surrogate . Meanwhile an emotional Mrs Palmisano added: 'It's just very overwhelming . . . the journey was very difficult. '[But] the joy that Andrea and Mark has [given us] is hard to put into words.' The Palmisanos and Rivases met while they were receiving treatment at the Shady Grove Fertility Center near Washington, D.C back in 2010. While the Rivases witnessed success the Palmisanos found that they were getting 'nowhere'. Cause for celebration: The two families pictured shortly after the twins were born . 'The joy that Andrea and Mark has [given us] is hard to put into words,' an emotional Mrs Palmisano said . Act of kindness: Mrs Rivas put herself forward as a gestational surrogate after getting the go-ahead from her husband - she gave birth this February via a planned C-section . Doctors told them they would need a gestational carrier to move forward with treatment. Mrs Palmisano mentioned this 'blow' to Mrs Rivas while attending a friend's baby shower and was surprised when Mrs Rivas - then eight months pregnant - put herself forward. Recalling the event, Mrs Rivas told the Herald Mail Media: 'Even though I was pregnant with my twins and I hadn’t even talked to my husband about it, I blurted out, ""I will do it for you."" 'With this journey together, growing our children and giving birth to our children, we've grown even closer' 'I think we both were a little surprised that those words were coming out of my mouth, but I truly was sincere.' After getting the go-ahead from her husband and giving birth to her own boy and girl twins, Connor and Avery, on February 1 2012., Mrs Rivas became a gestational surrogate for the Palmisanos. The first two embryo transfers failed but the third time around everything went according to plan. The couples got together, sharing images of prenatal scans and the Palmisanos even took Mrs Rivas her favorite snacks as she witnessed pregnancy cravings. They also took dozens of photographs with Mrs Rivas. One humorous shot shows Mrs Rivas with the Palmisanos holding a sign reading 'Their buns my oven.' Sleeping soundly: Doctors delivered 6lb Grayson and 7lb  EmmaLee within one minute of each other . Hard work: The new twins go through 22 diapers and 16 bottles a day . The mother-of-two delivered the Palmisanos’ babies in February at the Meritus Medical Center in Hagerstown, Maryland. She could only have one other person with her in the operating room, and it was decided that Mrs Palmisano would be present, while both husbands waited outside. 'It was incredible to have Sandi with me and to see the look on her face when she saw her beautiful babies for the first time,' Mrs Rivas recalled. 'It was incredible to have Sandi with me . and to see the look on her face when she saw her beautiful babies for . the first time' Doctors delivered 6lb Grayson and 7lb  EmmaLee within one minute of each other. The twins now require 22 diaper changes and 16 bottle feeds a day, leaving their parents with around four hours of sleep as they stir throughout the night. Thankfully the Palmisanos have been receiving lots of tips from the Rivas' on bringing up the twins and the couples meet up on a regular basis. Touching on her friendship with Mrs Rivas, Mrs Palmisano concluded: 'We have a beautiful relationship. I love her like a sister. 'With this journey together, growing our children and giving birth to our children, we’ve grown even closer. I know, without a shadow of doubt, we are lifelong friends and we’ll remain very close for the remainder of our lives.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . He is fashion's lifelong enfant terrible who created that iconic conical bra for Madonna. And now Jean Paul Gaultier is being honoured with the first major exhibition dedicated to his work in his 40-year career. The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier . From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk is being held in London's Barbican . Centre, and displays some of his most controversial pieces for stars . such as Beyoncé, Kylie, and Beth Ditto. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Last night Jean Paul Gaultier opened the doors to his new exhibition at the Barbican . Unveiling the exhibition today, the iconic couturier said it was an 'honour' to exhibit in the city of 'Eurotrash and punk' that has inspired him for so many years. The designer said gratefully that the British capital embraced his controversial designs from the outset: 'London loved it, Paris didn't give a sh**. 'In Britain you say it is ""no sex we are English"" but that is so not true. It is almost the opposite in fact.' Seated in a wheeled armchair - one of his . own creations - the 61-year-old spun around on stage as he . discussed his work. He described discovering corsets with his grandmother as a child. The designer has created outfits for some of world's most famous celebrities, including the late Amy Winehouse - one of her ensembles, pictured far right . The exhibit showcases some very original designs, such as a feathered corset for men (left) and a Spitting Image puppet of the designer himself (right) 'I was going to my grandmother's more and more. She was a faith healer. She was making beauty masks and doing tarots. She was telling me the same thing - ""you will have a good life and be loved"". 'She would tell women to change their hair for their husbands, it made me think how you can change the way you look. 'One . time I was there on my own and saw a corset. And she told me she was . wearing it, during last century, and she told me she drank vinegar to . contract her stomach to make her waist teeny. It was quite dramatic. Twenty years later I made a dress like that, because of that.' Gaultier became interested in corsets at a young age because his grandmother wore them often . The conical bra became one of the designer's signature creations . At school, while the other boys played football, he drew sketches of women in fishnet tights. 'My teacher made me put my hand out . and hit me, she then pinned the sketch on my back and made me parade . around the class. She wanted to humiliate me. But in the end, all the . boys were saying ""can you do a sketch for me!"". 'It . showed me that it could be a passport and it could open doors and . people could love me. So I went on to sketch and sketch and sketch and . then made clothes.' His schoolboy dream led him to become a catwalk pioneer, introducing latex and S&M to the world of high fashion. Jean Paul Gaultier originally rejected the idea of an exhibition as he wasn't sure if fashion would work in a museum . The designs on show trace the evolution of Gaultier's glittering  40-year career . The designer has always been a fan of Great Britan and invited a Queen Elizabeth look-a-like to the opening last night . Known for being inspired by strong female muses, including Madonna and Beth Ditto, Gaultier says he set out to change the image of women as passive, subservient characters. He said: 'I always found it strange that models were told to be beautiful and shut up. I find that very scandalous. I like girls to speak during the show, not to be a robot, to express themselves. 'Women were just seen as a sex object. I wanted them to express and I wanted a man to be a sex object too.' Jean Paul Gaultier says he was sick of women just being sex objects and that he wanted his models to express themselves on the catwalk and in photographs . Despite his extravagant creations, Gaultier has gained a wide celebrity following, from Madonna to Sarah Jessica Parker . He jokingly added: 'I think that's happened now as you get so many cougars...' The controversial fashion genius originally rejected the idea of an exhibition. He said: 'At first I didn't want it because a museum is for when you are dead. And I didn't think it would work in a museum, fashion.' But once he got on board, he applied his notorious inventiveness to develop an original and fascinating show. Gaultier's classic nautical stripe also appears regularly throughout the exhibition . Fashion today has been swept by a wave of androgyny, with girls swapping heels for trainers, dresses for boyfriend jeans. 'I have nothing against that. On the contrary, I think it is good to have it. 'Even if it looks the opposite, I am a minimalist. And also the opposite. You have to be creative with a simple thing to make an effect. 'But I try to make novelty out of things I like. To be honest, I don't think I can follow the trends. People copy each other, I don't think I can do that. For me, if you propose a different thing you can attract other people. If you are creating the same outfit as everyone else people will just say ""why you""?' Sex and bondage are regular themes in the designer's work . The exhibition will open to the public tomorrow and run until August this year . The designer, who was heavily influenced by London's dandies, punks and Eurotrash, said he has waited years to look back on his history with the city. He said: 'This show is like an homage to everything I love about London. 'I am super excited that the show is coming to London for two reasons. The first reason is that I always want to go to London, because London, for me, is a special place. 'In England I've got so many memories and I've had so many experiences and the English were the first ones to come to my shows and appreciate my fashion. The designer was joined by many celebrities at the exhibition's launch last night, including the heavily pregnant model Erin O'Connor, pictured here . 'I like the spirit, the humour and little adventures that were funny, like Eurotrash. 'I am very proud to show it to you. Even though I am a frog, I hope you enjoy it!' What's next? He doesn't know: 'I think I'm very lucky. 'I did fashion because there was a 1940s movie showing couturier and I said I want to do that profession. He has a muse, I wanted to have a muse and do a fashion show. Other celebrity guests included Janet Street Porter (left) and hat designer Stephen Jones (right) Guests were served champagne by waiters who wore the designer's signature nautical stripe and sailor hats .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Inconvenient, fussy, and at times downright awkward - words most women would acquaint with getting a bra fitted in-store. This is what inspired a frustrated San Francisco-native and ex-Google marketer, Heidi Zak, with the help of a team of scientists, to develop ThirdLove, an app that can accurately calculate your bra size using only a handful of carefully posed selfies. 'Eighty per cent of women wear the wrong bra size,' Kelly Boynton, a representative for the company tells MailOnline. 'Our sizing technology is accurate to a half inch which, based on our testing with focus groups, is more accurate than a seasoned tailor using measuring tape.' Innovation: ThirdLove, an app created by ex-Google marketer Heidi Zak, claims it can accurately calculate your bra size using two carefully posed selfies . The app uses computer vision technology, . which analyzes body size in relation to the iPhone’s size - a science . that took over a year to perfect under the direction of computer engineer Aran Nefian. Ms Zak started the company a year ago with her husband, venture capitalist Dave Spector - a business partnership which works 'really well' for the couple, according to Ms Zak. She was previously a Google marketing manager and before that, she was director of retail giant Aeropostale. With a keen interest in pairing fashion with technology, Ms Zak hired designer Ra’el Cohen, who has been busy producing several lingerie lines for the ThirdLove, using its own sizing method, to create bras which start at $39 on their website. Get ready: The process was slightly complicated and took a while to get our head around, but we were guided through it step-by-step by an automated female voice . Time for a selfie! The app uses computer vision technology, which analyzes body size in relation to the iPhone's dimensions . Fresh take: ThirdLove found gaps in industry standard sizing and has designed a range of their own label bras accordingly, which come in half sizes . The FEMAIL team were highly skeptical that taking a few selfies could produce a ‘prefect’ bra size, but I was taken through the process step-by-step by an encouraging, automated female voice. A total of two photos are captured in front of the mirror, one from the front and one from the side, and though I stripped down to my bra, as suggested, it is optional to wear a tight fitting T-Shirt if you'd prefer. I'm assured the entire measurement process runs through a computer, not a human, and the photos are stored on a secure, security-audited server. I was surprised to be told I was a 33F by their sizing, a hop and a skip away from my usual 32E, and unfortunately ThirdLove politely informed me  that they didn't yet carry my slightly unusual size. Studies have indicated that up to 80 per cent of women are wearing the wrong sized bra, perhaps in part due to the frustrating business of getting fitted properly . 'We are just getting started but extending our size range is very much part of our plan,' Ms Boynton assured me. Our deputy editor also test-drove the app and had better luck, coming out as a 29B1/2 and chose a nude, lacy bra for $64 from the online store. The bra arrived within three days and much to her surprise, and the fit was 'absolutely perfect' she says, adding that it was incredibly comfortable and really did feel as though it had been molded specifically to her shape. Entirely sold on the concept, and eager to order again from ThirdLove once they stock my size, I spoke to Ms Boynton more about what makes the technology so compelling. Result: Our tester was thrilled with her customized bra, similar to the one pictured, for $64, reporting that it fitted her 'perfectly' 'We've done a lot of in-house testing with focus groups and have found that when a human is measuring, there is a high likelihood of human-error,' she explains, with examples ranging from the placement of the measuring tape, to the customer's fidgeting or breathing in or out. Speaking of ThirdLove's sizing methods, Ms Boynton points out that the industry standard sizes are 'limited' and 'there are gaps.' Many women, our own tester included, apparently fall in between cup sizes. The ThirdLove app certainly worked for us, but could this really spell the future of bra shopping? Hands on approach: High-end boutique, Intimacy, is skeptical than an app can measure up to an in-person fitting . One high-end lingerie boutique chain we spoke to had concerns. Intimacy, whose bras cost anywhere from $75 up to over $250 each, trains its stylists to a high standard and prides itself on its one-on-one customer experience. 'There is much more to fitting a bra properly than picking up a size,' Katie Cornett, a stylist at the New York store explains. 'Even if a woman gets a bra in the correct size, without being shown how to adjust herself, she may think they are fit improperly.' Ms Cornett added that educating a woman on how to adjust herself is an extremely important part of the fitting process. 'It is almost impossible to do this correctly and comfortably without having someone to help you and show you how,' she adds. Variation: My stylist explained that there are large discrepancies in women's sizes and styles offered, so it is best to be assessed by a trained professional in order to find the right bra . Eager to find out if she was right, I visited the New York Intimacy store to get a private fitting. Having been incorrectly measured recently, with tape I should add, at Victoria's Secret and sold a bra that is far too uncomfortable to wear, I was highly impressed with the service at Intimacy. Aside from the rather unforgiving lighting in the changing room - essential, I'm told, for getting a good look at me - my stylist was charming and knowledgeable and I learned a great deal from the visit. As with the team at ThirdLove, she frowned on using a tape measure and insisted that sizing by (a highly trained) eye was the best way to go. Luxury: This tester visited Intimacy's New York store, pictured, and was met with a highly professional and informative stylist and a wide selection of lingerie . She explained the importance of getting the straps adjusted correctly; something I thought I had down, but with a few quick alterations, she transformed how the everyday bra I was already wearing felt and I instantly noticed a shift in my posture. She also informed me that one of the most common issues she sees is women wearing the back bands too high on their backs and that ultimately, there is such a disparity between women's bodies and the different styles available, that nothing can beat an in-person fitting. After some lengthy experimentation with a variety of the brands that Intimacy stocks, I walked out with a beautiful red set of lingerie for $200 and a $76 sports bra so unbelievably supportive - my stylist had me doing jumping jacks  - that I'm at least telling myself I will be seeing a lot more of the treadmill from now on. Pricier option: I walked away with a well-fitted bra and matching panties, similar to the one pictured, which set me back $200 . While most of us have experienced the discomfort of wearing the wrong sized bra, as far as medical science is concerned, it's a problem which can lead to more long-term issues. Many experts have already linked badly fitting bras with poor posture and spinal problems, as well as breathing problems, abrasions and breast pain. Osteopath and expert voice on the matter, Jon Morton-Bell warns: 'If a woman is bending forward because of insufficient breast support, the trapezius overstretches and causes headaches.' Back health: The consequences of wearing an ill-fitting bra have been well documented by the medical community and include back pain, poor posture and even headaches or stomach issues . 'All nerve roots come from the back; so stomach upsets and fatigue are common by-products of bad back health,' he added. Having tested both ThirdLove; the high-tech app experience and Intimacy; the custom bra-fitting service, the jury is still out. If you are lucky enough to be one of the sizes ThirdLove currently stocks, you could be happily surprised by how well their bras fit, and for a reasonable price. If you are willing to take the time to visit one of Intimacy's impeccably trained experts - and to invest substantially more in the cost, your game-changing bra could well be waiting.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . It has long been said it's possible to die from a broken heart - and now scientists say the phenomenon can also be triggered by the shock of natural disasters. They have discovered the stress of hurricanes and earthquakes can trigger a condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Also known as broken heart syndrome, this is where the heart muscle becomes temporarily enlarged and weakened. Scientists have discovered that natural disasters such as tornadoes (the aftermath of the one that hit Joplin, Missouri, is pictured) can trigger a condition called broken heart syndrome . Researchers found that disaster areas such as Joplin - where this tornado struck in 2011 - had higher rates of the potentially fatal condition that year . It is often triggered . by extreme physical or emotional stress – for example, being in a car . accident or losing a child or spouse, say the U.S. researchers. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy got its name because the abnormal shape of . the heart resembles a Japanese octopus fishing pot (tako=octopus, . tsubo=pot). Previous research has linked broken heart syndrome to natural disasters, including . the 2004 earthquake in Japan. Now, scientists at the University of Arkansas have studied catastrophies in the U.S. They found dramatic spikes in cases of broken heart syndrome in two states after major natural disasters, suggesting the stress of disasters as a likely trigger. They identified 21,748 patients diagnosed with cases of broken heart syndrome in 2011 using a nationwide hospital discharge database. After mapping the cases by state, Vermont and Missouri emerged as having the highest rate of cases, with 380 cases per million residents in Vermont and 169 per million in Missouri. A distraught woman in Banda Aceh after the Asian tsunami in 2004. Researches say broken heart syndrome is triggered by stress and causes the heart muscle becomes temporarily enlarged and weakened . Most states had fewer than 150 cases per million residents. New Hampshire and Hawaii had the lowest rate of the disease that year. The rate of broken heart cases in Vermont in 2011 was more than double most other states. This was the same year that Tropical Storm Irene pummeled the state with heavy rain and wind, causing the most devastation Vermont has experienced since the Great Flood of 1927. Similarly, researchers found broken heart syndrome at a rate of 169 cases per million in Missouri in 2011, the same year a massive tornado ripped through the state's town of Joplin, demolishing neighborhoods and killing at least 158 people. 'Despite the seemingly increasing number of natural disasters we have, there is limited data about how it might affect the heart,' said Dr Sadip Pant, lead investigator of the study. Vermont, which fell victim to Hurricane Irene in the same year, also had one of the highest rates of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Image shows flood damage in Quechee, near White River Junction . 'Our findings suggest two disasters, one in Vermont and one in Missouri, might have been possible triggers for the clustering of takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases in these regions.' Patients with broken heart syndrome often complain of chest pain and shortness of breath, symptoms that mimic those of a heart attack, which can delay diagnosis. While broken heart syndrome typically resolves within a month or two, in the acute scenario it can result in serious complications such as heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and stroke. Previous studies by the same group found that as many as one in four patients with broken heart syndrome have some form of arrhythmia and one to seven per cent suffer cardiac arrest. Many patients are diagnosed once doctors see there are no blockages in the artery, or imaging reveals changes in the shape of the heart that are characteristic of broken heart syndrome. Because natural disasters occur . more frequently in some parts of the country, residents in these regions . may have adapted to and experienced less stress during such . occurrences. A woman caught up in the 2003  Xinjiang earthquake, which destroyed the Chinese town. While broken heart syndrome typically resolves within a month or two, in the acute scenario it can result in serious complications such as heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and stroke . However in places such as Vermont, where natural disasters are . relatively rare, people may be more susceptible to extreme stress when a . disaster hits particularly hard. 'By and large, it is a very reversible form of cardiomyopathy, but in the acute phase, these patients need to be monitored closely to be sure they are stable and to prevent and manage problems,' added Dr Pant. 'It's also something that emergency doctors and medical personnel need to be aware of as they are often on the frontlines seeing patients after disaster strikes. The authors add that different people's threshold for stress may also affect rates of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Gravestones tumbled over at cemetry at Jiganji temple in Ojiya, northern Japan after strong earthquakes in 2004. Rates of broken heart syndrome rose there shortly afterwards . Episodes are thought to be driven by the sympathetic response and surges of adrenaline in the body, similar to the well-known fight-or-flight reaction. This leads to depressed function of the apex and middle segment of the heart and increased contractility of the base producing a balloon-like appearance. 'It's a perfect example of our brain-heart connection,' said Dr Pant. 'The emotional stress we have in our brain can lead to responses in the heart, and not much is known about this condition.' The research was presented at the American . College of Cardiology's 63rd Annual Scientific Session.","Stress of natural disasters triggers takotsubo cardiomyopathy .

"By . Emma Innes . A GP is being investigated amid claims he failed to diagnose a two-year-old with leukaemia and dismissed her symptoms as ‘toddler bruising’. Sarah Sargent, 31, took her daughter, Lacey, to the doctor when worrying bruises began appearing on her body. She claims Dr David Pelta didn’t even get out of his chair during the brief 30 second check-up at Queensway Surgery in Southend, Essex. Lacey Sargent was diagnosed with leukaemia after developing bruising. But, when her mother first took her to the GP, she was sent away and told she had 'toddler bruising' She is pictured before her illness . She said he glanced over his desk, said it was ‘toddler bruising’ and there was nothing he could do and then sent them home. Two days later, Lacey’s condition worsened and Mrs Sargent and her husband Stuart, 30, took their daughter back to see another GP at the surgery. This time, Dr Michael Jack immediately referred Lacey to Southend Hospital where she was diagnosed with leukaemia. In the seven months since, Lacey has had numerous blood transfusions and painful bone marrow tests and been forced to take chemotherapy tablets at home. But the family have finally had some good news after being told the treatment is working. It means Lacey has just one month left of taking medication before she is slowly weaned off the chemotherapy. Lacey's mother, Sarah, says Dr David Pelta just spent 30 seconds with her and that he did not check her over . NHS England IS investigating Dr Pelta who has voluntarily left the practice pending their report. Mrs Sargent, of Southend, Essex, said the GP should be permanently struck off. The mother-of-three said: ‘I took Lacey to see him and he didn’t even get out of his chair. He just peered over the table and said “it’s just toddler bruising”. ‘I just thought “I’m not a doctor, I don’t know” so I left and made another appointment for blood tests in two weeks’ time. ‘The second doctor examined her four times and immediately admitted her to hospital. He knew what was wrong but didn’t want to say. After months of chemotherapy, Lacey is now responding well to treatment and will soon be weaned off medication . ‘When we found out it was awful. You just don’t expect any of your children to come down with leukaemia.’ She added: ‘It has been horrible but she has been happy the whole way through and I’m so proud of her. ‘There is always a chance that it can come back which is extremely scary. I don’t think I could go through it again. ‘Now we want Dr Pelta struck off. We want to protect other families. You have to do your job properly and he didn’t.’ Mrs Sargent says she spoke about her concerns to a pharmacist before seeing Dr Pelta in August last year and they told her Lacey should have a blood test. Dr Pelta is also being investigated by the General Medical Council over separate allegations. He has been placed under a series of restrictions since November last year after concerns over his medical notes. He is one of four doctors who saw a 20-year-old before she died from heart failure. Jodie Fields’ family have refused to accept an inquest ruling that she died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome and say her symptoms should have been picked up sooner. A GMC spokeswoman said: ‘I can confirm that the GMC is investigating. ‘Dr Pelta has restrictions on his practice while the investigation is on-going. They were imposed on October 17.’ In a statement released by the Medical Protection Society, Dr Pelta, of Westcliff, Essex, said: ‘While matters are being investigated, I voluntarily agreed not to attend the practice. ‘I cannot comment while there is an investigation taking place.’ Ian Stidston, director of commissioning for NHS England Essex, said he couldn’t comment on individual cases. Fatigue and pale skin - this is because leukaemia can cause anaemia which makes a child feel weak, tired and light-headed. Infections and fever - children with leukaemia lack normal white blood cells which would normally help fight infection. Easy bruising or bleeding - this includes frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and bleeding a lot from small cuts. Bone or joint pain - this is caused by a build up of leukaemia cells near the surface of the bone or inside the joint. Swelling of the abdomen - leukaemia cells may collect in the liver and spleen causing them to enlarge. Loss of appetite and weight loss - if the spleen and liver swell, they can press against the stomach causing loss of appetite. Swollen lymph nodes - some leukaemias spread to the lymph nodes causing them to swell. Source: American Cancer Society .","Sarah Sargent took daughter Lacey to the GP with unexplained bruising .

"By . Emma Innes . A father has braved four storey-high waves and a force nine gale to row across the Atlantic Ocean in a bid to help find a cure for his son’s illness. James Prior, 49, from Wandsworth, London, has raised more than £100,000 to pay for research into a cure for Crohn’s disease. The father-of-four took on the gruelling trial because his son, Fergus, 10, has the crippling digestive condition. James Prior, 49, has raised more than £100,000 for Crohn's and Colitis UK by rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. His son, Fergus, 10, has the crippling digestive condition, Crohn's disease . Mr Prior, and seven others, rowed from Gran Canaria to Barbados in 32 days. They travelled in an open-topped boat and braved a force nine gale. They are pictured after arriving in Barbados (Mr Prior is third from right) Mr Prior, who had never rowed before, told MailOnline: ‘It was extremely brutal from start to finish – it’s a very hard routine of rowing for two hours on and two hours off during the day, and four hours on and four hours off during the night. ‘We were delighted when we finally saw land and it was fantastic to see our families again.’ He added: ‘Fergus deals with his condition incredibly well, despite getting frustrated, he takes his pain on and never complains. ‘He’s a fighter and I took on the Atlantic challenge to highlight the daily challenges faced by people with Crohn’s and colitis. ‘These can be tough conditions to live with, and while I was up against the Atlantic elements for one month, Fergus has a lifetime of Crohn’s challenges ahead of him. We want to help by tracking down the elusive cure.' Mr Prior said: 'We were delighted when we finally saw land and it was fantastic to see our families again.' He is pictured greeting his wife, Fiona, when he arrived in Barbados . Mr Prior, and eight others, rowed . unsupported from Gran Canaria to Barbados in 32 days and 22 hours before . arriving in Barbados on March 15. During the challenge they rowed through a force nine gale and experienced conditions Mr Prior described as ‘like a non-stop huge rollercoaster’. They lived off dehydrated food and slept in the base of the open-topped rowing boat. Mr Prior said: 'I was very respectful of what was to come. I knew it would be a huge challenge - and it certainly didn’t let us down. I was very grateful to my fellow rowers who all rowed very strongly.' He added: ‘Fergus was absolutely thrilled when I got back. All of the boys have been amazing throughout. Fergus was very sweet about it.' Fergus suffers severe stomach pains, he struggles to put on weight and has a poor appetite because of his Crohn's disease. About every six months he has to be tube-fed a highly nutritious liquid diet for eight weeks . Fergus was just five years old when he was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. This is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. The . inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system from the mouth . to the back passage, but it most commonly occurs in the small intestine . and the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss. The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be linked to genetics, an immune system problem, or a previous infection. Fergus (pictured with his brothers, Archie, 11, Max, eight, and Henry, six) may eventually need strong drugs or surgery but he can't have the medication yet as it could weaken his immune system or prevent him growing . There is no cure so the aim of treatment is to stop the inflammation and to relieve symptoms. In some cases, surgery is required to remove damaged parts of the intestines. Fergus’ mother, Fiona Prior, first noticed his symptoms when he was about two and a half. She says she was aware he was going to the toilet a lot and that he seemed tired and had a poor appetite. She also noticed that he was very thin and that he would go and lie down during meals. He also suffered from chronic stomach pains. Mr Prior said that at times the experience was like being on a 'non-stop huge rollercoaster'. The rowers are pictured letting of flares to celebrate arriving in Barbados . Mr Prior, and his fellow rowers, rowed for two hours and then had two hours off during the day and at night they rowed for four hours and then had four hours to sleep . She . told MailOnline: ‘I kept persisting and taking him to the doctor . because I could see that he was not as robust as my other sons. Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.Inflammation . can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back . passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small . intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon).Symptoms . include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the . long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such . as narrowing of the colon.It isn’t fully understood what causes the condition but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role.There . is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to . 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of . the digestive system. There are currently at least 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease in the UK.Crohn's . disease can affect people of all ages, including children. However, . most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30. ‘I just kept being told it was his age, or that I should bring him back in a few months if his condition didn’t improve.’ Eventually, Fergus was given an endoscopy – an internal examination using a camera - but it didn’t show anything. However, a second endoscopy revealed that he had Crohn’s disease. Mrs Prior, who also has three other sons – Archie, 11, Max, eight, and Henry, six - said: ‘Ferg managed to keep everything together but would always have a sore stomach. ‘We were relieved when he was diagnosed – we were relieved to know he finally had a proper diagnosis but it was a big blow as well.’ Immediately after his diagnosis, Fergus was admitted to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital because he had become very thin. He was put on a special, highly nutritious, liquid diet that was fed to him through a tube which was inserted into his stomach via his nose. Fergus, who was also born with just one kidney, was released from hospital after eight days but his parents had to continue to give him the nasal feed every two hours, six times a day for eight weeks. This gave his body time to recover and allowed him to put on some weight. He is too young to be given other medications yet as they could weaken his immune system and prevent him growing properly. As a result, his treatment currently revolves around being given eight weeks of the special nasal feed every time his condition deteriorates. So far, this has happened four times and on every occasion, Mrs Prior has to go to Fergus’ school every two hours to give him the feed. She said: ‘I have to stop everything. My life completely goes on hold. We can’t really go anywhere but we just have to adapt.’ Each time he is put on the liquid diet, it allows his digestive system to recover sufficiently that he is able to cope with normal food for a few months before her starts to lose weight and develop severe symptoms again. Fergus (pictured with his parents, James and Fiona) was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when he was five . At this point, he has to have another spell of being tube-fed. Mrs Prior told MailOnline: ‘Ferg is amazing, he is such an inspiration. He never complains and it never gets him down. He has a great sense of humour. He charms all of the doctors and nurses.’ Mrs Prior says that she and her husband decided to try and make something positive out of the situation so they set themselves the challenge of raising £100,000 for Crohn’s and Colitis UK in a bid to help find a cure. She says Mr Prior considered attempting to climb Mount Everest but decided against it as he has a fear of heights. Fergus said: 'Before this, Dad had never rowed. He is amazing, very brave and we are all incredibly proud of him' As a result, he settled on attempting to break the world record for the quickest row across the Atlantic. Unfortunately, he missed the record by just a few hours as the ocean currents went against the rowers. Before he left, Mrs Prior said: ‘There will be hour by hour pain for James – this is a correlation with the pain Fergus suffers every day. ‘We wanted to come up with something positive we could really get behind and James thought he could turn his mind to rowing.’ Mrs Prior added: ‘I am quite worried. We have been so busy fundraising we have hardly had a minute to stop and think. ‘It will be quite a thing not having him around for about six weeks but we just remember why we are doing it and that keeps us going. ‘I think it’s going to be gruelling and we are suitably respectful of what he is undertaking. ‘James is very focused so I am sure he can do it – I just hope it’s not too gruesome.’ She added: ‘Medical research into a cure is the most important thing. It’s a disease not many people think about so we want to raise awareness too. ‘It’s chronic so Ferg will have to suffer for the rest of his life with it unless a cure can be found.’ Mr Prior added: 'At my age I think I will have to take a forced retirement from rowing. I would certainly look at doing something else though. It was a great challenge and a wonderful thing to do, but I think it’s a younger man’s game.'

"By . Emma Innes . Men who read tabloids are more likely to check their testicles for signs of cancer than broadsheet readers, new research shows. Single men are also less likely to recognise the signs of testicular cancer than men who are in a relationship. And, office workers are the least likely to check their testicles for lumps. New research shows that two thirds of men do not know the signs of testicular cancer . The survey of 3,000 men, carried out for the male cancer charity Orchid, aimed to find out how ‘in touch’ men are with their testicles. It revealed that a worrying two thirds of men in the UK don’t know how to recognise the signs of testicular cancer. It also showed that one in three men would tell their mother or partner if they found a lump, but that they wouldn’t visit a GP. Finally, it revealed that men in London are the least ‘ball aware’ of all men in the UK. Orchid Chief Executive Rebecca Porta said: ‘Awareness of testicular cancer has significantly improved over the past few years, but these findings also illustrate that a large percentage of men are still not taking proactive steps to protect themselves. ‘If caught early, testicular cancer can be 98 per cent curable. Sadly, our findings indicate that men who delay seeking an early diagnosis may risk the disease spreading and a poor response to the treatment. Men who read tabloids, and those who are in a relationship, are more aware of testicular cancer than single broadsheet readers . ‘We were particularly surprised to find that men working in an office environment with easy access to the internet, social media and a wide range of health information tools were least likely to check themselves. ‘We’re calling on men across the UK to take a few minutes to learn about how to carry out simple self-checks and to recognise the early warning signs and symptoms, regardless of their work obligations and pace of life. The earlier they act, the better the outcome.’ The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in one of the testicles. Other symptoms can include pain in a testicle, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, a dull ache in the lower abdomen, fatigue and generally feeling unwell. Testicular cancer is uncommon and usually only affects men between the ages of 15 and 44. It only accounts for one per cent of all cancers that occur in men. It is one of the most treatable types of cancer with more than 85 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer being completely cured. Even in cases where the cancer has spread outside the testicles, there is about an 80 per cent chance of complete cure. To encourage men to be more informed about male cancers, Orchid is launching its confidential, freephone National Male Cancer Helpline on April 7, 2014. The Helpline is staffed by male cancer specialists every Monday and Wednesday from 10am until 5pm and can be reached on 0808 802 0010. They can also be contacted by emailing helpline@orchid-cancer.org.uk .","Single men are less likely to recognise the signs of testicular cancer .

"By . Fiona Macrae . The paralysed have been offered a ray of hope after British scientists used light to move and control frozen muscles. Experts from University College London and King’s College London made the breakthrough during stem cell research. The work is at an early stage but could one day be adapted to help the paralysed walk again. Experts from University College London and King's College London made the breakthrough during stem cell research. The work is at an early stage but could one day be adapted to help the paralysed walk again. In the shorter term, it could help sufferers of motor neurone disease, which leads to the gradual paralysis of muscles, including those that control breathing and swallowing. Paralysis occurs when motor neurons – specialised nerve cells that relay messages from the brain – become damaged, so the researchers set about replacing them. They began with embryonic stem cells, or ‘chameleon cells’, capable of turning into every tissue in the body. They inserted a gene into the cells that made them sensitive to light and then turned them into motor neurons. These designer cells were then transplanted into mice, where they grew and connected with paralysed muscles. Crucially, when light was shone on them, the muscles moved, the journal Science reports. The researchers now want to create an implant that emits light as needed. The research used designer cells which were transplanted into mice, where they grew and connected with paralysed muscles. Crucially, when light was shone on them, the muscles moved . UCL researcher Professor Linda Greensmith said: ‘A lot of patients live in fear suffocating to death because they can’t breathe or choking to death because they can’t swallow.’ She hopes the first test operations in motor neurone disease patients could start within five years. The breakthrough also offers hope to those left wheelchair-bound by car crashes and other accidents.However, the need to make dozens of muscles walk again means this is a more distant dream.","University College London and King’s College teams made breakthrough .

The Quality Street heiress got into shape for their wedding last autumn by weight lifting with personal trainer Richard Tidmarsh and now Professor Green is trying the same programme . The lanky 6ft 3in singer and rap star started working out in January, when he had a respectable 20.4 per cent body fat. Now, after just eight weeks, he is down to 15.3 per cent fat and has gained 7 kg of lean muscle. Professor Green is the new face of Lynx deodorant, so the public will soon get to see the results for themselves in the notoriously steamy ad shots... People with chronic pain could be helped by improving the quality of their sleep, new research suggests. Dr Nicole Tang said: 'Sleep has a naturally recuperative power. A greater treatment emphasis on sleep may help patients improve their daytime functioning' Feeling less tired helps them be more active – which in turn eases symptoms. Researchers measured the activity, sleep and symptoms of chronic pain patients round the clock for a week. Dr Nicole Tang, of the University of Warwick, said: ‘Engaging in physical activity is a key treatment process in pain management. ‘Very often, clinicians would prescribe exercise classes, physiotherapy, walking and cycling programmes. But who would like to engage in these when they feel like a zombie? ‘Sleep has a naturally recuperative power. A greater treatment emphasis on sleep may help patients improve their daytime functioning.’ It takes four weeks on average to get an appointment with your own GP at a group practice, a survey found. Only one in 20 people see their own doctor every time. The poll of more than 2,300 Britons, by medical negligence solicitors the Medical Accident Group, suggests a family doctor may be a thing of the past. In fact, 72 per cent of people no longer even request an appointment with their own regular doctor.","Professor Green using same personal trainer wife used before wedding .

"By . Sara Malm . A young woman who suffered from anorexia for more than six years has beaten the eating disorder  thanks to Pilates. Emily Sullivan, 22, suffered three heart attacks while suffering from anorexia and bulimia, a battle which started at the age of 15 and saw her weight drop to just six stone by the time she was 20. Ms Sullivan, who says she developed an eating disorder to cope with bullying at school and the death of her grandmother, was told by doctors she only had months to live unless she changed her habits. Back to health: Emily Sullivan, 22, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, has been able to make a full recovery from her anorexia thanks to Pilates . At her lowest point, Ms Sullivan, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, was finally admitted to hospital in November 2012 after suffering three suspected heart attacks . On being discharged, she discovered Pilates and just a few months later had become a healthy size 8. Ms Sullivan now wants to start teaching Pilates and is studying for a diploma in to become and instructor. ‘When the bullies used to tell me I was fat and ugly, I started to believe them,’ Ms Sullivan says. ‘I broke down my own self confidence . from then on by being negative about myself, but what started as cutting calories spiralled out of control. ‘During . treatment I wasn’t allowed to exercise, it was seen as a negative . because a lot of the patients would use it as a way to lose weight. Long way back: Emily suffered three heart attacks while battling anorexia, a fight which saw her weight drop to just six stone, pictured left during her illness and right, back to a healthy weight . ‘When I was released from day treatment I felt really uncomfortable in my body, I was exhausted, depressed and had lost all my strength. I wanted to find something new to try and I had heard about Pilates. ‘I started doing about two classes a week and I soon found not only was I good at it, but I loved it, too. ‘I finally found my drive and ambition again which is something I thought I had lost. 'I was rebuilding my body and it felt amazing. It made me happy which was something I hadn’t felt in ages.’ At just 15, Ms Sullivan at first found it easy to hide her eating disorder from her family. She lived with her mother who was training to be a midwife and working irregular shifts, making it easy for her to skip meals. Where it began: Emily, pictured with a friend while she was ill, began controlling her calorie intake after she was bullied about her weight in school . Low point: Emily at her thinnest. 'When the bullies used to tell me I was fat and ugly, I started to believe them,’ she says . ‘But then I realised that I could eat but that I could get rid of it straight away which is when I developed bulimia. ‘I was 20 when I was finally diagnosed, but there wasn’t enough help. The waiting list for the clinic in Cheltenham was about a year. Nothing really happened until I collapsed at university.’ Ms Sullivan was referred for day treatment but instead of making her better, it just made her worse. She said: ‘Everyone there is so thin and it made me feel like I wasn’t good enough. My body couldn’t deal with it and even when I tried to keep food down I was regurgitating it every five minutes.’ The constant throwing up had done some serious damage to her body. A healthy person has potassium levels between 3.5 and five, but hers had fallen to just two, which put her at serious risk of heart attacks or even organ failure. Healthy weight: More than six years after she first fell is, Emily is now fully recovered from her eating disorder, according to doctors, but says she sees it as an ongoing process . Then in November 2012, she collapsed with a suspected heart attack. She said; ‘My whole body cramped up. I couldn’t breathe and just curled up in a ball. ‘I had another two attacks, the first by the side of the road and another one in the consultant’s office. ‘He . just took me into a room and said ""this is getting ridiculous now"". He . told me I would be dead in a month - that I wouldn’t make it until the . end of the year. ‘I was admitted to The Priory the same day.’ Onwards and upwards: Emily is now studying to become a Pilates instructor . Ms Sullivan spent two weeks in hospital where she had to eat three meals a day . and drink high calorie, nutritional drinks. She was only allowed access . to a bathroom at certain times, and even then she was supervised. She said: ‘It was incredibly difficult, but when you reach that point you get a sense of unison with the other people there. 'You can’t not eat the meal because you’ll be letting the others down. ‘I came out after a couple of weeks. The purpose wasn’t to feed me back up again; it was to condition me into not being sick all the time. ‘I went back into day treatment but again it didn’t help.’ But shortly after leaving day treatment, while undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy, Ms Sullivan discovered Pilates. This is a system of exercises designed to improve strength, flexibility, and posture, and enhance mental awareness. It gave her a new lease of life and for the first time in a long she decided to actively try and get better. She said: ‘Finding something that made me happy gave me something to focus on. ‘As well as being a Pilates instructor, I want to go into schools and talk about healthy body image - there is too much focus on weight. ‘I will never see myself as recovered. You are never fully recovered from something like this. It’s an ongoing process. Recovery isn’t an easy road; it is full of bumps and setbacks. ‘But now I have the tools to cope and the opportunity to try to be as happy as possible, make the most of life and learn to love in the skin that I am in.’","Emily Sullivan suffered three heart attacks during battle with anorexia .

Streams in High Definition 1080p with Dolby Digital Plus Surround Sound . Box is 0.7” thinFire TV’s remote uses bluetooth . Voice search using microphone on remote . Average price of paid games is $1.85 . Available from today, it allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps. To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. 'Voice search that actually works means no more typing on an alphabet grid. 'Our exclusive new ASAP feature predicts the shows you’ll want to watch and gets them ready to stream instantly.

'And our open approach gives you not just Amazon Instant Video and Prime Instant Video, but also Netflix, Hulu Plus, and more. On Fire TV you can watch Alpha House and House of Cards.' The Fire TV service has been discussed with at least three major media companies, according to reports. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. The $99 Amazon Fire TV also has an optional $40 game controller (seen at rear) Earlier reports claim the set-top box is being developed by Amazon’s Lab126 division in Cupertino, close to Apple's campus, and is being run by Malachy Moynihan, a former vice president of emerging video products at Cisco who also worked for Apple. It comes as Amazon has been ramping up its video content. Amazon invested about $1 billion in content in 2013, according to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali. Last year it introduced 14 televisions pilots, which it financed, and is now monitoring customer feedback to decide which ones to produce as full series. The Amazon shows included Alpha House, starring John Goodman, the Hollywood actor known for his roles in The Big Lebowski and Argo. Bill Murray, of Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day, also appears. The $99 box is available from today . Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios, the unit that is creating the shows, said: ‘I think the distinction between a regular TV show and an online TV show will soon fade away. ‘It just makes sense that if you’re trying to decide what TV show to make, it might be a good idea to ask customers which one they like.’ Each pilot is available on Amazon Instant Video or Lovefilm for free, with viewer feedback deciding which show will get a full series order from the company. Alpha house, starring John Goodman (second left) is one of Amazon's latest TV shows. The firm is expected to reveal a set top box next week. The company has also paid to secure exclusive streaming rights to hit shows such as Downton Abbey. The firm also recently acquired video studio Double Helix Games, fuelling rumours the box could double as a games console.. Amazon already has its own studio, developing games for iOS and Android gadgets, and this acquisition suggests the firm is looking to expand this part of the business further. TechCrunch discovered leaked details about the acquisition earlier this week and Amazon has since confirmed it bought the company as part of its 'ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers.' Following reports last week Amazon is working on games console, the retail giant, pictured, has fuelled these rumours by acquiring Double Helix Games. Amazon already has it own games studio and the acquisition suggests the firm is looking to expand this part of the business further . Double Helix Games was set up in 2007 following a merger between studios, The Collective and Shiny Entertainment. Previous to that the firms had been respectively building games since the mid-1990s. Recent titles produced by Double Helix Games include G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and Silent Hill: Homecoming. The firm is based in Irvine, California and employs 75 people. Rumours about an impending games console were reported last week by gaming blog VG24/7. The 'gaming and entertainment device' is set to cost $300 (£180) and will run on Android. It is expected to go on sale later this year. Any games console Amazon makes will directly compete with the likes of Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. The company is also starting from an established base of more than 200 million customers, and already has a strong software base, with its Amazon store, alongside hardware such as the Kindle e-reader, and the Kindle range of tablets.

"By . Emma Innes . A woman told she was infertile after gruelling treatment for a brain tumour has given birth to a healthy baby. Nicole Malloy, from Halbeath, Fife, feared the worst when doctors called her in after spotting something on a routine scan. ‘Hysterical’ that her cancer had returned, the 22-year-old couldn’t believe it when she was told she was in fact 19 weeks pregnant. Nicole Malloy, 22, was told she would not be able to have a baby because of treatment she had received for a brain tumour. So, she was delighted when she was told she was pregnant with Denny . She gave birth to her son Denny on December 3, nearly a month premature. When she was just four years old Miss Malloy escaped without long term health problems after developing meningitis. However, at the age of 11 she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. The golf ball-sized tumour was discovered after she complained of headaches and double vision. After a successful operation to remove the tumour, she underwent several further operations to insert a pressure-relieving shunt into her head. The cancer left her with balance and memory problems. Miss Malloy was hysterical when doctors told her they had found something unusual on a routine scan as she feared it meant her cancer had returned. She was delighted when she was told she was actually pregnant . Miss Malloy was diagnosed with a brain tumour when she was 11 and she had to have surgery and radiotherapy. She was devastated when doctors told her she would not be able to have children . Denny was born almost a month early weighing 5lb 12oz but he is healthy despite his mother's health problems . The radiotherapy she received also damaged her hormones and disrupted her menstrual cycle - doctors warned she would not be able to have children and would undergo an early menopause. So when doctors told her they had discovered something during endocrine and oncology check-ups she feared her cancer had returned, or menopause had begun. The new mother said: ‘When I was going through my illness, I just wanted to die. I couldn’t see myself getting better. Every step I took I would just fall back. ‘So when I was told I wouldn’t have children I was just devastated. When the doctor told me I was pregnant, I was just so happy, I couldn’t believe it. ‘I didn’t think I was pregnant - I thought I was going through early menopause.’ Miss Malloy had to have surgery and radiotherapy to treat her tumour and she was left with balance, memory and hormone problems. She is pictured at the age of 12, after treatment for the tumour . Until she was told she was pregnant, Miss Malloy thought she was going through early menopause . She admitted that prior to discovering she was expecting she had been to a spiritualist event in Glasgow - where she was told she would have children. She said: ‘When I was told that, I thought, no, that’s not going to happen. ‘Now when I look at Denny, I am just so happy. Sometimes I just can’t believe it - he’s just a wee miracle.’ Her mother, Angie Kempson, 45, said: ‘The cancer can affect her spine as well and on July 29 she went to the Western General in Edinburgh for a brain and spine scan. ‘When we got back we got a phone call saying that something had showed up and she should go and see the GP. Nicole was just hysterical. Miss Malloy (pictured during her cancer treatment) said: 'When I was told I wouldn't have children I was just devastated. When the doctor told me I was pregnant, I was just so happy, I couldn't believe it' Doctors were worried baby Denny might be affected by drugs his mother was taking as they should not be taken during pregnancy. Luckily, they do not appear to have affected him . Miss Malloy (pictured when she was ill) says Denny is her 'miracle baby' ‘When we got to the doctor we were told something had shown up but it wasn’t at the top, it was at the bottom of the spine. ‘They thought she might have a cyst on her ovaries - or that she might be pregnant. ‘She was crying and I was being sick, because she had been on medication and treatment she shouldn’t have been on when you’re pregnant. ‘The doctor referred her to the antenatal clinic at Queen Margaret Hospital but we went out and paid for a scan because we were so worried, and found she was 19 weeks pregnant.’ Denny was delivered by C-section on December 3, weighing 5lb 12oz, 26 days before his due date. However, little Denny had a ‘massive’ haemangioma - lump of blood vessels - on the back of his neck, and Ms Kempson admitted she ‘freaked’ given her daughter’s medical history. However, doctors said it’s not life-threatening and he’s on medication to shrink it.","Nicole Malloy was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of 11 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Take a look at a map today, and you’re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland. But in reality China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north . You might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isn’t necessarily the case, according to James Wan writing in the Guardian. Much of this is due to technical reasons, said Mr Wan, while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. Arno Peters (pictured). The Gall-Peters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator . A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface . Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia also isn't as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to cones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar 'Mercator' projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Mr Wan. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in Gall-Peters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. As well, as this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands . The Werner heart-shaped project of the world (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head . For instance, The ‘Be On Guard!’ map was . created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine . and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Hinese Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of East and Western cultures. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off¬shore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map . Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the Americas, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific lapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the used could be at the centre, and which - with mapped content overlaid - can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes at a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and 'less important' regions get ignored. The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest. To counter this, brilliant designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination . Google Maps claims that it is on a 'never-ending quest for the perfect map', but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn't so sure . A Mercator map created in 1569. In the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size . Today, billions of searches are made on Google Maps each day, helping people navigate their way around, streets, towns and countries. Google Maps claims that it is on a ‘never-ending quest for the perfect map’, but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn’t so sure. He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes. ‘No world map is, or can be, a definitive, transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world,’ he writes. ‘Each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users, as their understanding of the world changes.’ This map was used in 1782 by British diplomats negotiating an end to the American War of Independence in Paris. Richard Oswald, secretary to the delegation, annotated it with coloured lines to show where it was thought past treaties established the U.S./Canada border .","The distortion is the result of the Mercator map which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world .
It gives the right shapes of countries but at the cost of distorting sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north .
For instance, north America looks larger, or at least as big, as Africa, and Greenland also looks of comparable size .
In reality, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over .
Map suggests Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size .

"By . Mark Prigg . Microsoft has been forced into an embarrasing u-turn on its Windows software by allowing users to boot into the dekstop and avoid its 'Metro' touch interface. The firm had hoped the system would boost touchscreen usage. However, users complained vociferously, forcing the firm to first agree to reinstate the start button, and now allow users to boot directly into the 'old' Windows interface. Microsoft's Metro interface. It will now allow users with a mouse and keyboard to bypass it completely and boot to the traditional windows desktop . Until now, Microsoft has charged phone and tablet makers between $5 and $15 per device to use its Windows system, as it has done successfully at higher prices for many years with Windows on personal computers. Hardware makers factor the cost of that into the sale price of each device. That model has been obliterated in the past few years by the fast adoption of Google's Android system for phones and tablets, which hardware makers quickly embraced and now accounts for more than 75 percent of all smartphones sold last year. Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad account for most of the rest of the mobile computing market.By contrast, Windows-powered phones held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year. Windows tablets have only about 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech research firm Gartner. The Windows 8.1 system will be available on Tuesday,. Although Microsoft has been pushing touch-screen controls, the new update is designed to make it easier for those with traditional keyboard and mouse controls. The firm also revealed major updates to its phone and tablet versions of Windows, and revealed it will make the software free to manufacturers of low cost devices. New Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella Nadella acknowledged Microsoft's underdog status in the mobile world. 'We are going to innovate with a challenger mindset,' said Nadella in a question and answer session at the developer conference. 'We are not coming at this as some incumbent trying to do the next version of Windows, we are going to come at this by innovating in every dimension.' 'Our vision, simply put, is to thrive in this world of mobile first, cloud first,' said Nadella. 'Our goal is to really build platforms, create the best end-user experiences, the best developer opportunities and IT infrastructure for this ubiquitous computing world.' Also at the gathering, Microsoft formally announced it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the Build conference, where the first admitted it had made mistakes in windows and was making it easier to use with a mouse and keyboard . The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive. The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones, said Belfiore. He announced that the latest version of Microsoft's smartphone software, called Windows Phone 8.1, will be rolled out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few months, and new phones running the software will be in stores by late April or early May. 'Microsoft is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth needle, this is a good and logical first step,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Windows will be free for companies making phones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches for the consumer market. A license fee will still apply for business devices. It comes a week after new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella unveiled new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel applications for Apple Inc's iPad. A year's free subscription to Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 service will be offered on the new devices running the free Windows, Microsoft said.","Firm will allow users to avoid Metro til interface entirely in windows 8.1 update .

"By . Mark Prigg . A radical 30ft high bamboo 'flower basket' could help give water to underdeveloped areas, it has been claimed. The structure harnesses condensation from the air using a specially-developed material. Called WarkaWater, its Italian inventor hopes it could bring drinking water to villages in Africa. Helping to end thirst: WarkaWater  is a project conceived for the mountainous regions in Ethiopia, where women and children walk several hours to collect water. The 9 metre tall bamboo framework (mock-ups pictured) has a special fabric hanging inside capable to collect drinkable water . The name ‘WarkaWater’ comes from the Warka Tree, a giant wild fig tree native to Ethiopia, traditionally used for public gatherings and school education. These trees are a very important part of the ecosystem and culture of Ethiopia and its disappearance seems unfortunately unavoidable. In many areas, they are known as the 'source of life' 'WarkaWater is designed to provide clean water as well as ensure long-term environmental, financial and social sustainability,' designer Arturo Vittori told Wired. 'Once locals have the necessary know how, they will be able to teach other villages and communities to build the WarkaWater towers.' Each nine-metre tower costs approximately $550 (£330) and can be built in under a week with a four-person team and locally available materials. They are designed for areas where digging wells is not possible. 'WarkaWater' is a project conceived for the mountainous regions in Ethiopia, where women and children walk several hours to collect water, the designers said. The bamboo framework has a specially-engineered fabric hanging inside it, capable of collect fresh water extracting condensation from the air. The lightweight structure can be constructed, lifted and fixed to the ground without special machinery . The tower can also be equipped with a solar-powered LED to provide illumination at night, giving the chance to children to study after sunset and also supporting the social space in the village in the evening . The lightweight structure can be built with local skills and materials by the village inhabitants. Vittori hopes to have two WarkaTowers erected in Ethiopia by 2015 and is looking for financial rainmakers who'd like to seed these tree-inspired structures across the country. The tower is built in sections installed from top down, so no scaffolding is needed.

"By . Laura Topham . Erin Boag defied those who criticised her for dancing while pregnant saying: it's 'good exercise'. She added: 'What do people expect us to do, just sit at home resting all day?' When Erin Boag , star of Strictly Come . Dancing, took to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall at 22 weeks pregnant . in December, she thought nothing of her protruding bump. Her mind was only on delivering the . stunning routines with partner Anton du Beke that have thrilled viewers . for the past ten years. But the audience was not equally unfazed by her dancing ‘in her condition’. One angry fan even rang the venue afterwards to complain – saying they may not have bought a ticket had they known. For in spite of increasing evidence of the benefits of exercising while pregnant – and that ‘putting your feet up’ is an unhealthy thing to do – it remains a controversial subject. ‘The complaint didn’t bother me – I laughed more than anything else,’ says Erin, 39. Now 36 weeks pregnant and due at the end of the month, she is still going to the gym. ‘There’s nothing wrong with dancing while pregnant; it’s good exercise. What do people expect us to do, just sit at home resting all day? ‘I’ve not performed since but still work out and teach dancing – I dance belly to belly with the students to show how it’s done. 'I do get looked at a lot in the gym when I walk in and when I’m working out – especially now I’m really big with only four weeks to go. 'But I think if a lady can work out when pregnant, then good on her. Exercising brings many benefits – like an easier recovery after birth – and I’ll do whatever I can to make things easier.’ As well as speeding recovery after labour, exercising while pregnant is good for the baby; recent research has suggested it can boost brain development, strengthen blood vessels and protect from diabetes. Meanwhile, many pregnant women – and their babies – suffer health problems due to excess weight: obesity in pregnancy can trigger pre-eclampsia, diabetes, and even cause foetal abnormalities. Around half of all mothers-to-be are now overweight or dangerously obese. Erin, who lives in Kingston,  Surrey, with her husband Peter O’Dowd, 48, dropped out of Strictly last May as she wanted to conceive. Erin Boag with her dancing partner Strictly's Anton du Beke. Erin is now 36 weeks pregnant and due at the end of the month but she is still going to the gym . ‘Time was ticking on and I wanted to have a baby – I was already 38 and didn’t want to push it too far. I knew Strictly would be too much if I was pregnant as it is very, very strenuous, and seven days a week, seven hours a day.’ The New Zealand-born dancer conceived naturally within months, but suffered extreme morning sickness – which only swimming eased. ‘From six to 15 weeks I was so sick I didn’t want to see the light of day. Then at 16 weeks a nurse suggested I try swimming, despite being sick, so I dragged myself to the pool and I felt much better. I swam four or five times a week until the nausea went away at 21 weeks.’ She then returned to her regular gym sessions for an hour four or five times a week. Erin pictured left with Vince Cable and right with Strictly Come Dancing presenter Len Goodman . ‘In the past couple of weeks I’ve had to slow down as my body is getting tired – it’s like ploughing through mud. So I now walk on the treadmill, go on the cross trainer and bike, plus do a few light weights. I don’t push myself and I don’t run now as your body releases a hormone to soften the joints so you have to be careful.’ Erin’s exercise regime has the approval of her doctors. ‘I asked my consultant if it was OK to exercise and he said absolutely yes; your body will tell you when to stop, so just listen to your body.’ This advice echoes that of Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr Clive Spence-Jones, who recently said: ‘There is no evidence that exercise during pregnancy can damage the baby or cause complications. ‘A large round-up of studies in 2010 came to this conclusion – the trials reviewed included vigorous non-contact exercise such as swimming, static cycling and floor-exercise programmes. The growing baby is surrounded by fluid in the womb that keeps it well insulated from movement outside.’ The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends moderate exercise such as brisk walking, jogging or cycling, three times a week. Vigorous exercise should be undertaken with caution as the resting heart rate increases during pregnancy. Erin with Anton Du Beke. The pair have a show booked for just seven weeks after the baby's birth . Erin says: ‘I went for a 36-week scan and everything is perfect – there’s a little too much fluid around the baby but doctors aren’t concerned and my blood pressure is fantastic.’ Once the baby is born Erin will be heading straight back to the dancefloor – and the gym – as she and Anton have a show booked just seven weeks after the birth. ‘It gives me a target. I’ve put on two stone and none of my clothes fit: my thighs are like tree trunks, my boobs are huge and my bum… I’m not looking backwards in the mirror until the baby is born. 'The doctors don’t seem concerned but in my profession it’s difficult to come to terms with – my career depends on my fitness and weight. I’m being careful about what I eat and will work very hard once the baby’s born. 'People may criticise but that’s my living – so the baby will be in a pushchair as I go running. ‘But right now it’s all about the baby’s health. I’m really excited and can’t wait to meet the little bundle.’","Danced at 22 weeks pregnant and received call from fan complaining .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A groundbreaking satellite that changes the way we see the world has been launched. Called Sentinel-1A, it launched from French Guiana on 3 April and soon after mission controllers confirmed they had made contact with the craft, to cheering in the control room. It is the first of a pair of satellites to launch into space, with the second - called Sentinel-1B - due to launch in 2015. The pair is the first of the new Esa Sentinel family of satellites that will map our planet like never before. Scroll down for video . Sentinel-1A lifted off on a Soyuz launcher from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana . The Sentinel-1A satellite, artist's impression pictured, will be the first of a pair of Esa satellites to launch into space, with the second - called Sentinel-1B - due to launch in 2015. Their mission will be to monitor the Earth and track changes in its climate . Sentinel-1 is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services. Sentinel-2 is a high-resolution imaging mission that will provide imagery of vegetation, soil and water cover. Sentinel-3 . is a multi-instrument mission to measure sea-surface topography, sea . and land-surface temperature, ocean colour and land colour. Sentinel-4 will be devoted to atmospheric monitoring.Sentinel-5 will monitor the atmosphere from polar orbit. Sentinel-6 carries a radar altimeter to measure global sea-surface height, primarily for operational oceanography and for climate studies. Sentinel 1-A launched on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport and will be placed into an Earth orbit between an altitude of 150 and 250 miles (250 and 400km). Using radar imagery, it will soon begin mapping the surface of Earth. Countries across Europe have spent â‚¬7.5bn (Â£6.2bn; $10.3bn) on the project that will run until the end of the decade. Its sensitivity will allow it to detect changes in the climate - particularly those caused by human interference. This will complement Esa's existing Copernicus Climate Change service, the goal of which is to respond to environmental and societal challenges associated with climate variability. The Sentinel family of satellites will give scientists the data they need to determine the current state of our planet. It will also enable scientists to continue to fine-tune their predictions of Earth's future. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that our climate will be damaged beyond repair if humanity does not stop harming the environment. Sentinel-1A will be able to observe Earth both day and night, and in any weather conditions - a first for observation satellites. Sentinel 1-A is launching on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport. Soyuz VS07 is pictured being transferred from the preparation building to the Soyuz launch zone in French Guiana on 31 March . This means that during disasters, including floods and earthquakes, the satellite could help provide support and relief for those on the ground. 'Sentinel-1A is using radar waves to image Earth's surface,' Mission Scientist Malcolm Davidson told MailOnline. 'It can penetrate through clouds and map . Earth, so in the case of flooding this ability is important and it can . generate maps of areas that are flooded. 'It can recognise, quite accurately, the difference between water and non-water.' The 1-A, artist's impression pictured, will be the first of six satellites from Esa's new Sentinel family that will map and monitor Earth in unprecedented detail . The Sentinel-1A satellite, artist's impression pictured, will orbit Earth at an altitude of 150 and 250 miles (250 to 400km) Climate studies and disaster relief aren't the only uses for the satellite. Its exceptional level of accuracy means it can also provide information on miniscule details on Earth's surface. From its orbit it is able to detect changes on Earth down to just a few millimetres. This . means it could theoretically predict when a building will collapse, . detect emerging sinkholes in the ground, or study volcanic activity. The Sentinel satellite should allow scientists to develop a forecast system for all volcanoes, including those that are remote and inaccessible. The satellite will give a view of volcanoes and find the link between ground deformation and eruption. Sentinel-1B will launch in 18 months and together the pair will map the entire Earth using radar imagery . It can also track the world's shipping lanes, something that has not yet been done by any satellite in Earth orbit. 'With hazards, such as sinkholes developing, we will be able to look where there will be structural damage over time,' continued Davidson. 'In extreme cases we could predict if a building could collapse or not.' A satellite image of Mount Longonot in Kenya. The new satellite should allow more accurate measurements to be made . All of the Sentinel satellites are expected to be launched in the next few years, and together they will provide data that could be used for 20 to 30 years, according to Davidson. Sentinel-1A is designed to last seven years but Davidson added that, like a fridge, 'you have a guarantee but I think as a consumer you usually hope it lasts longer.'","First of a new family of Esa satellites launches from French Guiana .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The dingo has been known as Australia’s native dog since the arrival of westerners more than 200 years ago. But now the country has redefined a wildlife icon as scientists have said that the dingo is a unique species and not just a common mutt. A new study has resurrected the species name Canis dingo, which was first mentioned by a German naturalist called Friedrich Meyer in 1793. Distinctive: The dingo is a unique species and not a common mutt, scientists have said. The dingo will now officially use its species name Canis dingo, which was first mentioned by a German naturalist called Friedrich Meyer in 1793 . ‘The dingo is distinct from what we describe as a domestic dog; it's a distinct form of canid,’ said Mike Letnic, a University of New South Wales (UNSW) ecologist. Confusion over whether or not the dingo was a distinct species partly originates from the scientific classification of the Australian dingo, which was based on a simple drawing and description in the journal of Australia’s first governor, Arthur Phillip, without reference to a physical specimen. To find a specimen of a dingo unlikely to have cross-bred with domestic dogs, the researchers searched museum collections in Europe, Australia and America that contained specimens known or likely to pre-date 1900. They examined 69 skull specimens and six skin specimens to create a benchmark description of the dingo, whose defining physical features include a relatively broad head with a long snout, as well as erect ears and a bushy tail. The description features in a study published in the Journal of Zoology. It is thought that dingoes were introduced to Australia between three and five thousand years ago, with genetic evidence suggesting they originate from East Asian domestic dogs. The animals bred in isolation until the arrival of domestic dogs after European settlement. An Aboriginal artist is pictured with a painting of a dingo . ‘Now any wild canid – dingo, dog, or hybrid of the two – can be judged against that classification,’ says Dr Matthew Crowther, lead author of the study, from the University of Sydney’s School of Biological Sciences. ‘We can also conclusively say that the dingo is a distinctive Australian wild canid or member of the dog family in its own right, separate from dogs and wolves. The appropriate scientific classification is Canis dingo, as they appear not to be descended from wolves, are distinct from dogs and are not a subspecies,’ he said. Many Australians like to think that dingoes are always yellow, but Dr Letnic said: ‘One of our insights is that coat colour does not define an animal as a dingo, dog or a hybrid. We found that dingoes can be tan, dark, black and tan, white, or can have the sable coloration typical of German Shepherd dogs.' Dingoes are Australia’s largest land predator and play an important role in regulating populations of species such as kangaroos, wallabies and invasive red foxes. The scientists believe that a clearer understanding of dingo numbers, based on the clearer identification, will improve understanding of their role in biodiversity. Dr Crowther said: ‘Distinguishing dingoes from their hybrids (cross-breeds) with feral dogs is a practical concern. Current policies in parts of Australia support the conservation of dingoes but the extermination of “dingo-dogs,” which are considered a major pest because they kill livestock.’ It is thought that dingoes were introduced to Australia between three and five thousand years ago, with genetic evidence suggesting they originate from east Asian domestic dogs. The animals bred in isolation until the arrival of domestic dogs after European settlement. ‘That made distinguishing dingoes from dogs problematic, as the DNA tests and analyses of their physical structure were based on dingoes whose ancestry was not known. They were either captive animals or wild animals of uncertain ancestry,’ Dr Crowther explained.","Scientists at the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales looked at the skulls of dingoes predating 1900 .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is believed to be preparing to unveil its iWatch alongside a new update to its TV box allowing it to download apps at an event in June announced today. The annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will be held in San Francisco from June 2nd. It is expected boss Tim Cook will unveil the much anticipated iWatch concept, which is believed to have health tracking capabilities. Scroll down for video . Apple fan and artist Martin Hajek created these incredible lifelike mockups of an iWatch, whcih he believes could come in two version, with the top of the range being the iWatch S, which has a metal body and leather strap . Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours . Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Apple has refused to hint at what announcement will be made. 'We have the most amazing developer community in the world and have a great week planned for them,' said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. 'Every year the WWDC audience becomes more diverse, with developers from almost every discipline you can imagine and coming from every corner of the globe. 'We look forward to sharing with them our latest advances in iOS and OS X so they can create the next generation of great apps.' The conference, aimed at app developers, WWDC will feature more than 100 technical sessions, and over 1,000 Apple engineers will attend to offer help. In previous years, the company has unveiled major new versions of its iOS and OS X software for Macs at the event, as well as new iPhones - although the firm is not expected to unveil these until September this year. However, Apple fans have not waited for the announcement, and many have released stunning new images of what they believes Apple's iWatch could look like. The latest images reveal two models, a luxury iWatch S with a metal case and leather strap, and a plastic iWatch C. The incredibly realistic images were mocked up by artist and Apple fan Martin Hajek, and even show how the timepiece would look in Apple''s retail stores. The incredibly detailed mockups even reveal how the watch could be displayed in Apple's stores . The mockups are Hajek's second attempt at an iWatch, having worked with Mac User magazine for the first. 'Right after Apple launched the colorful iPhone 5C I figured it would be nice to have a look at adding color to my original iWatch concept,' he said. 'I added some color, simplified the design and basically turned it into an iPhone 5C for around your wrist.' The latest rumours around the secret smartwatch claim Apple has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its iWatch project, it has been claimed. It is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep, letting wearers track and analyse their every movement. Although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch, experts believe it could be released this year. The iWatch c would match Apple's iPhone 5c perfectly . 9to5Mac reported that Roy J.E.M. Raymann -- whose background includes working on wearables, sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined Apple from Philips Research. the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called HealthBook that will be built into the next version of its iOS software, allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect. The firm's iPhone 5S already has a movement tracking chip, called the M5, which is expected to be used in the iWatch. Reports in the New York Times claim the first-generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly, using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases. Yet future models of the wrist-worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge. Solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the iWatch, for example, and harness the sun's energy. The watch imagined by Hajek has a square screen, while it believed the rear could have sensors to monitor a wearer's health. Hajek even revealed some advertising concepts he thought Apple could use for the iWatch . Casio, . for example, already uses solar technology in its G-Shock range of . watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to . recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch. This is further supported by the fact that in September, Apple posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise. Other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8. Another image showing how the iWatch could look in Apple stores . All these current claims back up the plans laid out in an Apple patent filed in 2011. The patent described a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist. It also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.' These current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 Apple patent. The patent described a 'wearable device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap, patent image pictured. Its battery life could be extended, using a 'solar panel array', or 'a kinetic power source . Other watchmakers, including Casio, already use solar technology in their products. For example, the Casio G-Shock, pictured, can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch . 'An accessory device designed to be worn . on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power . generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the . application continued. Similarly, a patent filed in 2009 . detailed how Apple wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of . an arm or leg as the wearer was walking. The . curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent, awarded . last year, which gave Apple the option to install a flexible battery . into future products. Last week, reports claimed Samsung was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next-generation smartwatch, dubbed Galaxy Gear 2. The original watch launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life. Elsewhere, other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen, similar to the concept images pictured, and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8 . Some analysts claimed the device was . rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating . Apple and Google to their respective rumoured devices. Whereas . Apple may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much . about what customers liked, and didn't like, in the Samsung version. Since . the first Apple iWatch rumours emerged in 2012, a number of . artists have created concept images of what it may look like. Apple is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much-rumoured iWatch, concept pictured, to remove the need for wires and chargers.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The free Blab app, pictured, lets users record and send videos to friends, even if the recipient doesn't have the iOS app . After almost a year of teasers, social network Bebo has kickstarted it revival with the release of a video messaging app. Called Blab, the free service lets users record and send videos to friends, even if the recipient doesn't have the iOS app. It is the first of three apps set to be released by the California-based social network this year, and signals that the once floundering firm is getting a reboot. The site itself is also going through a refresh and is set to relaunch 'soon'. Bebo was once the most popular social network in the UK. But following the launch of rival sites such as Facebook and Twitter, its numbers dwindled and the site, as its users knew it, eventually closed down. At the height of its popularity in 2008 - three years after it was created - the site was bought by AOL for $850 million (£510 million). Only five years later the site was trailing behind its rivals in terms of user numbers, and had developed a reputation for being supposedly rife with bullying. To save the company from going under in 2013, its founder Michael Birch bought his site back for a cut-price $1million (£600,000). Birch posted a video shortly after saying it was time to ‘wipe the slate clean’ and promised its users the service would come back fighting. Reports about the Blab app first appeared in February this year, and now the app is available on the Apple App Store. According to the app’s listing: ‘Blab is . the fun app that lets you send quick video messages to your friends and . family! It’s free to Blab anyone, anywhere in the world.' To send a Blab, users select a contact, hold the screen to record their video message, and release to send, pictured left.  If the recipient has the app, a notification appears on the app’s icon. If they don’t, the recipient receives the video in a text message with a link that opens the clip in a browser window . The app connects with the contacts in a user’s phone.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Children of the 1980s spent hours perfecting the art of playing Namco’s Pac-Man computer game. And now computers are teaching each other to play the popular game, which sees a player navigating a maze, trying to gobble up pellets while avoiding four colourful enemies. Researchers have managed to develop a method to allow a computer to give advice and teach skills to another computer in a way that mimics how a real teacher and student might interact - and are demonstrating it with video games. Scroll down for video . Game on: Computers are teaching each other to play Pac-Man (pictured) which sees a player trying to gobble up pellets while avoiding four colourful enemies, thanks to clever algorithms developed by researchers at Washington State University . The team, which was led by Matthew Taylor, Washington State University’s Allred Distinguished Professor in Artificial Intelligence, used virtual robots called agents to simulate the teacher and student relationship. The student robots initially struggled to learn Pac-Man and a version of the video game StarCraft, but the scientists were able to show that with time the student agent learned the games and surpassed the teacher’s abilities. Helping robots to teach each other to play games is an important and challenging are of research in robotics. Experts said that if robots could teach each other tasks, then they could learn to clean houses and make chores a thing of the past, for example. Pay attention: In the study, the scientists programmed their teacher agent to focus on action advice (shown in the text on the right of the screen) as well as giving it no advice so it could learn for itself . ‘As robots become more common, we want them to be able to learn quickly and any time one robot learns something we want to make sure that it can teach that information to another robot, because we don’t want this information to be lost,’ Professor Taylor said. In the study, which was published online in the journal Connection Science, the scientists programmed their teacher agent to focus on action advice or telling a student when to act. They said: ‘As anyone with teenagers knows, the trick is in knowing when the robot should give advice. If it gives no advice, the robot is not teaching. But if it always gives advice, the student gets annoyed and doesn’t learn to outperform the teacher.’ Professor Taylor explained that the team designed algorithms for advice giving and tried to work out when their advice made the most difference to make the learning technique as effective as possible. Must try harder: The team, which was led by Matthew Taylor, Washington State University's Allred Distinguished Professor in Artificial Intelligence, used virtual robots called agents to simulate the teacher and student relationship (illustrated) He aims on developing a curriculum for the agents that starts with simple work and builds to more complex tasks. His ultimate goal is to let agents teach humans new skills. But Professor Taylor said there is no need to worry about computers taking over the world because ‘they’re very dumb’. Even the most advanced robots are easily confused and when they get confused, they stop working, he explained. It often takes two or three times as long as he predicts to get the robots to learn and the easiest way of successfully teaching them new skills is to remove the ‘brains’ of the old one and put them in the new one. Problems occur, though, when hardware and software don’t work in the new model and this approach cannot be used in one of robotics long-term aims, which is to use robots to teach skills to humans, as we cannot simply insert their hard drives. Robots will be smarter than the most intelligent humans within the next 15 years, Google’s engineering head has predicted. Computers will soon be able to learn from experience, tell jokes and even flirt, according to Ray Kurzweil, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) expert. Google has spent billions of its £57billion fortune quietly buying up the world’s top robotics companies, including DeepMind, a British company which specialises in machine learning and Boston Dynamics, which makes advanced military robots. Prophet? Ray Kurzweil (pictured) predicts that the 'Turing test' moment - when computers become cleverer than us - will be passed in 2029 . The 66-year-old entrepreneur and futureologist, who predicted the rise of the internet and that a world chess champion would one day be beaten by a computer, has said machines will outsmart their makers by 2029. In an interview with The Observer, he said: 'My project is ultimately to base search on really understanding what the language means. 'When you write an article, you're not creating an interesting collection of words. You have something to say and Google is devoted to intelligently organising and processing the world's information. 'We want [computers] to read everything on the web and every page of every book, then be able to engage in intelligent dialogue with the user to be able to answer their questions.' Mr Kurzweil predicts that the 'Turing test' moment - when computers become cleverer than us - will be passed in 2029.","Scientists from Washington State University developed a method to allow a computer to give advice to another computer .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It won’t be long until Twitter and Facebook are virtually indistinguishable as the sites continue to borrow features from each other.

The move is seen as another direct move to compete with Facebook and Instagram's photo features. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out a new design that was similarly criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look. The most noticeable change is the size of the cover photo. Twitter added the feature during a redesign in September 2012, five months after Facebook included it as part of its Timeline rejig. Twitter cover photos now appear full-width along the top of the screen, and the profile picture that used to sit in the centre of this cover image has been moved to the left-hand side. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out a new design that was similarly criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look.

"By . Associated Press . A handshake? Sure. A selfie? No way. Some of America's Olympic athletes say they were asked to keep their cellphones in their pockets last week when they visited the White House and met with President Barack Obama. The White House said that's longstanding practice because taking individual photos with hundreds of people wouldn't be practical, and there are official photographers at such events. But the request to the Olympians drew attention because it came after the selfie Boston Red Sox slugger David 'Big Papi' Ortiz took with the president during his team's visit to the White House. Scroll down for video . Don't even think about it: The White House have already started to roll out a ban on selfies with President Obama after Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz took this shot last week, which turned out to a marketing opportunity for Samsung . Many criticized that snapshot as a marketing ploy after Samsung, the maker of the phone Ortiz used, used the picture in an advertisement. Ortiz denied taking the picture with the knowledge it would be part of a promotion. 'I was a little bummed,' said Nick Goepper, a bronze medalist in slopestyle skiing. 'I thought about trying to sneak one, but they were pretty adamant about it. I'm sure if they would've allowed it, there'd be 150 people with selfies with the president right now.' The Olympians were visiting the White House after competing in Sochi, Russia, in February. The president typically invites high-profile sports teams and athletes to Washington to congratulate them on their performances. The White House confirmed that the athletes were asked not to take their own photos with Obama. Winter athlete Nick Goepper says he was 'bummed' to be told he couldn't take a selfie with President Obama during a White House visit in February following the Sochi Olympics. Officials are now said to be looking at a ban of the photos following a stunt last week . The White House said that in the interest of efficiency, it has been practice for years for an official White House photographer to take pictures for large groups instead. It insisted there was no outright prohibition of selfies. 'There's no discussion of a ban,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney. In a statement given to the AP on Monday night, the Red Sox described the guidance they received from White House staff. ""Last . week the Red Sox were told, 'Don't worry about taking your phone out . because there will be a White House photographer on hand.' They weren't . told not to take them out. It was more of a: 'Don't worry, someone will . be there to take pictures with the President if he has time.'"" Ortiz's . selfie shows the sunglass-clad slugger grinning while standing next to . the president and holding up a uniform with ""Obama"" across the back. Ortiz tweeted the photo, and it was resent by tens of thousands of . Twitter users. Olympic 400m sprint gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross takes a picture with U.S. President Barack Obama during a visit to the White House . The White House was not amused. Carney said at the time that the White House objects any time the president's image is used for commercial purposes. On an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, White House Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer said the White House expressed its concerns to Samsung about the ad. ""Maybe this will be the end of all selfies,"" he joked. Turns out, it was — at least for the Olympians. Aerials skier Emily Cook said nobody barred general pictures during the general visit to the White House. But when they were in line to meet the president, they were told to keep their phones in their pockets. ""It would have been fun but I wasn't too bummed,"" Cook said.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Imagine a miniature robo-surgeon sliding into your body through an incision in your stomach.

It can then perform procedures such as an emergency appendectomy or perforate a gastric ulcer. Scroll down for video . This is the scenario being explored by . Nasa in the hope that risky surgical operations in space will someday . become a routine matter. Working in collaboration with Virtual Incision in Lincoln, Nebraska, the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely-operated fist-sized robot doctor. The robot is due to have its first zero-gravity test in the coming months to prove its dexterity and ability to manipulate objects, according to a report New Scientist. The 0.9lb (0.4kg) has two arms fitted with tools to hold, cauterise and suture tissue, while its head is a small video camera. Would you trust a robot with surgical tools? Working in collaboration with Virtual Incision in Lincoln, Nebraska, the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely-operated fist-sized robot doctor . The 0.9lb (0.4kg) has two arms fitted with tools to hold, cauterise and suture tissue, while its head is a small video camera. The camera feed is sent to a control station, where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks. The . robot would be remote-controlled, although controlling it from as far . away as Earth would mean impracticable delays in communication. Instead, the plan is to train astronauts to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other. The camera feed is sent to a control station, where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks. 'While this work is in an early phase, the minimal invasiveness of this approach could enable its use in remote locations such as on a moon or Mars colony,' researchers wrote in a technical paper on the prototype. The robot would be remote-controlled, although controlling it from as far away as Earth would mean impracticable delays in communication. Instead, Nasa plans to train astronauts to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other. Currently, astronauts on the International Space Station who face medical emergencies can be sent back to Earth in an escape capsule within a matter of hours. But for longer missions, such to Mars, coming home quickly won’t be possible. So far, tests using the prototype have performed on pigs. The next step, said Nasa, is to work in human cadavers. Escape plan: Currently, astronauts on the International Space Station who face medical emergencies can be sent back to Earth in an escape capsule within a matter of hours . A recent study of 12 astronauts show the heart becomes more spherical when exposed to long periods of microgravity in space. The change could lead to significant cardiac problems, according to research to be presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 63rd Annual Scientific Session. With implications for an eventual manned mission to Mars, the findings represent an important step toward understanding how a spaceflight of 18 months or more could affect astronauts’ heart health. 'The heart doesn’t work as hard in space, which can cause a loss of muscle mass,' said James Thomas, managing director of, Moore Chair of Cardiovascular Imaging and Lead Scientist for Ultrasound at Nasa. 'That can have serious consequences after the return to Earth, so we’re looking into whether there are measures that can be taken to prevent or counteract that loss.' Nasa said exercise regimens developed for astronauts could also be used to help maintain heart health in people on Earth who have severe physical limitations.","Prototype has been created by Nebraska-based Virtual Incision and Nasa .

Science Channel and Discovery Channel today announced that the networks will serve as television homes for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, a $30 million competition for privately-funded teams to land an unmanned craft on the moon by December 31, 2015. The networks will follow teams as they try to to land a craft on the surface of the moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit live pictures and video back to earth. Scroll down for video . Live from the lunar surface: A view of the Earth appears over the Lunar horizon as the Apollo 11 Command Module comes into view of the Moon before Astronatus Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr. leave in the Lunar Module, Eagle, to become the first men to walk on the Moon's surface. TV firms hope a new contest to send a rover to the moon and beam back live pictures will be a hit . The Google Lunar XPRIZE, the largest international incentive based prize of all time, aims to do something we haven’t done as humanity since 1973 - safely land on the surface of the Moon. 'More than half of the world’s population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface,' say the organisers. The Google Lunar XPRIZE aims to create a new “Apollo” moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $40 Million in incentive based prizes. In order to win this money, a private company must land safely on the surface of the Moon, travel 500 meters above, below, or on the Lunar surface, and send back two 'Mooncasts' to Earth . The Science Channel and Discovery Channel will follow the entire process including testing, lift-off, and live coverage of the winning lunar landing, which is estimated to take place in 2015. 'In addition to the technological breakthroughs catalyzed by the Google Lunar Xprixe, we have an equally important goal of inspiring young scientists, engineers and space explorers,' said Robert Weiss of Xprize. 'More than half the world's population has never had the opportunity to experience a live broadcast from the moon. 'Partnering with Discovery Channel and Science Channel will allow us to engage the public around this milestone event, creating an 'Apollo Moment' for the next generation.'

But not for Will Burrard-Lucas, who was used as a lookout post by these cheeky meerkats, who even had a go at taking a picture themselves. The adorable images were captured by wildlife photographer Mr Burrard-Lucas who spent six days with the new family in the Makadikgadi region of Botswana. Scroll down for video .

The cheeky youngsters used Mr Lucas as a lookout post before having a go at taking a picture themselves . The family included one female and four young pups. The adult keeps a lookout while her children look for food . Meerkats are famous for their upright stance, and females can even nurse their young while on their hind legs . Mr Burrard-Lucas has photographed meerkats in the past and was delighted when he found he would be snapping a few new arrivals. He said: 'They're normally extremely cautious but these meerkats in particular have no fear of humans so they were more than happy for me to get close. 'They were climbing on me and trying to get as high as they could to have a good look around. Meerkats are usually extremely cautious, diving for cover in their burrows as soon as danger threatens . However this family had no fear of humans, as they showed by climbing all over Mr Lucas while he took pictures . Meerkats are naturally hunted by birds of prey, and are so alert to aerial threats that the sight of a plane is enough to send the young ones running for cover . Meerkats are mammals, meaning the mother gives birth to live young. She typically has between four and six pups at any one time, and gives birth in a special burrow . 'They are very small and the grass is quite long so they're always looking for vantage points. 'The new babies were only a few days old and I was fortunate enough to see them coming out of their den for the first time. 'They were really cute and you can see them trying to stand and look for predators already. 'In Africa there are a lot of predators so they are always on the lookout for potential danger.' Meerkats are native to South Africa, where they live in large groups. The adults take it in turns to be lookouts, letting out a sharp, shrill call whenever danger is spotted .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Spinning wind turbines might soon be confined to the recycling bin. That's because German company Festo have revealed their innovative design for a new wind turbine that can operate even in low wing conditions. Known as the DualWingGenerator, it uses . two pairs of wings to generate power even when the wind speed drops to . nine miles (14 km) per hour. Scroll down to watch video . The product is part of Festo's Bionic Learning Network and mimics the natural beating of a bird's wings. As one wing rises the other drops so that they help each other move even when the wind speed is low. The shape of the wings means they generate lift when wind passes over them. The motion of the wings is turned into electricity by an integrated circuit motor. As one wing rises the other falls, so it can operate even in conditions when wind speed is low . But it's the effectiveness of the turbine to operate at low wind speeds that really makes it impressive. It's possible that it could one day be used as an alternative to modern wind turbines. Festo's DualWingGenerator is the first flapping turbine of its kind . The DualWingGenerator is an evolution of Festo's SmartBird. The SmartBird's revolutionary design allows it to start, fly and land autonomously. Its wings not only beat up and . down, they also twist at specific angles, providing the ultra-light . model with 'excellent aerodynamic qualities and extreme agility'. Controlled by a radio handset, it can also simply glide through the skies if left to its own devices. Steering is achieved when the SmartBird, which weighs just 450 grams, moves its tail and turns its head from side-to-side. Inspired . by the herring seagull, scientists at technology firm Festo control the . up/down flapping motion of the wings by spinning two wheels inside the . robot's torso.","German company Festo has unveiled their DualWingGenerator .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Films like Jurassic Park have imagined what a fight between dinosaurs might have looked like. But now scientists have a better idea than ever as they have digitally reconstructed a model of a dinosaur chase using photos of footprints. British experts examined the prints of a predatory theropod and herbivorous sauropod, which were excavated 70 years ago, to prove that they could reconstruct and possibly 3D print objects that no longer exist. Scroll down for video . Scientists have digitally reconstructed a model of a dinosaur chase using photos of footprints. This image is a photogrammetric reconstruction of the trackway of dinosaur prints. Photo-textured (top) and height mapped (bottom) views of a section of the trackway were created from old photographs . The tracks were left by two dinosaurs running through the mud of an ancient river bed more than 100 million years ago in what is now Glen Rose, Texas. They are some of the most famous in the world, but amazingly after part of the Paluxy River trackway was removed by experts decades ago, the precious prints were sawn up into three blocks and were moved to different locations to be studied and on the way one of them was lost. In a bid to reconstruct the unique site, a team of specialists led by Peter Falkingham of the Royal Veterinary College, London, pieced together 17 photographs taken by American palaeontologist Roland T Bird, who first discovered and excavated the site in 1940. The Paluxy River tracks contain footprints made by a carnivorous predator called a theropod and a large herbivorous sauropod. Dr Falkingham told MailOnline that the dinosaurs that made the print might be an Acrocanthosaurus and the sauropod was likely similar to Paluxysaurus or Sauroposeidon. ‘In some places the theropod tracks are in the sauropod tracks,’ Dr Falkingham told the BBC. ‘[This means] the theropod came after. So Bird interpreted this as a theropod chasing a sauropod.’ The dinosaur prints are some of the most famous in the world, but one part of the trackway was lost.  In a bid to reconstruct the unique site, a team of specialists pieced together 17 photographs (16 are pictured) taken by American palaeontologist Roland T Bird, who first discovered and excavated the site in 1940 . To digitally reconstruct the site as it was before the excavation began, the scientists scanned 17 photos using a technique called photogrammetry before combining them to develop a model of the trackway. They then compared the model to maps drawn by Mr Bird, before the site was divided into blocks and carried off, the study published in the Plos One journal explained. Despite the variation between the photos and the hand drawn maps, scientists were able to reconstruct and view the entire 147ft (45metre) long ‘chase scene’ in 3D for the first time since excavation. While the method is not new, the team has proved that it can be adapted for palaeontologists trying to piece together the past. Dr Falkingham hopes that the study will help other experts digitally recreate paleontological, geological or archaeological specimens that have been lost or deteriorated over time, but for which old photographic documentation exists. He said: ‘In recent years technology has advanced to the point where highly accurate 3D models can be produced easily and at very little cost just from digital photos and this has been revolutionising many different fields. ‘That we can apply that technology to specimens, or even entire sites, that no longer exist but were recorded photographically is extremely exciting.’ The Paluxy River tracks contain footprints made by a carnivorous predator called a theropod and a large herbivorous sauropod. In some places the theropod - which was perhaps a Acrocanthosaurus (pictured) - tracks are in the sauropod tracks, which suggests there was a chase . The tracks were left by two dinosaurs running through the mud of an ancient river bed in what is now Glen Rose, Texas, more than 100million years ago . The two remaining pieces of the removed trackway are housed in the American Museum of Natural History and the Texas Memorial Museum. Dr Falkingham began his research to document the prints in 2008 and as well as filling in the gap from the lost piece of excavated trackway, he wanted to record unexcavated tracks too. 'When we first set out to map the Paluxy River track, creating an accurate 3D model of the site required use of a large, heavy laser scanner that cost tens of thousands of pounds and was prone to failure especially in the extreme heat in Texas. ‘However, in recent years the technology of photogrammetry has significantly improved to the point where we were, for the first time, able to use this free software to get results just as - if not more - accurate than from use of a laser scanner. Palaeontologists can now apply the scanning technology to specimens, or even entire sites, that no longer exist but were recorded photographically, such as the footprints of the sauropod, which was likely similar to Paluxysaurus or Sauroposeidon (pictured) ‘Not only does this work with modern digital photographs but because the technology has become so advanced, and desktop computers so powerful, we were also able to use the historic photographs taken by R.T. Bird.’ He said the technique will significantly increase the protection of sites and artefacts of paleontological importance. ‘It is only natural that specimens will be lost or deteriorate over time, particularly those such as fossil trackways that must remain in the field. ‘But this technology has opened up an avenue for recreating these important sites and artefacts at little cost. All you now need are multiple photographs taken from different angles to be able to create accurate 3D models.’","Scientists have digitally reconstructed a model of the chase based on old photos that were taken at the moment the site was first discovered .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . While tourists might be preoccupied with snapping Roman landmarks in Italy’s capital city, beneath the streets geologists are documenting equally ancient tunnels. A labyrinth of subterranean passages that date back to the founding of Rome are being mapped to predict which modern buildings could be at risk of suddenly disappearing into a Roman quarry system. While this may seem unlikely, a staggering 83 structures have already collapsed due to the underground network of passages this year alone, ranging from buildings to streets. A labyrinth of passages (pictured) that date back to the founding of Rome are being mapped to predict which modern buildings are at risk of suddenly disappearing into a Roman quarry system . A team of geologists from George Mason University, Washington and the Centre for Speleoarchaeological Research, Sotterranei di Roma, are exploring the underground network to produce a detailed map that can be used to assess areas of the city that are most at risk. Geologist Giuseppina Kysar Mattietti from the university told LiveScience, that the mapping activity is critical as over the years locals have been patching up holes that have suddenly appeared. The geoscientists are using 3D laser scanning to look for weaknesses in known tunnels, before entering them through manholes to map the network, once they know they are safe. ‘There might be cracks, so they will be showing as veins almost, or openings, so we map the openings and map any kind of detachment,’ she said. The team has come across weakened ceilings as well as blockages and collapses that are alarmingly close to street level. This map shows the expansion of Rome (from its centre marked as 1) over the ancient quarry system, which is most comprehensive in the south east of the city, where dark green lines can be seen . The . geoscientists are using 3D laser scanning to look for weaknesses in . known tunnels. Any cracks show up as 'veins' or openings on the scanning results. If a tunnel is found to be safe, the geologists enter it through manholes. They can then explore the tunnel and extend their map of the underground network. The tunnels were originally created to provide building material for the rapidly growing city. Rome is built on volcanic rock which is strong but easy to carve and was therefore of interest to Roman builders and architects, who also made use of less compacted volcanic material to produce mortar for their buildings. The first Romans dug into the rock outside the city but as Rome grew to fill the areas previously used as quarries, they knew they could still use the tunnels for rock, providing they kept them narrow so buildings above ground could still be supported, Dr Mattietti explained. However, over time, weathering and humans have widened the tunnels – the latter by taking more rock from the tunnels for new buildings. Here, people stand on a Roman street, which is over 15 ft (5m) below modern street level and was built in the second century AD. Dr Mattietti described underground ancient Rome as 'a double reality' Holes are opening up all over the city of Rome and weathering plus humans widening the tunnel-like quarries have been blamed. This one is collapsed. Some locals have taken the repair of such holes into their own hands . The tunnels have also been exploited for mushroom farming, ad-hoc sewer systems, catacombs and bomb shelters during World War II. Dr Mattietti said that quite a lot of ancient Rome that is now below street level that was not to start with and described the phenomenon as a 'double reality’. ‘It's interesting, because at times when you are down there, you can hear people on top,’ she said. The team, whose work so far has been presented at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, began the study in the south eastern area of Rome, which has most quarries.","Geologists from George Mason University, Washington and the Centre for Speleoarchaeological Research in Rome are exploring the Roman network .

"By . James  Nye . and Daily Mail Reporter . Fort Hood shooter Spc. Ivan Lopez wanted to transfer units because he was being bullied, claims a senior US official working with the investigation. In an effort to discover why Lopez opened fire on his fellow soldiers on Wednesday, killing three before turning the gun on himself, the Army is examining the possibility he snapped after being tormented by colleagues. The Army is not only looking into his mental health history, but how he had settled with his fellow soldiers with the 154 Transportation Company at the Texas base after arriving in February. Scroll down for video . Suspicions he was bullied:  Army Spc. Ivan Lopez. Lopez killed three people and wounded 16 others in a shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, on Wednesday, April 2, 2014, before killing himself . One official familiar with the investigation into the mass shooting which also left 16 others injured, said that Lopez, 34, believed he was not being treated 'appropriately'. The official told CNN that it was not clear whether these individuals or his commanding officer knew of his mental health issues or if he was being treated for anxiety or depression. Officials have confirmed he received some initial mental health treatment at his previous post at Fort Bliss and was prescribed medications there. Indeed, Lopez had sent a request into the army to leave Fort Hood, military investigators said on Monday. Investigation: Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, III Corps & Fort Hood commanding general, (L) and US Senator John Cornyn (R) address news media at Fort Hood military base near Killeen, Texas in the aftermath of Lopez's shooting spree . Army spokesman Chris Grey did not indicate during a brief news conference Monday whether Spc. Ivan Lopez was granted the leave - as he revealed the shooting spree covered the equivalent of two city blocks as Lopez drive from one area to another on the Central Texas base randomly firing. Authorities have said the shooting was preceded by an argument Lopez had with other soldiers in his unit. Grey said Lopez fired more than 35 shots while driving from one building on the sprawling Texas Army base to another during the eight-minute rampage. It ended when Grey said Lopez got out of his car and was confronted by a female military police officer who fired her gun but did not strike him. Lopez then turned his .45-caliber pistol to his head and killed himself, Grey said. Shooting spree: Spc. Ivan Lopez, 34, unleashed his shooting spree on Wednesday - killing three colleagues and injuring 16-others . Mourning: US national flags and crosses representing victims of the shooting at Fort Hood military base are displayed outside Central Christian Church in Killeen, Texas over the weekend . Before the shootings, Lopez had taken to Facebook to rant about Sandy Hook and his anger at his tour of duty in Iraq. Details of his social media accounts were revealed as investigators try to piece together what caused the 34-year-old Iraq War veteran to shot dead three soldiers on the Texas army base on Wednesday. The Iraq War veteran was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, and his posts appear to show he was struggling to deal with his feelings of anger and anxiety after a robbery. It is not yet clear what drove Lopez to kill three people and injure 16 others before taking his own life this week, but he had a history of depression. Posts about his feelings were made on a Facebook account that a family member has confirmed did belong to the gunman. Snapped: Military police are attempting to understand why Lopez seemingly lost control of his faculties and opened fire on Wednesday - killing three people . In one, written last month around the time he bought the pistol used in the attack, he said he was 'Full of hate' after being robbed. The post, seen by CNN, stated: 'My spiritual peace has just gone. Full of hate. Now I think I'll be damned.' In another post he ranted about Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, condemning the 20-year-old who killed 20 children and six teachers, for wanting a 'minute of fame as a villain'. He added: 'It is stupid to me that anyone can have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated. This makes the government indirect accomplice.' Another post on his Facebook revealed feelings of fear from his time in Iraq, where he claimed to have seen 'the most brutal explosion'. The Rev. Jeff Miller lights four candles, one for each of the victims of the Fort Hood shooting and one for the alleged shooter, at the beginning of the worship service at First United Methodist Church in Killeen, Texas, on Sunday April 6, 2014 . It read: 'Hours of agony waiting for an attack by the insurgency but we were able to exit Fallujah all alive. I was in vehicle #6.The worst was that #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I was only thinking about getting back with my family.' Lieutenant General Mark Milley however said Lopez did not experience direct combat during his time in Iraq. 'We have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds received in action, contact with the enemy or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed,' he told CNN. Chris Grey, spokesman for the army's investigation, has not yet commented on the Facebook posts. He said: 'Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did.' Tragedy for the family: Ivan Lopez with his family on a day out - the Lopez family have reacted with total shock as to why he opened fire on Wednesday . The Lopez family, who live in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, said in a statement they were 'dismayed' by the tragic events. 'This is a very painful situation,' the father of Ivan Lopez said in the statement. 'I ask for prayers for the affected families.' The rampage is the third shooting at a military base in the United States in about six months that, along with a series of shootings in public places, such as schools and malls, has intensified a national debate over gun violence. It has also raised questions about security at U.S. military installations, such as Fort Hood, home to some 45,000 soldiers and airmen assigned to the 335-square-mile (870-square-km) base, along with thousands of civilian employees. 'Obviously we have a gap. Anytime we lose an individual, something's gone wrong,' U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters in Hawaii on Thursday.","Spc.

"By . Sean Poulter . The levy is predicted to reduce the number of bags handed out at tills by more than 70 per cent . Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to hand over a £19million-a-year VAT windfall from introducing a 5p charge on carrier bags. The Treasury would be in line to collect 20 per cent VAT, or 1p, on the 5p charge, due to come into effect in England next year. The levy is predicted to reduce the number of bags handed out at tills by more than 70 per cent. It will also raise some £70million a year for green charities, including those tackling litter. The VAT element would raise £19million a year from shoppers, according to the Government. But . the Environmental Audit Committee, dominated by Conservative MPs, says . today that this sum should be handed back to green good causes, such as . cleaning parks and waterways. The . all-party group of MPs also said that plans for the levy in England . have been a ‘complete mess’ after ministers proposed several exemptions . and red tape rules. Its . report today said: ‘The VAT on the charge should also be spent on new . environmental projects and on monitoring the impact of the scheme.’ The Treasury is already collecting VAT . on the 5p charge in Wales, which already has the levy, and will also do . so when the scheme starts in Scotland in October. Consequently, its windfall from the charge is even higher than £19million. The introduction of the levy  is a victory for the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to hand over a £19million-a-year VAT windfall from introducing a 5p charge on carrier bags . More than eight billion disposable bags are used in England each year, or 130 bags per person. For Wales, this fell to 22 after the levy was introduced in October 2011. Its scheme is simple in that all retailers, regardless of size, charge a 5p levy on all single-use carrier bags. But ministers insist that in England . there should be no 5p charge for biodegradable or paper bags, and small . shops – those employing fewer than 250 people – will be exempt. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says this is to reduce the regulatory burden on small shops. But the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents small shops, said its members would be happy to apply the levy. EAC chairman Joan Walley MP urged ministers to ‘keep it simple to help shoppers do the right thing’. Current Government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in England until October 2015 at the earliest . She added: ‘Ministers have managed to make a complete mess of their planned carrier bags charge by making it unnecessarily complicated.’ The committee said there is no value in exempting paper bags because they can have a greater impact on the environment than plastic versions. Miss Walley added: ‘Biodegradable bags are not as green as they sound. We heard they can do as much harm to wildlife as normal plastic bags and could cause big problems for the UK recycling industry.’ Dr Sue Kinsey, of the Marine Conservation Society, said the plan to exempt small shops, paper and biodegradable bags was ‘ludicrous’. But a Defra spokesman said: ‘Paper bags make up only a small proportion of carrier bags and break down naturally. Biodegradable bags will only be exempt if they are genuinely biodegradable – currently such a bag does not exist.’","The Treasury would be in line to collect 20 per cent VAT, or 1p, on 5p charge .

"By . SIMON JONES . Arsenal are evaluating the cost of a deal for Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic. Manager Arsene Wenger is resigned to the fact that Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa is joining Chelsea this summer, while Monaco's Radamel Falcao, who is still recovering from a knee ligament injury, would be an expensive risk. Scouts have been in Germany continuing to monitor Schalke's Julian Draxler and Nuremberg's promising Josip Drmic but Mandzukic represents the ready-made centre forward. Target man: Arsenal are weighing up a deal to sign Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic this summer . Reluctant sellers: Bayern are said to want to keep the Croatian forward, but he is after more playing time . Bayern are reluctant to sell but Mandzukic wants regular football and has one year left on his contract. The 27-year-old came on as a substitute for Thomas Muller against Manchester United and gave Bayern's attack even greater threat. The Croat is clever in his movement, aggressive, technically adept and good in the air. Mandzukic believes his performances and goals record warrant a regular place in Pep Guardiola's starting line-up but the summer arrival of Robert Lewandowski from Borussia Dortmund will only serve to restrict his game-time further. David Moyes is also a confirmed fan of Mandzukic having tried to sign him for Everton in the past but Manchester United remain keen on Edinson Cavani at Paris St Germain for now. Hit list: Sporting Lisbon left-back Marcos Rojo is also on Arsene Wenger's list of potential transfers . Incomings: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be under pressure to reinforce his squad this summer . Meanwhile, Arsenal have checked on Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo. The . 24-year-old Argentine - who has also been watched by Liverpool, United and . City - has been booked eight times but has been impressive at . centre-back during Sporting's rise to second in the Portuguese league . table. However, he plays left-back for Argentina and that is an added . attraction for his British suitors who are all seeking to strengthen . that position. Everton weigh up Lukaku alternatives due to £25m hurdle . Everton remain in the frame for the . permanent signing of Romelu Lukaku, but Chelsea's asking price of around . £25million will be an obvious stumbling block. Manager . Roberto Martinez has had scouts monitoring other forwards in Spain and . Germany with the likes of Carlos Bracca at Sevilla, Loic Remy of QPR and . Luciano Vietto of Racing Club among names discussed but a permanent . deal for Lukaku remains his dream ticket. The . 20-year-old is keen to play in European competition next season and . Everton's finishing position could prove crucial in terms of standing . and new finance. Lukaku's camp would prefer to wait until after the . World Cup when more clubs are anticipated to show an interest. Options: Everton remain firmly in the hunt to sign Romelu Lukaku, a player they have on loan from Chelsea . In demand: Everton aren't the only club vying for Lukaku - Tottenham are also talking about a deal this summer . The Belgium international's agent Christophe Henrotay has confirmed a conversation has taken place with Tottenham. Talking . to Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad, Henrotay said: 'I’m looking for a . club for Romelu. And yes, I’ve talked to (Spurs chairman) Daniel Levy . once, but that doesn't mean Romelu will join Spurs. That's not a talking . point at this moment.' Although . Chelsea are reputed to want an option on Everton midfielder Ross . Barkley in any negotiations for Lukaku, the 20-year-old Barkley is keen . to stay at Everton and further his development under Martinez. Contract . talks are expected in the summer. No deal: Everton are adamant that any deal with Chelsea for Lukaku wouldn't include Ross Barkley . Crystal Palace will rival Sunderland in a renewed battle for Will Buckley this summer. Both . clubs showed an interest in the Brighton winger in January and will . resume talks over a £3million deal at the end of the season. Sunderland . were rebuffed in two bids for Buckley before settling on a deal for his . team-mate Liam Bridcutt, who was considered the greater priority by . manager Gus Poyet. Wanted: Both Crystal Palace and Sunderland are expected to fight it out for Brighton's Will Buckley (left) Sporting director Lee Congerton wants a . more British-themed recruitment policy to Sunderland's transfers and at . 24 years-of-age Buckley fits into that profile along with the likes of Hamburg's . Michael Mancienne. Palace . manager Tony Pulis could be in a stronger position to tempt Buckley with . his side favourites at this stage to stay up, although Pulis himself . will be in demand following his exploits at Selhurst Park. Leicester, meanwhile, are among clubs to have shown an interest in Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni. Martin Skrtel's agent has dismissed the prospect of the Liverpool defender moving to Napoli in the summer. Skrtel . has revived his career at Anfield after being on the brink of leaving, . with his former boss Rafa Benitez keen to take him to Serie A. However, . the Slovakian's agent Karol Csonto said: 'There is no chance for Skrtel . to go to Napoli. What I can say is that Martin Skrtel will not go to . Napoli. Skrtel will remain at Liverpool.' Staying put: Martin Skrtel's agent has said the Liverpool stopper will not be leaving Anfield this summer . Napoli do remain strong candidates to sign Pepe Reina on a permanent deal. Meanwhile, . representatives of Napoli's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami are . understood to have spoken to Tottenham to gauge interest. The . 28-year-old is keen on a move to England. Halifax's . very own livewire striker Lee Gregory will be looking to impress . tonight against Braintree Town in the crucial Conference League clash. A . win for either side would put them into the play-off positions and . Gregory will be looking to add to his tally of 28 goals in 31 games this . season. Staff from . Blackburn, Burnley, Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester, Barnsley and . Millwall are all due at the game to watch the 25-year-old striker who . has scored seven in his last four games. Gregory, . who finishes his shift with his electrical company at 3pm before . heading off for his pre-match meal, is eager to impress and earn his . chance of a transfer to a league club as well as propel Halifax closer . to promotion. Sevilla are rekindling interest in Fulham forward Bryan Ruiz. The Spanish side were among clubs interested in signing Ruiz in January prior to the 28-year-old joining PSV Eindhoven in a £1m loan deal. He is rediscovering his best form in Holland and has scored four goals in 10 games to keep talented teenager Zakaria Bakkali out of Philip Cocu's first team. Sevilla, who are expected to lose the goal threat of midfielder Ivan Rakitic to Real Madrid in the summer, sent scouts to run the rule over Ruiz last week. Back on form: Fulham's Bryan Ruiz, pictured here in action for Costa Rica, is wanted at Sevilla . Cardiff City are in talks over a £1.5million deal for for Beira-Mar striker Willyan. The clubs have been in discussions over a possible partnership and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer recognises the potential in the 20-year-old Brazilian. Full name Willyan Barbosa, he has an Italian passport which would clear any work permit problems. Formerly with Torino he joined Beira-Mar on loan and only joined on a permanent deal in January. Anderlecht's highly-coveted defender Wout Faes has agreed a contract with the club after turning 16.

"By . James  Nye . About 100 people were arrested and at least 44 people were taken to the hospital during a weekend college party in Southern California that devolved into a rock- and bottle-throwing melee, authorities said. The violence broke out in the densely populated beachside community of Isla Vista around 9:30 p.m. Saturday during the annual spring break party known as Deltopia, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Hoover said things escalated after a University of California, Santa Barbara police officer was hit in the face with a backpack filled with large bottles of alcohol. Scroll Down for Video . Carnage: The Spring Break party erupted into chaos - leading to the arrest of more than 100 revelers . The officer was hospitalized with a 'significant head injury,' according to a statement from the university. Authorities said some members of the crowd of 15,000 then began throwing rocks, bricks and bottles at officers, lighting fires and damaging law enforcement vehicles. 'It was an emergency situation where we had to call in mutual aid,' Hoover said. 'They have had civil disturbances before in Isla Vista, but it has been many years since something like this.' Authorities reported using tear gas, pepper spray and foam projectiles to disperse the surging crowd. Fights: More than 100 people were arrested when an annual spring break party in California turned violent, with police using chemical spray and foam bullets to disperse crowds . Chaos: More than 40 people, including several law enforcement officers, were taken to hospitals for treatment after clashes broke out between partygoers and police during the annual ""Deltopia"" street party in Isla Vista . Public disorder: The melee erupted Saturday evening after a university police officer was hit in the head with a backpack filled with large bottles of liquor, the sheriff's office said in a statement . Commotion: Authorities tried to break up the event by declaring an unlawful assembly, and 'chemical agents and less lethal foam projectiles were deployed to disperse the crowds,' the statement said . At least five more officers were injured in the melee, including one officer who was hit in the face with a brick and two others who were both hit in the hand with bottles, sheriff's deputies said. All had been released from the hospital by Sunday morning, Hoover said. Earlier in the day, authorities also responded to reports of a stabbing and found several individuals carrying weapons, she said. Aside from those who were treated after the brawl broke out, nearly every person who was hospitalized on Saturday had consumed excess alcohol, Hoover added. Unruly: At least five other sheriff's deputies were injured, including one who was hit in the face with a brick and two who were hit with bottles . Destruction: There was no immediate word on how many of the 100 arrested would be charged with crimes . Crowd control: Approximately 18 people were arrested during the actual disturbance, police said . Party over: The incident unfolded about 9:30 p.m. at the event, known as Deltopia, which drew about 15,000 revelers . Anti-social: Some vandalized street signs, set small fires, and damaged property, including law enforcement vehicles, police said . 'It really was ridiculous,' Hoover said. 'Deltopia attracts out-of-towners who come in and are not invested in our community and there are some who come to cause trouble.' The situation had stabilized by Sunday morning after sheriffs received backup support from multiple agencies in neighboring Ventura County. Isla Vista borders the university and is known for partying. The half-mile area has roughly 23,000 residents, of which 60 percent are students. Hoover said authorities remained in the area Sunday morning cleaning up broken glass and trash strewn throughout the neighborhood.","More than 100 people were arrested when an annual spring break party in California turned violent .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 04:33 EST, 8 March 2012 . Scientists have made a potential . breakthrough against both cancer and obesity after identifying a way of . modifying a gene that controls cell growth. Mice given an extra copy of the anti-cancer gene Pten were less prone to weight gain and were more resistant to the disease. The Pten gene is key in controlling cell growth in both mice and humans. The study by the Spanish National Cancer Research Center also found that the creatures with adapted genes lived longer. Scientists gave mice abnormal amounts of the gene Pten and found the creatures also remained thin while eating high-fat foods (file picture) The gene was also found to help mice become less prone to insulin reistance, a precursor to diabetes. Dr Manuel Serrano, the lead scientists on the study published in Cell Metabolism, said: 'Tumour suppressers are actually genes that have been used by evolution to protect us from all kinds of abnormalities. 'This tumour suppresser protects against metabolic damage associated with ageing by turning on brown fat.' When cancer begins to spread, the Pten gene is one of the first to be destroyed as cancerous cells begin to grow, which leads to tumours being formed. Researchers believe the role of tumour supressors like Pten is not limited to stopping cancer, and that they could have further potential waiting to be discovered. Giving mice more than the naturally-recommended amount of Pten appeared to keep them cancer free. The discovery means having several genomic copies of Pten could help fend off harmful mutations. Experts stressed that the findings still need more work, and it remains unclear just how easily the same genetic studies could be applied to humans to help fight obesity . And as well as apparently fighting off cancer, the gene also gave mice a metabolic imbalance, allowing them to eat more but remaining thinner than normal mice. It is thought this is down to overactive brown fat cells, which were burning extra calories having been stimulated by Pten. In a seperate breakthrough, researchers believe a natural cannabis-like chemical in the brain may hold the key to keeping couch potatoes slim. Scientists at the University of California found that blocking the compound allowed mice to gorge on high fat food and take little exercise without putting on weight or becoming unhealthy. The genetically modified animals produced limited amounts of the endocannabinoid 2-AG, a chemical related to the active ingredient in cannabis. All mammalian brains, including those of humans, contain 2-AG, which is believed to control neural circuits involved in metabolism.","Modification of Pten gene found to help mice stay cancer free while also keeping them thin .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It cost Nasa $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) to land their Curiosity rover on Mars. But, with tongue firmly in cheek, perhaps they could have fooled us all by sending a rover to the abandoned Wheal Maid mine in Cornwall instead. Photographer Mike Thomas’ incredible photos show how, in a secluded part of the UK, there is a landscape that looks as alien as anything any rover has seen on the red planet. No place like home? The 'Martian' landscape of Wheal Maid mine near Carharrack, Cornwall is revealed in these beautiful photos by MIke Thomas . Mr Thomas had been unaware of the mine until a local told him to go and check it out. What he found absolutely blew him away. ‘I was a bit shocked,’ Thomas tells MailOnline. ‘I didn’t expect the colours to be so vivid, and it was pretty alien looking. It’s more like a Doctor Who set.’ The mine itself was first opened in 1782. Although it was mostly used to mine copper, there were a number of by-products that are still present today. These include black tin, arsenic, pyrite and zinc ore, all of which combine to produce the fantastic colours you can see in the images. The mineral waste including copper, black tin, arsenic, pyrite and zinc ore has collected in a lagoon on the site producing vivid colours . The site is part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site . Aliens among us: Pictured is plant life on the site that gets covered with the mineral deposits producing a range of strange colours . Mars or rust: The lagoon gets its red colour from copper sulphate left from the old mine . ‘What you’re seeing in the pictures are the remnants of mining silt that built up in the mines that is held in the lagoon on the site,’ continued Mr Thomas. ‘When the water level drops slightly, all the minerals stick to the side of the lagoons which is why you get all these odd colours.’ In addition to the lagoon, many plants are also coated in different minerals, with brambles appearing a metallic purple and willow trees a bizarre greenish-yellow. The out-of-this-world effects occur all year round when heavy sunshine follows periods of rainfall. With summer on its way, Thomas says it’ll look even more impressive on the balmiest of days. Roses are purple, violets are red: The waste minerals at the site have given the plants some rather odd-looking colouration . Look but don't touch: A risk assessment of the local area suggests it is safe to explore, but the council advises against eating the soil or drinking the water . Hotting up: The colours within the site are at their most vivid on hot, sunny days . Thomas explored the site with his friend Richard and said the site was simply beautiful . Safety first: The council is confident that no significant damage is being done to the surrounding environment . The site is now used for mountain bike competitions, but strictly no motorbikes are allowed . Most of the site itself is a public right of way, with some of it used as a mountain bike circuit. The local Gwennap Parish Council purchased the mine in 2002 for £1 from previous owners Carnon Enterprises. An Environment Agency investigation into the site was carried out to check for possible contamination of the surrounding wildlife. Initial reports said some areas were a risk due to high levels of arsenic but now, according to Parish Chairman Kevin Furnish, the site is largely safe to explore. Wheal Maid was once part of a site called the Great Consolidated Mine. First opened in 1782, the area was at times highly profitable. The main produce was copper, along with smaller amounts of black tin, arsenic, pyrite and zinc ore. By 1870, however, much of the useful minerals had been mined. By the early 1990s the entire site was closed and later opened to the public by the council, who purchased it for £1. ‘A full investigation by the Environment Agency said that there are some places where you wouldn’t want to eat the soil or drink the water, but that’s pretty common to Corwnwall,’ he tells MailOnline. ‘There’s a slight impact on the local stream but, when taken into context of the whole watershed, it’s trivial as to what comes out of the tin mines further downstream. ‘There’s no impact at all on the area wider than a couple of hundred yards. ‘There are signs up which are there to educate people not just about the history and the environment, but also that they shouldn’t drink too much of the water.’ ‘The risk analysis by the Environment Agency was that there is very little danger to anyone in the valley.’ With that in mind, Thomas points out that the area is a public right of way and anyone can go along to enjoy the beautiful scenery. ‘It’s beautiful in its own right,’ he concludes. ‘I wouldn’t swim in the lagoon though, no.’","Photographer Mike Thomas has unveiled stunning photos of a disused mine .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A 10-year-old primary school pupil weighs an astonishing 20 stone, figures have revealed. The child, who has not been named, narrowly topped the list of the most obese children in Coventry and Warwickshire, where the data was collected. The Year 6 pupil tipped the scales at 19st 7lbs, making them one of the heaviest children in the country. Another child of the same year weighed just over 18st, a third weighed 18st 6lbs and a fourth weighed 16st 7lbs. Shocking: The 10-year-old child, who has not been named, is one of the fattest children in the country (file picture) The children were weighed at school as part of an annual child measurement programme and it is now known if they were male or female. The latest data has been supplied by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the official source of NHS data. Coventry City Council estimates there are about 10,000 primary school children in the area who are classed as either overweight or clinically obese - including a handful of local youngsters who weighed in at more than 16st during health checks in Year 6. Many will grow to become obese adults, increasing their risk of diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other killer diseases. National figures released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre in December revealed the proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight had actually fallen for the first time in six years. A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - . measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 . were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous . year. In Reception, the number of obese and . overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year . and is lower than seven years ago. And . in December, it was revealed a ten-year-old schoolgirl in Birmingham . weighed at 22 stone 11lbs, closely followed by six youngsters of the . same age who weighed 19 stone. Tam . Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told MailOnline: 'It is a truly . horrific problem we have. The Government says obesity is falling in . children, which it might be in affluent areas. Denial: Experts say many parents believe nothing needs to be done about their overweight children - because they 'look healthy and happy' 'But in many cases, it's about volume - fat people are getting fatter. Also, many parents don't realise their child is overweight - quite often because they are fat themselves. 'It is horrific figures such as these which show just how big the problem of childhood obesity is becoming.' Berni Lee, public health consultant for Coventry City Council, said the main challenge is changing the attitudes of parents with overweight children who believe nothing needs to be done because theirchild looks healthy and happy. A recent survey suggests most parents ignore advice offered by the National Child Measurement Programme. She added: 'We’ve become accustomed to the overweight because it’s so common in our society. 'We are not recognising it when we see it because people only hear about the extreme cases, people think it’s an extreme state. 'The 19-and-a-half stone child is not the problem, although it’s a problem for them. 'The problem is the [other] children...who are either overweight  or very overweight. Worry: Millions of schoolchildren will grow to become obese adults, increasing their risk of diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other killer diseases . 'But we shouldn’t focus on weight, we should focus on the behaviours, their eating and the activity. 'If we did this healthy weights will naturally follow.' A spokesman at Warwickshire County Council said: 'Children identified as overweight or obese through the programme are pro-actively offered weight management support. 'There are protocols in place to ensure that the family/carer receive an individual child’s results within three weeks of being weighed and measured. 'Up to three weeks after this, the school health team’s Family Change4Life Advisory Service will telephone the family and offer weight management support. 'If calls are not returned, the school health team will follow up in writing, but it is ultimately the family’s decision whether to take up the offer of help or not. If any safeguarding issues are considered, a referral to Children’s Services may be made.'","Unnamed child, from Coventry, weighs 19st 7lb, according to NHS statistics .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Human remains found in a car pulled from the bottom of a Florida canal over the weekend are believed to be those of a man missing for nearly a decade. The body found Saturday inside a green Ford Thunderbird is assumed by many to be that of William Naylor, a 69-year-old Coconut Grove man missing since February 2005. The car was pulled from a canal directly behind his home. The medical examiner has yet to identify the remains, but both family and a woman searching for Naylor since his disappearance insists it is him. Missing for nine years: William Naylor hasn't been seen since 2005 . Salvaged: Naylor's green Ford Thunderbird was pulled Saturday from a local creek . ‘In my heart I really do think it's him,’ Dinorah Perry, head of Missing Children International Ministries, told WPLG. MCIM is a non-profit group that had been helping Naylor’s family search for the long-missing man. Derek Borrero, owner of Aquatic Ops, detailed the salvage operation to WSVN. ‘We got in the water at approximately 10:05 [a.m.],’ he said. At approximately 10:26, we located a vehicle. It took about 40 yards swimming. I had three divers in the water.’ They found something just eight inches below the surface using search sticks and soon pulled out the muck covered car. ‘Well, it happened to be a Ford Thunderbird,’ Borrero said, before adding that he was sure it was the missing man’s car. Investigation: Authorities immediately began pouring over the car for evidence, foul play is not suspected . ‘The color was identical to what he was driving at the time, even though the car has been in the water for nine years,’ he continued. ‘The tag number matched the flyer number, so once we got those tag numbers, we could verify that it was his vehicle.’ The canal is right behind where the retired county employee lived right up until his disappearance, according to the Sun Sentinel. 'It's just ironic that they would find him right here all along,' daughter Jeanie Naylor told the paper. She said she is convinced the car is her father’s, but the medical examiner said dental records will be needed to confirm the identity of the body found inside. William Naylor took medication for his Parkinson’s Disease that had hallucinatory effects. The man stormed angrily out of his home the night he disappeared after it was suggested he live in an assisted living facility because of his medical condition, she continued. He was never seen again. Authorities do not believe foul play is involved. Family searched five years for their missing patriarch, and even called police stations up and down the east coast hoping to get lucky. A failure to turn up any leads led his daughter to believe the worst. 'When [police] couldn't find his car — I mean, you usually find an abandoned car,' she told the paper. 'I knew he was in a canal.' Hauled away: The car were taken away for further investigation, the human remains were sent to the medical examiner's office for identification . It turns out she was right, and MCIM helped bring her to the bittersweet moment. The group found the car as part of their ‘Cars held Hostage’ program, which searches waterways for missing people and vehicles, Perry told NBC Miami. ‘Families, they're not asking for much, they're just asking for a tiny tiny piece of closure,’ she told the station. She said they were overwhelmed at the thought he was finally found after all these years. ‘I know the family had a rough time last night,’ said Perry. ‘You know, emotions, they cried, they're happy, they're sad.’","William Naylor, 69, has been missing since 2005 .

"By . Marie-louise Olson . Hollywood actress Meryl Streep launched a nine-minute tirade against Walt Disney at the glamorous National Board of Review dinner in New York City on Tuesday. Streep was at the event to honor Emma Thompson for her portrayal of Mary Poppins’ creator, PL Travers in the Disney film, Saving Mr Banks. She said of her good chum: ‘Not only is she not irascible, she’s practically a saint. There’s something so consoling about that old trope, but Emma makes you want to kill yourself, because she’s a beautiful artist, she’s a writer, she’s a thinker, she’s a living, acting conscience.’ Scroll down for poem... Scathing remarks: Actress Meryl Streep called Walt Disney a 'gender bigot' and 'anti-Semitic' in her speech on Tuesday. But she also praised her friend and fellow actress, Emma Thompson, as a 'beautiful artist' We think the Brits are brittleThey think that we are mushThey are more sentimental, though we do tend to gushVolcanoes of emotion, concealed beneath that lipWhere we are prone to guzzle, they tip the cup and sipBut when eruption rumbles from nowhere, near the brain, it’s seismicGranite crumblesThe heart more flows like rainLike lavaAll that feeling melts downLike Oscar goldAnd Emma leaves us reelingA knockout, truth be told . The veteran film actress had even written a poem for Thompson entitled, An Ode to Emma, Or What Emma is Owed, according to Variety. But in between all the good words, she managed to direct a few scathing ones at Walt Disney, who she called a ‘hideous anti-Semite’ who ‘formed and supported an anti-Semitic industry lobby. And he was certainly, on the evidence of his company’s policies, a gender bigot’. Streep read a letter that his company wrote in 1938 to an aspiring female animator. It included the line, ‘Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that task is performed entirely by young men.’ ‘Some of his associates reported that Walt Disney didn’t really like women,’ Streep said, quoting esteemed animator Ward Kimball on his old boss: ‘He didn’t trust women or cats.’ Honoured: Emma Thompson for her portrayal of Mary Poppins¿ creator, PL Travers in the Disney film, Saving Mr Banks, pictured . However, she softened the blow by adding that ‘there is a piece of received wisdom that says that the most creative people are often odd, or irritating, eccentric, damaged, difficult. That along with enormous creativity come certain deficits in humanity or decency.’ ‘We are familiar with this trope in our business: Mozart, Van Gogh, Tarantino, Eminem,’ Streep added. Tuesday’s . event is seen as a big pre-game to the Golden Globes and the biggest . movie event until the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s gala on . Sunday. This year’s . list of honorees included Thompson for best actress, Bruce Dern for best . actor for Nebraska, Will Forte for best supporting actor for Nebraska . and Octavia Spencer for best supporting actress in Fruitvale Station.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A woman stripped down to her underwear in a supermarket  before downing a can of beer for a NekNominate challenge. Footage of Rebecca Dagley, 19, shows the woman walking into an Asda supermarket in Fosse Park, Leicester, in a beige trench coat. She walks around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle - and then takes a can of Stella Artois from her pocket. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Dagley, 19, stripped down to her underwear in a supermarket before downing a can of lager . The woman removes her coat, stripping down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders. She then downs the can of beer in front of shocked shoppers. The act was captured on film by a giggling friend - who at the end of the footage nominates three more friends to take part. Speaking with The Daily Star, Miss Dagley said: 'I just found an aisle and tried to drink it before security came over. 'People were just looking at me like ""what on earth are you doing?"" 'I didn't want to do it at first but then I thought I should just have fun.' Rebecca Dagley pictured wearing her beige coat in the Asda store (left) removes her clothing (right) The teen totters around wearing only her underwear while holding the can of Stella . 'Everyone will go as far as they want to, nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.' NekNominate is an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours. Participants often upload the footage onto the internet. In . some instances, teens can be seen downing 'dirty pints' - or . concoctions of alcohol and other substances - or large amounts of strong . spirits as part of the dare. Last week, footage of one young man from Derby drinking a live goldfish as part of the craze. The girl's friend, who'd been filming the dare, then nominates three others to take part in the challenge . Miss Dagley said she didn't want to do it at first, but then thought 'I should just have fun' The teen added she downed the drink as quickly as she could before security arrived . The act is often done in bizarre and dangerous circumstances - such as Sean Bisset, 18, who downed a mixture of  wine and gin before plunging in to a freezing harbour. The craze started in Australia last month and has now swept the globe - with thousands of British youngsters taking part. Last weekend two young men died in Ireland as a result of taking part. Ross Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death. Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination. The game has been condemned by experts. Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in, but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise. 'Quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess, there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the 'cyber shame' some young people may experience. 'Drinkaware research shows nearly half of 18 to 24-year-olds admitted 'un-tagging' drunk photos of themselves on Facebook that they didn't want others to see.'","Rebecca Dagley, 19, walks in to an Asda store and strips to underwear .

"By . Isabelle Loynes . A man has told how a botched operation to remove his 'moobs' caused him to lose his nipple and his job. Mark Jones, 39, had been bullied since childhood because of the large collection of fat in his chest which resembled breasts. The common condition, also known as gynaecomastia, affects around 15 per cent of adult men in the UK. Mark Jones, 39, was left with only one nipple and no job after botched surgery to remove his 'moobs' Mr Jones, from Bebington, Wirral, spent £7,500 having a procedure to remove the excess tissue, otherwise known as a male breast reduction, in May 2011. Sadly, the operation went wrong and after losing his nipple and his job Mr Jones says he is left ‘feeling like a freak’. He said: ‘I was always active growing up but for some reason fat collected in that area. ‘No matter how much exercise I did the area wouldn’t firm up and the fat on my chest wouldn’t go away.’ Like many men affected by “man boobs”, Mr Jones was subjected to a lifetime of bullying and name calling, which started at school but stretched into the workplace. He said: ‘As a child the kids I played football with used to chant, “get your boobs out for the lads” in the changing room. Mr Jones was bullied for years - at school and then at work - because of his ""man boobs"". As a result, he had very low self-esteem and went through his teens and 20s without ever being in a relationship . Mr Jones, from the Wirral, spent £7,500 on surgery to have the excess fat on his chest removed, but it went wrong and he was left with only one nipple (pictured) ‘The teasing carried on at school, they would make jokes about me needing a bra. There was just no let up and I became obsessed with trying to cover my chest at all times. ‘I wouldn’t wear t-shirts, preferring to cover up in baggy clothes. Even in summer I would layer on hoodies and jumpers so people couldn’t see my breasts.’ Mr Jones was left with cripplingly low self-esteem and, despite being a semi-professional footballer, he found it impossible to speak to girls. He said: ‘I thought if I tried to chat a girl up she would just laugh, or, take the mickey out of me. So, I just didn’t try, I thought it was safer to be on my own so never had a relationship.’ Mr Jones' nipple had to be removed after the operation as its blood supply was lost so it turned black. He had more surgery as medics attempted to build him a new one but these procedures were unsuccessful . Mr Jones (pictured before his operations) said: 'As a child the kids I played football with used to chant, ""get your boobs out for the lads"" in the changing room. The teasing carried on at school, they would make jokes about me needing a bra. There was just no let up' Sadly, this meant Mr Jones spent most of his 20s watching his friends date from the side lines. He said: ‘Mates would talk about girls they had met, the physical side of their relationships and girlfriends they had, all I could do was listen. ‘I was envious but I knew that no girl would want to see what it looked like under my top. I felt like I was less of a man.’ Mr Jones spent his spare time avoiding any situation that would mean he had to take his top off. He said: “Holidays, trips to the seaside, swimming pools, sunbathing, I went to extreme lengths to avoid them.’ Mr Jones had to have so much time off work for surgery he lost his job and unemployment left him depressed . After injuring his arm playing football in 2003, Mr Jones stopped exercising and put on weight, only making his issue worse. He said: ‘My weight reached 19.5st and the extra fat collected around my chest making them look even more like breasts. ‘I knew I had to do something or I would end up being alone for the rest of my life.’ Mr Jones lost weight in 2008 by going on a TV programme called ‘Diet On The Dancefloor’, where contestants competed to lose the most weight. Dropping 2.5st in eight weeks Mr Jones had a boost to his confidence that pushed him to try and get rid of the issue that had plagued his life. Mr Jones said: 'I wouldn't wear t-shirts, preferring to cover up in baggy clothes. Even in summer I would layer on hoodies and jumpers so people couldn't see my breasts' He said: ‘I had some savings set aside and after reading about a man who had a breast reduction I decided to look into it myself. ‘I did my research, found a practice in London and paid the £7,500 fee. It was a lot of money but I knew it was going to change my life.’ Sadly, Mr Jones was right, the operation did change his life, but not for the better. He said: ‘I woke with heavy bruising and a loss of blood flow to one breast. I thought it was normal and the surgeon said the operation had been a success.’ Gynaecomastia is a common condition which causes men's breasts to swell. It can appear as a small amount of extra tissue, or, as prominent breasts. It’s also referred to as ‘man boobs’ and can be caused by a hormone imbalance where the male affected produces too much oestrogen. Losing weight or exercise will not affect the condition as it’s not caused by being overweight. Tthe main treatment is surgery to remove the excess breast tissue. But as Mr Jones lay in bed, imaging the new life he would have, the bruising worsened. He said: ‘They changed the dressing one day and one of my nipples had gone black, there was no blood going to it all. ‘The surgeon explained they had to remove it but would be able to construct another nipple using a skin graft.’ For Mr Jones, who thought the operation would mean meeting a woman and finally losing his insecurities, it was a bitter blow. ‘I had been so excited about having the operation I didn’t think about what could have gone wrong. I just assumed it would be straightforward and I would have the body I had always dreamed of.’ Once he had recovered from the operation, Mr Jones returned for a skin graft where skin was taken from his leg to make a new nipple. He said: ‘They left the new nipple to heal but when I went in to have the dressing removed the nipple came off with it, it hadn’t attached properly to my skin. ‘I looked down and the pink circular lump of fat and felt sick, once again I felt like a complete freak.’ Doctors quickly arranged to do the process again, which meant two more operations but sadly for Mr Jones, neither worked and he was left with no nipple. Mr Jones (pictured after his original nipple was removed, but before the failed reconstruction surgery) has now found a new job and a partner, Dawn, but he still hopes to find a way of improving the look of his chest . He said: ‘To make matters worse, with all the time off I had my work grew impatient and had to let me go. ‘The hospital gave me a prosthetic nipple to wear underneath clothes, so it didn’t look odd. ‘It felt stupid having to walk around with something stuck to my chest just to make me look like a normal man. ‘While a lot of the fatty tissue had been removed my pecs still looked saggy.’ To make matters worse, Mr Jones started to feel depressed about his lack of work too. Mr Jones (pictured after his failed reconstruction surgery) said: 'I had been so excited about having the operation I didn't think about what could have gone wrong. I just assumed it would be straightforward and I would have the body I had always dreamed of' He said: ‘My confidence hit rock bottom, while I had always had issues about my body I was a grafter, I had always had my job to take my mind off things. ‘With no work on top of everything else I didn’t feel like a real man, I felt useless.’ But thankfully for Mr Jones, amongst all the bad luck, one thing had gone his way. He said: ‘I met Dawn, through a friend and we became a couple, she’s been my rock through everything. ‘It’s ironic that I had the operation so I could have a relationship one day but I’ve met Dawn despite it all going wrong. Mr Jones said: 'It's ironic that I had the operation so I could have a relationship one day but I've met Dawn despite it all going wrong' ‘It just seems unfair that after spending all that money, I’m still not happy with the way I look. ‘My chest looks saggy and I still wouldn’t take my top off in front of a stranger. Swimming or sunbathing in public is out of the question.’ Yet, despite everything he has been through, Mr Jones still stands by his decision to have the surgery. He said: ‘Like most people who have cosmetic surgery, I felt l had no other choice but to go under the knife, things had got that bad. Mr Jones said: 'My chest looks better than it used to and, although I've lost a nipple, I've found happiness' ‘My moobs had ruined my teen and adult years so I would have done anything to be rid of them. Sadly, it didn’t work out for me.’ After a long period of difficulty Mr Jones has also found a new job as a sales manager and is trying to move forward with his life. He said: ‘My chest looks better than it used to and although I’ve lost a nipple I’ve found happiness with Dawn. ‘I still hope something might be able to be done in the future to improve the way I look.’","Mark Jones was bullied at both school and work because of his 'moobs'

Naamen Meziche, 43, born in the French capital, travelled to Afghanistan in his early 20s and later joined the infamous 'Hamburg cell' in Germany some of whose members took part in the September 2001 atrocities. Meziche, described as a longtime member of Al Qaida was captured in May 2012 together with three other French nationals in the tribal regions of south east Pakistan which harbour Al Qaida operatives. Arrest: Naamen Meziche, 43, who was born in France,  joined the . infamous 'Hamburg cell' in Germany some of whose members took part in . the September 2001 atrocities . He was deported from Pakistan last Tuesday and arrested by French Police acting for the country's intelligence services and an anti terrorist judge. He was charged on Friday with complicity in criminal acts with a terrorist organisation with a view to committing crimes. Said to have been under surveillance by anti terrorist agencies for over ten years Meziche has no criminal record in Europe, French sources stressed today. Investigators wish to question him about information received by the German secret service and criminal acts carried out in the area of southern Afghanistan close to the Pakistan frontier. Pakistani intelligence sources said Meziche had links to Younis al-Mauritani, a suspected al Qaeda chief, believed to have planned the attacks in Europe and the US under the direct orders of Osama bin Laden. Roland Jacquard, head of the Paris-based International Terrorism Observatory, told FRANCE 24: 'Meziche is probably the terrorist who is most familiar with the recruitment channels used by al Qaeda to bring young jihadists to its training camps – and that’s why the French were so keen to get hold of him.'","Naamen Meziche was a member of the infamous 'Hamburg cell'

At least a third of the output is spent praising the government of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, while another third extols workers to toil harder for the good of the country. The weekly television highlight is ‘It’s So Funny’, a long-running comedy show in which two uniformed soldiers perform slapstick sketches in between propaganda lectures about the greatness of North Korea. At least a third of the output on Korean Central Television is spent praising the government of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un . The move to bring a little more light relief to the world’s most isolated country follows a BBC initiative last year, supported by the Foreign Office, to draw up a list of programmes the regime might consider importing. At the time the Foreign Secretary William Hague hailed it as ‘a good way to improve understanding about the outside world within such a closed society’. After long negotiations, the shortlist of three programmes was selected for consideration, with a report on each one sent to North Korea. ‘Extensive enquiries have been made about what these three shows involve and if they would be suitable for the Korean people,’ an insider in the capital Pyongyang told the Independent on Sunday. ‘Anything too political was not suitable but these are entertainment shows, and one of them is for young children.’ No timescale has been given for when an answer is expected, and the BBC said it would not comment until a final decision is made. It is likely that Top Gear, at least, may have some of its dialogue edited and censored before being broadcast, but there should be no such problem with Teletubbies.","Teletubbies also among shows that will be broadcast .

"By . Alex Greig . A celebrity chef is being sued after allegedly firing a night cook from his staff at a Manhattan boutique hotel while the man was on leave caring for his dying wife. Robert Esselborn says Anthony Paris, who won the Food Network's Chopped in 2010, dismissed him while he was on family medical leave from his job at the upmarket Crosby Street Hotel in December 2013, just one day before his wife died. According to suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, on December 19, four days after Esselborn requested time off to care for his critically ill wife and their two children, Paris emailed him demanding to know when he would be returning to work. Grieving: Chef Robert Esselborn lost his wife and his job within a day of each other . Sudden illness: Robert Esselborn lost his beloved wife Barbara after she suddenly and unexpectedly became critically ill . Esselborn explained that his wife Barbara was on life support in hospital and that he would reassess the situation on January 1, reports the New York Post. Paris then fired him, telling him the wait was 'too long,' and demanded he clean out his locker, despite knowing that Esselborn's wife was on life support. Barbara Esselborn died the following day. 'The Esselborn family was in a total state of shock and turmoil,' according to the wrongful termination suit. '[Esselborn] needed to care for his wife and children. He also needed to make critical decisions about how to medically care for his wife and what her wishes would be under the circumstances.' Barbara Esselborn, Robert Esselborn's . wife of almost 17 years, became seriously ill on December 15 and was . rushed to hospital with chronic organ failure. 'Over . the next 48 hours, the doctors had discovered that her vital organs . were shutting down and that her lungs and throat were infected,' the . filing reports. She then had a stroke and doctors told Esselborn his . wife was brain-dead. Heartless: TV chef Anthony Paris told Esselborn he was taking too long to care for his critically ill wife and the couple's two children and fired him . Grieving family: Esselborn took time off from his job to care for his wife and their two children during the painful time . On December 23, father-of-two Esselborn received an email from the HR department saying he'd been 'absent from work without notification,' reports the New York Daily News. Just over an hour later, Esselborn received an email from Paris telling him to disregard HR's email. 'I appreciate your situation and . value you as an employee, that's why we have waited. But at this time we . cannot wait until Jan. 1, 2014 for you to reassess your situation, we . will take this email as your resignation letter,' he wrote. Esselborn . responded to Paris, telling him 'the situation with my wife's health is . critical at this time' and that he required family medical leave. The . HR department responded, telling him he was not eligible for family . medical leave and that his position was terminated, reports the New York . Daily News. Barbara Esselborn was taken off life support the next day. Under New York's Family and Medical Leave Act, employees are entitled to take 12 weeks of 'unpaid, job-protected leave' annually for various situations, including 'to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition.' Luxe hotel: Esselborn was a chef at the Crosby Street Hotel, where Anthony Paris is executive chef . The suit claims that Paris 'willfully' failed to inform the HR department of Esselborn's request for family medical leave 'in an effort to retaliate against Esselborn for exercising his federally protected right,' reports the New York Post. 'Then I heard nothing,' Esselborn told the Post. 'No card, nothing, just ""Turn in your key and have a nice day.""' Esselborn's wrongful termination suit claims he was eligible for family leave because he had worked more than 1,250 hours at the hotel restaurant during the year he'd been employed there. The suit seeks unspecified damages from Paris and the Crosby Street Hotel 'for intentional, outrageous and extreme conduct.' Neither Paris nor the hotel responded to requests for comment.","Executive chef at a luxe Manhattan hotel Anthony Paris allegedly dismissed an employee who was caring for his sick wife .

"By . James  Nye . and Joel Christie . The Canadian man on trial for the rape and murder of a Chinese student in her Toronto apartment while her horrified boyfriend watched helplessly on Skype in Beijing was found guilty on Monday. Brian Dickson, 32, did not show any emotion as he was convicted of the first degree murder of 23-year-old Qian Liu in April 2011, receiving a life-sentence with no chance of parole for 25-years. Liu's father broke down in tears as the verdict was delivered - bringing an end to three years of trauma for the family after the York University student's boyfriend watched her fend off Dickson before calmly turning the computer off. Scroll down for video . Brian Dickson, 32, had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, but the . prosecution rejected the lesser charge in the death of Qian Liu. Justice . Anne Molloy imposed a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 . years . Liu was found dead after her boyfriend managed to contact authorities after he witnessed the last moments of his girlfriends life. Robert Nuttall, Dickson's lawyer, said his client has been 'absolutely remorseful for a very long time.' 'He didn't say anything. He just accepted the verdict,' Nuttall said. 'It was a very tough case. A very, very tragic case.' 'The case hung on the mechanism of death. The jury struggled with it, the jury made their decision and they made their decision of first-degree murder,' said Nuttall. Nuttall said his client accepted the verdict. 'Mr. Dickson has always had his eyes wide open.' Devastated: Ya Ru Zheng holds a photo of her daughter Qian Liu outside a courthouse in Toronto, on Monday, April 7, 2014. A jury has found 32-year-old Brian Dickson guilty of first-degree murder in the death of York University student . Tears: York University student Liu Qian's father Liu Jianhui and mother Zheng Yaru, right, broke down in tears  in court as the verdict was announced on Monday. They are pictured here in Toronto on Monday, March 24, 2014 . The prosecution presented the theory that Dickson forced himself on Liu then killed her by asphyxiation to cover it up. Liu, who was 23, had moved to Canada to study English. Dickson lived in an apartment in the same house as Liu, just outside the campus of York University. Nuttal said it's too early to say if Dickson will appeal the verdict. 'He's been absolutely remorseful for a very, very long period of time,' he said. Last month, the shocking testimony of Liu's boyfriend, Xian Chao Meng reduced the court room to silence. He explained through an interpreter how he Dickson burst through the door of the his girlfriend's basement studio while he was on Skype with her before he heard two 'muffled bangs' and then silence. Moments later Dickson appeared naked from the abdomen down in front of the computer and quickly turned it off. Liu was found dead in April 2011, just a few hours after her boyfriend in China watched via webcam as she tried to fend off an attacker who appeared at her door. The boyfriend told police he saw Liu struggling with a man before her computer was shut off . Liu's naked body was found covered in blood and semen on April 16, 2011. According to Meng, the night before he had been talking to Liu for hours on both Skype and QQ, which is China's version of MSN. He was on his laptop in Beijing, where it was about noon, while Liu was doing homework in Toronto, where she attended York University and it was about midnight. The couple had broken up three months earlier but remained friends, catching up every couple of weeks. Meng told the court he could see Liu, wearing a headset, sitting in front of the computer in her apartment just south of the university campus. Also visible in the frame was the door, to about knee level. 'She said to me that somebody was knocking on the door. She would check,' he said. Liu rose to answer the light knock, saying something through the door first in English, which Meng couldn't understand. As Liu opened the door partway to her visitor, Meng caught sight of a man standing in the door frame. 'A foreigner, not a Chinese,' he said. Brian Dickson, pictured in a photo from his Myspace account, pleaded not guilty to killing Qian Liu . The man, his hair mussed in the front, was wearing a half-sleeved dark-colored crewneck T-shirt and loose shorts. 'After the door was opened, the two had a chat close to the door frame,' Meng told court. It seemed to Meng that the male asked to see Liu's cellphone. The jury heard earlier that Liu had been having Wi-Fi issues and had asked other tenants — the building was full of student residents — for help resolving them. Liu, said Meng, got her phone and handed it to the man. 'He did some operation on the cellphone.' While the visitor was thus occupied, Liu sat back down at her computer. Meng saw her face in profile as she spoke to the male. 'The man was in and out of the door frame,' Meng testified. 'It seemed that he was hesitant.' They appeared to be parting when 'all of a sudden, something abnormal took place,' said Meng. 'That male tried to force his way in. Liu was trying hard to push the door, not to let him in. She could not prevent him from entering. He wanted to embrace Qian Liu. (She) was all the time pushing at his chest.' Meng heard Liu say 'No'  in Cantonese. 'Maybe she felt he did not understand. Then she said 'No' in English. But that person did not listen.' There was a struggle, visible to Meng. Star witness: Xian Chao Meng was on Skype with his girlfriend Qian Liu when she was murdered. He has told her murder trial exactly what he saw and heard that night . 'Qian Lu was pinned.' Liu then fell out of camera range. 'Then I heard two muffled bangs. From then, I heard no more sound from Qian Liu.' In the silence that followed, Meng said he heard the man breathing heavily and, shortly afterwards, what he thought sounded like furniture being moved. The light in Liu's room was shut off. Meng thinks he heard what may have been the jingle of keys. The male next appeared directly in front of the computer. 'He was already naked. I could see the part of his body below the abdomen to the knees. He leaned forward to shut off the computer.' When the webcam was turned off, Meng continued to make an audio recording; he and Liu had simultaneously been communicating by cellphone. That connection was still open and the tape was played for the jury. What Meng thought was keys jingling might also be the sound of a belt unbuckling. Meng is also heard swearing in Cantonese. 'This is the only way I let out what I was feeling . . . I was stunned.' An autopsy could not determine definitively how Liu died, though a pathologist has testified it was likely by 'mechanical asphyxiation,' with compression applied to her neck. Male DNA from swabs of a substance lifted from Liu's breasts was matched — to a degree of probability estimated to be 1 in 25 trillion — to Dickson. Semen found on Liu's groin area matched Dickson to a probability of 1 in 2.7 quintillion, and DNA from a small blood stain on a blue T-shirt seized from Dickso's first-floor apartment matched Liu to a probably of 1 in 140 quadrillion.","Brian Dickson, 32, was found guilty of the first-degree murder of Chinese student Qian Liu in court today in Toronto .

"A soldier’s charity is to close down after it raked in £555,000 in donations - but spent just £15,000 on actually helping people. Afghan Heroes was founded by Denise Harris in memory of her son Lee who was killed by an improvised explosive device in Nad-e-Al while serving in Afghanistan in July 2009. The Charity Commission froze the organisation’s bank accounts and launched an inquiry in December into the charity which helps hard-up and injured former soldiers. But an interim manager has now declared the charity 'no longer a viable concern' and would be wound up while the investigation continues. Afghan Heroes was founded by Denise Harris in memory of her son Lee, who was killed by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. The charity is now closing and is being investigated by a charity watchdog . In a letter to former volunteers, interim manager Brian Johnson of HW Fisher & Company, said: “As a result I am, I am in the process of winding down the operations of the charity and no further action should take place in terms of events or other fundraising or support activities.” During 2012, Afghan Heroes recieved £548,440, and while it spent £516,288, just £15,153 went on helping soldiers and their families. Some £241,014 was spent on encouraging people to donate money, £233,910 on fundraising events, and a staggering £190,479 on wages for eight full-time and 16 part-time staff. Fundraiser Tony Hall, volunteered for the charity four days a week and raised around £20,000 for the organisation over three years after he met founder Denise Harris. Mr Hall, who left when he found out the charity was under investigation, said: 'I feel sorry for them in truth. 'She lost her son and that is sad. They didn’t expect this. They expected to get through it I think. 'I don’t hate them for that has happened. It is just that I wonder where the money has gone sometimes. 'It is all very well saying it is being wound up and it is not ‘viable’ but where has all the fund raising that we worked so hard for gone?' Police say there has been a huge increase in the number of fake charities fraudulently claiming to cater to injured servicemen> File picture . The commission met with the trustees last October to discuss misgivings but still had concerns about financial mismanagement so started an inquiry. In a statement at the time, the watchdog said it is looking at the charity’s management and administration including 'the significant risk to, and potential loss of, the charity’s funds or other property'. It is also investigating 'unmanaged conflicts of interest and unauthorised trustee benefits' and whether trustees have made any failings. A report will be published following the conclusion of the inquiry. In a statement in December, Denise Harris, 50, said the Somerset-based charity had tried to act properly and the last year had been busy. She said: 'The charity was set up in 2009 when my son died while serving in Afghanistan and is run by a very small team, with most activities undertaken by myself and my husband. 'In the past year we have opened our first retreat for service personnel in Somerset, which has five bedrooms that are currently fully occupied. 'Full financial disclosure and access to our records has been made to the Charity Commission, which will report in due course. 'We have tried to act properly and within the regulations at all times. 'The inquiry will reveal whether anyone within the organisation has made any mistakes or mismanaged anything during an incredibly busy period for us. 'Our aim is for funds donated to benefit our troops. 'We are working with our advisers and the Charity Commission to resolve this issue and ensure that the best interests of recovering personnel are uppermost.' Since it launched in 2009, Afghan Heroes has provided money to build memorials, organised holidays for families of wounded soldiers, and set up two retreats in Ashcott and Minehead, in Somerset. A spokeswoman for the Charity Commission said she could not comment on an ongoing inquiry. While there is no suggestion that Afghan Heroes has been involved in any wrongdoing, police say there has been a huge increase in the number of fake charities fraudulently claiming to cater to injured servicemen. Commander Stephen Head, lead on charity fraud for the Association of Chief Police Officers, told the Daily Star: 'In terms of cases relating to armed forces and veterans charities, of those that we see, the largest number by a long way relate to people who have got names similar to Help For Heroes.' The number of cases has leapt from two in 2012 to 29 last year.","Denise Harris founded charity after son Lee died in war-torn nation in 2009 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Daily Mail Reporter . One of the two Chris Christie aides revealed in a newly-released report to have been romantically involved leading up to last year's traffic closures is fighting back. The lawyer for Bridget Anne Kelly, who infamously sent an email saying 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee', and whose judgement was called into question after a failed relationship Christie's former campaign manager Bill Stepien, slammed the findings of the Bridgegate inquiry. Attorney Michael Critchley said in a statement to the Star-Ledger that 'the report's venomous, gratuitous, and inappropriate sexist remarks concerning Ms. Kelly have no place in what is alleged to be a professional and independent report.' Under examination: Bridget Anne Kelly, the Christie aide who sent the infamous 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee' email, was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal . Close: Bill Stepien (left) was Christie's campaign manager until April when he stepped down and Bridget Kelly took over . The report released by a law firm . Christie hired to investigate the scandal, said that the two had been a . couple for months but had called things off a month before the George . Washington Bridge lane closures. Critchely called the report 'a preemptive strike' meant to 'isolate Ms Kelly and impugn her credibility,' 'Ms. Kelly is not a liar,' the statement continued. 'She is a single mother of four children who was deeply devoted and committed to her job at the Office of the Governor. 'She worked tirelessly to pursue the goals of the Office during her tenure.' Stepien, 36, worked as the Republican governor's deputy chief of staff and then when he left the post in April to become Christie's campaign manager, he was replaced by Kelly, 41. 'At . some point after Stepien’s departure to run the campaign, Kelly and . Stepien became personally involved, although, by early August 2013, . their personal relationship had cooled, apparently at Stepien’s choice, . and they largely stopped speaking,' the report by Randy Mastro states. 'Because Stepien was her ""benefactor,"" Kelly relied heavily on him during this transition' ahead of their August break up. The . report also concluded that the governor was not involved in a plot to . create gridlock near a major bridge as part of a political retribution . scheme. The taxpayer-funded . report released by Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, relies on . interviews with Christie and other officials in his administration and . 250,000 documents, many of them emails and text messages. Chris Christie's government funded lawyer claims the New Jersey governor had nothing to do with the George Washington Bridge scandal . 'We . found that Governor Christie had no knowledge beforehand of this George . Washington Bridge realignment idea,' Mastro said at a news conference. His report comes out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers. Some of the key figures would not cooperate with Mastro's investigation, leading Democrats to question the credibility of the report and its thoroughness. Assembly Select Committee on Investigation Co-Chair John Wisniewski released a statement effectively calling the report an attempt by Christie to move past the issue without critically examining the scandal. 'Lawyers hired by and paid by the Christie administration itself to investigate the governor’s office who then say the governor and most of his office did nothing wrong will not be the final word on this matter,' he said in a statement. During a media conference call Thursday, Wisniewski said that the mention of Kelly and Stepien's romantic entanglements was 'irrelevant' especially because neither were interviewed for the report so there was no clear connection between their love life and the lane closures. 'It is very difficult to tell who is telling the truth when you don't hear from both sides,' he said. 'It reads more like a novel than a work of fact.' Defending the report at a news conference Thursday, Mastro said, 'We believe we have gotten to the truth or we wouldn't be reporting it.' The September closure of lanes near the bridge that caused four days of massive gridlock in the community of Fort Lee have become a major scandal for Christie, a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender. Christie said on a radio show Wednesday that the events will not affect his decisions about his political future. In his view: Governor Christie's office hired Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor, to investigate the scandal and the report released Thursday declares clears Christie of wrongdoing . The lawyer hired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to review a traffic-blocking scandal that has engulfed Christie's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot . The report, issued at Mastro's New York law office, concludes that former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey official David Wildstein and ex-Christie aide Bridget Kelly were behind the closures and that they were targeting Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. But it did not conclude why they wanted to hurt the Democrat and said there was no evidence that it was because he refused to endorse Christie for re-election last year. Mastro says that Kelly, who did not cooperate with the report, tried to cover her tracks when Christie began asking what happened last year by asking a colleague to delete an email about the plot but the other staffer retained the email anyway, the report says. Mastro also says that Wildstein suggested he mentioned traffic issues in Fort Lee to Christie at public event during the lane realignment. Wildstein says Christie did not recall it being brought up and if it was, it would not have registered as significant to Christie — something Christie has said before. The report also finds that a claim by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, that Christie's administration told her that Superstorm Sandy would be tied to a private redevelopment plan, is 'demonstrably false'. A spokesman for Zimmer did not immediately return a call. Mastro calls for Christie's office staffers to cease using personal email accounts for official business, eliminating the office where Kelly had worked and appointing an ethics officer in the governor's office. He also recommends major changes to the structure of Port Authority, an agency jointly run by the states of New York and New Jersey.","Bridget Anne Kelly's attorney said the remarks about her personal life 'have no place in... an independent report'

"By . Alex Greig . In the wake of the embarrassing 'bridgegate' scandal, a new poll has revealed that Americans now have a largely unfavorable opinion of the New Jersey Governor and presidential hopeful Chris Christie. However, among his core Republican supporters, Christie's approval ratings are almost unchanged from before the September 2013 closure of the George Washington Bridge as revenge against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey by Christie staff. The survey found that 51 per cent of Republicans say they have a favorable opinion of Christie while 33 per cent have an unfavorable opinion. Taking a dive: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (seen here in March) has lost favor with Independents and Democrats but his fellow Republicans haven't wavered . Overall, 45 per cent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Christie, and 34 per cent have a favorable opinion. These figures show a dramatic drop since January, when another YouGov/Huffington Post poll found that just 34 per cent of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of the New Jersey Governor, and 38 per cent had a positive view of him. Increasingly, Americans are mistrustful of Christie, with 36 per cent saying they believe he is lying when he says he didn't know anything about his staff's involvement in causing the bridge bottleneck - though 48 per cent of Republicans believe he is telling the truth, as opposed to 19 per cent who believe he's lying. The drop in approval is almost entirely among Democrats and Independents, who largely believe Christie lied about his involvement in bridgegate and that he is an unfavorable candidate. As for Christie's presidential hopes, 10 per cent of Republicans 'definitely' plan to support his nomination, while 32 per cent would consider it. Massive holdups: Two of three lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed between September 9-13 at the behest of Christie staffers without warning to the public or emergency services . Christie has maintained throughout the scandal that he was ignorant of any revenge plot hatched by his staff. A law firm handpicked by Christie himself somewhat unsurprisingly found that he was not involved in the bridge closure scheme. The tax-payer funded, self-commissioned report came out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in October - before the scandal erupted - showed that just 17 per cent of Americans viewed Christie negatively, a dramatic difference from today's results. The September 9 lane closure on the George Washington Bridge caused a threat to public safety, not to mention inconvenience to residents. Local area officials and emergency services officers, as well as the general public, were not notified of the lane closures, and there were multiple cases in which emergency services responses were delayed.","A YouGov/Huffington Post poll shows that Chris Christie's approval ratings have fallen among Americans since 'bridgegate'

"By . Mark Duell . Gunmen killed three Egyptian soldiers in an attack on a bus today - prompting a warning from the army that it would eliminate the Muslim Brotherhood. Al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militant groups in Sinai have stepped up attacks on security forces since the army toppled President Mohamed Mursi in July after mass protests against his rule. Some 49 people were killed yesterday in anti-government protests which were attacked by supporters of the new political order and security forces, witnesses said. Scroll down for video . Attack: His appearance comes as British holidaymakers are repeatedly told to stay indoors in Egypt's capital after 80 people died during a weekend of street clashes. Above, protestors throw stones and glass at police . Help: Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi carry an injured demonstrator who was shot during clashes in Cairo . Deaths: Supporters of Egypt's army and police at Tahrir Square, on the third anniversary of Egypt's uprising . Yesterday was the third anniversary of the uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Security forces said they fired live rounds on Brotherhood supporters as they tried to set up a sit-in in Cairo. Security sources said that 23 people died in the incident, 22 from by bullet wounds, and that they were included in the official death toll of 49. The violence showed deep divisions that have flared often since the 2011 revolt that raised hopes of a stable democracy. The military blames the Brotherhood for much of Egypt's political violence. In another attack in lawless Sinai, five soldiers were killed yesterday when an army helicopter crashed in the north of the peninsula in an operation against militants. It was a missile attack, security sources said, without giving further details. The army has not commented on the cause of the crash. Militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem) claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on an army helicopter in a statement posted on the internet. Fire: Supporters of the Brotherhood and President Mursi close the road during clashes with riot police in Cairo . Protection: A riot policeman sits inside a police vehicle on October Bridge during the clashes with protestors . Tanks: Supporters of Egypt's army and police cheer with national flags and Sisi posters in front of armoured personnel carriers standing guard in front of Tahrir Square . The group also said it was behind a wave of bomb attacks in Cairo on Friday which killed at least six people. Egyptian authorities make no distinction . between militants operating in the Sinai and the Brotherhood, which . renounced violence in the 1970s but has been declared a terrorist group . by the Egyptian government. 'We assure the Egyptian people of the great determination of its men to fight black terrorism and the complete elimination of the advocates of oppression and sedition and blasphemy from followers of the Muslim Brotherhood' Egyptian army . In a statement on Facebook, the army said: â€˜We assure the Egyptian people of the great determination of its men to fight black terrorism and the complete elimination of the advocates of oppression and sedition and blasphemy from followers of the Muslim Brotherhood.â€™ . The soldiers who were killed in the bus attack were on their way back from holiday when gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, security sources said. Security forces have killed up to 1,000 Muslim Brotherhood supporters and put the movement's top leaders in jail. But the tough measures have failed to pacify Egypt, which is of great strategic importance because of its peace treaty with Israel and control over the Suez Canal. Destruction: A security guard walks at the Islamic Art Museum, which was damaged by a car bomb attack targeting the nearby Cairo Security Directorate on Friday . Taken away: Riot police arrest anti-government protesters and members of the Brotherhood during clashes at Ramsis Street, which leads to Tahrir Square . Death toll: Some 49 people were killed yesterday in anti-government protests which were attacked by supporters of the new political order and security forces, witnesses said . Interim President Adly Mansour announced today that Egypt's presidential elections would be held before parliamentary polls. The new political timetable could see army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who toppled Egypt's first democratically-elected president, become head of state within months. Parliamentary elections were supposed to happen first under the roadmap agreed after the army deposed Mr Mursi. But critics argued that a presidential poll should be held first to elect a strong leader able to stabilise Egypt before potentially divisive parliamentary elections. General Sisi, who was President Mubarak's head of military intelligence, is expected to announce his candidacy for the presidency soon and is likely to win by a landslide. His supporters view him as a decisive figure who can pacify Egypt. The Brotherhood accuses him of masterminding a coup and holds him responsible for what it says are human rights abuses.","Egyptian army warns that it will eliminate the Muslim Brotherhood .

"By . James  Nye . U.S. and Canadian Coast Guard crews kept up their battle on Monday to clear pathways for vessels hauling vital raw materials on the ice-clogged Great Lakes, where a shipping logjam forced a weeklong shutdown of the nation's largest steel factory. Traffic remained largely at a crawl after a winter that produced some of the heaviest ice on record across the five inland seas, where more than half the surface area remained solid this week. Icebreaking ships slogging across Lake Superior were still encountering ice layers 2 feet to 3 feet thick. In some areas, wind and wave action created walls of ice up to 14 feet high. Scroll down for video . Frozen: U.S. Coast Guard a convoy of Great Lakes cargo ships line up to follow an icebreaker on the St. Marys River, which links Lakes Superior and Huron. U.S. Steel said Monday, April 7, 2014 that its largest mill in Gary, Indiana, is on limited production because of a lack of raw materials . United States Steel Corp.'s plant in Gary, Indiana, had resumed limited operations after receiving a shipment over the weekend of iron ore from a company mill near Detroit, which was sending one additional load, spokeswoman Courtney Boone said. Two ships were scheduled to arrive Tuesday with ore from mines in northern Minnesota following a two-week voyage across Lake Superior, which ordinarily would take three days. Other companies were hoping their supplies would be adequate to avoid significant disruptions. 'Nobody's stockpile situation is very good,' said Glen Nekvasil, a spokesman for the Lake Carriers' Association, which represents companies that operate 57 U.S.-flagged freighters on the Great Lakes. 'It's still very slow sledding.' Polar vortex: A ship is frozen in Lake Superior at port in Superior, Wisconsin on February 15, 2014. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, about 94% of Lake Superior was covered with ice this winter . Only three ships were able to haul coal on the lakes in March, their cargos combining for 102,000 tons - down 70 percent from the same month in 2013, he said. Coal trade was 54 percent below the long-term first-quarter average. The Gary Works mill generates steel for industries such as construction and auto manufacturing. Production resumed at one of the mill's three furnaces after Sunday's shipment was received, Boone said. The Gary Works is capable of producing 7.5 million tons of steel per year. U.S. Steel was able to operate off stockpiles for some time before the ice began affecting production, Boone said. Charles Bradford, a steel industry analyst, said the company should have done better planning even though this winter was among the harshest in recent memory. Coast Guard Cutter Biscayne Bay, a 140-foot ice-breaking tug, sails through ice covered waters toward the shores off Indiana as U.S. Steel said on Monday, April 7, 2014 that its largest mill in Gary had to halt production over the weekend . Production: U.S. Steel's sprawling Gary Works plant in Gary, Indiana sits a short distance from Gary's City Hall . At one point, ice extended across 92 percent of the Great Lakes, falling just short of the record set in 1979. 'They know that every winter the Great Lakes freeze over,' Bradford said. Boone declined to comment. The shipping season officially began two weeks ago with the opening of navigational locks on the St. Marys River connecting Lakes Superior and Huron, a bottleneck for vessels hauling iron ore and coal to manufacturers and electric power plants. But just one convoy of vessels - including two icebreakers and the two ships hauling iron ore - had traversed Superior with loads of freight. Two other coal haulers were docked in Superior, Wis., waiting to make deliveries to a power plant in Marquette, Mich., said Mark Gill, director of vessel traffic service for the U.S. Coast Guard in Sault Ste. Marie. Five empty vessels were expected to begin crossing Lake Superior on Tuesday to pick up iron ore. Revelations: Sightseers trek across a frozen expanse of Lake Superior, the world's largest freshwater lake, to the sea caves of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore near Cornucopia, Wisconsin on February 15, 2014 . The We Energies Presque Isle power plant in Marquette was operating just three of its five generating units to conserve coal until more arrives, spokesman Barry McNulty said. Even so, there wasn't enough demand to disrupt service, he said. The plant serves about 22,000 customers, mostly in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. DTE Energy, which operates five coal-fired plants in southeastern Michigan, has dealt with dwindling stocks by taking some units out of production for maintenance ahead of schedule and making up for the loss by buying power from the grid, spokesman Scott Simons said. 'This will hold us over until we can rebuild our supplies,' Simons said. General Motors has not had any delays or material shortages because of Great Lakes shipping problems, spokesman Tom Henderson said. Nine U.S. Coast Guard ships are capable of breaking ice but only one, the Mackinaw, is equipped to deal with the thickest formations, Gill said. The Canadian Coast Guard dispatched two heavy-duty vessels to assist. About three-quarters of Lake Superior, the largest and deepest of the Great Lakes, remained ice-covered. Gill estimated it would be about two weeks before the surface is clear enough for freighters to make the crossing without an icebreaker escort. Even then, the icebreakers probably will be on duty well into May and possibly as late as Memorial Day. 'We'll be constantly on search-and-destroy missions, finding big pieces of ice and breaking them into smaller pieces,' Gill said.","United States Steel Corp.'s plant in Gary, Indiana had to shut over the weekend after its iron ore supplies failed to arrive .

"By . Reuters . After a two-decade manhunt, New Jersey police have captured a convicted sex offender who was one of the state's top 12 most-wanted fugitives, authorities said on Monday. A multi-state investigation and three-day stakeout ended the 23-year search for James Wade Barclay with his arrest on Saturday, the New Jersey State Police Department said. Barclay was arrested in 1989 and pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old multiple times over a two-year period, but he never showed up for his sentencing hearing in September 1991. He had been on the run ever since. James Wade Barclay (pictured left on Saturday) was arrested after evading sexual assault charges and going on the run for 23 years. He was arrested in 1989 (right) but failed to show up to his sentencing hearing . Police recently learned that Barclay had created a new identity, going by the alias James Toryone and working as a trucker throughout the United States, police said. He was able to purchase a home, develop new friendships and attend social functions where children were present. Barclay had created a new identity and worked as a trucker for 20 years . The investigation led New Jersey police to stake out a 'Stop N Ride' parking lot in rural Pennsylvania for three days. Three detectives from the department's fugitive unit took shifts watching the lot from a rental car. They donned camouflage suits when remotely surveying the lot from a wooded area nearby, police said. Barclay was spotted inside a parked tractor trailer and arrested without incident. He attempted to use his alias before admitting his true identity, police said. 'This arrest demonstrates our unwavering commitment to capture wanted fugitives,' said Colonel Rick Fuentes, Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, in a statement. Barclay is being held in a Pennsylvania jail on $5 million bail and awaiting extradition to New Jersey. It is not clear if Barclay has an attorney.","James Wade Barclay was arrested on Saturday in rural Pennsylvania after a 23-year search .

"By . Tara Brady . Plans for a new high street on the site of the old Battersea Power Station have been unveiled. The pedestrianised street, designed by architects Gehry Partners and Foster & Partners, will be called The Electric Boulevard and sit to the south of the power station. It will connect the Northern Line Extension station with the power station on the redeveloped 42-acre site in south London. Plans for a new high street on the site of the old Battersea power station have been unveiled . The ground-level shops to the east of the boulevard, designed by Gehry Partners, will be called Prospect Place and have double-height ceilings while two floors of retail units, created by Foster & Partners, will front on to the western side. This is the third phase of the planned regeneration for the former industrial site and is to include more than 1,300 homes in a range of sizes and styles in two zones on either side of the boulevard, a 160-room hotel and 350,000 sq ft of retail and restaurant space plus additional leisure space. The new street would connect the Northern Line Extension station with the power station on the redeveloped 42-acre site in south London . Another 103 affordable homes, out of a total 517 affordable homes to be provided across the whole development, are part of these phase three plans. Gehry Partners founder Frank Gehry said: 'Our goal from the start has been to create a neighbourhood that connects into the historic fabric of the city of London, but one that has its own identity and integrity.' Grant Brooker, design director and senior partner at Foster & Partners, said: 'We moved our own office to Wandsworth almost 25 years ago - the borough is very important to us, so we were absolutely delighted to be chosen by the shareholders of Battersea power station to be part of this inspiring regeneration project. Another 103 affordable homes, out of a total 517 affordable homes to be provided across the whole development . 'It will transform the area and create a vibrant new district for south London that we can all be proud of.' Rob Tincknell, chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development Company, added: 'We are determined to create a genuine sense of place, and developing landmark buildings in which people are proud to make their home and work in is vital to us achieving this aim.' Culture minister Ed Vaizey described Battersea power station as an 'iconic site' and hoped the new design would 'put Battersea on the world stage once again'. 'The plans for a new high street for the capital show that London continues to attract the best in terms of architecture, design and innovation,' he said.","Street designed by architects Gehry Partners and Foster & Partner .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Katherine Poxon, 22, pictured outside Leeds Crown Court, has been jailed for conspiring to unlawfully cause GBH to her husband Steven Poxon . A cheating wife who plotted with her lover to stab her husband to death so they could be together has been jailed for more than two years – but has remarkably been forgiven by her understanding husband. Katherine Poxon, 22, and her lover Stephen Swallow, 44, have both been jailed for the plot to attack Steven Poxon, which a judge said lacked ‘guile and sophistication’. Leeds Crown Court heard how the young mother nagged Swallow via text to ‘get the job done’, after her husband found out about their affair and threatened to take custody of their son. However, Mr Poxon has now forgiven his scheming wife - he attended court for the sentencing hearing and plans to reconcile with her when she is released from prison. Mrs Poxon of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, was described by defence lawyer Richard Clews as an ‘immature and silly girl, rather than a calculating and cold criminal’ as the court was told about her plan to brutally attack her spouse. The court heard how the Poxons' marriage had become unhappy prior to their split in December 2012. However, the pair reunited in spring last year, just before Mrs Poxon began an affair with 44-year-old Swallow. Swallow, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, said he had known Katherine Poxon - who appeared in the dock wearing black shiny leggings, a checked shirt and bright pink trainers - for a few years before they began their affair. The two were arrested last September and had their phones seized by police officers, after Swallow admitted to his niece that he planned to kill Mr Poxon. Gurdial Singh, prosecuting, told the court Katherine Poxon sent her lover a series of texts before saying: ‘I hope you kill Stu [Steven] babe, then we can be happy. ‘You know if you come out tomorrow . will you and your mate do that thing for me? I would love for it to be . done so we can be together.’ She then sent him a text asking him to ‘get the job done’. Swallow . was later seen by a neighbour standing drinking outside the Poxon . family home in September last year, claiming he was ‘off to stab Poxon’ and pulling two knives out of his pocket. In . a statement to police, the neighbour said: ‘I was aware of the affair . that was going on. I was at home when I saw Swallow outside his house . mouthing off and drinking from a can of lager. ‘He said, “I’m off to go and stab him”, then he took two knives out of his pocket. ‘I calmed him down and told him to go back inside. He later thanked me for calming him down.’ Defending . Swallow, Robin Frieze told the judge his client was a ‘vulnerable’ person with previous convictions for theft and moderate violence, . fuelled by problems with drink and depression. Katherine Poxon, 22, left, has been forgiven by her husband Steven, right, despite conspiring with her lover Stephen Swallow, 44, to brutally attack her spouse . Stephen Swallow, 44, left, and Katherine Poxon, 22, right, were both jailed at Leeds Crown Court after pleading guilty to conspiring to unlawfully cause GBH to Mrs Poxon's husband Steven in September last year . Mr Frieze said: ‘Poxon knew about his psychiatric problems and he thought she would support him, instead she said she wanted her husband dead so he said he would help her. ‘He said he wouldn’t have gone through with it although there were several occasions he left the house with a knife.’ Mr Frieze told the judge his client had later described Poxon as being ‘twisted’, that her marriage was ‘unhappy’ and that she was ‘angry’ with her husband for threatening to take away their son and wanted him to get him ‘out of her life’. In February, Poxon and Swallow pleaded guilty to conspiring together to unlawfully cause GBH. Stephen Swallow, 44, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, was seen by a neighbour standing drinking outside the Poxon family home in September last year, claiming he was 'off to stab Poxon' Telling them they should be ‘thankful’ of the neighbour’s intervention, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC sentenced Swallow to three years in prison, while Poxon was jailed for 27 months. Turning to Poxon, the judge said: ‘This was not a sophisticated conspiracy, and I am aware your husband has forgiven you. ‘You are still very young and have no previous convictions.’ He added: ‘You lack guile and sophistication and Mr Swallow you are fortunate you have a supportive family who will allow you to stay with them when you are released from prison.’","Katherine Poxon and Stephen Swallow admitted plot to harm Steven Poxon .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Tragic: Jesse Quincey, 15, has died after falling from a train station platform on to a 750-volt live rail while 'drunk on vodka' A teenage boy has died after falling from a train station platform on to a 750-volt live rail while 'drunk on vodka'. Jesse Quincey, 15, was electrocuted when he stumbled on to the power line at Horley railway station in Surrey yesterday. Despite emergency crews arriving at the scene within minutes, he was pronounced dead at around 8.40pm. Jesse, from Redhill, Surrey, has been named locally, but is yet to be formally identified by police. Today, his distraught friends said he had been drunk on vodka when he fell on to the station's 'third rail', which is situated between the rails of the track and provides power to trains. Trent Reed, 16, said Jesse had been standing on the platform with another friend called Morgan when the accident happened. 'He was here with us last night. It was just a usual night . and we were chatting and stuff,' he said. 'Jesse . turned up drunk. He was drinking vodka but that was what he was like. He had had a hard life so I think he drank to block out the pain. 'He seemed quite drunk so Morgan walked him to the station so he could catch the train home. 'The . next thing we heard was he had fallen on the tracks and was dead. I . just can't get my head around it. He was with us one minute and gone the . next.' Mr Reed said Jesse had been taken into care after his father was sent to prison and his mother became seriously ill - adding: 'But you never saw him without a smile on his face.' Police were called to Horley railway station yesterday after Jesse fell from the platform edge, while a train which had just passed through the station juddered to a halt. British Transport Police and Surrey Police officers and paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes, but were unable to do anything to save the teenager. Scene: The teenager was electrocuted when he stumbled on to the power line at Horley railway station (pictured) in Surrey yesterday. Despite paramedics' best efforts, he was pronounced dead at around 8.40pm . Today, investigators were examining CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses at the railway station. One woman, whose son was friends with Jesse, said the news of the teenager's death was 'absolutely heartbreaking'. 'He was in my house last night and he was the same old Jesse,' she said. 'He had an outstanding personality and he was always there for his friends to talk to. Investigation: The British Transport Police are investigating the teenager's death and speaking to witnesses . 'He was always laughing. Despite everything he had been through in his life, I have never seen that boy sad.' A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: 'Officers from BTP and Surrey Police attended Horley railway station on Monday after a report of a body on the tracks. 'The incident was reported to BTP at 8.41pm and was also attended by Surrey Fire Service and South East Coast Service. 'On arrival, officers discovered the body of a male who is believed to have been electrocuted after falling from the platform and coming into contact with the live power rail. 'He was pronounced dead at the scene. The spokesman added: 'At this stage, officers believe there are no suspicious circumstances and the incident appears to have been the result of a tragic accident.' An inquest is expected to take place in due course.","Jesse Quincey fell on to 750-volt rail at Horley station in Surrey yesterday .

"By . Paul Bentley . Feud: The late Poet Laureate's love life is back in the spotlight after a row between a biographer and his widow . He was as renowned for his tempestuous relationships as he was for his award-winning poetry. And Ted Hughes's extraordinary love life is once again in the spotlight after a row between his widow and an academic planning a no holds barred biography. Jonathan Bate, an English professor at Oxford, has worked for four years on a book about the poet after being given access to Hughes's journals, diaries and unpublished poems. He has since been banned from looking at any more documents by the poet's widow Carol Hughes after uncovering new material about a series of affairs and his turbulent relationship with his first wife Sylvia Plath, a fellow poet who committed suicide in 1963. Mrs Hughes has also requested he now return any photocopies he has made of documents held in an American archive. Mr Bate yesterday spoke of his anger about the project being sabotaged. 'It makes me wonder if there is some secret being guarded,' he told the Sunday Times. 'Of course I would have to make some references to his love life, but that itself was so important to his poetry. The point is that everything he did in a remarkable life fed into his writing.' The biography Professor Bate has been working on was never officially authorised but Mrs Hughes gave her blessing and initially allowed him access to archives on condition that personal revelations were only used to inform understanding of the poet's works. She has since reneged on permission she granted for him to photocopy material from the Hughes archive in the British Library, which bought the collection from her in 2008 for Â£500,000. Mr Bate discovered new material about his scrutinised relationship with Plath, including an unpublished poem which reveals how he tried to reconcile their relationship over a romantic dinner in Soho shortly before she killed herself. Ended co-operation: Carol Hughes has banned Oxford professor Jonathan Bate from seeing any more material . Hughes was subsequently blamed for his wife's death. The poet later had a relationship with German Assia Wevill, who also committed suicide. In 1970, he then married Carol Orchard but took mistresses including novelist Emma Tennant, Australian Jill Barber and Brenda Heddon, a social worker from Devon. Professor Bate's biography was commissioned by Faber & Faber but is not expected to be published next year by rival HarperCollins. An employee at Faber & Faber - Hughes's former publisher - said of the poet's appetite for women: 'He was insatiable. He'd come in the office and seek women. He had tremendous sexual presence too. Carol, who is a very nice and steady person, put up with the affairs but never knew the full extent.' Revelations: The biographer is said to have discovered new details about .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Love cheat: Katherine Poxon, 22, plotted with her lover Stephen Swallow, 44, to attack her husband Steven . A cheating wife who was charged with plotting with her secret lover to have her husband killed has rekindled the romance with her intended victim. Katherine Poxon, 22, and Stephen Swallow, 44, both admitted planning to attack her husband Steven when they appeared in court today. But Mr Poxon has forgiven his wife for her affair and they are going to work out their differences. He was even sat in the public gallery at Leeds Crown Court, where she and Swallow were due to stand trial for conspiring to murder him, before they pleaded guilty to conspiring to cause him grevious bodily harm. A previous court hearing was told that the young mother had allegedly asked her lover Swallow to kill her husband after he threatened to take custody of their child if she left the marriage. The hearing was told that Poxon had allegedly sent her lover a text message to 'get the job done'. Police arrested Poxon, who has never had a job, and after questioning she was charged with soliciting murder, conspiracy to murder and perverting the course of justice. Two days earlier, on September 7, last year, Swallow’s niece Kirsty had contacted Poxon claiming she as aware she had asked her uncle to kill Mr Poxon. Richard Clewes, defending Poxon, said his client had confessed to her husband about sending the texts on September 6 and they had decided to make a go of their marriage - she had then destroyed the sim card before the police arrested her. Mr Clewes told Judge Geoffrey Marson QC: 'She told her husband about this on the Friday that she had sent the messages and they were in the process of sorting things out.' Plot: Katherine Poxon and her lover Stephen Swallow (left) admitted planning to attack her husband Steven Poxon. Mr Poxon has since forgiven his wife and the couple are back together . Even as Poxon went through the court system, her forgiving husband was posting on Facebook alongside photos of him and Poxon kissing passionately pages stating ‘you are my one in a million’ and phrases ‘This is for my baby girl LV U 2 bits bbe xxxxxxx’. Poxon wept in the dock today as she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of conspiring together with Swallow to cause grievous bodily harm between August 28 and September 9, last year. Swallow admitted the same offence. Swallow, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, was remanded in custody and Poxon was granted bail for the preparation of reports prior to sentencing on March 21. The court was told that the perverting the course of justice charges will lie on file while the remaining charges will be dealt with on the day of sentence. Couple: Mr and Mrs Poxon. The couple are now back together and living with their young child in Featherstone, West Yorkshire .","Young mother Katherine Poxon and Stephen Swallow both admitted plotting to attack her husband Steven Poxon .

"By . James Salmon . Financial advisers are routinely misleading their customers about charges more than a year after a crackdown was enforced to weed out rogue firms. Describing the failures as ‘unacceptable’, the City watchdog said more than seven in ten (73pc)  firms failed to properly explain upfront the cost of advice or how the charges work. More than three in ten (31pc) failed to explain they are not independent and can only sell certain types of investments from a limited number of product providers. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, described the findings as a 'wake up call' for advisers . And more than a third (34pc) did not provide clients with a clear explanation of the service they offer in return for charging ongoing fees or their right to cancel at any time. The failings come more than a year after the City watchdog banned commission payments to advisers to prevent future mis-selling scandals. Last night campaigners said savers ‘do not know where to turn’ for decent financial advice, while the Financial Conduct Authority described the findings as a ‘wake up call’ for advisers. The regulator also said it is likely to refer two unnamed firms which it described as guilty of ‘egregious failings’ to its Enforcement and Financial Crime Division. One is a financial adviser and another is a wealth manager. The FCA added that the failings were worse at private banks and wealth managers which tend to specialise in wealthier investors. The damning verdict comes as demand for financial advice is set to soar, as millions of savers seek to make sense of the government’s radical overhaul of pensions announced in the Budget last month. Consumer campaigner and founder of Fairer Finance James Daley said: ‘This is incredibly disappointing as trust in financial services is already at an all-time low. Customers, which already can’t trust the banks, have nowhere to turn. There was a hope that the reforms to the adviser market would start turning things around. It would seem it hasn’t worked.’ In total 113 financial advisers across the country were reviewed by the watchdog as part of its investigation. Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA described the results as a ‘wake up call’ to the industry and said he was ‘disappointed’ with the results. Demand for financial advice is set to soar, as millions try to make sense of the Budget's overhaul of pensions, left. However, Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA, said he was 'disappointed' in the industry . Tougher rules, including a ban on commission,  were introduced for financial advisers in January last year to protect savers and investors from rogue salesmen. The crackdown applied to independent financial advisers as well as investment salesmen working in  High Street banks. It followed a spate of mis-selling scandals spanning decades, including personal pensions, payment protection insurance, mortgage endowments and investment bonds. In many cases, these products were hugely lucrative to financial advisers as they received handsome commission payments from insurance companies and fund managers to sell them. Huge costs for the advice was often hidden from savers and docked from their pensions and investments. Under the tougher rules, dubbed the Retail Distribution Review, advisers have to charge fees which must be spelled out clearly at the outset. Firms typically take a 1pc cut of a customers’ investment, but many charge an hourly rate of £150 or more for providing advice. The fees can range between hundreds to thousands of pounds, depending on the size of the investment and the type of financial adviser. Those  who want to continue calling themselves independent also have to scour the market for the best products, rather than only sell products from the insurance company which pays them the most commission. They also need to need tougher qualifications. The major High Street banks have pulled out of providing financial advice for all but the wealthiest customers since the crackdown was introduced.","The FCA said 73% if firms do not properly explain upfront cost of advice .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia's richest woman, discovered her close friend and minder Jerry Rouwhorst unconscious at the Dorchester Hotel on March 16 . The heiress to an £11billion mining fortune has been left devastated by the death of her Australian bodyguard after a suspected suicide attempt in her suite at the Dorchester hotel. Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia's richest woman, discovered her close friend and minder Jerry Rouwhorst unconscious in her room after returning from a night out in London on March 16. The 27-year-old, who will inherit the billions amassed by her mining magnate family, raised the alarm finding the 35-year-old collapsed on the floor. Police officers and paramedics were called to the suite at the five-star hotel, which is often used by wealthy businessmen and rich celebrities and where rooms can cost up to £4,000 a night. Mr Rouwhorst was taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington but died three days later after his family flew to London and his life support machine was switched off. Scotland Yard said today his death was being treated as ‘non-suspicious’. A spokesman said: ‘Police were called by London Ambulance Service on Sunday 16 March to the Dorchester Hotel to reports of an injured male. ‘Police and London Ambulance Service attended and the man was taken to hospital. ‘Police have since been notified that he died on the 19 March. ‘The death is being treated as non-suspicious.’ Mr Rouwhorst was an ex-special forces solider who received a bravery award just two days prior to his death for saving a man’s life during an Asian riot in 2007. It is understood he had pulled a man away from danger in East Timor and got him to hospital despite being attacked by a mob himself. He was said to be a close friend of Miss Rinehart and her well-known family in Australia, who are said to be shocked by the news. Police officers and paramedics attended the suite at the Dorchester Hotel, pictured, which is often used by wealthy businessmen and rich celebrities, on March 16 following reports of an 'injured male' Although it is believed he died in a suspected suicide bid, it is not clear if it was intentional. A spokesman for Miss Rinehart told The Sydney Morning Herald: ‘Jerry was a good person and a great Australian, proven by his bravery during his service. ‘He also has a family who are dealing with his sad loss, so we'd ask that privacy, decency and consideration be shown to them.’ A death notice in Tasmania's The Advocate newspaper last week said: ‘Jerry flashed like a meteor across the sky ... and burnt out too soon.’ No suicide note was found at the scene prior to Mr Rouwhorst’s death and the circumstances surrounding his death are unclear. Friends are said to have described him as ‘a perfectly normal healthy guy’, with one friend telling The Sun: ‘Ginia loved him to bits. She is totally devastated about what happened.’ An inquest into Mr Rouwhorst's death was opened on Wednesday but was adjourned to June 12 at Westminster Coroner's Court. It is understood bodyguard Jerry Rouwhorst was found unconscious by heiress Ginia Rinehart in a suite at the Dorchester Hotel, pictured, on March 16 . Ginia Rinehart is the daughter of Gina, pictured, who inherited an estimated £11billion fortune from her father - mining magnate Lang Hancock . It is understood the Tasmanian-born bodyguard’s family have arranged for his body to be returned to his birth country for a private funeral service. Miss Rinehart, who is the youngest of mining magnate Gina Rinehart's four children and the one to side with her mother throughout the family's bitter legal feud, has since reunited with her family in Paris. MailOnline has contacted Dorchester Hotel representatives for a comment. Ginia Rinehart has now reunited with her mother Gina, left, in Paris after discovering her 'close friend' and personal bodyguard Jerry Rouwhorst unconscious at London's five-star Dorchester Hotel, right . Georgina Hope 'Gina' Rinehart, 60, is an Australian mining heiress who inherited her estimated £11billion fortune from her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock . The Rinehart family – one of the richest families in the world - have captured the public’s attention in Australia with an on-going inner legal dispute which has seen the private lives of each of them rolled out into the public eye. Georgina Hope ‘Gina’ Rinehart, 60, is an Australian mining heiress who inherited the empire left from her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock. Mr Hancock – a household name in Australia – is credited with discovering the world's largest deposit of iron ore in Pilbara, Western Australia. In 1988, Mr Hancock established the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust, nominating daughter Gina as a trustee, with his four grandchildren named as beneficiaries. Since her father’s passing in 1992, Gina has been named Australia’s richest woman several times in a number of billionaire rich lists. After taking over the chairmanship of the family’s flagship company, she has multiplied her fortune – including by acquiring and developing new mining tenements and developing thermal coal projects as well as a host of other projects. During 2011, both Forbes Asia and Business Review Weekly reported that Gina – dubbed the ‘Iron Lady’ - was Australia's wealthiest person and in 2013 she was revealed as the fourth richest woman in the whole world. However, fortune has brought tribulations to the Rinehart family who have found themselves at the centre of a family legal battle. Two of Gina's children are seeking to remove her as the sole trustee of the pool that holds an almost one-quarter share in Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd, one of the world's largest privately-owned mining companies. Details about the family feud have spilled out into the media over the last couple of years, with email correspondence between the rifting children emerging from court hearings. Ms Rinehart had previously tried unsuccessfully to have the court hearings held behind closed doors. However, she lost a court bid to throw out the lawsuit and it was reported she announced she wanted to step down as trustee during a hearing in October 2013. Justice Paul Brereton of the New South Wales Supreme Court ruled that the case should go to a full trial at a date yet to be determined.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Newly declassified documents reveal how the CIA tried to start revolution in the USSR by printing and distributing the novel Doctor Zhivago. When the CIA first reviewed Boris Pasternak's manuscript in 1957, they realized its high-propaganda potential and printed it in secret to be passed out to Soviets at international meet-ups in Europe. The plan was considered a success as Soviets smuggled the banned book back to their home country and it was illicitly passed from person to person. The CIA distributed hundreds of copies of Boris Pasternak's novel Doctor Zhivago to subvert the Soviets in the midst of the Cold War. Above, miniature versions of the novel that were printed by the CIA to be distributed at a 1959 youth conference . Authors Peter Finn and Petra Couvee obtained the more than 100 CIA memos for their new book about the novel's role in the Cold War. 'The Zhivago Affair: The Kremlin, The CIA and the Battle Over a Forbidden Book' is due out this June. Finn and Couvee previewed their book in the Washington Post, writing about how the CIA first obtained Pasternak's manuscript from British Intelligence in 1958. The agents immediately recognized the books potential as propaganda 'not only for its intrinsic message and thought-provoking nature, but also for the circumstances of its publication'. 'We have the opportunity to make Soviet citizens wonder what is wrong with their government, when a fine literary work by the man acknowledged to be the greatest living Russian writer is not even available in his own country in his own language for his own people to read,' the memo said. The novel follows the life of Yuri Zhivago, a physician and poet, as he falls in love with two women throughout decades of revolution, war and Communist oppression in Russia. Revelations: Peter Finn and Petra Couvee reveal . how the U.S. tried to inspire revolution in the USSR with Boris Pasternak's (left) book in 'The Zhivago Affair' (right) due out in June . For many reasons, including the fact that the main character did not subscribe to official Marxist ideology, Pasternak was considered a traitor and Soviet Union publishers refused to print the book. However, an Italian literary scout was impressed with the book and it was first printed by a publisher there, in Italian, in 1957. But what made the book unpublishable in Pasternak's native country is what made it so alluring to Americans seeking to undermine the Communist regime. 'Pasternak's humanistic message - that every person is entitled to a private life and deserves respect as a human being, irrespective of the extent of his political loyalty or contribution to the state - poses a fundamental challenge to the Soviet ethic of sacrifice of the individual to the Communist system,' John Maury, chief of the agency's Soviet Russia Division, said in a memo, according to the Post. The CIA decided to print the book in secret through a foreign publisher to be distributed by agents around Europe - with an emphasis on the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, Belgium where 16,000 Soviets citizens were due to attend. Of course the copies of the book couldn't be handed out at the United State's pavilion, so instead they enlisted the help of the Vatican . It was at the City of God's pavilion that 200 copies were handed out in a small library behind a 'somewhat hidden' curtain. Banned: The U.S. had 200 copies of the novel passed out to visiting Soviets at the Vatican's pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair. Above, a picture from the 1958 exhibition . Cold War run-in: The U.S. and USSR had their own pavilions at the World's Fair that advertised their competing ways of life. Above, a woman waves a Soviet flag at the exhibition . 'Soon the book’s blue linen covers were littering the fairgrounds. Some who got the novel were ripping off the cover, dividing the pages, and stuffing them in their pockets to make the book easier to hide,' the authors wrote. Adaptation: The novel was turned into a movie in 1965 starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif, and went on to earn five Academy awards . The books dispersal at the World's Fair was so successful that word got back to Pasternak himself in the USSR that people were reading Doctor Zhivago in the original Russian. But the plan did have one draw back. Despite the instruction that America's hand 'not be shown in any manner', the CIA messed up in printing the book by violating the Italian publisher's rights. The publishing house objected, and attention was drawn to the fact that so many books were being printed. An anonymous columnist for the National Review Bulletin was sharp enough to pinpoint the blame on the CIA. 'That quaint workshop of amateur subversion, the Central Intelligence Agency, may be exorbitantly expensive but from time to time it produces some noteworthy goodies,' columnist 'Quincy' wrote. But overall, the CIA found the operation a success and decided to pull it off again at a Vienna youth conference the following year. This time they printed the book at their own press back in the States, making an inauspicious pocket-sized version. When bus-loads of Soviet youth arrived at the conference in 1959, Russian emigres stormed their vehicles and threw the books threw open windows. The passengers under KGB surveillance didn't know what to do with so many  copies of the book readily available. Surprisingly, the KGB officers at the conference were lenient. Hit: Doctor Zhivago was nominated for Best Picture and remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time . 'Take it, read it, but by no means bring it home,' the agents advised. Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1958, but was not allowed to travel to Sweden to claim the award. He spent the rest of his life in USSR and died at the age of 70 in 1960. The 1965 film adaptation of the novel starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif went on to win five Academy Awards, a nomination for best picture and remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time.","The CIA realized the book could be used as a tool to get Soviet citizens questioning their Communist government .

"By . Jim Norton . Revisted: Comedian Tony Hancock was the main character in the 1950s sitcom. Lost episodes will be played in November to mark the 60th anniversary . It has long been revered as one of the most important British radio comedies of all time, yet the BBC still managed to mislay several episodes. However now there is good news for fans of Hancock’s Half Hour, who will once again be able to listen to the travails of the struggling comedian and actor. This November the BBC is to broadcast lost episodes of the classic 1950s sitcom on Radio 4, to mark the 60th anniversary of the show’s first transmission. The Missing Hancocks will feature a new cast re-recording material from the original scripts, with Pirates of the Caribbean actor Kevin McNally playing the lead role as Tony Hancock. Mr McNally, 57, has also played various parts in Doctor Who, Downton Abbey and Midsomer Murders. Hancock’s Half Hour, which was originally broadcast on the BBC Home Service between 1954 and 1959, centered on a fictionalised version of Tony Hancock’s life. He was joined by his dim Australian lodger, played by Bill Kerr, and dodgy businessman Sid, played by Sid James. In all, 103 episodes were recorded and a TV version followed in 1956 which ran for five years and more than 60 episodes. The programme was the first hit for writing partners Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who went on to create Steptoe and Son. They have chosen five out of the 20 missing episodes that will begin recording this evening at the BBC Radio Theatre in central London. Star: Kevin McNally will play the lead character and will join a cast reading scripts from older episodes . The cast will also feature Simon Greenall, Kevin Eldon and Robin Sebastian. The idea came about when series co-producer Neil Pearson, who was researching original Tony Hancock scripts for a rare book catalogue, found out many episodes had disappeared from the BBC archive. He told the Guardian: ‘We will be re-creating as closely as possible the experience you would have had listening to your radio all those years ago. The scripts are perfect and timeless. ‘We will be recording the programmes in front of a live audience at BBC Radio Theatre and, rather thrillingly, the BBC Concert Orchestra will be re-recording the theme tune for the new series.’","Unreleased episodes of 1950s sitcom will be aired again in November .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Associated Press . Back in the gym: Gabby Douglas, 18, is going back to training for the next Olympic games after briefly pursuing an entertainment career (pictured in January) Olympic gold medalist Gabby Douglas is reuniting with the coach who helped her win gold in 2012. Gymnastics coach Liang Chow said on Sunday that the 2012 Olympic all-around gymnastics champion will return to train at his gym in West Des Moines, Iowa. Douglas left Chow last August to live in Los Angeles, raising questions about her ability to return to the Olympics in 2016 because she would miss training time. Chow says he is excited to work with Douglas again, but she faces a number of hurdles before returning to competition. 'We are welcoming Gabby to come back in our gym,' Chow responded to The Des Moines Register via text message. 'We . are all excited to see her next week. It is hard for me to make any . detailed training plan at this point since I have not seen her for a . long time.' When she moved . to Los Angeles last fall, she said that she would continue to train and . search for a coach out there while she was also pursuing other . opportunities. She was a judge on the reality show 'So You Think You Can Dance' and gave a number of interviews to celebrity outlets.

Close: Gabby moved to Iowa to train with Chow (seen together in London) when she was only 14 after hearing about his work with Olympic gold medalist Shaun Johnson . Douglas became a household- and historic- name during the 2012 games, as she is the first African American gymnast to win the individual all-around competition and the first american to win multiple golds. That dream was almost cut short because of the trouble she had being away from her family, as she almost left Iowa six months before the London games because she was homesick.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Concerns: Evidence casts doubt on testimony that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death . The Innocence Project says the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has denied its petition to posthumously pardon a Texas man executed for killing his three children in a house fire. A letter from the parole board released last week says the agency has denied a pardon for Cameron Todd Willingham, whose case has been cited by wrongful-conviction advocates who argue Texas' death-penalty system is severely flawed. Willingham was put to death in 2004 for the deaths of his three daughters in a house fire in Corsicana. Fire investigation experts say the science used to convict Willingham was faulty. The New York-based Innocence Project, which has argued Willingham's case after his death, says the parole board's decision 'illustrates that the clemency system is completely broken in Texas.' Willingham was sentenced to death in 1992 after being convicted of murder based on arson analysis that was later discredited, and testimony from a jailhouse informant. However, a note found in the case files suggested that the prosecutor may have concealed a deal with the informant, Johnny Webb, who claimed Willingham had confessed to him. Before Willingham was executed in 2004, a prosecutor argued that Webb's testimony was enough to prove his guilt, after the arson analysis was found to be substandard. Last month, however, lawyers seeking a posthumous pardon for Willingham claimed the inmate who provided testimony did so to gain a reduced sentence, the New York Times reported. Widespread support: The annual 'March to Abolish the Death Penalty' at the State Capitol in Austin in 2009 used Willingham's likeness . Belief in innocence: Attorney Gerald Goldstein (right) speaks to reporters after announcing the filing of a petition for posthumous pardon for Cameron Todd Willingham, in Austin, Texas, on October 24, 2012 . If that had proven to be the case in the lead up to Willingham's execution, it could have been enough to clear him of guilt. 'It's astonishing that 10 years after Todd Willingham was executed we are still uncovering evidence showing what a grave injustice this case represents,' Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project, which is working on the case, said. Willingham's case has been scrutinized by advocates who argue the state may have executed a wrongfully convicted man. Fire science experts already have refuted much of the methodology used in his case. Webb and the trial prosecutor, John Jackson, have both denied any deal existed during Webb's testimony. Doubt: New evidence suggests Willingham, pictured here with one of his daughters, may have been wrongfully convicted . Crime scene: Willingham was accused of killing his three children in a fire at this house in 1991 . Lawyers from New York-based Innocence Project filed an official request to have Willingham exonerated because of the discredited arson analysis and efforts to cut Webb's sentence. In November, one of the project's lawyers, Bryce Benjet, was going through files when he found a box of photocopies, which included a handwritten note on the inside of the district attorney's folder. The note, which is not dated or signed, allegedly stated that Webb's charges were to be listed as a lighter robbery charge 'based on coop in Willingham'. Mr Benjet described the discovery to the New York Times as a 'rush of excitement', adding: 'This is what we've been looking for.' Mr Scheck . said the case has suggested a weakness in the . justice system. If Webbâ€™s testimony 'was really based on a deal and . misrepresentation, then the system cannot be regulated ... you cannot prevent the execution of an innocent . person [in those circumstances].' Justice: Willingham's cousin, Judy Cavnar, holds up a photo of him playing with one of his children at a press conference in 2006 . Jackson, the prosecutor who later became a state . district judge, has maintained that Webb did not receive leniency. He . told the Associated Press on Friday that he had not seen the note, but . believed it was likely referring to efforts he made to get Webb out of . prison after Willingham's trial due to threats to Webb's safety. 'The . file may certainly reflect that we tried to get sentencing shortened, . but it had nothing to do with any agreement relative to the Willingham . trial,' Jackson said. He said imprisoned members of the Aryan Brotherhood had threatened Webb due to his role in Willingham's conviction. 'We certainly had an interest in not seeing a primary witness in the case killed while he was in prison,' he said. Willingham's family said if he was pardoned they would not press for damages. His cousin, Patricia Cox, added: 'We're not asking for compensation, we're asking for justice.'","Cameron .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . First The Great British Bake Off spawned a cult ‘bingo’ game for soggy bottom lovers. Now the BBC is hoping to replicate the show’s success with a version for amateur gardeners - and has filled it with even more naughty innuendo than its predecessor. Starting next week, The Big Allotment Challenge will see nine pairs of green fingered contestants compete for the title of best grower by producing vegetables, fruits and flowers for a panel of experts. The BBC show will be hosted by Fern Britton, left, and judged Jim Buttress, Thane Prince and Jonathan Moseley . In the place of Bake Off’s Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, the new show will be judged by the Queen’s former gardener Jim Buttress, jam expert Thane Prince and floral designer Jonathan Moseley. Hosted by Fern Britton, it was filmed over six months last year and will follow the same format as the hit cookery show, where contestants are set a different challenge each week and attempt to avoid elimination. Mr Buttress supposedly provides much of the show's risque humour . But producers are hoping viewers will also appreciate its irreverent puns, following Bake Off’s lead. Bake Off spawned an internet craze in which viewers flocked to social networking sites to share the best catchphrases, including ‘soggy bottom’, ‘raise your game’ and ‘it’s got a good wobble.’ Many of the vegetable double entendres in the Allotment Challenge are even more risqué. In the first episode, viewers will hear Mr Buttress, 69, discuss the merits of some ‘good, erect stems’, a comment that produces muffled laughter from his fellow judges. Later in the show, Miss Prince advises a contestant on the correct pan to use for jam making, saying with a knowing look that it depends on ‘the thickness of your bottom’. Speaking before the show’s launch, Mr Buttress - who was superintendent of the Royal Parks for 25 years - admitted he deliberately inserted naughty puns into the show to liven it up. He said: ‘At the end of the day you’ve got to enjoy it. It’s got to be fun. That’s my motto in life. ‘And I’ve always been a great believer in just twisting it a little bit, because nobody gets hurt. It takes it away from being boring.’ The show’s executive producer Daisy Goodwin promised it will get even ruder as the series progresses. She said ‘You’ll enjoy episode six. Thane does utter the words “I’ve got wood in my mouth”’. She added: ‘Melons week was excellent. People got the giggles.’ Former This Morning presenter Miss Britton, 56, said it was a ‘tradition’ to slip rude jokes into otherwise innocent TV shows. The new show hopes to ride the same wave of enthusiasm that has made the Great British Bake Off, judged by Paul Hollywood, left, and Mary Berry, right, such a success . She added: ‘Jonathan (Moseley) was very naughty. His eyebrows were shooting up at some stages.’ It is Mr Buttress who is set to carve a role for himself as the gardening equivalent of Mary Berry on the show. He has been tending to flowers and plants since he was a ‘nipper’ and in a separate interview with the Radio Times, he opened up about his time as the Royal gardener. He said: ‘I was in charge of Hyde Park, St James’ Park, Kensington Gardens, Buckingham Palace and Clarence House. All the Queen Mum wanted was flowers, flowers, flowers. But when Charlie took over at Clarence, large areas were turned into an allotment because he’s a vegetable nut. He used to come and ask advice. Her Majesty took after her mother: more colour than veg.’ Asked if he was a prickly judge, he replied: ‘Someone said I was a cross between Ray Winstone and Paul Hollywood! I am just myself and I try to give lots of advice. I hope this is going to inspire people. No disrespect to makeover programmes but one minute it looks like a jungle and the next you could be at Chelsea Flower Show. That’s not gardening. Gardening is all: “Oh no, the greenfly’s got the roses,” or “Jack Frost’s destroyed the beans”. A lot of that happened and there were tears.’ The Big Allotment Challenge was filmed in a walled garden within the grounds of Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire last year. It will screen on Tuesday, April 15, on BBC2 at 8pm.","The Big Allotment Challenge sees nine pairs of contestants compete for the title of best grower .

"A multi-million pound project to replace street lights with LED lamps has left residents in a London borough feeling like they're 'living on a football pitch'. Hounslow Council started installing the ultra-bright lights to improve the area's roads last year. But homeowners in Park Road, Chiswick, and the surrounding areas have complained their evenings are ruined by the dazzling light pouring through their windows. They say the lamps are causing them sleepless nights, and have now resorted to methods used during the Blitz to keep the light out. A multi-million pound project to replace street lights with LED lamps has left residents feeling like they're 'living on a football pitch' The lights are more cost effective and burn less electricity, and give a more directional light, meaning less light pollution. But Kristina Fearnley said she has to 'seal up her Venetian blinds with ducktape daily' to dim the light out. She told BBC: 'The light that comes through side of the blinds is like a great big spot light beaming into your face as you try to relax with your family in the evenings. And AndyRichards added: 'We've had to resort to this black cardboard that we bought so it masks the window - a bit like Wolrd War Two.' When they were installed, residents also complained that the LED lights are not in keeping with the character of their roads, which is in a conservation area. Cllr Colin Ellar, deputy leader of Hounslow Council said: 'It is true that a small number of residents have told us that our new street lights are too bright and that their sleep has been disturbed, which is something I can fully sympathise with. They say the lamps are causing them sleepless nights, and have now resorted to methods used during the Blitz to keep the light out . Homeowners in Park Road, Chiswick, and the surrounding areas have complained their evenings are ruined by the dazzling light pouring through their windows . 'Many residents have also said how happy they are with the new standard of lighting in their street. 'It is possible to dim the new lights and we will be carrying out a trial soon. 'The new lights do, however, help save energy, save council taxpayersâ€™ money and have been recognised by the police as helping the fight against crime because of the better quality light.' The lights are part of a 25-year borough-wide Â£800â€‰million renovation being carried out by private contractor Hounslow Highways. The first lights were installed in 2013, as part of a two year scheme to replace all street lights with LED lamps. At the time, Hounslow Highways said the brightness will be adjusted and centrally controlled.","Hounslow Council installed the ultra-bright lights to improve area's roads .

"By . Sam Webb . Demonstrators opposed to fracking at a site in the north of England have been mocked after begging for gas for their camp on Twitter. Online observers quickly pointed out the irony of protestors at Barton Moss near Salford, Greater Manchester, asking for the supplies while opposing fracking for gas. Scores of anti-fracking protesters descended on the site last November, erecting a large camp of around 60 tents and caravans along a farm track after  energy firm IGas announced it was carrying out exploratory drilling for shale gas. Irony bypass: Anti-fracking protestors at Barton Moss were mocked by Twitter users after begging for gas supplies . A protester makes sure there is enough wood on a fire on the protest site close to Barton Moss . Opponents of fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, are concerned about the potential environmental effects of the process, which involves the fracturing of rock by a pressurised liquid to release oil and gases. The camp’s gas supply ran out Sunday morning and they tweeted from their account @BartonMoss: '#bartonmoss URGENTLY needs water and gas for the cooker if anyone can help'. The tweet triggered a series of flabbergasted responses. Twitter user NottsCo_David quipped: 'Why don't you frack for some gas?, while Foxgoose tweeted: 'Can't they burn their own dung? - that'll give them a nice foretaste of the life they want for the rest of us.' Insider OnEnergy tweeted: 'Ironic really isn't it?!', and: 'Why can we not live what we preach and use a sustainable source?' Mark McAndrew added: 'Oddly enough, rest of UK needs gas as well...' Anti-fracking campaigners and druids Lardon and Guinevere sit outside their donated caravan near the IGas Barton Moss exploration facility in February . Twitter user Mark McAndrew was withering about the plea, tweeting: 'Oddly enough, rest of UK needs gas as well...' IGas was granted permission for exploratory gas drilling at the site and said it is seeking methane and shale gas but has no immediate plans for fracking. In the past four months more than 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with a variety of offences including obstruction and drink-driving. The protest is estimated to have cost £750,000 so far with Greater Manchester Police having to prioritise more and more officers to the site. An unnamed anti-fracking protester signals to supporters after being cut free from a 'lock-on' near the Barton Moss exploration facility in March . Protesters at the Barton Moss site, which lies in the shadow of the M62, have accused the police officers of violence and bully-boy tactics. But police accused protesters themselves of resorting to dirty tactics after a police officer was injured by a ‘booby-trap’ drum containing barbed wire and glass. He suffered a cut to his hand last month as he attempted to free two anti-fracking protesters who locked themselves to the concrete drum.","Environmental protestors at Barton Moss needed fuel for cooking .

"By . Mark Duell . Kelly Burgess, 26, exchanged more than 12,000 texts with the 16-year-old boy in just seven months . A drama teacher who had a fling with a pupil had sex with him at a hotel paid for by their school as part of a training weekend, a court heard. Infatuated Kelly Burgess, 26, exchanged more than 12,000 texts with the 16-year-old boy in just seven months, including ‘explicit’ naked pictures. Their relationship was only uncovered when the pupil visited a  sexual health clinic and let slip who his lover was. Yesterday Burgess sobbed hysterically as she was sentenced to  ten months in prison, suspended for two years. She had previously admitted four charges of abuse of trust – sexual activity with a boy aged 13 to 17. Her barrister Raymond Tully insisted: ‘She is not a vamp or cougar, far from it. ‘She is just a young woman somewhat immature, somewhat mixed up who fell in love with the wrong young man.’ But Judge Euan Ambrose, sitting at Bristol Crown Court, declared: ‘You make it clear that you were both participating in what you thought was a relationship of equals, but it was quite clearly not a relationship of equals – you were at all times a teacher and he was a pupil.’ Suspending her sentence, he told Burgess that losing her teaching career was ‘the greatest punishment in many ways’. The court heard the pair met during a school production in December 2012 and started their relationship in January 2013 – shortly before the trip to a hotel in Warwickshire. They also went on a camping trip to Devon together in July. Scroll down for video . Hearing: Drama teacher Burgess arrives under an umbrella at Bristol Crown Court for her sentencing today .

"By . James Chapman . Maria Miller’s key justification for her expenses claims was directly challenged by a former aide last night as Tory MPs warned David Cameron the affair had turned ‘completely toxic’. Phil Heath, who campaigned for the Culture Secretary for years, said the Hampshire property she told parliamentary authorities was her main residence was ‘definitely her second home’. The former deputy mayor of Basingstoke and Conservative councillor, who now represents UKIP, told BBC South Today: ‘She would come back once every couple of weeks on a Friday to do a surgery then she’d be sheepishly back up to London – her family were there, her children were there. Challenge: Phil Heath (left), who campaigned for Culture Secretary Maria Miller (right) for years, said the Hampshire property she told government authorities was her main residence was 'definitely her second home' ‘Her house in Basingstoke – whenever we had a meeting there, there was no family there.’ His account contradicts Mrs Miller’s claims to the Commons authorities that the property in Wimbledon was her ‘second home’ from 2005 to 2009. This allowed her to claim more than £90,000 in parliamentary expenses for mortgage interest and bills. She sold the Wimbledon house for £1.47million in February and has moved into a £1.2million country pile in Hampshire. Mr Heath’s account was challenged by Mrs Miller’s allies, who said he had been thrown out of the party over allegations of bullying and had an ‘axe to grind’. Claims: He said Mrs Miller would return to the house in Basingstoke (above) 'once every couple of weeks' Formal apology: Mrs Miller was ordered to repay £5,800 and apologise to the Commons (pictured) last week. The independent parliamentary standards commissioner concluded Mrs Miller should properly have identified as her main dwelling the London house on which she claimed second-home expenses. However, the issue was ‘finely balanced’ because of her evidence that she spent significant amounts of time in a rented property in Hampshire. Mr Heath’s intervention came as Tory MPs expressed increasing concern about the fallout from the row over Mrs Miller, who was ordered to repay £5,800 and apologise to the Commons last week. The Prime Minister will be confronted over his strong support for his minister in a meeting of MPs tomorrow. Contradictory: Mr Heath's account contradicts Mrs Miller's claims to the Commons authorities that the property in Wimbledon (pictured) was her 'second home' from 2005 to 2009. She sold the Wimbledon house in February . Employment minister Esther McVey criticised Mrs Miller’s 30-second statement in the Commons, telling ITV’s The Agenda: ‘It wouldn’t be how I would have made an apology. But different people have different styles. What we’ve got to do is make sure the public believe in their representatives.’ A senior MP said the affair was ‘completely toxic’ and that Downing Street should either have insisted Mrs Miller issued a proper apology  or asked her to resign. Concern: Tory MPs have warned David Cameron the affair has turned 'completely toxic' A poll has found that 74 per cent of voters believe Mr Cameron should have sacked Mrs Miller last week. Worryingly for Mr Cameron, 69 per cent of his own supporters thought he should have acted. The findings by ComRes – commissioned by Conservative Grassroots, will be sent today to Mr Cameron and party chairman Grant Shapps. Robert Woollard, who chairs the group of voluntary party members, said: ‘Mr Cameron’s support of the Culture Secretary is completely irrational. She has clearly broken the rules and according to media reports she and her allies have allegedly tried to bully and intimidate both the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards and journalists who investigated her behaviour.’ Dominic Grieve, the Government’s top legal adviser, pointedly refused to defend Mrs Miller, saying she had to ‘answer to her constituents’. She was cleared last week by of seeking to cheat the taxpayer to fund accommodation for her parents, who lived with her, but was found to have overclaimed significant sums through an admin error. Her spokesman said she accepts she faces a capital gains tax bill on her £1.2million profit from the sale of the house. A source close to Mrs Miller dismissed Mr Heath’s claims, adding: ‘The committee and the commissioner both said the issue of what was her main home was finely balanced and she did the honest and right thing.’ An online petition calling for Mrs Miller to repay £45,000 or resign had 100,000 signatures last night. Downing Street scrambled to shift its position yesterday on changes to the way MPs police their own affairs. Number Ten had insisted that David Cameron was happy with the existing system – which sees a committee of MPs and three lay members rule on alleged breaches of the Commons code of conduct. But yesterday, after Labour backed reform of the Standards Committee, Mr Cameron insisted he was ‘very open’ to amending the system. Despite warnings from senior Tories that independent regulation raised constitutional problems, the Prime Minister said the current rules, where MPs can ‘mark their own homework’, may not be working. ‘If there are further changes that people think are appropriate, I’m very open to suggestions,’ he said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Geoffrey Cox, a Tory member of the committee, raised concerns about external regulation, asking: ‘Who is to do it, and to whom is that person or regulator to be accountable?’","Phil Heath has insisted Maria Miller misled MPs over house in Hampshire .

"By . Lillian Radulova . An Australian athlete suffered head injuries after a a drone which had been filming the race plummeted to the ground. Raija Ogden was only metres from the finish line in the Endure Batavia Triathlon in Geraldton, Western Australia, on Sunday, when the incident happened. She claims the drone hit her on the head and that an ambulance crew later found a piece of propeller embedded in her skull. She was taken to hospital where she needed three stitches. The drone owner and operator Warren Abrams said Mrs Ogden was hurt when she fell over after being startled by the piece of equipment as it fell. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is investigating. Hit by drone? Paramedics treat Raija Ogden after the crash at the Endure Batavia Triathlon in Geraldton, Western Australia . 'My hair was completely red with blood.' Mrs Ogden told The Western Australian. 'I didn't hit the ground. I sat down because I just thought I was going to pass out.' She vehemently denied that the injuries were caused when she fell over. Warren Abrams, the pilot and drone owner from New Era Photography and Film, admitted that he had lost control of the drone before it fell 10 metres to the ground. However, he claimed that this was because it had been hacked and that he had also lost control in an earlier test flight when someone 'channel hopped' and took it over. Mr Abrams believes any of the spectators or competitors could have easily used a smartphone to hack into the drones operating system. He also claimed that footage from the flying camera would show that the device missed Ms Ogden and fell just behind her. A number of witnesses have expressed varying views, supporting both versions of the event. Accident: Mrs Ogden (right, pictured with her husband Courtney) was just metres  away from the finish line when the drone crashed . Taken to hospital: Mrs Ogden needed three stitches and said that the ambulance crew had removed a piece of propeller from her head . CASA is looking into the incident concerning the regulations for operating the drones, which dictate the minimum distance that unmanned aircraft must be flown is 30 metres away from people at all times. The regulations relating to commercial unmanned aircraft clearly state that they 'require UAV controllerâ€™s certification and an operatorâ€™s certificate to fly.' Allegations have also been raised over whether Mr Abrams or his company are certified to fly the cinematographic drones, with neither seeming to appear on the list of 92 nationally certified operators. Drones, or unmanned aircraft , are best known for their military uses. However, In recent years the technology is being utilised by photography groups, agricultural industries, advertising companies and in some cases for surveying purposes, according to CASA's list of operator certificate holders. Hobbyists are also able to access devices, with affordable consumer options available on the market.

"By . Associated Press . Tragic: Tameria Greene, pictured, was stabbed to death in January 2013. Her mother has now been jailed for her murder . A Detroit woman was sentenced Monday to at least 23 years in prison for fatally stabbing her 8-year-old daughter whom a court had refused to remove from the home despite allegations of abuse. The system failed Tameria Greene, Wayne County Judge Margaret Van Houten said as she sentenced Semeria Greene under a plea deal between prosecutors and defense lawyers. Greene, 27, apologized for killing her daughter, telling the judge in a soft voice that her death was an accident. Assistant Prosecutor Carin Goldfarb, however, said Greene had choices and made the wrong one. 'This is just further evidence of Ms. Greene's manipulation. ... Tameria was 8 years old. She was a . chronically abused child,' Goldfarb said. The . Michigan Department of Human Services tried to immediately remove . Tameria and four siblings from the home in November 2012. But Family . Court Referee Richard Smart declined, suggesting instead that their . mother should move out in the short term or place the children . elsewhere. The detailed . petition presented to Smart said Tameria had been bitten by her mother . on her hand, forearm and face. The agency said there were multiple marks . and bruises elsewhere . Drawn-out: The trial of Semeria Greene took more than a year after multiple delays because of her mental health . The state didn't appeal Smart's decision, and more court hearings were planned. Tameria was killed five weeks later. Greene . pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder. She'll be eligible for . parole after 23 years in prison; her maximum stay is 50 years. Failings: Michigan Child Protective Services attempted to remove Tameria, pictured, from her mother's care for two years but a court ruled against it . Gone: The little girl, pictured left with her mother Semeria, right, was found in a pool of blood with stab wounds, bruises and bite marks . The . case has lasted more than a year, mostly because of delays related to . Greene's mental health. The judge noted that experts found depression . but not bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. 'Mental illness does not cause child abuse or child murder,' Goldfarb told Van Houten. Defense . attorney Cornelius Pitts didn't refer to specific mental conditions but . said Greene was ""born with a deficit that cannot be overcome. 'Ms. Greene is the victim of the system,' he said.","Semeria Greene, 26, was charged in January 2013 in the death of her daughter Tameria .
