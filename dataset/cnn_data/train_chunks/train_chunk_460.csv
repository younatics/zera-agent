"Geoff Counsell  was targeted over the pile-up in Taunton that killed seven people and injured 51 others . By . Stephanie Darrall . Last updated at 12:49 PM on 27th November 2011 . The organiser of a fireworks display under investigation after a horrendous crash on the M5 has been forced out of his home after a hate campaign. Geoff Counsell, from Firestorm Pyrotechnics was targeted after the bonfire night celebration became the centre of a police investigation into the pile-up that killed seven people and injured 51 others. Claims that thick smoke from the display held in Taunton, Somerset earlier this month drifted across the motorway before the accident and limiting drivers' vision are being looked into by police. Hate campaign: Geoff Counsell was targeted after his bonfire night celebration became the centre of a police investigation into the pile-up that killed seven people and injured 51 others . Over 200 witnesses of the pile up at Junction 25, in Taunton have been interviewed in an attempt to establish the cause of the collision. According to the Sunday Times many have given differing statements. The newspaper reported that a reliable witness explained that the fog was so dense just before the crash, that he could not see the pavement on the other side of the road. Mr Counsell has said he had carried out a full safety review before the display. He said: 'I can guarantee I would not have fired the display if it was the slightest bit unsafe. There was no more smoke than usual.' He did admit, however, the fog was so thick that he couldn’t even see the 1,000 strong crowd.' He said: 'I wouldn’t have driven in those conditions unless I had to.’ The newspaper reported that CCTV footage of the accident was unavailable as the cameras were pointing the other way at the time of the crash. Avon and Somerset police, who are . investigating the crash have appealed for bystanders to handover any . footage they may have captured to help them pinpoint the cause. However both . the rugby club and Counsell are believed to be considering making a . formal complaint against Somerset Assistant Chief Constable Anthony . Bangham. Investigation: Claims that thick smoke from the display held in Taunton, Somerset earlier this month drifted across the motorway before the accident are being looked into . Avon and Somerset police, who are investigating the crash have appealed for bystanders to handover any footage they may have captured of the accident . It is claimed that comments he made suggested a 'criminal investigation' would focus on the fireworks event - which both Mr Counsell and the club believe could be prejudicial. A friend of Mr Counsell told the newspaper: 'He acted entirely in good faith throughout the organisation for and the execution of the event. 'He can't believe what has happened since. The comments of the ACC were premature and ill-thought out, especially when you consider what had happened as a result of them.' Transport minister Mike Penning has appeared to suggest the smoke that caused the crash may not have come from fireworks, as previously suggested. He said: 'Once these lorries caught fire, diesel produces a very black acrid smoke, the tyres were alight, the plastics were alight. 'That mixing with mist or fog would create something that people might have thought was there before but was not there before but was part of the accident.' In a statement, the management of the rugby club said: 'As a family-based community club Taunton RFC held a fireworks display on the evening of the 4th November. 'Taunton RFC is working closely with Avon and Somerset police to assist with their investigations.'",Geoff Counsell  was targeted over the pile-up in Taunton that killed seven people and injured 51 others .

If you go shopping for NBA jerseys, Louis Vuitton handbags or Ugg boots today then be rest assured there’s less chance of you being sold a fake. Around 150 websites accused of selling knock-off or pirated goods to unsuspecting online bargain hunters have been shut down by authorities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized domain names for the sites in a three-month probe. FBI investigation: Around 150 websites accused of selling knock-off or pirated goods, such as Louis Vuitton handbags and Ugg boots, have been shut down . ‘This is straight crime,’ ICE Director John Morton said. ‘This is people being duped into buying a counterfeit.’ Results of the investigation were revealed on ‘Cyber Monday’ - the day for many shoppers that kicks off the online holiday shopping season. The U.S. federal government has seized the domain names of 350 websites since first targeting online counterfeiters in June 2010. Visitors to the seized domains are now greeted with a message from authorities saying the site has been seized by the government. It says: . Message: Visitors to seized domains are now greeted with a message from federal authorities explaining that the site has been seized by the government . 'Wilful copyright infringement is a federal crime that is punishable by up to five years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine, forfeiture and full restitution.’ Did you shop more on Cyber Monday than Black Friday? Mr Morton and Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said the domain names were registered in the U.S. but most were run abroad in China. Nobody has yet been charged with a crime in connection with the most recently seized domains. Earlier this year five people were indicted in Virginia on conspiracy and copyright infringement charges for their roles in operating a website. NinjaVideo.net allowed people to illegally download high-quality movies and television shows, the Justice Department said. Probe: John Morton's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized domain names in a three-month investigation . Mr Breuer said since the crackdown on counterfeit sellers started last year, internet users have gone to the seized domains 77 million times. 'It is very large figures. Well, well above millions' John Morton . ‘Typically we don't track the volumes of sales of these particular sites,’ Mr Morton said. ‘It is very large figures. Well, well above millions.’ He said it may seem trivial to buy knock-off sunglasses, but profits for the counterfeiters can help fund far more nefarious activities. ‘This is increasingly not simply a matter of mom and pop violations at the corner of Fourth and Main,’ Mr Morton added.","ICE and FBI seize domain names in three-month probe .

Could a 15 ton bunker buster that blows apart 200ft of concrete be the bomb that stops America's adversaries from developing nuclear weapons? The U.S. Air Force has unveiled the Massive Ordnance Penetrator - dubbed the Big Blu - and speculation is already mounting that it may be used in airstrikes on Iran or North Korea. B-2 Stealth Bombers will use the six metre long GPS guided rocket, fitted with 2.5 tons of explosives, to smash open underground bunkers and tunnels suspected of containing weapons of mass destruction. Scroll down for video... Threat: USAF specialists stand under a mock-up of the new bunker busting Big Blu . Bunker buster: The USAF's $32 million contract with aerospace firm Boeing will see eight of the devices delivered to 'fulfil the Air Force's operational needs' USAF Lieutenant Colonel Jack Miller said the service started taking delivery of the giant bomb, a staggering ten times more powerful than its predecessor the BLU-109, in September. He added that the $32 million contract with aerospace firm Boeing would see eight of the devices delivered to 'fulfil the Air Force's operational needs'. The delivery of the super bomb comes as U.S. President Barack Obama today said America would act firmly against any nuclear proliferation activities by North Korea. And it is in the same week an International Atomic Energy Agency report renewed calls for a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. In a speech to the Australian Parliament, Obama said the transfer of nuclear material by North Korea to other nations would be 'considered a grave threat to the U.S. and our allies'. Ramping up: The delivery of the super bomb comes in the same week an International Atomic Energy Agency report renewed calls for a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities . Transporter: B-2 Stealth Bombers (pictured) will use the six metre long GPS guided rockets to hit underground bunkers and tunnels suspected of containing weapons of mass destruction . He said he would hold North Korea, which has tested two nuclear devices since 2006 and is believed to be working on a long-range missile designed to reach the U.S., 'fully accountable for the consequences of such action'. The . multi-billion pound drug trafficking trade in Iran has been seized by . its Revolutionary Guard Corps, former regime officials claim. They . say RGC members are using it to establish links with a global crime . network and further its goal in undermining the West, say former regime . officials. The alleged . smuggling of heroin, opium and meth is in complete contrast to the . Guards hard-line reputation as defenders of the Islamic Revolution. Sajjad Haghpanah, who worked for Iran's domestic intelligence unit, said trafficking was endemic. He told the Times: 'There are several commanders involved in smuggling narcotics. 'They work with criminal gangs to move it overseas. They have their own ships, aircraft and haulage companies.' His warning came amid efforts to restart negotiations with the country on dismantling the nation's nuclear programme. Meanwhile, the IAEA's report focused on Iran's alleged efforts to fit a nuclear warhead on a missile. And it claimed Iran has been working to acquire equipment and weapons design information, testing high explosives and detonators and developing compute models of a warhead’s core. It led to the U.S. ramping up pressure on the country, which it suspects of building nuclear facilities deep underground to thwart any possible air raid. Obama refused to rule out a military option to prevent the country from making nuclear weapons and said economic sanctions against the country, aimed at halting its nuclear threat, were having 'enormous bite'. The new MOP is twice as heavy as the 'daisy cutter' bomb employed in Vietnam and in Tora Bora at the outset of the war in Afghanistan. The 'daisy cutter' has since been retired and replaced with the MOAB, the Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb or 'the Mother of All Bombs', which weighs less than the MOP bomb but contains more explosive power.","U.S. Air Force takes delivery of eight Big Blu bombs .

"By . Keith Gladdis . Last updated at 10:06 AM on 28th November 2011 . A colonel has ordered young officers to ‘sharpen up’ their appearance by dressing more like Princes William and Harry – and less like schoolboys from Grange Hill. In an extensive email, Colonel Barry Jenkins of the Royal Artillery Regiment tells male officers to avoid cartoon character socks, the ‘silvery’ shirts worn by Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker and shoes with treads like ‘four-wheel drives’. He informs female officers that their make-up should not be excessive and, ‘most importantly’, hair should be tidy and presentable, adding: ‘The whole “train crash survivor” clambering the embankment look is unattractive and inelegant.’ Do: Dress like Prince Harry out of uniform . Don't: Wear shirts like those of Gary Lineker . Instead, he advises his officers to follow the lead set by Princes William and Harry when they are in civilian clothes. Colonel Jenkins says: ‘We should not ape the armed wing of Boden, Primark, Fat Face. ‘I am constantly amazed by what some think is acceptable dress. ‘It is not just the quality but the untidy, scruffy manner in which it is worn – this must sharpen up.’ The memo – which quickly swept the internet – advises officers to wear a ‘good, clean, well pressed suit’ with a Gunner zigzag tie for the men and a brooch for the women. Support: Tory MP and former soldier Patrick Mercer applauded the email . He suggests a ‘slim elegant leather . suit belt’ rather than a Harley Davidson-buckle belt and long socks that . ‘do not show your flaky, spindly, hairy Twiglet-like shin’. Then he reminds young officers of the importance of polished and good quality footwear. He . says: ‘A heavy tread and a big fat square toe won’t do justice to your . well-cut suit… you wouldn’t put ketchup on a Dover sole.’ Colonel Jenkins is particularly . animated about the way in which young officers wear their zigzag style . neck tie. He says: ‘The tie should be correctly tied, close to the . collar and checked regularly. ‘The . knot must not be big fat Grange Hill special or be seen adorning the . neck of a semi finalist from The Apprentice. The tie should just reach . over the waist belt, not six inches above or below.’ Further . advice includes avoiding diving watches, which look ‘awful’ when . ‘furiously scrunched up against your shirt cuff’, and to steer clear of . shirts with pockets or those in black, red or other ‘EMO’ colours, . referring to the clothes worn by members of popular bands such as My . Chemical Romance, which often include studded belts and black . wristbands. Colonel Jenkins asks Royal Artillery staff to: ‘Please disseminate this lick of polish on to our fantastic, brave and impressive cohort of young officers.’ Conservative MP and former Army colonel Patrick Mercer believes the advice from Colonel Jenkins should be ‘applauded’. He said: ‘I know Barry Jenkins, he was a student of mine at staff college. He is a good bloke and I suspect if he is recommending that young Army officers should present themselves in a particular way, then it is good advice. I think increasingly in today’s society that the Army plays a part in being a role model for young people because of their sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan, therefore I think this is to be applauded.’ The memo has proved a hit with the Army. One officer said: ‘The colonel’s an absolute legend.’ Last night a Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was ‘aware’ of the email.","Avoid cartoon character socks, 'silvery' shirts and shoes with treads like 'four-wheel drives'

The mother had been in a wheelchair for several years after being involved in a car crash. Police are warning people in the town, which has a population of 8,000, to be on their guard and wary of unexpected packages in the post, particularly if they have been hand-delivered. Yesterday her house had been cordoned off while police carried out a forensic investigation at the scene. The blast had knocked one window out of the property. Ms Schachtay was not 'known' to police and neighbours have no idea why the mother, who lived in a two-storey apartment block, was targeted. Police spokesman Sgt Patrick Webb said: 'It is a tragedy and we're trying to determine exactly what happened. We're going all out on this one. 'At this time, we are treating it as a murder, as we do normally with all sudden unexplained deaths.' Ms Shachtay's neighbours described hearing a loud 'bang' that shook the apartment building.

Video footage has emerged of Afghan police humiliating a cross-dressing man by forcing him to undress on camera apparently for their own amusement. The Afghan male, seen initially wearing a long shiny black wig, jewellery and a flowing black robe, is ordered to remove all his female attire despite protests of innocence. The man is cruelly humiliated as officers demand he remove the wig, jewellery robe during the eight-minute video. The unknown Afghan cross-dresser's ordeal begins when he is ordered by police to take his black wig off . The man's receding tightly-cropped hair is revealed as Afghan police laugh and continue to give him orders . By the end he is stood in a scarlet short-sleeved traditional female dress with his receding hair on full show. As police officers appear to laugh and goad the cross-dressing man, he pleads for mercy and can be heard saying, 'Don't make fun of me.' At one point he even suffers the indignity of having to remove fake breasts from under his dress, which turn out to be two socks filled with dough. Upon seeing this, an officer comments: 'Dough to make the breasts feel softy-soft.' According to the Guardian, the officers then deliver a barrage of questions to the transvestite and a second man who is arrested. The man is next forced to remove his black dress, to reveal a bright red female garment underneath as the humiliation continues . The Afghan man protests that he 'hasn't committed any crime', but is still made to remove all his female clothing by police . His humiliation comes to an end after he is ordered by Afghan police to remove the two fake breasts from under his dress, which turn out to be two socks filled with dough . They ask the pair: 'Why are you dressed like this? Where did you put the makeup on? What is all this about? What have you two been up to?' As the Afghan cross dresser removes his jewellery, he can be heard to whisper: 'I was shopping for clothes.' After being near reduced to tears, the second man tells police officers: 'Please, officer, we haven't committed a crime.' The video, which appears to have originated from an Afghan news source, is listed as being filmed in Kabul on Friday. It is not clear what eventually happened to the two victims, but the footage has since been viewed nearly 25,000 times online. Homosexuality and crossdressing are considered criminal offences in Afghanistan, with the regime change in the country doing very little to alter gay rights.","Video viewed 25,000 times shows Afghan cross-dressing male suffer humiliation at hands of police.

A young mother who was left paralysed after a row over a spilt drink broke down in court yesterday after her attacker was allowed home for Christmas. Claire Hilton, 29, yelled at Christopher Towers: ‘Look what you’ve done. You’ve ruined my life.’ She wept as Towers was granted bail, meaning he can spend the festive season at home with his family. He will almost certainly be jailed when he returns in the New Year to be sentenced. Outraged: Claire Hilton outside Newcastle Quayside Crown Court today. She was left paralysed after a pub row over a spilt drink . 'You've ruined my life': Miss Hilton told the court it 'was not fair' was able to spend Christmas at home with his family . The court had heard how Towers, 24, . chased Miss Hilton and then punched her in the face after an argument . over a pint of cider costing £2.80. The impact threw Miss Hilton back on to a dry stone wall and she broke her back and neck. Yesterday . Miss Hilton, who was sat just a few feet away from Towers in her . wheelchair, was unable to contain her anger as he was given bail and . interrupted: ‘So he gets Christmas out and has ruined my life? It’s not . fair.’ She then waited for . him to leave the dock with his co-accused before looking him in the face . and demanding: ‘Look at what you have done to me. Look at what you have . done. You have ruined my life.’ Thug: Christopher Towers admitted grievous bodily harm but was bailed until the New Year . Towers, . whose mother and girlfriend were in the dock alongside him, refused to . look at his tearful victim after admitting a lesser charge of grievous . bodily harm and instead strode past her and out of  the court. He . had originally been accused of GBH with intent – a crime that carries a . maximum sentence of life – but after an eleventh-hour plea-bargain the . charge was dropped for the lesser offence which carries a five-year . limit. He will return to Newcastle Crown Court on January 6 when he will be sentenced. Outside . court Miss Hilton, who is paralysed from the waist down, said: ‘I . cannot see why he should have Christmas out with his family. He’s ruined . my life forever. I can’t understand why he was bailed. ‘I . feel totally let down by the justice system. I have been given the . short straw of this throughout. I’m absolutely devastated. My Christmas . is over this year – all because of him.’ Miss . Hilton, a former telesales worker, was enjoying a quiet night out at . her local pub in June when her cousin, Lauren Mould, 18, accidentally . knocked over the £2.80 drink with her handbag. She . and Miss Mould apologised to Towers, his girlfriend, Kelly McCone, and . his mother, Lynn Faherty, and even offered to buy them a drink by way of . a goodwill gesture, but they refused to calm down. Towers, . his mother and girlfriend, who had spent the day drinking, were asked . to leave the pub and escorted out. But they waited outside the . Wheatsheaf pub in West Boldon, South Tyneside, for Miss Hilton and her . cousin to leave. They then . followed the pair as they made their way home with two friends before . launching the mindless attack. 'Party girl': Claire Hilton, pictured right, with friend Joanna Teasdale, suffered a broken neck and back . Attack: Claire Hilton was attacked close to the Wheatsheaf Pub in an argument about a £2.80 pint of cider . Miss Hilton, who has been told she will . never walk again after the attack, recalled yesterday: ‘When we got so . far away they seemed to be behind us somehow. ‘Christopher . Towers seemed to take a run up and punched me full in the face. I was . thrown against this wall with such force that it broke my neck. ‘A . friend tried to protect me and he got punched.

I told . him to call an ambulance and said “I can’t feel my legs”. I knew . straight away.’ She added: . ‘It was all over a spilt drink. It wasn’t even half a glass. We offered . to buy Kelly McCone a fresh drink but they refused. They had been out . all day and were picking fights with other people. We were the . unfortunate ones.’ Miss .

Sea drama: Prince William co-piloted a rescue helicopter as they searched for the crew from the large cargo ship . The Duke of Cambridge helped pluck two shipwrecked sailors from a raging sea in a dramatic rescue, but five other crewmen were missing feared drowned last night. Prince William’s RAF search and rescue helicopter was scrambled in the early hours yesterday after the 267ft Swanland sank with its cargo of 3,000 tons of limestone after being hit by a massive wave off the North Wales coast. He was co-piloting the Sea King in 50mph winds as the crew from his base, RAF Valley in Anglesey, spotted the second officer and a crewmate in the sea and winched them to safety. The body of one of the sailors’ crewmates was later discovered, but despite scouring 300 square miles of the Irish Sea, rescuers found no trace of the remaining five members of the Russian crew before the search was called off for the night. Coastguards said they would reassess the situation this morning. The Swanland, which is registered in the Cook Islands but owned by a firm based in Grimsby, was carrying limestone quarried in North Wales from Raynes Jetty to Cowes on the Isle of Wight when it came to grief. When the mayday call was made at 2am yesterday, it quickly became clear that the bulk carrier was doomed after being hit by an enormous wave that cracked its hull around 20 miles off the Lleyn peninsula. Survivor: A man aboard a life raft waves at the helicopter piloted by the Prince as they attempted to rescue him and his colleagues after the ship sank . Rescue mission: The helicopter hovers over the sea as it looks for survivors . Sunk: The Swanland which was battered by gale-force winds in the Irish Sea . As the Swanland sank, its eight-man crew – all believed to have been wearing survival suits – took to life rafts in the stormy water, which would have been a chilly 14-15c (57-59f). The helicopter co-piloted by William – known in the RAF as Flight Lieutenant Wales – quickly traced the second officer and an able seaman in a life raft as winds touched gale force nine, and they were flown to Anglesey for check-ups. Ray Carson of the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Holyhead, who described the rescue as ‘outstanding work given the conditions’, said: ‘The ’copter crew definitely saved the life of two men.’ The crew were joined by two rescue helicopters from Ireland and counterparts from RAF Chivenor in Devon, as well as lifeboats from Porth Dinllaen, Pwllheli and Abersoch. A life raft beached off Bardsey Island could not be checked last night because of dangerous rocks, but rescuers fear there is little chance of finding anyone else alive.

He also urged the pilgrims to let their lives be guided by their faith, saying even those who doubt God's existence 'are closer to the kingdom of God than believers whose faith is routine and who regard the church merely as an institution, without letting their hearts be touched by faith.' The pope drew large crowds at his stops in Berlin and in mainly Protestant eastern Germany, but the numbers were largest in the heavily Catholic south-western city of Freiburg.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Last updated at 6:36 PM on 23rd November 2011 . 'Amazing': A new study will give hope to thousands of people with Alzheimer's after halting brain shrinkage in the region linked to memory . Alzheimer’s could be eased by bursts of electricity to the brain, research suggests. In a small-scale study, regular fleeting pulses of electricity stopped the brain shrinkage linked to the memory-robbing disease. The bursts of energy also appeared to prevent key brain regions from ‘shutting down’, this week’s New Scientist reports. The research is very preliminary, with just six patients treated, but the results have been described as ‘amazing’. Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons, and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages. Current drugs can halt the progression of the disease, but do not work for everyone and their effects wear off over time, leaving the disease free to take its cruel course. To try to halt and even reverse the brain wasting effects, the Canadian researchers turned to a technique called deep-brain stimulation. This involves implanting electrodes deep within the brain and programming them to give off tiny pulses of electricity 130 times a second. While this may seem radical, it is already successfully used to ease the tremors, stiffness and walking problems of Parkinson’s Disease. In Alzheimer’s, the hippocampus, the brains’ memory hub, shrinks. In addition, brain scans show that the temporal lobe, the region which contains the hippocampus, and another region called the posterior cingulate, use less sugar than normal, suggesting they have slowed or shut down. Requires surgery: An X-ray showing implanted deep-brain stimulation electrodes like the ones used by researchers in Canada (file picture) to shock brain cells that carry signals to and from the hippocampus . To try to combat this, the Canadian researchers inserted electrodes into the brains of six patients, each of whom had been diagnosed with the disease at least a year earlier. During the brain surgery, the electrodes were carefully placed next to a bundle of brain cells that carry signals to and from the hippocampus. The electrodes released 130 bursts of electricity a second and, after a year, the brain’s use of sugar had returned to normal in all six patients. And while the brain’s memory hub shrunk in four of those taking part, it grew in the remaining two, a neuroscience conference heard last week. Describing the result as ‘amazing’, researcher Andres Lozano said: ‘Not only did the hippocampus not shrink, it got bigger – by 5 per cent in one person and 8 per cent in the other. Progressive: A scan showing a healthy brain (top) compared with one displaying warning signs of Alzheimer's (bottom) in red . Tests showed that their minds also seemed to be sharper than expected. Dr Lozano isn’t sure how the treatment works, but it may be through the electrical current driving the birth of new brain cells. And, in mice, deep brain stimulation triggers the production of proteins that encourage brain cells to form new connections. Dr Lozano, of Toronto Western Hospital, is starting a bigger trial involving 50 people. Answering criticism about the practicalities of using brain surgery to treat a common disease, he pointed out that deep brain stimulation has already been used 90,000 times in Parkinson’s patients from around the world. He told New Scientist that Alzheimer’s is just five times more common than Parkinson’s. And added: ‘If it can be used in Parkinson’s, it can be used in Alzheimer’s.’","Region linked to memory stopped shrinking in small study .

New research has found that grey seals have distinctly different personalities which results in individual ways of mothering their young. Researchers from Durham University and the University of St Andrews have found that seal mothers adopt a wide variety of mothering styles when caring for their pups. Loving: A mother seal affectionately tends to her pup as new research has revealed how grey seals exhibit a wide variety of parenting styles . The study shows for the first time the extent of personality differences in marine mammals in the wild and how they may be limited in their ability to respond to different environments. Researchers observed seals on the Scottish island of North Rona during the breeding season between September and November for two years. Using a remote controlled vehicle fitted with a video camera, the researchers tested how seals react to potential threats, including approaches by the vehicle and wolf calls played from the vehicle. Female seals varied considerably in their responses to the remote controlled vehicle, from almost completely ignoring it, to pushing it with their muzzles. Affectionate: A new study found that some seal mothers are very watchful when something threatening approaches them while others barely check their pups at all . The team also checked the responses of seal mothers by recording the number of times she raises her head off the ground and looks in the direction of her pups to check their well-being, during a specific time period. Lead author, Dr Sean Twiss, of the School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences at Durham University, said: 'Our findings show that there is no such thing as an average seal. 'Individuals behave differently and do so consistently. 'We found that some seal mothers are very watchful when something potentially threatening approaches them, while other mums barely check their pups at all. Playful: Researchers say the new study confirms that there is no such thing as an average seal . 'Why female grey seals express individually consistent patterns of pup-checking is unknown. 'Our results show large differences in response to the same potential dangers.' The researchers also checked the response of male seals to the remote controlled vehicle and logged a wide range of reactions, from rapid retreat to threatening behaviour. Some males, particularly the dominant ones, were consistently alert and aggressive, and challenged the remote controlled vehicle, while others were more cautious and moved away. Further studies could help biologists understand whether such behaviour patterns limit the ability of individuals, and potentially species to adapt to climate or habitat change. Dr Twiss said: 'We can see the grey seals are individuals and we want to find out if having different personalities and behaviour helps seals and other animals in the wild, or whether it does limit their ability to cope with change.'","Fascinating discovery follows two years of research on Scottish island .

Looming Mr Lansley: 'I hope it's as good quality care as we can possibly make it' Hospital patients are being forced to endure a 'welcome message' from Health Secretary Andrew Lansley projected into wards on a continuous loop. The Cabinet minister's face appears on bedside TVs saying that their care 'really matters to me' and asking them to thank NHS staff. The Big Brother message can be turned off if patients register on the entertainment system, which gives them free radio access. The daily rate for TV and email services is £5. Mr Lansley's subtitled message, which replaces one made by his Labour predecessor Andy Burnham, goes: 'Hello, I'm Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary. 'I just want to take a few moments to say that your care while you're here in hospital really matters to me. 'I hope it's as good quality care as we can possibly make it and I do hope you'll join me in thanking all the staff who are looking after you while you're here.' According to the PR company Tetra strategy the video is seen by up to 10 million patients a year in over 150 hospitals. It comes just weeks after a damning Patients Association report revealed a catalogue of abuse by NHS staff. The charity compiled a dossier of . 16 distressing hospital cases based on accounts by either relatives or the . patients themselves, but said it has been made aware of hundreds of . examples from calls to its helpline. The bedside entertainment system can cost £2.50 for a couple of hours . They said nurses have refused to give painkillers . to dying patients, while relatives were so concerned at the lack of care . for their loved ones that they stayed on the wards round the clock. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme today, the Health Secretary insisted his TV role put across 'a useful message'. Mr Lansley said: 'When people go into hospital, I hope one of the first things they realise is we want them to have as comfortable and as high quality a stay as possible. 'I want them to help join me in thanking the NHS staff and I particularly wanted to say if they had any feedback that would be really helpful,' he said. 'It can be even worse - one constituent told me their baby's first experience of life was to see me on a monitor, which he found rather unnerving. He wasn't sure about the baby.' One man visiting an elderly relative, . told The Independent: 'It was eerie. Everywhere you looked there was . Andrew Lansley.

"By . Tom Worden In Barcelona . Last updated at 4:32 PM on 23rd September 2011 . It is a sport that has come to symbolise Spain - but from this weekend it may come to represent political divisions in the country. This weekend Catalonia becomes the first region on the Spanish mainland to ban bullfighting. Barcelona's famous bullring El Monumental will host its final bullfight on Sunday evening in front of 20,000 spectators. While some see this as a victory for animal rights activists, there are those who say the ban is politically motivated as the region strives for autonomy. El Monumental bullring in Barcelona will host the last bullfight in Catalonia this Saturday before it is banned . The iconic Barcelona landmark will likely be used to host rock concerts . Jose Tomas, 36, the country's most popular matador, will perform at his favourite bullring, drawing to close almost 100 years of history in the impressive building. Catalonia's regional government voted in July last year to ban bullfighting on the grounds it is outdated and cruel, in response to demands from animal rights activists. Supporters of bullfighting accused . Catalan nationalists of hijacking the anti-bullfighting campaign for . political purposes, to highlight their independence from Madrid. They . point out that other popular events involving bulls, called . 'correbous', still take place legally in Catalonia, one of 17 autonomous . regions in Spain. And they hope to overturn the ban on bullfighting on constitutional grounds. Jose Tomas is caught by a bull during a bullfight at El Monumental in 2009. The matador will be taking part in the last such spectacle in the bullring this weekend . The historic vote was sparked when campaign group Prou! ('Enough!' in Catalan) collected 180,000 signatures calling for a ban in the north-eastern region. Celebrities including Pamela Anderson and Ricky Gervais backed the bid to outlaw the practice. The parliamentary debate was closely fought, with 68 votes for the ban, 55 against and nine abstentions. The law comes into force on 1 January next year but Sunday's bullfight is the final one in the season scheduled at El Monumental - Catalonia's last functioning bullring. Tickets for the event are selling for up to 3,500 euros on the black market on the internet. Catalan . bullfighting fan David Guillem said: 'It's a surreal feeling, I can't . quite believe it. It's like the sensation you have when someone you know . dies and you can't quite accept it.' A worker puts up a poster by Balearic artist . Miquel Barcelo, painted for his bullfighter friend Jose Tomas to mark . the last bullfight in Catalonia. While elsewhere the event is well advertised . El Monumental has been hosting bullfights for almost 100 years . In recent years El Monumental, inaugurated in 1914, held only around 15 bullfights a year out of 1,000 around Spain. It was often half empty during bullfights, which are not popular with younger people in Catalonia. By contrast Las Ventas bullring in Madrid often sells out its 25,000 capacity and holds 350 bullfights a year. Discussions are still going on over the future of El Monumental, which could become a concert venue. It has previously hosted concerts by groups including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Animal rights campaigners hope the Catalonia ban will spark further campaigns around the country. The Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the north west coast of Africa, banned bullfighting in 1991, but it was never popular there. Spanish matador Daniel Luque performs at Las Ventas bullring in Madrid, which holds 350 bullfights a year . In contrast to the Barcelona arena, Madrid's bullring is regularly sold out . Spanish matador Jose Tomas will be appearing int he last ever bullfight at El Monumental . Many supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national cultures. Rather . than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual which is . judged by aficionados based on artistic impression . and command. Ernest . Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book Death in the . Afternoon: 'Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in . danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance . is left to the fighter's honour.' While . there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed as a . sacrificial victim—it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy . adversary, deserving of respect in its own right. On the other hand those . who oppose bullfighting maintain it is a . cowardly, sadistic tradition of slowly torturing, humiliating and . finally murdering a terrified, dying bull. who . vomits blood, bellows in agony, and desperately seeks his escape amid . pomp and pageantry of unashamed people who applaud when he finally . collapses and then is killed.","Region is first on mainland Spain to stop bullfighting .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:47 PM on 28th November 2011 . Nato airstrikes which killed 24 Pakistani soldiers went on for almost two hours and continued even after Pakistani soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop, the army claimed today. The deaths have been described as 'tragic and unintended' by Nato who have promised a full investigation. Afghan officials have claimed the bombing raid was triggered when a joint Afghan-Nato force received incoming fire from the direction of Pakistan. Now scroll down for video . Fury: Protesters torch an American flag as they shout slogans about the Nato airstrikes which killed 28 people . Ties between Pakistan and the United States were already deteriorating before the deadly attack and have sunk to new lows since, delivering a major setback to American hopes of enlisting Islamabad's help in negotiating an end to the 10-year-old Afghan war. Yesterday thousands of angry Pakistanis took to the . streets and burned an effigy of President Barack Obama in . protest over the Nato strike that killed 24 soldiers. Demonstrators, who carried anti-Western placards and shouted slogans such as ‘death to America’, also set fire to U.S. flags. Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said today that the Pakistani troops at two border posts were the victims of unprovoked aggression. Demonstration: Supporters of the banned charity Jamat-ud-Dawa protest about the Nato airstrike. The attacks have led to an outpouring of anger across Pakistan . An activist of the Pakistani Islamic and political party Jamaat-e-Islami burn tyres on a street during a protest against Nato strikes on Pakistani troops in Lahore . He said the attack lasted almost two hours and that commanders had contacted their Nato counterparts while it was going on, and asked that 'they get this fire to cease, but somehow it continued.' The Pakistan army has previously said its soldiers retaliated 'with all weapons available' to the attack. The poorly defined, mountainous border has been a constant source of tension with the U.S. Nato officials have complained that insurgents fire from across the frontier, often from positions close to Pakistani soldiers who have been accused of tolerating or supporting the militants. Nato and Afghan forces are not allowed to cross over into Pakistan in pursuit of militants. Saturday's strikes have added to popular anger in Pakistan against the U.S.-led coalition presence in Afghanistan. Many in the army, parliament, general population and media already believed that the U.S. and Nato are hostile to Pakistan and that the Afghan Taliban are not the enemy. By claiming it was the victim of unprovoked aggression, the Pakistan army is strengthening this narrative. A Pakistani boy joins in the protest after the helicopter attacks on Friday which killed 24 soldiers and sparked widespread anger . Heavily guarded: The 24 Pakistani soldiers who were killed in the attacks are buried yesterday . Salute: Pakistan army soldiers march among the rows of coffins . While the United States is widely disliked in Pakistan, the army has accepted billions in American aid over the last 10 years in return for its cooperation in fighting Al Qaeda. Abbas dismissed Afghanistan's claims that the joint Afghan-Nato troops were fired upon first. 'At this point, Nato and Afghanistan are trying to wriggle out of the situation by offering excuses,' he said. ""Where are their casualties?""' John Allen, the U.S. commander of NATO . forces in Afghanistan, yesterday issued a statement saying the incident . had his 'highest personal attention.' Abbas said the two military posts, named 'Volcano' and 'Golden,' were located on a ridge in Mohmand region around 300 yards from the border with Afghanistan. He said their exact location had been provided to Nato and that the area had recently been cleared of militants. Burning issue: Protesters in Karachi set fire to an effigy of President Obama in anger over the deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers killed in a Nato attack . Upset: The Supporters of Pakistan Muslim League also shouted anti-U.S. slogans as they burned the effigy . 'Nato shame': The effigy quickly perishes in the flames . Hours after the attack on Saturday, Pakistan closed its western border to trucks delivering supplies to Nato troops in Afghanistan and demanded that the U.S. abandon an airbase inside Pakistan used to operate drone strikes. However, a complete breakdown in the relationship between the United States and Pakistan is considered unlikely. Pakistan relies on billions of dollars in American aid, and the U.S. needs Pakistan to push Afghan insurgents to participate in peace talks. After the Bin Laden raid, ties almost collapsed but slowly resumed, albeit at a lower level and with lower expectations on the American side. A year ago, a U.S. helicopter attack killed two Pakistani soldiers posted on the Afghan-Pakistani border, prompting the army to close one of the border crossings. Stuck: Cargo trucks, including those carrying supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan, are halted along the Pakistan border, after it was shut down . No passage: A Pakistani security personnel stands guard beside trucks carrying supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan that are parked at the Pakistan's border crossing . A joint investigation by the two nations found that Pakistani troops had fired first at the U.S. helicopters. The investigation found that the shots were probably meant as warnings after the choppers passed into Pakistani airspace. The U.S. apologized, and the border was reopened. Yesterday, as funerals took place for . the 24 Pakistani Army soldiers killed in the attack, hundreds of trucks . carrying supplies to U.S.troops in Afghanistan clogged the Pakistani . border crossings. As . Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani attended the funerals . of the victims, including a major, the U.S. sought to minimize the . fallout from the crisis. The attack is the worst single incident . of its kind since Pakistan uneasily allied itself with Washington in the . days immediately following the September 11 attacks on U.S. targets. Full probe: The President and Hillary Clinton support 'NATO's intention to investigate immediately' Suspected militants destroyed around . 150 trucks and injured drivers and police a year ago after Pakistan . closed one of its Afghan border crossings to NATO supplies for about ten . days in retaliation for a U.S. helicopter attack that accidentally . killed two Pakistani soldiers. The . situation could be more dire this time because Pakistan, outraged at . the alleged NATO attack before dawn Saturday, has closed both its . crossings. Nearly 300 . trucks carrying coalition supplies are now backed up at Torkham in the . northwest Khyber tribal area and Chaman in southwestern Baluchistan . province. Last year, Pakistan only closed Torkham. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in a joint statement offered their . 'deepest condolences' and said they 'support fully NATO's intention to . investigate immediately.' U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter also met with Pakistani government officials in Islamabad. The incident occurred a day after U.S. General John Allen met Pakistani Army Chief of Army Staff General . Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to discuss border control and enhanced . cooperation. The . United States has long suspected Pakistan of continuing to secretly . support Taliban militant groups in a bid to secure influence in . Afghanistan after most NATO troops leave in 2014.

"By . Rob Cooper . Created 5:31 PM on 14th November 2011 . Axed: Judeson Peter, 39, claims that Huawei Technologies axed him 'because he was not Chinese' A telecoms company is accused of race discrimination after axing almost 50 British workers and replacing them with Chinese employees. Judeson Peter, 39, told an employment . tribunal that Huawei Technologies made him redundant from their office . in Basingstoke, Hampshire, because he was British. The £48,000-per-year customer support engineer, who . specialised in fibre optics, said there was 'clearly' an increasing . number of Chinese staff at the firm. In total, they moved 342 workers to Britain over three years, the tribunal heard. In the same period, 49 British and non-British staff lost their jobs. Mr Peter said: 'A large number of Chinese employees were joining the workforce in 2009 at the same time that I was being made redundant. 'I believe I could have done these . roles. Far more non-Chinese employees have been selected for redundancy . than Chinese employees. 'With regard to engineers, it should . be noted that not a single Chinese engineer has been made redundant, . whereas 30 non-Chinese have been.' The hearing in Southampton, Hampshire, was told that Mr Peter started working for the Chinese firm in April 2006 but was made redundant in May 2009. Mr Peter, who was born in Sri Lanka but became a British national after studying at King's College, London, in the 1990s, said no foreign workers were made redundant. He added: 'The human resources manager sent an email dated April 21, 2009, stating that expat employees are exempt from redundancy. 'This is a clear racial discrimination against non-Chinese employees as most expats are Chinese. 'Home Office guidelines state employers are not to treat migrant workers more or less favourably than resident workers. 'I believe I have been unfairly pre-selected for redundancy and have been selected due to my age and race in that I am not Chinese.' Mr Peter added: 'Those who were made redundant were local engineers, some British, some of other nationalities.' Mohamed Kerrouche, a colleague of Mr Peter, said Chinese employees’ poor spoken English made it impossible for them to speak to customers. He said: 'There were three rounds of redundancies in 2009. 'On each occasion local engineers were made redundant and either expat employees - Chinese migrant workers - or locally employed ethnically Chinese engineers were not. 'One Chinese engineer I worked with spoke very little English, hence it made it extremely difficult for me to liase with him. Mr Peter was the most senior engineer on his team at Huawei before being made redundant. Huawei, which has its headquarters in Guandong, China, employs 110,000 staff worldwide and made a profit of $3.64 billion last year. Tony Cooper, representing Huawei, said the figures quoted by Mr Peter were unreliable. He also stressed that the Chinese expats were employed by the holding company in their homeland - and not the UK firm. Mr Cooper said: 'The Chinese expats went through a different redundancy process. They were employed by the holding company in China and seconded to work in the UK. 'They did not work for the UK-based company. The whole company was affected by economic circumstances and changes in the organisation of their competitors.' In cross-examination, he said to Mr Peter: 'The figures you have given cannot be relied on. The numbers are not reflective of the number of visas granted or the number of people who have come to work in the UK.' A spokesman for Huawei added: 'Huawei denies all allegations made by Judeson Peter within his employment tribunal. 'In 2009 Huawei unfortunately had to make a series of redundancies, resulting in 25 percent of British workers and 32 percent of Chinese employees losing their jobs. Huawei’s Chinese expat employees are subject to a separate contract and dealt with through a different process. The fact that a higher percentage of Chinese workers than British were made redundant shows that Huawei in no way prioritised Chinese employees.'Mr Peter was employed as an optical customer support engineer at the time of restructuring. Huawei began a fair review, strictly following selection criteria feedback. Mr Peter scored the lowest number of points, so unfortunately he had to be made redundant. Huawei believes that the process followed was fair and in line with the approach other companies operating in the UK would take to restructuring.' Mr Peter, from Paddington, London, . alleges unfair dismissal, breach of contract and discrimination on the . grounds of age and race.","Judeson Peter, 39 claims Huawei Technologies moved 342 Chinese workers to Britain as they axed 49 staff .
£48,000-per-year worker said Chinese workers were exempt from redundancy .
Huawei won the tribunal. A spokesperson for the company said: ‘The tribunal has upheld that Judeson Peter was not unfairly dismissed and that Huawei was found to have followed a fair and legal process.  Huawei as a reputable employer would not tolerate any form of discrimination in the workplace and this has been validated by the tribunal's review of the case.Huawei is a responsible and fair employer and we are committed to the equal treatment of all our employees, providing the same career opportunities to all our employees globally.'"

Andrei Murakhovsky, a Ukraine-born doctor working in the town where Saif al-Islam is being held, last night told how the wound was 'covered with gangrenous and necrotic tissue' and 'requires amputation'. Captive: Saif al-Islam looks at his injured fingers just after his capture, while in the custody of revolutionary fighters in Obari . 'Necrotic': Saif al-Islam needs surgery to remove gangrenous flesh from a severed thumb and finger which if not treated could make him seriously ill . Fighters from Libya's Western Mountains captured Saif al-Islam in the southern desert on Saturday and flew him to their stronghold town of Zintan. The former playboy and student at the London School of Economics is being held there until a handover to the country's provisional government. Dr Murakhovsky said Saif al-Islam's middle finger did not require surgery but the two other bandaged digits had been severed and were weeping pus. 'His index finger has been ripped off at the level of the middle phalange (finger bone), the bones are all shattered ... It's the same thing with the thumb of that hand,' he said. Saif al-Islam flashes a victory sign for reporters prior to his capture . When a picture of Saif al-Islam's bandaged hand was aired, many Libyans thought his captors had cut off his fingers in retribution for threats against anti-Gaddafi rebels which he made on TV while pointing and making other hand gestures. Dr Murakhovsky said, however, that the injuries were consistent with 'some kind of explosion'. According . to Dr Murakhovsky, the surgical intervention required was relatively . simple and could be performed in Zintan under local anaesthetic. But the town's militiamen were worried someone would try to kill Saif al-Islam if they took him to hospital. 'I . would have done it the day before yesterday. It's not so urgent. It's . already been like that for a month. But it's preferable that it should . be done soon,' Dr Murakhovsky said.

Solemn: Mabrouka Sherif, Libya's new minister of social affairs, swears on the Quran as she takes her oath of office . Libya's transitional government was sworn in before the country's interim leader yesterday, another step in the oil-rich country's path to elections next year. Starting with Prime Minister Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib, each minister faced the transitional council's leader, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil. They placed their hands on a Quran and swore to 'remain loyal to the goals' of the revolution that overthrew longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi. Each shook Abdel-Jalil's hand as he stood in front of two national flags, and some also embraced him. The country faces huge challenges, but Mr el-Keib said he and his ministers were 'upbeat' and optimistic about leading Libya toward elections by next June. 'We are looking forward to having an exciting seven months ahead of us, with lots of things to do and hopefully good results,' Mr el-Keib said. The transitional Cabinet includes 24 ministers, although several, including the defence minister, were missing from yesterday's ceremony. The prime minister explained that they were out of Tripoli, some of them attending to personal preparations in their hometowns before taking up their new posts. Abdurrahim El-Keib, the new Libyan prime minister, has said Saif al-Islam is receiving the best possible treatment, but for now he is not in the hands of the provisional central government. Zintan's fighters have said they will hand him over to the provisional government once it is formed. The cabinet was sworn in yesterday, with the defence minister's post going to the head of Zintan's military council. Dr Murakhovsky said only a small part of Saif al-Islam's thumb and index finger needed to be removed. While he did not need to be operated on urgently, he added, if there were no intervention there could be serious consequences. If left untreated, the gangrenous infection could spread into the bloodstream and lead to osteomyolitis, which Dr Murakhovsky said was 'an infection of the bone marrow, which could have an impact on his general condition'. The International Criminal Court has indicted Saif al-Islam for crimes against humanity and issued a warrant for his arrest. Libya, however, says it will not hand him over to the Hague, and the ICC's prosecutor says Tripoli can try him if it wants to. Saif al-Islam has not been charged in Libya, but ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said his Libyan counterpart has launched investigations into the same events as the ICC, in which protesters were killed during this year's revolution. If Libya were to charge him with similar crimes as the ICC, Saif al-Islam would face the death penalty. The maximum sentence the ICC can pass is life in prison. Libya is also investigating five counts of alleged corruption by Saif al-Islam, Mr Moreno-Ocampo said yesterday.","Saif al-Islam still captive in Zintan .

Luck of the Irish ran out: Janet Devlin was sent home last night after singing for survival against Misha B . The redhead performed well in the sing-off, tapping into the innocence of her very first audition with a rendition of Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol.

Holiday giant Thomas Cook is struggling for survival following a slump in bookings and fears it is having difficulty repaying bank loans totalling £1billion. The firm, founded in 1841, is under threat as families cut back on sunshine holidays. The value of shares in the company, now German-owned, slumped by 75 per cent yesterday after it said it is talking to banks about re-financing its debts. Vulnerable: The latest announcement comes after reports that Thomas Cook could close 200 travel agencies . Earlier this year the company revealed a drop in bookings and issued three profit warnings. The firm, which was the world’s first . package holiday company, sells 22million trips a year to families in . Britain and 20 other countries. Executives yesterday insisted that . trading is robust and there is no danger to the holidays or travel plans . of its millions of British customers. But James Hollins, analyst at . investment bank Evolution Securities, said: ‘Legitimate questions will . be asked as to whether Thomas Cook can survive long-term.’ Package holiday pioneer: An advert from 1936 when most breaks were no further from home than the English coast . Bosses are looking at immediate cost . cutting measures, including closing more than 200 of its travel agent . outlets on high streets, threatening thousands of jobs. The company, Europe’s second biggest . tour operator after TUI Travel, suddenly parted company with its chief . executive, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, in the summer. The new interim chief executive, Sam . Weihagen, said that trading had deteriorated in recent months, with poor . bookings for this winter and for summer next year. He blamed the lack of bookings on the . eurozone crisis and resulting financial turmoil which has led to . families abandoning luxuries, including foreign holidays. Unrest caused by the Arab Spring . especially in Egypt and Tunisia – popular destinations with . holidaymakers from its key markets in the UK, France and Russia – had . also hit the business harder than expected. Despite the collapse in the share . price, which meant it is down 93 per cent since January, Mr Weihagen . insisted the company is a ‘robust business that has a great future’. The group insisted it had not fallen . behind with any of its bank loan repayments and Mr Weihagen  said the . talks with its lenders were an act of ‘prudence’. Cutbacks: The holiday giant is to reduce its plane fleet by six aircraft . He added: ‘We’re operating business as usual. Flights are leaving on schedule, shops are open and we’re taking bookings.’ The travel industry trade body, ABTA, . also reassured consumers, saying all flights and package holidays sold . by the firm are protected. ABTA spokesman Victoria Bacon insisted that customers can continue to make bookings for next year with confidence. ‘The key thing is that anyone who has . booked a holiday with them is protected,’ she said. ‘People can go ahead . and book as normal.’","UK business has accumulated debts of nearly £1 billion .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 5:04 PM on 28th November 2011 . Streets in downtown Los Angeles where thousands of Occupy protesters swarmed to stage an early morning demonstration have re-opened. The protesters had crammed onto the City Hall lawn and the surrounding streets after the midnight deadline of their eviction passed, vowing to 'stay put'. Four people were arrested for failure to disperse and a few protesters . tossed bamboo sticks and water bottles at officers, according to Police Commander Andy . Smith. Staying put: Occupy LA members crowded in front of City Hall late last night as the eviction deadline passed . Force: A police officer orders a demonstrator off the street at the early morning protest in Los Angeles . The LAPD yesterday revealed it was now on tactical alert. Deputy Chief Jose Perez told the LA Times it will see on-duty officers remain at work and police not responding to low-priority radio calls. Following . the midnight eviction deadline, a celebratory atmosphere filled the . night outside City Hall and the encampment near it. A group of protesters on bicycles circled the block, one of them in a cow suit, while organisers led chants with a bull horn. 'The . best way to keep a non-violent movement non-violent is to throw a . party, and keep it festive and atmospheric,' said Brian Masterson. Prepared: Police in riot gear line the street to push the demonstrators back into the park during the protest . Making a stand: Occupy LA protesters pictured last night making preparations for their eviction . Defiant: In response to the eviction deadline, Occupy LA protesters pour into streets surrounding the park . Shortly after the 12.01am . deadline, there was only a small police presence, about two dozen . motorcycle officers who remained across the street from the camp. By 2.30 a.m., most protesters had . moved from the campsite and swarmed onto nearby streets, putting them . technically in compliance with the mayor's eviction order. But at 4.50 a.m., police on loudspeakers declared an unlawful assembly and protesters were ordered out of the streets. The . previously peaceful protest turned violent, with masked protesters . taunting officers and throwing water bottles at police in riot gear. Show of support: Former U.S. Marine Jason Washburn joins a demonstration by Occupy Philly at Dilworth Plaza, in Philadelphia, on Sunday in defiance of the city's 5pm eviction order . An uneasy peace: There were no reports of violence as the demonstrations continued after the Philly deadline . Awaiting orders: Officers in Philadelphia after the deadline had passed . Commanders eventually moved the demonstrators back to the City Hall park, telling them they would not be arrested there. In time for the commuter frenzy, police cars began to leave and traffic was able to move along the streets. Commander Smith said they won't raid the camp anytime soon but he hopes about 200 protesters will remain calm . through the morning. Prior to the eviction deadline, Mayor . Antonio Villaraigosa said the grounds would be closed after it had . passed and protestors would be moved along. But in a statement issued shortly before midnight, the mayor said police 'will allow campers ample time to remove their belongings peacefully and without disruption'. Villaraigosa said police and social workers will walk through the park handing out information on the closure and services available, and expressed hope it would happen in a 'spirit of cooperation'. United front: Members of the Occupy Philly chant their slogans . Taking precautions: The food tent comes down at the Los Angeles camp outside city hall on Sunday . But many, including the protest's . chief organisers, said they had no intention of cooperating, and only a . handful of campers cleared out over the weekend. The passing of the LA eviction deadline follows a tense stand-off in Philadelphia last night between Occupy protesters who had formed a human wall and police, after the 5pm deadline to leave the Dilworth Plaza site had passed. Around 50 defiant protesters linked arms at the entrance of the plaza where they have camped for two months. The deadline passed without scuffles or arrests. Occupy Philadelphia has managed to avoid . aggressive confrontations so far, and on Sunday night there was hope the . City of Brotherly Love would continue to be largely violence-free. In Los Angeles, meanwhile, protesters planned for their midnight deadline to abandon their encampment by holding an 'eviction block party.' Nearly 45 minutes after the 5pm deadline in Philly, Police Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said: 'Right now, we have a peaceful . demonstration.' The big clean-up: A protester packs up her stuff ahead of the 12.01am deadline in LA . Defiant: While some packed in LA, many stayed and braced themselves for eviction . A police presence was heavier than usual but no orders to leave had been issued as midnight approached. The . mood was upbeat in the hours before the evening deadline, with groups . playing music and singing hymns. A few dozen tents remained scattered on . the plaza, along with trash, piles of dirty blankets and numerous signs . reading, 'You can't evict an idea.' 'We . can definitely claim a victory,' said Mike Yaroschuk, who was in the . process of dismantling his tent. 'We've opened a lot of minds, hearts . and eyes.' Yaroschuk said he . was leaving the plaza not because of the city-issued deadline but . because of a request by unions whose workers will be involved in the . long-planned construction project there in the coming weeks. He . said Occupy's efforts to draw attention to economic inequality and . corporate influence on government were more important than its physical . location. 'This place is not a key battle for me ... this is a marathon, not a sprint,' he said. Waiting game: Protesters plan to party and put out Facebook fliers for others to join them . Although city officials in LA had . told demonstrators they must leave the weeks-old protest site and take . their nearly 500 tents with them by 12.01am this morning, just a handful . were seen packing up Sunday. Instead, some passed out fliers . containing the city seal and the words: 'By order of Mayor Antonio . Villaraigosa, this notice terminates your tenancy and requires you to . attend the Occupy L.A. Eviction Block Party,' which the fliers' said was . scheduled for 12.01am. Los . Angeles protester Brian Masterson said: 'The best way to keep a . non-violent movement non-violent is to throw a party, and keep it . festive and atmospheric. Speaking as he helped a friend break down her tent, he said: 'I'm going to be doing as much as I can to stop violence. 'We can't beat the LAPD, but we can make it difficult for them to do their job, and have fun while we're doing it.' He said he had turned his own tent into a 'non-violent booby trap' by filling it with sandbags to make it tough to tear down. Let's get outta here: Two men remove their belongongs after two months at LA City Hall . Standing firm: The scene at the LA encampment late Sunday afternoon . The atmosphere was festive on Sunday afternoon with a punk-pop band playing protest songs on one of the lawns. The protest's artists were out in . great numbers showing their work, and twice the usual number of news . trucks surrounded the tent city. Conservative . blogger Andrew Breitbart drew a crowd as he stood on the City Hall . steps and argued with protesters on topics like Bank of America and . Warren Buffett. Some campers packed up their tents and belongings Sunday to avoid police trouble, but said they intended to return without them in support of their fellow protesters. 'I would prefer not to take the tent down,' said Tiffany Wallace as she packed up. 'But we need to be strategic for this movement to last.

But the letters she claimed were from her GP and employer explaining why she was not at the hearings were less than convincing. The note said to be from Dr Johal had no letterhead, was clumsily written in capitals and, most obviously, was littered with spelling mistakes – such as, ‘Majistrate’ and ‘A,E’.

One of the three U.S. university students accused of throwing Molotov cocktails during the protests in Tahrir Square has worked for a Republican congressman, it has emerged. Derrick Sweeney, 19, initially worked on Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008, but switched allegiances and interned this year with Blaine Luetkemeyer in Washington. The Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri, was arrested alongside two friends on the roof of a university building - where they were allegedly throwing firebombs at security forces fighting with protesters below. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Detained: Gregory Porter, 19, Luke Gates, 21, and Derrik Sweeney, 19, are still being detained by Egyptian authorities . Sources in the congressman's office . said he was a 'hard worker' and 'nice', his typical duties included . answering phones and attending meetings, and he worked there from February to May. Gregory Porter, 19, a Drexel . University student from from Glenside, Pennsylvania; and Luke Gates, 21, . an Indiana University student from Bloomington, Indiana, were also . detained. The three were studying at American University in Cairo for a semester to improve their Arabic language skills. Officials at all four universities involved said they are working with the US State Department and the Egyptian government to get the Americans released. Video footage taken from the protests in Cairo shows at least two of the students, their faces covered by bandanas, taking part alongside the Egyptians. Mr Gates, the oldest of the captured students, had been sending Tweets from Cairo about attending the massive rallies. Intern: Derrick Sweeney worked in congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer's (pictured) office in Washington . 'Earlier tonight rubber bullets a charge and then a retreat, my knee and elbow are f***** up,' he wrote two days ago. The Twitter messages are erratic, but . numerous. At one point, Mr Gates Tweets: 'I am a world citizen. Can I . renounce my US citizenship on Twitter? haha' 'Honestly, hopefully I die here,' he says later. Tens of thousands of Egyptian . protesters have filled iconic Tahrir Square and clashed with police, . demanding the country's interim Egyptian rulers hand over power to a . civilian government. Based on his Twitter activity, it . appears Mr Gates, at least, willingly got involved in the protests. Mr . Sweeney's mother, Joy, told CNN that she cannot believe the accusations . against her son. 'He's a strong believer in democracy and . the right to it,' she said. 'But I don't believe he would be involved . with intentionally harming anyone.' She described her son as a principled . person who stands up for his beliefs, and that he had attended previous . protests but stopped after a demonstration where dozens were killed. He . had assured his family the violence wasn't near him and he was safe. She said: 'He got caught up in the whole college-change-the-world mentality, and he believes in democracy strongly.' But she also said her son was the family peacemaker when siblings fought and she couldn't see him acting violently. Arrested: Luke Gates (left) goes to Indiana University and is a native of Bloomington, Indiana, while Derrik Sweeney (right) is a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri . Working for his release: Gregory Porter, 19, attends Drexel University in Philadelphia and is from Glenside, Pennsylvania . She added: 'I don't believe that he would intentionally throw a bomb at anyone. I don't believe that.' The video footage shows the three young men standing against a wall looking into the camera. In front of them, plastic bottles that appear to be filled with liquid sit on a table. 'The three boys were throwing Molotov cocktails and had no passports on them when they were picked up,' Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor, said. He said they will face interrogation by police, though they are being allowed access to State Department officials. They were being held at a courthouse in Cairo as night fell in the country, family members said. 'I suspect that being with a bunch of Egyptian students he probably got caught up in something.

The 'greening' of the Arctic could be less to do with global warming - and more to do with rodents long-rumoured to harbour suicidal tendencies. Scientists have found that the 'greening' of the Arctic many not be solely caused by global warming, as previously believed, but the environmental impact of lemmings, whose presence causes lichens to be replaced by grasses and sedge. Scientists still do not know what the net effects of this greening might be on climate - and fear greenhouse gas being released . by  bacteria responsible for plant decomposition. Unsung heroes? A U.S. study found that when lemmings are absent, the Arctic tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss . A US study found that when lemmings are absent, the Arctic tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss. Where lemmings live, on the other hand, there is a surprising increase in grass and sedge. As well as providing the animals with food, the plants do act as an important 'sink', soaking up carbon from the atmosphere. One reason for the trend may be the waste products of large numbers of lemmings fertilising the soil, say the researchers. But that in itself may have unpredictable 'feedback' effects. Warmer temperatures are themselves promoting the growth of grasses and shrubs which are helping to make large areas of the Arctic more habitable. To study the effects of lemming populations on Arctic ecosystems scientists measured plant cover and biomass on sites in the coastal tundra near Barrow, Alaska, pictured . Dr David Johnson, from the University of Texas at El Paso, lead author of the study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, said: 'Our paper confirms that we really need to be careful attributing the greening of the Arctic to global warming alone. 'We have shown that lemmings can promote similar greening, through the increase of grasses and sedges, as warming does in Arctic regions where lemmings are present and go through dramatic population cycles. 'We still don't know the relative magnitude of these two feedbacks to warming. A greener landscape may maintain the region as a carbon sink, however higher plant growth in a greener landscape may not be enough to offset losses of carbon from soil microbes. 'It is plausible that herbivores, in some situations, may provide a mechanism for higher plant growth maintaining these ecosystems as carbon sinks.' Lemming populations are known to go through historic high and low periods, but their declines are not due to 'mass suicides' which are a myth. In reality lemmings migrate in large numbers when their population density becomes too great. Some fail to survive the perils of the journey, such as crossing wide rivers. To study the effects of lemming populations on Arctic ecosystems, the scientists measured plant cover and biomass on sites in the coastal tundra near Barrow, Alaska.","'Greening' of Arctic not caused by warming, but by lemmings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:10 PM on 28th November 2011 . Christopher Jefferies: The former teacher, pictured arriving at the inquiry today, felt he was subjected to 'house arrest' because of the media . The retired teacher wrongly arrested for killing Joanna Yeates today told the Leveson Inquiry that he was told to change his appearance to avoid media interest. Despite being absolved of any wrongdoing, Christopher Jefferies said he was 'effectively under house arrest' during a Press 'witch hunt'. He eventually brought legal proceedings against eight newspapers, and told the inquiry into media standards today that he felt the Press Complaints Commission was 'wholly inadequate' in controlling the excesses of the Press. Singer Charlotte Church also appeared at the inquiry today, and said she had waived a £100,000 fee to perform at Rupert Murdoch's wedding in return for favourable coverage in his newspapers. Mr Jefferies, who was the landlord of architect Joanna, was arrested on December 30 last year, five days after she was found dead. He was released two days later, and on March 4 police confirmed he was no longer a suspect. Joanna's neighbour Vincent Tabak was found guilty of her murder last month, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This morning Mr Jefferies told the Leveson Inquiry: 'Because the media interest was so enormous I was very strongly advised both by friends and lawyers not to go out. 'And in any case, if it had been apparent where I was staying, these friends would have been besieged by reporters and photographers. 'For a period after I was released I was effectively under house arrest and went from friends to friends - rather as if I were a recusant priest at the time of the Reformation I suppose, going from safe house to safe house.' Mr Jefferies said that after his release from custody it was suggested it would be good for his 'psychological health' if he did not read the press coverage in detail, and he had only started doing so after libel action was started against several publications. He told the inquiry that he brought legal proceedings against eight newspapers concerning 40 different articles. The Attorney General brought contempt of court proceedings in relation to three articles. The former English teacher, who taught at Clifton College in Bristol, said in his witness statement: 'I can see now that, following my arrest, the national media shamelessly vilified me. 'The Press set about what can only be described as a witch hunt.' Joanna Yeates: Mr Jefferies was wrongly accused of involvement with his tenant's death . Mr Jefferies said that having his photograph on the front page of a number of papers had made him 'instantly recognisable'. 'I had a distinctive appearance and it was as a result of the entire world knowing what I look like that it was suggested to me that I ought to change my appearance so that I would not be instantly recognisable and potentially harassed by the media,' he said. Robert Jay QC, counsel for the inquiry, asked Mr Jefferies about when he was referred to as a 'sexually perverted voyeur'. He replied: 'It was suggested there may have been some sort of sexual motive to the murder of Jo Yeates and at that time I was obviously a suspect of that murder. 'On the other hand it was suggested in some articles that I was gay, so that created a problem as far as that was concerned. 'It was then suggested in another article that I was bisexual - so the press were trying to have it every possible way.' Around the time of his arrest, a number of defamatory articles appeared in the press, Mr Jefferies added. Headlines included 'The Strange Mr Jefferies', 'Jo Suspect Peeping Tom', 'Jo Suspect Scared Kids' and 'Was Killer Waiting in Jo's Flat?' The inquiry heard that the retired teacher was contacted by the PCC about what could be done to prevent a recurrence of what had happened to him. Reading from his reply, he said any redress the PCC may have given would have been 'wholly inadequate'. 'It is no wonder that the PCC is held in such low esteem,' he wrote to the body. 'Indeed, I would suggest that the shocking and reckless irresponsibility displayed by sections of the media is in part attributable to the failure of the current regulatory system and the weakness of the voluntary code of practice.' Mr Jefferies insisted that what had happened to him would continue to have an impact on his life. 'I suppose it is true to say there will always be people who don't know me, people who don't know anybody that I know, who will retain the impression that I am some sort of very weird character indeed who is probably best avoided,' he said. 'I will never fully recover from the events of last year. The incalculable effect of what was written about me by these highly influential tabloid newspapers is something from which it will be difficult ever to escape.' Charlotte Church: The singer waived a £100,000 fee in exchange for good publicity from Rupert Murdoch's newspapers . Witness: Ms Church leaving the inquiry with her legal team this afternoon . During her appearance this afternoon, Charlotte Church told the Leveson Inquiry she was asked to sing at Rupert Murdoch's wedding to Wendi Deng in 1999. In a statement she said she was offered a fee of £100,000, but was told if she waived it she 'would be looked upon favourably by Mr Murdoch's papers'. The inquiry heard News International denied the offer was made but Ms Church today said: 'I remember being told that Rupert Murdoch had asked me to sing at his wedding to Wendi Deng and it would take place on his yacht in New York. 'I remember being told that the offer of money or the offer of the favour, in order to basically get good press, to be looked upon favourably. 'And I also remember being 13 and thinking, ""Why on earth would anybody take a favour over £100,000?""' She said she and her mother were both quite 'resolute' about accepting the money, but were urged by her management and figures from the record company into taking the option of the favour from a 'powerful man' like Mr Murdoch. The inquiry heard it was later claimed her performance was organised as a surprise for Mr Murdoch, but Ms Church said she understood the request to be specifically from him: 'I had been told by my management that he had specifically asked for me to sing Pie Jesu.' She said she had raised the issue that it was a requiem - a funeral song - but was told Mr Murdoch specifically wanted it performed. In her witness statement, she said that accepting the waiver 'failed', adding: 'In fact Mr Murdoch's newspapers have since been some of the worst offenders, so much that I have sometimes felt that there has actually been a deliberate agenda. 'While newspapers such as Mr Murdoch's have not helped my career, they certainly damaged it. 'I do of course accept television and radio have been very significant contributors to my success. I have little complaint at the contact of those media organisations or the people they employ.' Ms Church also described a 'shadow network' of staff at hotels, restaurants and airlines who tip off journalists about her movements.","Christopher Jefferies was 'effectively under house arrest' after being released by police .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:59 PM on 29th November 2011 . This satellite image shows the devastation caused by a mysterious blast at an Iranian missile base earlier this month. Its buildings are destroyed, mountains of debris are scattered in courtyards and roads are severely damaged. Iranian authorities claimed the November 12 explosion, which killed 17 at the Revolutionary Guard compound 25 miles east of the capital of Tehran, was caused by 'an accident' when ammunition was being moved. Devastated: This satellite image shows the destruction caused by the November 12 blast . Before: This is the missile base pictured before it was devastated in a blast on November 12 . But the death of Brigadier General Hassan Moghaddam, a senior commander of the country's missile development programme, prompted speculation that Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved. Now, with a further blast yesterday in the western city of Isfahan, observers are questioning the competence of those in charge of the country's missile programme. And they have said the lack of information coming from Iran is doing nothing to clarify their concerns. A Washington-based research group released the satellite image today, which clearly shows the facility has been all but destroyed, but said it did not provide any clue as to what caused the explosion. Questions: The western city of Isfahan was rocked yesterday by another explosion, but officials denied it was anything to do with the Uranium Conversion Facility (pictured here) which is just outside the city . Denial: The explosion was due to a military drill, officials said, and not related to Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility (pictured here) Paul Brannan, senior analyst for the Institute for Science and International Security, said it was 'impossible to tell' whether the blast had been caused by sabtoage. But he did say that, when performing work with missiles, there are a variety of 'volatile processes' that could cause an explosion. And he revealed the Institute for Science and International Security had received intelligence from 'knowledgable officials' that the blast occurred as Iran had achieved a milestone in the development of a new missile. They believed staff could have been performing a 'volatile procedure involving a missile engine at the site.' That blast was the latest 'disaster' to hit Iran's nuclear programme in the last two years. In 2010, 18 people were killed after an explosion at a base which housed Shahab-3 long-range missiles. It was also put down to a fire in an ammunition depot. And it came a week after the release of an International Atomic Energy Agency report that renewed calls inside Israel for a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. It focused partly on efforts allegedly being made to fit such a warhead on a missile, and claimed Iran has been working to acquire equipment and weapons design information, testing high explosives and detonators and developing compute models of a warhead’s core. On Monday, just two weeks after the blast detailed in the satellite image, the western city of Isfahan was also rocked by an explosion. The semi-official Fars news agency reported it was heard in several parts of the city, with residents saying their windows shook from its force. But Iranian authorities put it down to a military drill, denying it was somehow related to the nearby nuclear facility, which is regularly monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. An Iranian official said: 'There is no such thing, the blast was entirely from the military maneuver.'

"By . Louise Eccles . Last updated at 10:54 AM on 29th November 2011 . Rugby ace Mike Tindall's appeal against a £25,000 RFU fine has been successful, it has been reported . Shamed rugby star Mike Tindall was reinstated to the England rugby squad because he can't remember his raucous World Cup drinking session, it emerged today. The husband of the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, went on a drunken night out in New Zealand after England's disappointing World Cup opener against Argentina in September. But after being dropped form the Elite Playing Squad, England bosses made a dramatic U-turn in admitting Tindall's memory loss was a 'mitigating factor' in reinstating him. RFU chiefs have also cut Tindall's fine from £25,000 to £15,000 after the 33-year-old appealed. Explaining the decision, RFU chief executive Martyn Thomas said: ‘Mike did not intentionally mislead the RFU team management when he stated that he could not remember where he was on the night of September 11, and that he was relying on other people’s versions of events which were relayed to him.' Newly-wed Tindall downed cut-price shots at a ‘dwarf-tossing’ competition with fellow players and cavorted with a glamorous former girlfriend. Afterwards Rob Andrew, director of the Rugby Football Union elite squad, warned that his behaviour would ‘not be tolerated’ and he was thrown off the team, effectively ending his international career. But yesterday, the player won his appeal against the decision and was allowed back on to the elite squad. In his appeal, Tindall claimed that there were no protocols on the night in question, including no ban on alcohol or curfew. The Rugby Players’ Association backed the 33-year-old and described the punishment  as ‘extraordinary’ and ‘unprecedented’. His reinstatement is largely symbolic because the squad disbands at the end of the year ready for a new one to be announced for 2012. However, he could now potentially be selected for future international matches. Tindall, who married world champion eventer Zara Phillips in July, had heaped embarrassment on his bride after he was seen embracing the woman later revealed as his ex-girlfriend  Jessica Palmer. Tindall with his wife, Zara Philips, who is the Queen's granddaughter . At the time of his punishment, Tindall’s father Phil insisted he had been made a ‘scapegoat’ because of his connection to the Royal Family. But the RFU accused Tindall of breaching the England elite player squad agreement. Mr Andrew was even more scathing. ‘Mike Tindall’s actions reached a level of misconduct that was unacceptable in a senior England player,’ he said. RFU chief executive Martyn Thomas added: ‘There was no evidence of any suggestion of sexual impropriety of any nature with the woman in question, and we accept the fact that she is a family friend who he has known for a long time. ‘Mike expressed deep regret during the appeal meeting about his behaviour, and that he had apologised to [then England manager] Martin Johnson and the team for the events which unfolded as a consequence.’ However, he added that  Tindall’s behaviour ‘fell way below that to be expected of somebody of his calibre and experience’. The Gloucester player had, he said, ‘exposed himself to a very compromising position and exposed the rest of the team to damaging publicity’.","RFU chiefs also cut his fine from £25,000 to £15,000 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 6:22 PM on 29th November 2011 . He has successfully evaded capture for nearly three months while trekking 730 miles across mountains, deserts and highways. But, for once, this is not the case of the fugitive gunman doing his utmost to escape the police. It is the journey of a lovesick wolf who has become a media and internet celebrity in America during his epic search for a mate - taking him across most of Oregon despite a 'dead or alive' bounty on his head. Path of true love: The wolf has traipsed more than 700miles across Oregon's rugged terrain and highways in search of a mate . In the dock: Wolves from the Imnaha pack on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest in northeastern Oregon. A two-year-old left the pack shortly before the others were issued with a death warrant for killing cattle . He left his home on September 10 just before state officials served a death warrant on members of his pack for killing cattle. And while some have grown fond of his antics, it is feared he will be targeted by poachers or government hunters. OR-7, as he has been unlovingly dubbed, captured the imagination of Americans after the conservation group Oregon Wild mapped his journey on its website and Facebook page. They have begun a competition to give the wolf a name - hoping it will make him too famous to shoot. One entry came up with: 'Whoseafraida'. But some are not so keen. Cattle rancher Nathan Jackson, who ranches near Upper Klamath Lake, said: 'In this country, we worked really hard to exterminate wolves 50 years ago or so, and there was a reason. 'A lot of people who don't have a direct tie to the agricultural community tend to view wolves as majestic, beautiful creatures. They don't seem so majestic and beautiful when they are ripping apart calves and colts.' Keeping an eye out: Russ Morgan, a wolf co-ordinator for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, with a female wolf pup just fitted with a radio collar - as was OR-7, which has enabled officials to track its movements . Last February, OR-7 was in a snowy . canyon in north-eastern Oregon when a state biologist shot him with a . tranquilizer dart from a helicopter before fitting him with a tracking . collar and blue ear tags. Officials . have been able to chart his journey from GPS positions transmitted from . the collar. They show he has traveled 730 miles on his meandering . route, getting as far as 320 miles from home. Each time he enters a new . area, he makes it onto the local news. OR-7 set out on his trek just before . state wildlife officials issued a death warrant for members of his . Imnaha pack for killing cattle. The . kill order specifically mentions OR-7's father, the alpha male, and one . younger wolf with no collar. Since OR-7 and two siblings took off that . would leave his mother and one pup. The . department reports a government hunter had a shot, but missed and did . not get another before conservation groups won a stay of the kill order . while their legal challenge is settled by the Oregon Court of Appeals. Tough trek: The wolf climbed up into Oregon's Cascade Mountains (pictured) on his journey. At one point, a hunter shot at him, but missed . Wolves started moving into Oregon from Idaho in the late 1990s from packs introduced into the Northern Rockies as part of a federal endangered species restoration program. From trail cameras, radio tracking collar data and sightings, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife figures the state has at least 23 wolves. All four packs are in the north-eastern corner of the state. Two produced pups this year. Federal protection for wolves was lifted in Eastern Oregon, but they remain under state protection. West of Interstate 97, they are back under federal protection. Most of the wanderers become 'biological dead ends', but even if OR-7 dies alone, the trail of scent posts he has left will be followed by others. Wolves typically strike out on their own when they reach two years old to look for a mate and empty territory they can call their own. Once in the Cascade Range, OR-7 meandered through the Rogue-Umpqua Divide, where Oregon's last known wolf was shot by a bounty hunter in 1946. He skirted Crater Lake National Park and dropped down to the flatlands near Upper Klamath Lake, climbed back up in the Cascades, and crossed over the crest south of Mount McLaughlin, a snow-capped volcano visible from Interstate 5. So far there have been no reports of cattle killing along his path. Russ Morgan, the wolf co-ordinator for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, has been surprised by the way the public has embraced the wandering wolf. He said: 'With all that's going on right now with management of wolves in Oregon, this is kind of a different side that people across the state have taken a shine to.' OR-7's travels are not unusual, said Ed Bangs, the retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wolf co-ordinator for the Northern Rockies. A female from Montana headed south through Wyoming, crossed southeastern Idaho, dropped down to Utah, crossed northern Colorado, and headed back up to Wyoming, where she ate poison and died.","Fled home in north-east Oregon in September before state officials arrived to cull pack .

Footballer Joey Barton was at the centre of controversy today over comments he made on Twitter about the death of Gary Speed, describing suicide as a 'selfish' act. Despite an outcry from other users on the social networking site, the QPR captain has refused to apologise for his 'insensitive' comments. Welsh football legend Gary Speed was tragically found hanged at his home on Sunday morning in what is thought to have been suicide. Like countless others, Barton took to Twitter to speak of his shock at Speed's death and to pay tribute to him. He posted: 'Just hearing about Gary Speed, to say am shocked is an understatement. 'My thoughts are with his family and friends. Really sad news.' However, his tributes were then swiftly followed - with astonishingly tactless timing - by his views on suicide. The outspoken footballer added: 'Suicide is a mix of the most tragic, most selfish, most terrible (and I want to believe preventable) acts out there.' As Twitter users bombarded Barton in an online backlash, the star - unrepentant - branded his critics as having 'half a brain' instead of apologising for his offensive comments.

It may be 65 years old but classic It's A Wonderful Life has beaten all its modern rivals to be nominated Britain's favourite Christmas film.

A paedophile who posed as a gay 14-year-old girl to entice children to perform sex acts in front of a web camera has been jailed for almost seven years. Father-of-two Barry McCluskey, 40, pleaded guilty to 49 charges including lewd and libidinous behaviour. The offences were committed between March 2003 and August last year at locations in Glasgow. The former nurse often used the pseudonym 'Clare' when he contacted children, whose ages ranged between nine and 15, via online instant messenger services. Jailed: Father-of-three Barry McCluskey posed as a gay 14-year-old girl to entice children to perform sex acts in front of a web camera . In one instance he asked a 14-year-old girl to rub her naked breasts and bend over in front of the webcam while wearing grey knee-high socks. He told one girl: 'Three more videos, then I am out of your life forever.' He often blackmailed the children, telling them he would distribute the videos of them, or even commit suicide, if they did not do as he said. McCluskey was arrested after police found him on Glasgow's Erskine Bridge, apparently contemplating suicide. McCluskey also admitted two charges of surreptitiously following schoolgirls and filming up their skirts, as well as filming women and children in public changing rooms. Sentencing him today at the High Court in Glasgow, temporary Judge Rita Rae said McCluskey's actions were 'depraved' and that the case should act as a warning to parents who allow their children full access to the internet. She noted that in one case McCluskey would not leave one of his victims alone even after she pleaded with him that her mother was dying of cancer. The girl told McCluskey that she would kill herself if her mother found out. Judge Rae sentenced him to a total of six years and eight months, which will be backdated to November 1 last year when he was first taken into custody. She also imposed a lifelong restriction order on him, meaning he will be monitored after his release and can be returned to custody if a judge orders it.","Warped Barry McCluskey, 40, jailed for almost seven years .

Intimate details of the affair between a married MP and his blonde Russian researcher were exposed last night as she was cleared of spying for Moscow. In her diary, Ekaterina Zatuliveter, then 20, described her love for 'her darling Teddy Bear' Mike Hancock, who is 40 years her senior. She wrote of her desire to feel him 'with all my naked body', and nicknamed the Liberal Democrat her 'King Louis', thought to be a reference to the ape from Disney's The Jungle Book. Success: Miss Zatuliveter, 26, smiles with flowers outside the Immigration . Commission hearing today where she won her case against deportation . Details from the diary proved crucial . in convincing the tribunal that she was not a honeytrap sent to access . defence secrets while working in the Portsmouth MP's Parliamentary . office, as MI5 claimed. The Special Immigration Appeals . Commission described the diary as 'compelling' evidence of her innocence . and concluded the pair's four-year liaison was 'enduring and genuine on . both sides'. The panel said: 'However odd it might seem, she fell for him.' Appeal: Katia Zatuliveter told a hearing her affair with MP Mike Hancock was based on love, not espionage . Last night Miss Zatuliveter admitted . she was 'surprised' to win her case and accused the security services of . being 'unprofessional and paranoid'. She added: 'I went through an . extremely unfair process. If I can describe it in war terms it would be . me on a horse with a sword against tanks and aircraft.' And she confessed she felt she had no choice but to reveal intimate details of her private life to prove she wasn't a spy. She said: 'I had two options. I would . be forever branded a spy, but will be  able to keep my private life . private; or I had to give all of this out to the press and to the public . but be able to prove that I am not spy. 'And for me, it was more important to prove that I am not a spy.' The former international relations . student was arrested last year as the Government sought to deport her to . Russia, claiming her presence was a threat to national security. The 26-year-old, known as Katia, was . accused of seducing Mr Hancock, who has been married to his wife . Jacqueline for more than 40 years. Government lawyers pointed to a string . of affairs she had with older men in sensitive positions, including a . Nato official and a Dutch diplomat. The journal emerged at the start of . the tribunal – despite Miss Zatuliveter's claim in her first witness . statement that she had never kept a diary. It purported to cover a period from November 2004 to April 2007, including the start of the affair with Mr Hancock in 2006. She wrote of clashes with her sister Polina who told her she was 'wasting her youth on an older man'. The panel said the diary showed Miss . Zatuliveter to be an 'immature, calculating, emotional and self-centred . young woman'. In it she describes four men she wishes to date as . potential 'victims'. In April 2006, she wrote: 'Mike Hancock, MP wants both to help me and to sleep with me. True love: Miss Zatuliveter, 26, wrote in . her diary like a 'love-struck teenager' after meeting 65-year-old . Liberal MP Mike Hancock, right, at a conference in St Petersburg in . 2006, the hearing heard . 'He offered me to go with him to Strasbourg at the end of June. I said yes. Is there any danger in it?' Then in June, after the affair began, she wrote: 'I am in love... And he's gone to Iraq today. 'I worry a lot, don't know what to do, . what to do with myself. Yes, he had told me that most probably he won't . be able to either call or to write me. 'I wish there were at least some news. I stay at home all day. What if he calls me? My darling Teddy Bear.

Let the moment of our next meeting come the . soonest possible. I love you, my King Louis!' The tribunal said the entry about Iraq . was a 'revealingly false statement'. While Miss Zatuliveter thought Mr . Hancock was in Iraq on a committee visit, he was actually in Paris. The . panel, chaired by Mr Justice Mitting, accepted this could be a . 'subsequent fabrication' but concluded Mr Hancock had lied to her. Their ruling states: 'The picture . painted by the diary entries is inconsistent with the Security Service's . assessment that she was, most likely, tasked actively to pursue the . offer of a relationship with Mr Hancock. 'The most likely explanation, and one . which we find to be proved on the balance of probabilities, is that, . however odd it might seem, she fell for him.' Last night security officials insisted . they were not in any way 'embarrassed' by the ruling and insisted their . identification of Miss Zatuliveter as a potential threat to national . security was correct. The ruling said: 'We are satisfied that it is significantly more likely than not that she was and is not a Russian agent.' However, it added: 'We cannot exclude . the possibility that we have been gulled – but, if we have been, it has . been by a supremely competent and rigorously trained operative.'

For the 45-year-old bus driver is a one-man time-warp from the 1930s. His clothes and semi-detached home are all in keeping with his obsession with Britain on the eve of World War II. A vintage telephone stands on the hall . table beside an exquisite art deco lamp, just a foretaste to the living . room that’s packed with mirrors, clocks, ornaments and picture frames . from the era. Houseproud: Michael relaxes by the wireless in his front room as neighbour Pam tries out the 1938 Hoover . All mod cons: Left; a dial telephone would have been the latest thing . and the lamp the height of fashion and There’s a copy of his favourite . paper on the chair and right; a jumble of 1930s wooden-shafted golf . clubs, straw boaters, a metal RAF case, leather suitcases . . . and even . a banjo . Mr McTigue is never seen wearing anything out of keeping with his favourite era — except in the cab of his bus. He doesn’t own a washing machine and instead laborious scrubs his clothes outside in a dolly tub then squeezes them through a mangle. His Hoover dates from 1938. ‘I’m really a time traveller who lost his way,’ he says. ‘But I’m 45, so it’s too late to change now! I just love the era, it was a much simpler time.’ Mr McTigue’s home, in Riddleton, West Yorks, was unmodernised when he bought it seven years ago — the couple who had owned it since it was built in 1936 had lived there for more than 50 years. Since then he has set about collecting suitable antiques, old newspapers and knick-knacks from car-boot sales. He . says: ‘My clothes are from the era, too. But as I’m 6ft 4in I’ve had to . get most of them tailor-made using authentic materials, as there . weren’t many people my height in the 1930s,’ he explains. Squeezy does it: Hand-scrubbed clothes are wrung through the mangle before being hung out to dry . Mr McTigue’s favourite period is 1939 and the early months of the war. He and a group of fellow enthusiasts, including neighbour Pam Robinson, gather for soirees and even stage re-enactments of Home Guard exercises. Antique wirelesses and gramophones are dotted about the house, playing 78s by Thirties bandleaders such as Geraldo and Ambrose. Mr McTigue does, however, have a refrigerator and a television — albeit a black-and-white model made in 1947. ‘People think I’m a lunatic, but it’s just my passion,’ he adds.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:57 AM on 30th November 2011 . U.S. home prices are falling again in most major cities after posting small gains over the summer and spring. As of the third quarter of 2011, average home prices across the U.S. are back at their early 2003 levels, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index. The report, issued today, shows prices dropped in September from August in 17 of the 20 cities tracked. That was the first decline after five straight months in which at least half the cities in the survey showed monthly gains, suggesting the troubled housing market remains weak and won't recover any time soon. Housing troubles: A 'For Sale' sign standing outside of a Denver home indicates the asking price has been reduced amid new lows in major cities across the U.S. A separate index for the July-September quarter shows prices were mostly unchanged from the previous quarter. Americans are reluctant to purchase a home more than two years after the recession officially ended. High unemployment and weak job growth have deterred many would-be buyers. Even the lowest mortgage rates in history haven't been enough to lift sales. David M Blitzer, chairman of S&P's index committee, said that while the steep price declines seen between 2007 and 2009 appear to be over, home prices are down from the same time last year and do not show signs of easing. 'Any chance for a sustained recovery will probably need a stronger economy,' Mr Blitzer said. The largest monthly price declines . were in Atlanta, San Francisco and Tampa, Florida. And prices in . Atlanta, Las Vegas and Phoenix fell to their lowest points since the . housing crisis began four years ago. Mr Blitzer called the new lows . reached in those three cities a 'bit disturbing'. New York, Portland, Oregon, and Washington were the only cities to show monthly price increases in September. A majority of the cities tracked by the . survey posted modest price increases from April through August, the peak . buying months. The monthly changes are not adjusted for seasonal . factors. Data: As of the third quarter of 2011, average home prices across the U.S. are back at their early 2003 levels, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index . Even with the gains, home prices were down in all but two major cities in September from the same month one year ago. Sales of previously occupied homes are on pace to match last year's dismal figures — the worst in 14 years. And sales of new homes are shaping up to be the worst since the government began keeping records a half century ago. Some people can't qualify for loans or meet higher down payment requirements. Many with good credit and stable jobs are holding off because they fear that prices will keep falling, according to Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.com, which measures home values. 'Despite record high affordability of . real estate, the psychology of home buyers is still being weighed down . by economic uncertainty, keeping them on the fence when it comes to . buying homes,' he said. Atlanta . has been especially hard hit in the past year. Prices there dropped . nearly six per cent in September and have fallen nearly 10 per cent over . the past 12 months. Plummeting: The table above summarises The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices results for September 2011, indicating that Atlanta, Las Vegas and Phoenix posted record index lows for the month . Since the fall of 2008, one out of every four sales in Atlanta has been a foreclosure, an auction or a bank sale. Many homes there were built during the housing boom. The city has also been confronted by high unemployment. In September, the unemployment rate was 10.3 per cent — more than a point higher than the national average. The Case-Shiller index covers half of all U.S. homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The September data is the latest available. Prices are certain to fall further once banks resume millions of foreclosures. They have been delayed because of a yearlong government investigation into mortgage lending practices. Home prices had stabilised in coastal cities over the past six months, helped by a rush of spring buyers and investors. But this year, prices in many cities, including Cleveland, Detroit, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tampa, have reached their lowest points since the housing bust more than four years ago. Foreclosures and short sales — when a lender accepts less for a home than what is owed on a mortgage — are selling at an average discount of 20 per cent.","Prices dropped in September from August in 17 of the 20 cities surveyed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:50 AM on 29th November 2011 . Pakistan will boycott a vital international conference on the future of Afghanistan next month, it emerged today. The move is a protest against the Nato air-strikes that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at the weekend in an apparent case of mistaken identity. A government official told the AFP news agency: 'The cabinet has decided not to attend the Bonn meeting.' Pakistan's attendance at the conference had been considered essential to ensure stability in the region stands a chance. Scroll down for video . Healing process: Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan (left) prays with relatives of Major Mujahid Ali Meerani, who was one of 24 soldiers killed in a Nato attack at the weekend, at his home in Naudero . Protesters burn a U.S. flag in Multan yesterday in response to the Nato air-strikes. It was today claimed that Nato forces may have been lured into attacking friendly Pakistani border posts by the Taliban . Meanwhile, preliminary U.S. military . reports reveal that Nato forces may have been lured into attacking . friendly Pakistani border posts in a calculated manoeuvre by the . Taliban. The attack - which Pakistan claims went on for almost two hours and continued even after soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop - marked the deadliest friendly fire incident with Pakistan since the Afghanistan war began. A joint U.S.-Afghan patrol was attacked by the Taliban in the early hours of Saturday morning. While . pursuing the Taliban in the poorly-marked border area, the patrol is . said to have mistaken one of the Pakistan troop outposts for a militant . encampment and called in a Nato gunship and attack helicopters to open . fire. U.S. officials, . speaking on condition of anonymity, claim the reports suggest the . Taliban may have deliberately tried to provoke a cross-border fire-fight . that would set back fragile partnerships between the U.S. and Nato . forces and Pakistani soldiers at the ill-defined border. Student protesters shout anti-American slogans during a protest in Peshawar today. There is widespread anger across Pakistan following the air-strikes . The incident has sent the perpetually difficult U.S.-Pakistan relationship into a tailspin. General . James Mattis, head of U.S. Central Command, yesterday announced he has . appointed Brigadier General Stephen Clark, an Air Force special . operations officer, to lead the probe into the incident. Brigadier . General Clark has been ordered to include input from the Nato-led . forces in Afghanistan, as well as representatives from the Afghan and . Pakistani governments. According . to the U.S. military records described to news agency the Associated . Press, the joint U.S. and Afghan patrol requested back-up after being . hit by mortar and small arms fire by Taliban militants. Before . responding, the joint U.S.-Afghan patrol first checked with the . Pakistani army, which reported it had no troops in the area, the . military account said. Some . two hours later, still hunting the insurgents - who had by then . apparently fled in the direction of Pakistani border posts - the U.S. commander spotted what he thought was a militant encampment, with heavy . weapons mounted on tripods. The . joint patrol called for the air-strikes at around 2.21am local time, . not realising the encampment was apparently the Pakistani border post. Heavily guarded: The 24 Pakistani soldiers who were killed in the attacks are buried yesterday . Salute: Pakistani soldiers march among the rows of coffins during yesterday's ceremony . Records show the aerial response included Apache attack helicopters and an AC-130 gunship. U.S. officials are working on the assumption the Taliban chose the location . for the first attack to create confusion and draw U.S. and Pakistani . forces into firing on each other, it is claimed. At . the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama . considers the Pakistani deaths a tragedy, and said the administration is . determined to investigate. The . Pentagon released a four-page memo from General Mattis directing . Brigadier General Clark to determine what happened, which units were . involved, which ones did or did not cross the border, how the operation . was coordinated, and what caused the deaths and injuries. Brigadier . General Clark must also develop recommendations about how border . operations could be improved. His final report must be submitted by . December 23. The details of . the air-strike emerged as aftershocks were last night reverberating . across the U.S. military and diplomatic landscape, threatening . communications and supply lines for the Afghan war and the success of an . upcoming international conference. While . U.S. officials expressed regret and sympathy over the cross-border . incident, they are not acknowledging blame, amid conflicting reports . about who fired first. The . air-strike was politically explosive as well as deadly, coming as U.S. officials were working to repair relations with the Pakistanis after a . series of major setbacks, including the U.S. commando raid into Pakistan . that killed Osama bin Laden in May. Attack: Nato helicopters similar to this one opened fire on the Pakistani army checkpoint close to its border with Afghanistan . In . recent weeks, military leaders had begun expressing some optimism that . U.S.-Pakistan military cooperation along the border was beginning to . improve. Just last Tuesday, . U.S. Army Major General Daniel Allyn told Pentagon reporters that . incidents of firing from Pakistan territory had tapered off somewhat in . recent weeks. Pentagon press secretary George Little last night stressed the need for a strong military relationship with Pakistan. He . said: 'The Pakistani government knows our position on that, and that is . we do regret the loss of life in this incident, and we are . investigating it.' The military fallout began almost immediately. Pakistan . has blocked vital supply routes for U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan and . demanded Washington vacate a base used by American drones. Pakistan . ordered CIA employees to mothball their drone operation at Pakistan's . Shamsi air base within two weeks, a senior Pakistani official said.

Department also issued a new warning for U.S. citizens in Pakistan. It . said all U.S. government personnel working in Pakistan were being . recalled to Islamabad and warned Americans to be on guard for possible . retaliation.

When Mitch Hunter walked down the street, children hid behind their mothers because they were scared of what they saw. On becoming a father himself, he decided to have a face transplant, because he didn’t want his own son to be afraid of him. Mr . Hunter, a former soldier whose face was destroyed saving a woman’s . life, can now smile again, feel the breeze on his face and warmth of his . wife’s kiss. Scroll down for video . New life: Mitch Hunter sits with his son Clayton and girlfriend Katarina following the amazing procedure to rebuilt his face and help him lead a more normal life . And he can walk down the street without children shouting, staring and hiding in fear. Mr Hunter, 30, of Indianapolis, is one of the first people in the world to be given a whole new face. His face was destroyed when, as a young solider, he heroically saved the life of a woman 10 years ago. When . the car he was in smashed into a 10,000 volt electrical pylon, he . pushed the woman, who was also in the crash, out of harm’s way, and . thousands of volts of electricity surged through his body, severely . burning his face. He . then went through at least 20 corrective operations, with skin taken . from his thighs and elsewhere in his body used to patch him up, but the . results were far from satisfactory. The disfigurement scared children and fascinated adults, who stared at him when he ventured outside. He . had no normal sensation in his face and had lost the bulk of his lips . and so his girlfriend Katarina had never kissed him on the lips. The 30-year-old, pictured left as a soldier before the accident which destroyed his face, was left with horrific injuries and needing skin grafts following a car crash in which he saved a woman's life. When he and Katarina had a son, he decided it was finally time to get a new face. He said: ‘I’ve had kids hide and run behind their moms because they were so scared when they saw me. ‘That was hard to cope with because my friends started having kids, then my brother had a kid. ‘Then I had Clayton and I didn’t want kids to be afraid of me any more.’ On . Sunday, BBC2 documentary Frontline Medicine will tell the story of the . 14 hour operation, in which he was given an entire new face, including . eyelids, lips, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power . them and provide sensation. Painstaking . micro-vascular surgery was needed to attach the two main arteries to . the new face, allowing Mr Hunter’s heart to start supplying it with . blood. Getting ready: Dr Donald Annino Jr, right, chats through the marathon procedure with Mr Hunter, left, before he goes under anaesthetic at the Boston hospital . Transformation: Mitch, pictured during the documentary which followed his operation, said he can now feel the breeze on his face and his girlfriend's kiss. Overjoyed: Mr Hunter, pictured with his son Clayton, said he hoped the procedure would transform his life . Five months after the U.S. military-funded operation at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston . and Mr Hunter is starting to see some of his old features starting to . come through as the swelling subsides. His . speech is rapidly improving and he is able to do simple things like . smile, purse his lips and scrunch his eyes. He can feel his son touch . his face and can also do something he couldn’t do even before the . accident - grow a beard. He said: ‘This face is really starting . to feel more and more like mine every day and the sensation that I’ve . gained back is just extraordinary. ‘I . can feel the breeze on my face now. I can feel heat. It’s just amazing . how much sensation I’ve gained back in such a short time.’ Epic: The team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, anaesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace Mr Hunter's face . Permanent reminder: Mitch still has scars on his head following the micro-vascular surgery to rebuild his appearance . Peter Butler, who hopes to carry . out Britain’s first face transplant at London’s Royal Free Hospital, . believes the technique could one day benefit millions around the world. He . said: ‘There are a quarter of a million people in the UK with severe . facial disfigurement for whom reconstructive surgery has not worked. ‘They get stared at and they don’t blend into a crowd.

"Well-educated 24-year-old to represent himself . Flight was about to land in Detroit when accused attempted to detonate device . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 12:03 PM on 4th October 2011 . Pleading not guilty: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is on trial for an alleged bomb plot on a Detroit-bound plane . The trial of an alleged al Qaeda terrorist who tried to destroy a Detroit-bound plane with a bomb hidden in his underwear begins today. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, from Nigeria, was known to have been heavily influenced in his extremist views by the American-born, Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by the CIA in Yemen last week. Abdulmutallab faces eight charges, . including conspiracy to commit terrorism and attempted use of a weapon . of mass destruction. U.S. authorities have accused the 24-year-old of detonating chemicals . in his underwear seven minutes before the flight was to land at . Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Christmas Day 2009. The bomb failed to explode and passengers and crew leapt on Abdulmutallab to stop him. He suffered serious burns to his groin area. Proceedings against Abdulmutallab will open with jury selection. Prosecutors already have his hospital-bed confession, dozens of witnesses, remnants of the explosive and a video of the 24-year-old explaining his suicide mission. He has pleaded not guilty. Abdulmutallab is acting as his own . lawyer. Anthony Chambers, an attorney appointed to assist him, said . al-Awlaki's death might make jury selection more difficult but that it wasn't . relevant to the trial. Abdulmutallab, who is well-educated and comes from an upper-class family, was reportedly convinced by the radicial teachings of al-Awlaki. Campaign of hatred: Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab at an al Qaeda training camp in the desert . One official said the cleric had directed Abdulmutallab to detonate an explosive device over U.S. airspace to maximise the number of casualties. According to prosecutors, the . alleged extremist said he wanted to become a martyr when he boarded . Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam along with 278 other . passengers and 11 crew. He told authorities that he trained in . Yemen, an al Qaeda stronghold in the Arabian Peninsula. He said he was . influenced by the preacher al-Awlaki, who was killed on Friday by an air strike that . President Obama called a 'major blow' to al Qaeda. The failed attack on the Detroit-bound plane two years ago was the first act of terrorism in the U.S. during the Obama administration. A . conviction on multiple charges could bolster the argument that terror . suspects should be prosecuted in civilian courts and not through military . proceedings. Evidence: The syringe detonator said to have been inside Abdulmutallab's underwear. Jurors in his trial will be shown a model of the bomb . Failed: The badly burned underwear Abdulmutallab was wearing on the Christmas Day flight. The bomb failed to detonate, but he was badly burned . Vijay Padmanabhan, a lawyer who has handled cases involving terror-related detainees at Guantanamo Bay, said: 'Convictions that are achieved in . federal court using proper procedures will be upheld on appeal. That's . simply too powerful a tool for the President not to use. 'What people will be looking to see is whether the administration can bring what appears be a fairly straightforward case to fruition.' Patricia 'Scotti' Keepman from Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, was seated several rows behind Abdulmutallab on the flight with her husband, daughter, and two newly adopted children from Ethiopia. Mrs Keepman said: 'He needs to be held accountable in a trial. It's as simple as that.'","Well-educated 24-year-old to represent himself .

"By . James Slack . Last updated at 8:15 AM on 29th November 2011 . Police abandoned the streets to opportunistic looters during the August riots, an inquiry has concluded. By not getting a grip at the outbreak of the violence, officers allowed the impression to take hold that the streets had been surrendered to thousands of yobs. Disturbingly, the report added that unless police improve their response few rule out the prospect of riots in the future. Chaos: A fire rips through a building in Tottenham, north London, during the disorder. The official inquiry into the five days of violence ¿ which cost the country at least £500million ¿ concluded the shameful scenes were not motivated by 'politics' The official inquiry into the five days of violence – which cost the country at least £500million – concluded the shameful scenes were not motivated by ‘politics’. Instead, the rioters’ main objectives were getting their hands on ‘luxury branded goods’ which ‘confer instant status’. The report describes looters queuing up . inside shops to get the best products, trying on trainers in the . wreckage of stores and admitting their motivation was ‘greed’. Trigger: The shooting of father-of-four Mark Duggan sparked rioting which spread across the country . The panel, established by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, concluded: ‘Rioters believed they would be able to loot and damage without being challenged by the police. In the hardest-hit areas, they were correct.’ Labour MPs had claimed the shocking scenes witnessed in August, which included 5,000 crimes and five fatalities, had been sparked by Coalition cuts. But panel member Heather Rabbatts said: ‘These were not riots that were political, these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting and very much targeted at brands.’ The panel, which interviewed those who lost their homes and businesses, said the vast majority believed the ‘sole trigger’ for disturbances was the perception that the police ‘could not contain’ the scale of rioting in the capital. Between 13,000 and 15,000 people were 'actively involved' in rioting which swept across the country between August 6 and 10. More than 4,000 suspected rioters have been arrested with nine out of 10 already known to the police, the study said. More than 5,000 crimes were committed - and there were five deaths. There were 1,860 incidents of arson and criminal damage, 1,649 burglaries, 141 incidents of disorder and 366 cases of violence against the person. The final bill could be around £500 million, with up to £300 million of claims under the Riot Damages Act and £50million on policing London. There were 1,860 incidents of arson and criminal damage, 1,649 burglaries, 141 incidents of disorder and 366 cases of violence against the person. The final bill could be around £500 million, with up to £300 million of claims under the Riot Damages Act and £50million on policing London. Miss Rabbatts said scenes from Tottenham, North London, in which it ‘looked as if police were backing off’, led to a ‘perception that the streets were there for the taking’. The panel members, headed by Darra Singh, have a long history of working in the public and voluntary sector. Mr Singh has worked for homeless charities and was chief executive of two local councils. Miss Rabbatts spent time as a barrister and a BBC governor. They were joined on the panel by Baroness Sherlock, of the Refugee Council and the National Council for One Parent Families, and Simon Marcus, who founded the Boxing Academy for teenagers at risk of gang crime. Riots broke out in Tottenham on August 6, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. Mr Singh said: ‘Our research has also led us to conclude that riots of this nature will happen again unless immediate action is taken.’ The Riots, Communities and Victims panel painted a devastating picture of a country in which ‘some would argue consumerism is the new religion’. It said: ‘The desire to own goods which give the owner high status (such as branded trainers and digital gadgets) was seen as an important factor behind the riots.’ Looters repeatedly targeted the same types of shops across the country, including Footlocker, JD Sports and electrical stores. The panel went on: ‘The ownership of . luxury branded goods confers instant status. It is therefore perhaps not . surprising these goods became the rioters’ main objectives.’ Disorder: A hooded youth walks past a burning vehicle in Hackney on August 8. Inquiry panel member Heather Rabbatts said: 'These were not riots that were political, these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting and very much targeted at brands.' The panel, demanding much improved planning from police in future, said: ‘The police decision to withdraw to the periphery of riot-hit areas left many communities feeling they had been abandoned.’ The panel also called for insurers, who were accused of a ‘poor response’ in some cases, to do far more to pay compensation claims promptly. It also called for an overhaul of the 1886 Riot Damages Act, which is used to claim compensation from the state. The panel estimated up to 15,000 were ‘actively involved’ in the riots. More than 4,000 suspected rioters have been arrested with nine out of ten already known to the police, the study said. An Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman said the riots had presented ‘considerable challenges’ to the police. James Slack: 'Riots were opportunistic' The streets were still ablaze when a string of senior Labour figures took to the airwaves to blame Government ‘cuts’ for the riots. The party’s candidate for Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, explained the initial outbreak of violence and looting by saying: ‘Tottenham’s had a  9 per cent cut nearly in its Government grant.’ Harriet Harman, as the riots spread nationwide, then pointed to the trebling in tuition fees, the axing of the Education Maintenance Allowance and the closure of local job centres. Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, also suggested the Government’s austerity drive was to blame. But, if Miss Harman and her colleagues were hoping yesterday’s report would validate their argument, they would have been sorely disappointed. The most striking rebuttal of their claim came from panel member Heather Rabbatts who explicitly said the riots were not ‘political’. She said that, in the case of the initial outbreak of trouble in Tottenham, the ‘catalyst’ had been the police shooting of Mark Duggan. Opportunistic: A masked youth walks away from a blaze during the riots . With reference to the way the riots then spread, she concluded: ‘These were not riots that were political, these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting.’ The members of the panel have a long track record of working with disadvantaged groups, including teenagers at risk of social exclusion, refugees and the homeless. It was set up after Ed Miliband called for an inquiry into the causes of the riots. None of the panel’s recommendations for preventing further disturbances make any reference to spending cuts – which had barely begun at the time of the riots. Where tuition fees are briefly discussed in the report, it’s in the context of some children, who live in deprived areas, saying they do not feel they will have the opportunity to get a good job or go to university. However the panel says children in the same class as those who said they felt angry about the likes of EMA cuts had instead expressed ‘optimism and self-sufficiency’. The report points to concerns among young black and Asian men that they are being unfairly targeted by police stop and search. But panel chairman Darra Singh said the riots ‘were very different’ to the race riots of 1981 sparked by so-called stop and search ‘Sus laws’. Of those offenders brought before the courts so far, 42 per cent were white, 46 per cent black and 7 per cent Asian.","Rioting 'triggered by handling of death of Mark Duggan'

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 6:40 PM on 29th November 2011 . This year is set to be the 10th warmest on record, say meteorologists. Climate researchers in the UK said that temperatures in 2011 were nearing the top of records dating back to 1850. This despite a 'strong and persistent' La Nina weather system in the Pacific - an effect which should lead to lower temperatures across the world. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) released the figures based on three sets of independent data, including a joint one from  the University of East Anglia (UAE) - currently mired in controversy - and the Met Office, at a climate change conference in Durban this week. However, only last week researchers at UAE were criticised for colluding with politicians to ‘massage’ evidence of man-made climate change after 5,000 emails were leaked online. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heat is on: The World Meteorological Organisation's graph showing how global temperatures have risen since 1850 . Deputy Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Jerry Lengoasa speaks at the UN Climate Change Conference in Durban today - an event attended by 200 nations . A Nasa thermal satellite image showing the world's Arctic surface temperature trends during autumn between 1981 and 2008. Ice coverage in the Polar regions has been declining rapidly in recent years . ‘It’s part of a natural climate oscillation in the tropical pacific,’ says Adam Scaife, senior climate scientist at the Met Office. ‘It oscillates between the warm El Nino phase – El Nino is Spanish for “the boy”– and the cold La Nina phase. ‘La Nina is the cold “little sister” phase. It’s a purely natural event that occurs every few years as part of this natural oscillation. ‘During La Nina, the rainfall that normally falls over the Pacific, shifts west over Indonesia and the northern and eastern parts of Australia. ‘La Nina effects weather patterns throughout the globe, but the further away from La Nina you are, the more difficult it is to pinpoint the effects.’ The WMO released the figures as 200 nations meet in Durban, South . Africa, for the latest UN talks on agreeing a deal to tackle climate . change. The organisation, whose data also includes figures from the U.S., put the global . average temperature at 0.41C above the 1961 to 1990 average of 14C, . making it the 10th warmest on record. According to the WMO, the 13 warmest years on record have all occurred in the 15 years between 1997 and 2011. The Met Office/UAE also suggested a long-term warming trend in the global climate. Their data shows the average global . temperature for January to October 2011 was 14.36C, 0.36C above the 1961 . to 1990 long-term average of 14C. The WMO's final figure is an average of the three sets of data. According to their researchers, each decade since the 1950s has been warmer than the . previous decade, and last year was one of the warmest on record. Peter Stott, head of climate . monitoring and attribution at the Met Office, said: ‘This year we have . seen a very persistent and strong La Nina, which brings cooler water to . the surface of the Pacific Ocean. ‘This has a global impact on weather . and temperatures, and is one of the key reasons why this year does not . figure as highly as 2010 in the rankings. ‘However, global temperature so far . this year is likely higher than it was in the La Nina events in 2008 and . 1999 to 2000 - indicating a continuing warming trend combined with . natural variability.’ Hot air? A delegate walks past television screens that form part of exhibits at the climate conference in Durban, South Africa . Professor Phil Jones, director of the . Climatic Research Unit at UEA, said that natural variations from year to . year meant that every year would not be warmer than the last. But he said: ‘Independent researchers . analysing long-term trends of these indicators have seen an increase in . air, sea and land temperatures, rising sea levels and decreasing Arctic . sea ice, spring snow cover in the northern hemisphere and glacier . extent.’ The global temperature figures come as . scientists warned the latest evidence was showing that global warming . appeared to be a greater, rather than lesser, problem. Brian Hoskins, director of the . Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London and . professor of meteorology at Reading University, said: ‘What we've seen . in the science is not one huge change but a number of things - the . melting of the ice sheets, the permafrosts and release of methane and . the carbon cycle - have tended towards this problem being more serious . rather than less.’ As negotiators meet in Durban to . discuss efforts to tackle climate change, he said it was important to . get a global deal on curbing greenhouse gases that would see emissions . peak around 2020 and begin to fall by around three per cent a year. He said: 'There's no doubt that what the . climate system feels is the total greenhouse gases we emit to the . atmosphere, so unless countries can agree it's very difficult to see how . we can cap the total which is what the climate feels. ‘That's why a global agreement is so important.’ The WMO report also said 2011 saw . Arctic sea ice reach the second-lowest extent of cover on record during . the summer melt, and its lowest ever volume in the summer months. The report said Russia suffered . another hot summer, while central America was on course to have its . hottest year for 140 years and France and Spain had their hottest .

Following on from the original .

The . emails paint a clear picture of scientists selectively using data, and . colluding with politicians to misuse scientific information. ‘Humphrey’, . said to work at Defra, writes: ‘I cannot overstate the HUGE amount of . political interest in the project as a message that the government can . give on climate change to help them tell their story.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:16 AM on 29th July 2011 . Republican leader John Boehner was last night forced to abandon an attempt to pass a republican plan for the debt crisis through Congress after he failed to gather enough support from the right-wing of his party. Despite lawmakers working late into the night, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy announced the planned vote tonight on legislation to avoid a first-ever U.S. government default will not happen. It came as the the heads of America’s largest financial firms wrote to the White House and Congress pressuring them to reach a deal on the debt and deficit - or face ‘very grave’ economic consequences. Tricky times: Many of the chamber's GOP freshmen who are crucial to passage of a House plan to avoid a first-ever default are climbing aboard, but House Speaker John Boehner will not be claiming victory just yet . JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, Goldman . Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, among . others, made their plea as politicians last night (Thurs) voted on a . plan put forward by the Republicans. The country officially reaches its . legal borrowing limit on August 2, beyond which it cannot fund its huge . debt of $14.3 trillion. America’s top notch credit rating . will be downgraded if it defaults on its debt next week - with . potentially disastrous results for the world economy. The country’s financial chiefs reiterated that an agreement between squabbling politicians needs to be reached this week. Their letter said: ‘A default on our . nation’s obligations, or a downgrade of America’s credit rating, would . be a tremendous blow to business and investor confidence - raising . Earlier yesterday, the vote was . delayed amid reports that Mr Boehner was struggling to get the votes . needed for the debt plan to pass, even as GOP freshman important to the . bill's passage climbed aboard. If the House approved the bill it . would bring President Barack Obama and congressional leaders a step . closer to endgame efforts for a debt-limit solution before next . Tuesday's pressing deadline. Republicans are seeking deep spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation's $14.3trillion debt limit to allow the government to keep paying its bills. The White House has threatened to veto the GOP bill if it makes it through the Democratic-controlled Senate. 'What we're trying to do is save the . world from the Republican budget. We're trying to save life on this . planet as we know it today' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi . But getting the newly modified House plan passed on Thursday is seen as an important step towards finding a compromise - possibly in the Senate. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi today said: 'What we're trying to do is save the world from the . Republican budget. We're trying to save life on this planet as we know . it today.' Rival plans by Mr Boehner and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid have much in common, such as the creation of a congressional panel to recommend additional spending cuts this autumn. Mr Reid has hinted a compromise could be achievable, and as debate got under way in the House, he said the Senate would vote on the GOP bill as soon as the House finished late on Thursday. Having their say: A woman, left, holds a sign with a message for President Obama as dozens of Tea Party supporters rally near the U.S. Capitol against raising the debt limit, while a male protester, right, makes a point . But he insisted: ‘No Democrat will vote . for a short-term Band-Aid that would put our economy at risk and put the . nation back in this untenable situation a few short months from now.’ ‘No Democrat will vote . for a short-term Band-Aid that would put our economy at risk and put the . nation back in this untenable situation a few short months from now' Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid . Earlier in the day, in a closed-door GOP meeting, Mr Boehner made headway in securing the 217 votes necessary to pass his plan. No Democrats were expected to support it. Mr Boehner told the Republicans he expected to round up enough votes but was not there yet. ‘But today is the day,’ he reportedly said. At an early afternoon news conference, Mr Boehner said the bill wasn't perfect but was a ‘sincere and honest way to end this crisis’. ‘This bill is as large a step as we're able to take at this point in time that is doable and signable and to become law,’ he said. Left men: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, of Nevada, right, and President Barack Obama, left, are the key Democratic players in the debt debate . Standing with Mr Boehner, . Representative Kevin McCarthy, of California, who counts the votes, . offered no numbers, simply saying they were moving in the right . direction. ‘This bill is as large a step as we're . able to take at this point in time that is doable and signable and to . become law' House Speaker John Boehner . The bill passed an early hurdle as . the House voted 238-186 along party lines to move forward on the . legislation. Some lawmakers were climbing behind it, though sometimes . grudgingly. ‘I think it's the best deal we can get,’ said Republican Representative Steve Chabot, of Ohio, who revealed he had dropped his opposition. Republican Representative Walter Jones, of North Carolina, said he would back the measure to ensure that Mr Boehner ‘has a seat at the table’ for the final negotiations. The White House expected Mr Boehner to rally enough Republicans for the measure, with adviser David Plouffe saying it will ‘pass out of the House in partisan fashion.’ Interesting comments: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has caused stir in the political world by saying: 'We're trying to save life on this planet as we know it today' The House has 240 Republicans and 193 Democrats with two vacancies. Mr Boehner can only afford to lose two dozen members. Wall Street warily watched the bitter standoff in Washington D.C. as stocks rose modestly on Thursday, based in part on a strong jobs report - after a poor day’s trading on Wednesday. But only the Nasdaq finished up, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 both closing slightly down. House Republicans tweaked their measure on Wednesday to enhance its prospects of passage after a worse-than expected cost estimate from congressional budget analysts on Tuesday. The changes were modest, but they brought projected savings for 2012 to $22billion, part of a 10-year cut of $917billion. That would trigger a $900 billion increase in the debt limit. Mr Boehner showed fire in a meeting on Wednesday with the Republican caucus, saying: ‘Get your ass in line. I can't do this job unless you're behind me.’","American financial giants write to leaders warning of 'grave consequences'

As a new sex allegation threatens to unravel Herman Cain's White House bid, an ex-business partner of his accuser today shedding new light on the woman's past. Atlanta businesswoman Ginger White came forward last night during a TV interview to reveal that she has carried on a 13-is an unemployed single mother-of-two with numerous evictions on her record - including one just this month. She also had a protection order sought against her by an ex-business partner, Kimberly Vay. Scroll down for video . Legal trouble: Ginger White, right, had a . protection order sought against her by ex-business partner, Kimberly . Vay, left, a competitive body builder who started No Limit Cycling in Atlanta with Ms White last year . Rethinking? Cain told senior staffers today that he will review the campaign's strategy over the next several days . Miss . Vay is a competitive body builder and a behavioural health specialist . who last year started No Limit Cycling with Ms White - in which the two . women taught spin classes. But . somewhere along the way, their business relationship soured, with Miss . Vay seeking a 'stalking protective order' after Ms White sent out a . defamatory email about her in December, according to Miss Vay's lawyer, . Kurt Martin. Miss Vay accused Ms White of sending her repeated emails and texts threatening a lawsuit, as well as defamation of character. While . that case was later dropped, Miss Vay then filed a libel lawsuit on . June 9 and won after Ms White never responded to the case. The case will now go to a jury to decide a dollar amount for damages. Meanwhile, Cain told staffers today that he's reassessing his campaign a day after Atlanta businesswoman Ginger White alleged a 13-year extramarital affair with the Republican. He has fiercely denied the affair as well as several other accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour that have surfaced over the past month and he has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race. Coming forward: Ms White, an Atlanta businesswoman, she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story first . 'Here we go again': Herman Cain went on TV to deny the allegations that he had an affair... before they fully emerged . He told senior staff in a mid-morning conference call lasting roughly 10 minutes that all public events will go forward this week but he will review the campaign's strategy over the next several days. One participant on the call, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the conversation, said that as part of that assessment, Cain's campaign is examining the impact of the newest allegations. This person described the tone as positive but also said there was some uncertainty coming from Cain. 'He said obviously it's taken an emotional toll on his family, but he's moving ahead with the campaign,' said Steve Grubbs, Cain's Iowa campaign chairman. 'He said that they will be reassessing the campaign.' Grubbs added: 'He said this lady was a friend, someone he thought was a friend, that he was trying to help out financially and had been a friend for some period of time. But that nothing inappropriate occurred.' When asked about the libel case and its impact on her accusations against Cain, Ms White said: 'Well, because I admit it. Whatever happened with Kim and I - um - happened. 'Just as, what, what, there would make no sense to come out with these allegations against Herman if it absolutely wasn't true.' Ms White’s attorney told WAGA that she didn’t respond because to the case because she thought it had already been settled. Also, in 2001, she filed a sexual harassment claim against her former employer, which was later settled. Standing by her man: Herman Cain's wife Gloria, who married him in 1968, has been consistent in her support for her husband . Going on: Mr Cain said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her . Mr Cain denied the affair, but a statement from his attorney side-steps the question entirely by claiming the allegations are not a matter open for public scrutiny. But they represent the most serious claims yet against Mr Cain, who has been accused of sexual harassment against four other women. And Mr Cain began defending himself . before the allegations even surfaced. He broke the news himself on CNN . that Ms White would make claims against him. 'This appears to be an accusation of . private, alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter . which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public,' said a statement from Mr Cain's lawyer. The statement, however, does not explicitly deny the affair. In an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta yesterday, Ms White said she was only coming forward because she was afraid . someone would tell her story before she herself could. 'I'm not proud,' she said. 'I did not want to do this. I did not.' Mr Cain has been accused of sexual . harassment by four other women, two of whom have come forward publicly . with their allegations. As well as an alleged relationship with Ginger White, Mr Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women: . However, to this point, the only . accusations were about inappropriate advances or comments. Ms White is . saying he cheated on his wife for more than a decade . 'It was pretty simple. It wasn't complicated,' she told the local TV station. 'I was aware that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very inappropriate situation, relationship.' Mr Cain has been married to his wife Gloria since 1968. Both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment. And Mr Cain's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete. 'I . just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up, ""Here . we go again,""' he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Situation Room. The Georgia native said he knew the woman as an 'acquaintance who I thought . was a friend.' He denied having an affair, instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems. Cain also deflected criticism . and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him . out of office. As proof of the lengthy relationship, Ms White offered her mobile phone, which has Mr Cain's private number. Ms White also showed mobile phone . records dating back four months that have 61 phone calls and text . messages to or from Mr Cain as early as 4.26am and as late as 7.52pm. 'He made it very intriguing,' Ms White . told FOX 5. 'It was fun. It was something that took me away from my . humdrum life at the time. And it was exciting.' Ms White said the two met in . Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s when Mr Cain was the president . of the National Restaurant Association. That night, she says, Mr Cain took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room. 'I'd . like to see you again. You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us . to continue this friendship,' Ms White claims Mr Cain told her. From then, he paid for her to fly to his . speaking engagements across the country, where he put her up in fancy . hotels and restaurants like the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons.

"Tunnel from Tijuana linked to warehouse in San Diego's Otay Mesa district . By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 11:12 AM on 30th November 2011 . A 2,625ft-long drug-smuggling tunnel discovered running under the Mexican border has been described by police as the 'most sophisticated ever'. The tunnel scheme, which links warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana, even has a hydraulic lift to take people and contraband underground. It is the latest in a spate of secret passages found smuggling drugs from Mexico into the U.S. 'It is clearly the most sophisticated tunnel we have ever found,' said Lauren Mack, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego. Sophisticated: Authorities discovered the entrance in San Diego's Otay mesa district, and found tracks (left) and a hydraulic lift . Mexican soldiers found the entrance on the south side of the border at a Tijuana warehouse, near the airport, after the U.S. opening was discovered on Tuesday. The Tijuana warehouse is on the same block as a federal police office and sits next to a packaging company and tortilla distributor. This discovery comes less than two weeks after U.S. authorities found a 400-yard passage linking warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana, seizing 17 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border. It was equipped with lighting and ventilation. As U.S. authorities heighten enforcement on land, tunnels have emerged as a major tack to smuggle marijuana. More than 70 have been found on the border since October 2008, surpassing the number of discoveries in the previous six years. Standing guard: Soldiers stand guard next to vehicles outside a warehouse where a tunnel was found under the Mexico-U.S. border in Tijuana . Bust: Police found marijuana near the start of the tunnel in Tijuana . Many are clustered around San Diego, California’s Imperial Valley and Nogales, Ariz. California is popular because its clay-like soil is easy to dig with shovels. In Nogales, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals. Authorities said they found a drug tunnel in Nogales, running from a drain in Mexico to a rented house on the U.S. side. San . Diego’s Otay Mesa area has the added draw that there are plenty of . warehouses on both sides of the border to conceal trucks getting loaded . with drugs. Its streets hum with semitrailers by day and fall silent on . nights and weekends. Haul: As U.S. authorities heighten enforcement on land, tunnels have emerged as a major tack to smuggle marijuana as the latest discovery shows . Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border, ranking among the largest pot busts in U.S. history. Those secret passages were lined with rail tracks, lighting and ventilation. On Monday, a Mexican man was . sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison for his role in last November’s . tunnels. Prosecutors described Daniel Navarro, 45, as a significant . player in moving marijuana from the San Diego warehouse and sought a . 30-year prison sentence. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns said Navarro, a legal U.S. resident since . 1999 who worked as a trucker in Southern California, was 'up to his . hips' in smuggling the large marijuana loads. 'This is just a gigantic amount of marijuana,' Burns said. Market: Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border, worth millions .

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 2:49 AM on 30th November 2011 . A driver who killed a motorcyclist on a roundabout as he sent a text message to his grandmother has been jailed for three years. The judge told 26-year-old Stephen Rawlinson he had been distracted by using his mobile phone, and ‘even the time to text eight characters is the time it takes to kill a man’. Rawlinson, a father of three, was seen driving his Ford Focus at speed seconds before it struck Nigel Earnshaw, 58, on his 125cc motorbike. Stephen Rawlinson (left) was texting his grandmother when he struck Nigel Earnshaw (right) on his Honda motorbike at 10.30pm. His mobile was taken from him at the scene and examined by police . The accident happened in Saltaire (pictured), West Yorkshire. Rawlinson said he could not understand how he failed to see the motorbike and said he thought the noise he had heard when he hit Mr Earnshaw was children throwing stones at his car . Judge Jonathan Rose told him: ‘You just wiped out the machine and the man who was upon it.’ Mr Earnshaw, who was on his way to a . night shift at Hallmark Cards, was within the speed limit and had the . right of way on the roundabout when he was hit at around 10.30pm on . September 5 last year in Saltaire, West Yorkshire. He suffered a fractured ankle, developed deep vein thrombosis and died in hospital 18 days later. Rawlinson said he could not understand how he failed to see the motorbike. He also claimed he thought the noise he had heard when he hit Mr Earnshaw was children throwing stones at his car. Rawlinson denied causing death by dangerous driving, but a jury  at Bradford Crown Court found him guilty. Prosecutor Richard Clews told the . court: ‘He was either grossly inattentive or he was, for some reason, . grossly distracted for a considerable period of time on the approach to . the roundabout.’ Police officers took his phone at the scene and found . he had sent a text message at 10.28pm telling  his grandmother he would . be with her shortly. Court: The father-of-three was convicted by a jury at Bradford Crown Court, in West Yorkshire (pictured) Rawlinson, from Bradford,  denied using the phone while he was driving. Mr Earnshaw, a devoted charity . fundraiser from Keighley, West Yorkshire, left behind Susan, his wife of . 38 years. The couple had been teenage sweethearts. Judge Rose said Mrs . Earnshaw ‘suffered a daily loneliness’ since the death of her husband, . and had been deprived of her friend, companion and breadwinner. He told Rawlinson: ‘There was an . arrogance in your driving that night. You were driving too fast for the . road, for the circumstances, too fast to respect other road users.’ Rawlinson was also banned from driving for four years and ordered to take an extended re-test before returning to the roads. Outside court Mrs Earnshaw said: ‘I . think the sentence was a bit too lenient, but I sometimes read in the . papers about drivers killing others and walking free, so I suppose I . have to be grateful to the judge for jailing him.’ Mr Earnshaw’s brother-in-law Mike . Smith said: ‘It can be difficult enough to send a text when you’re at . home, but when you’re driving, it’s just reckless. ‘Until you are on the receiving end . you cannot possibly realise the impact of just how dangerous driving . while using a mobile phone is –  to understand that it can kill.’ Richard Coteau, of campaign group . Brake, said: ‘People who text, use the web or social networking when . driving are taking enormous risks with their own and other people’s . lives.’","Stephen Rawlinson, 26, has been jailed for three years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:27 PM on 30th November 2011 . Banned: Redshaw will no longer be allowed to teach after a number of 'inappropriate' emails to a 13-year-old pupil came to light . A teacher called a 13-year old pupil the 'fittest babe in the school' as he bombarded her with a succession of inappropriate messages. Daniel Redshaw, 33, even used his wife's laptop to email the girl,  a disciplinary panel heard yesterday. Redshaw, who taught at St Guthlac School, in Crowland, Lincolnshire, sent the girl a number of emails under a false name, using phrases . such as 'the hottest', 'well good looking' and 'pretty plz let me . have her number', the panel was told. He has now been struck off the teaching register indefinitely. The school was made aware of Redshaw's pursuit when parents of the student's friend convinced her to tell the school, after she had initially confided in their daughter. Redshaw, who was dismissed from the school in 2009, was found guilty by the General Teaching Council's Professional Conduct Committee of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while employed as head of maths at St Guthlac School. The panel struck him off the teaching register. It means he cannot seek to return to the classroom for at least seven years. The panel findings say that Redshaw 'behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional manner to a 13 year old student (identified only as Student A)' by sending her emails using the name of 'Bob Smythe' and approached and intimidated her at school. It said that, on or around October 7, 2008, he kept her behind in class and said 'we spent so many hours together yesterday at the open evening, it was nice we should do it again.' On or around October 8, 2008, he asked her if she had looked at her emails and told her that he had sent emails to her under the name 'Bob Smythe'. Then, on or around October 10, 2008, he said to her: 'I guess I must try harder', and again asked if she had read his emails. On alert: St Guthlac School has suspended former teacher Redshaw following an illicit pursuit of a student . He again asked her about them on or around October 21, 2008, and told her that she should come up to him if she felt bored in English class because he wanted to see her. The panel also found that he 'made inappropriate use of school computer equipment' by using it to obtain the girl's email address and send some of the emails to her. Committee chairwoman Rosalind Burford said the committee had seen printouts of the emails which were sent to the girl including one from Redshaw's wife's laptop. She said: 'The content of the emails is clearly inappropriate, particularly phrases such as 'will the hottest, well good looking [Student A] pretty plz let me have her number...' and '[Student A] - the fittest (!!!) babe at school'. Finding his conduct unacceptable, she said his behaviour had seriously affected Student A and that he had not provided any evidence of insight into his failings or expression of regret. She said: 'We have concluded that Mr Redshaw's behaviour is incompatible with being a registered teacher.' Afterwards, Steve Baragwanath, executive head of the Holbeach and Crowland Secondary Federation, which includes St Guthlac School, said: 'I'm glad this has been resolved. It brings closure for the family and the youngster involved.' He said the matter had initially been reported by the girl's parents. The matter was dealt with by the school as quickly and as fully as possible. There was an internal investigation and Redshaw was dismissed. The information was then passed to the GTC. 'Our concern was that something like this could happen at another place and we wanted to make sure that the matter was resolved properly. 'There was an internal review of the school's policies and procedures but it was not felt necessary to make any changes.'","Daniel Redshaw banned from teaching after sending girl a string of inappropriate messages .

The 42-year-old father-of-two said his family meant 'everything' to him, and was more important than any medal he had won during his lengthy career. In the interview with FourFourTwo magazine, Speed said: 'The item I cherish the most isn't material. I don't even know where my Leeds championship medal is. So I'd say family: we're an item and they mean everything to me.'

Peter Kay, the chief executive of the Sporting Chance Clinic told BBC Radio 5: 'I'm hesitant to even link that tragedy with anything good. I think it's almost inappropriate that anything good can come out of such an awful occurrence. But over ten players have contacted me since that news broke. 'That means 10 people are seeking help. That is an unusual amount.' The news came after Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), urged players to ask for help with any issues which concern them. Mr Taylor said the PFA, in conjunction with associated partners, regularly helped their members but the greatest hurdle was often making the first step.","Wife Louise given advice by paramedics after she discovered his body .

If you look out of your kitchen window today and see a giant inflatable island floating towards your home - don't worry, aliens are not about to land and you're not going mad. You've probably just found a runaway sculpture inflated with helium which a couple of tipsy revellers released when it was moored at Cambridgeshire's Secret Garden Party. The £12,000 Is Land, had been bobbing around in the sky to inspire party-goers having been built to represent the ""slightly modified reality"". Missing: The £12,000 Is Land, had been bobbing around in the sky to inspire party-goers at the Cambridgeshire Secret Garden Party . However, around 3am on Sunday, July 24 two youths were spotted crossing the lake in a dinghy under the cover of darkness, who then promptly cut all five of its tether ropes and watched it sail away into the night sky. Now a man-hunt has been launched to track down the seven-metre wide sculpture - created by Royal College of Art graduates Sarah Cockings and Laurence Symonds. Data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted the inflatable land mass could now be as far as Slovenia, according to The Independent - over the town of Celje in fact - although organisers of the event hope it is still in the UK. The island is due to be on display in the U.S. at this year's Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, pictured, later on this month . It was last seen over Huntingdon, . Cambridgeshire, 400 metres up - but no one from any of Britain's . airports have spotted the unusual airborne art piece. Some . residents claim to have seen it in Dorset - and one woman thought it . was the Loch Ness Monster - whilst others thought extra-terrestrial life . was about to touch down. A statement on the organisers' website . said: 'The UK Civil Aviation Authority, local airports as well as . chartered air spaces were informed, and attempts have been made to . calculate the wind speed and direction around Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire . at the time of its release, any more accurate location updates will be . published. Under construction: The island is made of durable polyurethane, and is covered in green foliage . 'However due to there being release valves on the balloon, the helium will have been slowly expelled over a long period of time, as opposed to rising quickly and rupturing, meaning the island could have reached great heights. 'But what goes up must come down, so the hunt is on. If what looks like a floating chunk of earth turns up in your Nan’s back garden, or if you think you see a new planet on your Easyjet flight to Portugal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.' Made of durable polyurethane, and . covered in green foliage, organisers are desperate for it to be located - . it has a date in the U.S. at this year's Burning Man festival in the . Nevada desert later on this month. Into the ether: The sculpture floated off from the festival - and could be in Slovenia. The festival attracts around 26,000 visitors . The creation took six months to make - in Stroud in Gloucestershire. About 26,000 visitors flocked from across the UK to the Secret Garden Party. The festival started in 2004 when just 1,000 people attended. The event takes place in the grounds of a country house in the village of Abbots Ripton, near Huntingdon and the lake becomes the centre stage for various sculptures and other art pieces. Any sightings should be reported via is-land.co.uk .","£12,000 art piece was released from its tethers by vandals at Cambridgeshire's Secret Garden Party ."

"By . Chris Parsons and Emily Allen . Last updated at 5:50 PM on 30th November 2011 . They took to the streets in their thousands with the intention of voicing their anger to the Coalition in the bitter row over pensions. But it seems that although many stuck to their task of manning the picket lines in protest, others decided to use their day off for an altogether more leisurely pursuit. With schools closed due to strike action, many parents and children with a rare weekday off seized the opportunity for an extra day's Christmas shopping. Extra time off: The Trafford Centre in Manchester, pictured, was one of a number of shopping centres to see a rise in numbers today during the nationwide strikes . Many shopping centres which would normally have been only moderately busy were instead crammed with shoppers who had a rare break from work or school. One centre chief declared: ‘Christmas is well and truly underway at last’, as bargain hunters packed into store aisles. Bluewater shopping centre in Kent reported a seven per cent increase in footfall, which bosses directly attributed to the national strikes. Tim Hollands, Assistant General Manager at the centre, said: 'I have no idea why we’ve been so busy but I would suggest that some of the shoppers today were public sector workers and parents with children who aren’t at school. Retail therapy: Shopping centres reported traffic higher than usual for a Wednesday in November due to the strike action . In Scotland, Glasgow's Silverburn shopping centre reported 15,000 extra visitors than on a normal weekday . 'In particular, there are a lot of families at Bluewater today, due to some schools being closed and many parents being off work.' At the Trafford Centre, Manchester, Gordon McKinnon, Director of Operations, said: 'Christmas is well and truly underway at The Trafford Centre today, as people take advantage of a midweek day off. 'Manchester has experienced a huge jump in footfall, compared to the same day last year.' Packed: Silverburn in Glasgow was just one of several major shopping centres to report 'significant' increases in visitor numbers . The trend of increased shopping traffic continued elsewhere nationwide, with the Metrocentre in Newcastle also reporting swollen numbers. Tim Lamb, general manager of Newcastle’s Metrocentre said: ‘It has been a very, very busy day today.’ A spokesman for Brent Cross Shopping Centre, north-west London, said: 'We’ve had a lot of families and parents who have had to look after their kids because of the strike it’s been a great day. 'It’s felt a bit like a busy weekend not a week day.' North of the border, meanwhile, Silverburn Shopping Centre in Glasgow said it expected up to 15,000 more customers than on a normal weekday, according to the BBC. The 24-hour walkout by two million workers is being staged amid union fury over plans to reform pensions which will involve members working longer and having to pay more. It is the biggest strike for over 30 years, with schools, hospitals, courts, transport and government all set to be hit by the walkout. But Mr Cameron told the House of Commons: ‘So far the evidence would suggest that 40 per cent of schools are open.’ He also said the country had full ambulance service cover and that just 18 out of 900 job centres were closed. Millions of children stayed at home today as teachers and heads took to the picket lines, affecting almost three in four schools. The Department for Education (DfE) said it believed that more than half of England's 21,700 state schools - 58 per cent - are closed, with a further 13 per cent partially shut. About 13 per cent are open, the DfE said, while the rest are unknown. Although Heathrow was today braced for major disruption, some passengers claimed border controls were 'better than usual' The airport yesterday warned of arrivals expecting a two or three hour wait at passport control, due in part to workers staffing the borders having limited training. On the march: Members of public sector unions - along with a 'Golf Sale' sign holder march in central London . Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said a 'significant' number of civil servants had volunteered to cover for striking Border Agency staff, including a 'considerable' number from the Ministry of Defence. Even Gabby Bertin, Mr Cameron's long-serving spokeswoman, stood in for UK Border Agency staff at Heathrow today. Mr Maude, who is the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'There are going to be queues but we have proper contingency plans in place and we have been training people to do what we can to mitigate the impact.'","Bluewater in Kent reports seven per cent increase in footfall for a Wednesday in November .

A huge search is on after an elderly man donated more than he intended by accidentally leaving his life savings in a suit he gave to a charity shop. Charity workers were today hunting through piles of donated clothes at a warehouse in Iowa after the 80-year-old man handed in his suit in Illinois. A Goodwill store spokesman said the man's wife has cancer and they were going to be using the $13,000 in the suit pocket for her medical expenses. Scroll down for video . Where's the money? Charity workers were today hunting through piles of donated clothes at a warehouse in Iowa after the man handed in his suit in Illinois . ‘It's his life savings and he's in a difficult situation right now,’ the charity’s vice president of marketing Dana Engelbert said. She said the grey suit was donated to a store in Moline, Illinois, and could have been sold at the store or sent away with other clothing. If it was sent away it would have gone to a regional Goodwill warehouse in Iowa City, where non-seasonal items go for storage, Ms Engelbert said. The man wasn't sure when he made the donation, but workers were checking back through clothes dropped off since the last week of October. Ms Engelbert said more than 575,000 items have been donated in the past year to the chapter that covers southeast Iowa and western Illinois. Searching: She said the grey suit was donated to a store in Moline, Illinois, and could have been sold at the store or sent away with other clothing . It is not know how many bills were in the suit jacket or the denominations of the cash, but Ms Engelbert said the lumps could easily go unnoticed. 'It's been extremely heartwarming, the number of people reaching out to help. The phone at the Moline store rang almost nonstop with people calling about it, and I've received emails from as far away as Germany' Dana Engelbert . As word of the man's plight spread, Goodwill has been inundated with calls and emails from people offering assistance. ‘It's been extremely heartwarming, the number of people reaching out to help,’ Ms Engelbert said. ‘The phone at the Moline store rang almost nonstop with people calling about it, and I've received emails from as far away as Germany.’ But the man and his family are declining all offers of financial assistance and have asked that they not be identified, Ms Engelbert said. Problems: The charity's vice president of marketing Dana Engelbert said the mistake has left the man in a 'difficult situation right now' The man's daughter said in a statement provided to WQAD-TV in Moline the family is very grateful for everyone who has offered a donation.

He only wanted someone to come forward with the money he gave away by mistake.’ The family is offering a $1,000 reward for the return of the money, Ms Engelbert said. It's not unusual for people to find money in donated clothes and return it to the store, but typically no more than $5, Ms Engelbert said. ‘We do whatever we can to return it to the owner whenever possible,’ she said, adding that unclaimed money usually goes to their operating fund.

"Created group 'Wakey Riots' before posting messages saying 'Who's up for it?' Group invitation sent to 700 people in Wakefield after first outbreak of violence . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:44 AM on 1st December 2011 . Relief: Hollie Bentley (left) avoided a prison sentence despite posting messages on her Facebook page to encouraging people to loot during the UK riots . A teenager facing jail for inciting a . riot during the summer troubles walked free from court yesterday after a . judge decided she was guilty only of making a ‘stupid’ joke on . Facebook. Hollie Bentley, 19, had faced a five-year jail sentence under a relatively new section of the Serious Crime Act of 'encouraging the commission of an offence believing it would be committed'. But Judge Peter Collier QC recognised that slang acronyms such as LMFAO backed up her claim that her 'Wakey Riots' event page had been set up in jest. Bentley had created the Facebook group and even posted on the message board, just hours before looters trawled shops, homes and local businesses throughout the UK. Her messages such as LMFAO - which means 'Laughing My F****** Arse Off' and is used to indicate you're laughing - were alleged by authorities to have incited criminality. But the judge said he could not accept that the term referred to Miss Bentley 'sitting in her bedroom laughing inwardly . about Wakefield being burned to the ground'. The former pupil at Wakefield Cathedral School was stunned when a marked police car turned up at her door in at the family home in the suburbs of the West Yorkshire town on the evening of 'one of the darkest summer days' Britain had ever seen. She was placed in the back and taken to the police station where she spent the night in custody before telling police the following afternoon she 'was just mucking about'. At Leeds Crown Court yesterday the case was thrown out after a one-hour 'trial' that followed a previous Crown Court plea and directions hearing and two magistrates' court appearances. There was no dispute that Bentley created the Facebook event page 'Wakey Riots' which was sent to more than 700 people on Tuesday August 9 about 5.30pm. In the early hours of the following morning police would face their fourth night of rioting and running battles with looters in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Salford, Nottingham and Liverpool. However, Judge Collier, the Recorder of Leeds, said there was not enough evidence to disprove Miss Bentley's claim that it was a joke, adding: 'That's been her account from the start'. Thrown out: Judge Peter Collier QC rejected calls for Hollie to face a jail sentence at Leeds Crown court . The judge was also bemused that police had not asked Miss Bentley about the letters LMFAO. Defending barrister Matthew Harding said: 'To put it bluntly, it's riddled with references to jokes.' Richard Clews, prosecuting, also failed to mention the letters when opening the case and when asked by the judge what if he knew what the abbreviation meant said he did not and had 'no instructions'. Opening the case Mr Clews told the jury: 'It is not in dispute as to what happened. The key issue is what was meant by what happened. That's for you to decide - to interpret the actions of the defendant which she admitted carrying out. 'This was in the dark days of summer just gone, metaphorically speaking. Some of the darkest days perhaps you will recall this country has had on its shores for a number of years. 'I'm talking about the riots. On August 9th the country was in the thick of them. 'The prosecution say no one could think anything like that was funny. It's not funny now. It certainly was not funny on 9 August.' The case against Miss Bentley suggested her Facebook group encouraged looters . The court was told Miss Bentley, who is now pregnant and expecting her first child in April, had been sitting alone in her bedroom that evening when she created the Wakey Riots page with a picture of the town centre and the cathedral and message: 'Who's up for it?' She told police because of the way the Facebook events system works she had to put a date in and chose the following Saturday when Wakefield city centre would have been packed with people. The event was received by more than 700 people, of which 62 replied they would not come, 16 said they could, five were ""maybes"" and 691 did not reply. Miss Bentley admitted she did not actually know most of them. The alarm was raised when one of Miss Bentley's Facebook Friends Joe Wingfield, 16, accessed his Facebook account via his IPhone and told his brother Richard who is a policeman. Earlier, Miss Bentley's friends had warned her she was getting herself into trouble. Natalie Salmon wrote: 'Hollie, this is stupid. Why are you even making this event? You might think it's funny but it's not. 'All you are doing is causing trouble and not just for yourself but everybody else. If I was you I would just delete this.' Several young people targeted were encouraged via various social mediums to loot throughout the UK before posting pictures of their successful looting . But Miss Bentley left the page up and sobbed out an interview about what had happened the following afternoon to Pc Angelina Shute after a night in custody She said: 'I made it. I was joking with my friends. I did not realise the police would get involved. I was just mucking about. 'I did not believe it when the police came around. There is nothing more for me to say except I shouldn't have done it. It was just a joke. I was not really going to do it.' But Pc Shute asked her: 'Have you seen all the disruption? Have you seen all the property damage? All the police officers that have been injured? All the houses and businesses that have been burned to the ground? People's lives have been put in danger. Is it funny now?' But the judge agreed after 45 minutes of prosecution evidence there was no case to answer. He rejected the Crown's argument that similar previous cases which resulted in jail terms would have been equally difficult to prove. The judge maintained those cases were different because the defendants pleaded guilty and could not accept LMFAO referred to Miss Bentley 'sitting in her bedroom, creating this, and laughing inwardly about Wakefield being burned to the ground'. There were tears from the Bentley family as the judge ordered the jury to acquit her of encouraging violent disorder on Facebook. One said: 'We are just glad it's all over.' Miss Bentley, who is only about 5ft in height, and dressed all in black, was hugged by her parents Leonard, an ambulance paramedic, and Susan, a hospital cleaner. The teenager appeared in a daze after the verdict was announced. Mr Bentley said: 'We don't want to talk about it now or ever.' Hollie, a former pupil of Wakefield's Cathedral School, lives with her parents in a semi-detached house and was charged under the Serious Offences Act 2007. The court heard there was no Wakey Riot in the end. Miss Bentley told police had lives and businesses been endangered she would have felt 'awful and that it was all my fault'.","Created group 'Wakey Riots' before posting messages saying 'Who's up for it?'

"By . Rebecca Evans and Arthur Martin . Last updated at 9:05 AM on 1st December 2011 . After laying siege to St Paul’s Cathedral for weeks, anarchists hijacked the pensions protest yesterday. Amid violent clashes with police, members of the notorious anti-capitalist group Occupy London stormed the head office of a FTSE 100 company. As 25,000 TUC strikers including a strong representation of teachers marched through the capital, the 60-strong gang broke away and forced their way into the West End offices of Xstrata, a multi-national mining firm. Wide eyed: Police arrest an Occupy London protestor on the roof of Panton House, a building used by mining company Xstrata, whose offices were attacked by a group of protesters . Pinned down: Police handcuff an anti-capitalist protesters on the roof of Panton House. The protesters had unveiled a banner and set off flares . Flames of hatred: A man carries a flare down Haymarket in central London after lighting it outside the head offices of Xstrata . Banner: A group of protesters run through London carrying a sign saying 'all power to the 99%' The professional protesters got on to the roof of the four-storey building, where they unfurled a banner saying ‘All power to the 99%’ and set off flares. Some tried to break into the office of the company’s boss Mick Davis to confront him over his ‘excessive’ pay. In stark contrast to the summer riots, where police were criticised for allowing problems to escalate, hundreds of officers descended on the building within minutes and surrounded the protesters. One of the demonstrators said: ‘We put the message out on Twitter to meet here. We want to make a stand about the huge pay rise Mick Davis has received. Kettled: Police held a large group of protesters close to the building until the final people were removed in handcuffs . Heavy presence: A large number of police officers formed a cordon outside the offices of Xstrata following the storming by the anarchists . ‘Someone let off a flare and we tried to put a sign out of the window but the police stopped us. ‘We wanted to get into Mick’s office, but it was locked. We wanted to ask him how he thinks he can justify his excessive pay packet.’ The gang stormed the building at around 3.30pm and within half an hour police had removed 30 of them. Some of these later held up a banner outside, which read: ‘You get £18,426,105. We get austerity,’ in reference to their claim that Mr Davis had just received a 49 per cent pay rise. A group of 23 – 16 men and seven women – stayed for a further three hours before being led away in handcuffs. After the first group were removed, police ‘kettled’ a small group of demonstrators – some of whom were smoking cannabis – in an area outside the office in Haymarket until the siege was over. Tin blue line: A mobile police cordon was erected at Trafalgar Square to stop protesters making their way towards Parliament . An Occupy London spokesman said they were aiming the demonstration at Mr Davis because he was the highest-paid chief executive of all the FTSE 100 companies in the last year. A total of 96 arrests were made during yesterday’s march in London. Many of the demonstrators  said they were striking for the first time. Those representing the NAHT head teachers’ union, which has not taken industrial action on 114 years, arrived in suits and overcoats. Also new to the strike action were London Ambulance dispatchers and paramedics, who had not been on strike since the 1970s. Most of the banners on display were distributed by the big trade unions - Unite, Unison, the NUT and the PCS.","60-strong gang break into offices of Xstrata, a mining firm .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:52 PM on 29th November 2011 . It seemed the perfect act of revenge - a jilted lover cruelly tattooed a picture of flies over excrement on his ex-girlfriend's back and the photo swept the internet. But MailOnline can reveal all is not quite as it seems with the story of 'Rossie Brovent's poo tattoo'. The resident of Dayton, Ohio, was reportedly suing her ex-boyfriend and tattoo artist Ryan Fitzjerald for $100,000 over the drawing which she eventually found out was of flies over a pile of excrement. Tall story? This photograph of a woman with a pile of excrement tattooed on her back was claimed to be Rossie Brovent of Ohio - but it is sourced from a Polish website . He was said to be angry at her for . cheating on him with a friend and plied her with alcohol before she . signed a consent form agreeing a design ‘at the artist's discretion’. She wanted an image of Narnia. But the story itself - originally reported on the VeryWeirdNews website and later followed up by British newspaper The Sun, U.S. website Metro and others across the world - has been thrown into doubt. The picture of the ‘tattoo’ appeared on the Ugliest Tattoos blog, part of the Fail Blog group of websites, as far back as December 2009, MailOnline can reveal. It was sourced from Polish social network website Nasza-klasa, which translates as ‘our class’, and the caption on the photo lists the month in Polish as January, without a year, and the name of ‘Ania’. A court official at Dayton Municipal Court, where the lawsuit would most likely have been filed, told MailOnline they had no record of either Ms Brovent or Mr Fitzjerald in their records system. Is it real? The story itself - which was originally reported on VeryWeirdNews and later followed up by newspapers and website across the world - has been thrown into doubt .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 4:30 PM on 30th November 2011 . Newsreader Brian Williams proved a more-than-steady anchor for NBC last night when he calmly continued his live broadcast through a fire alarm. Mr Williams barely batted an eyelid when a siren went off in the channel's 30 Rock studio in New York moments into the Nightly News show. He had just started a report about American Airlines filing for bankruptcy when he was interrupted by a drone followed by an automated voice announcement. Scroll down for video . Cool: NBC's Nightly News anchorman Brian Williams barely reacts when a fire alarm goes off in the studio live on air last night. He calmly continues with his broadcast, but it was another 20 minutes at least until it was turned off . But he maintained his composure, only once or twice flicking his eyes upwards, as he carried on with the segment. At one point, as the noise continued, he offered an easy chuckle and reassured viewers he was in no danger before reading on. He said: 'Forgive us. We have a fire alarm announcement going on here in the studio.' Very quickly, viewers began reacting on Twitter, asking why someone couldn't turn off the alarm quicker, while others praised Mr Williams' cool-headedness. David Loughran said: 'Brian Williams is rewriting the definition of professionalism tonight.' Mr Williams eventually handed over to his colleague Tom Costello in the channel's Washington office in the hope the now-high-pitched siren would be fixed in the meantime. Just a slight twitch: Mr Williams flicks his eyes upwards as the siren continues while he reads the latest on a story about American Airlines filing for bankruptcy . Time for a laugh: Mr Williams jokes about the endless drone as he hands over to his colleague Tom Costello in the Washington office . But the alarm buzzed on, through the Herman Cain story and through the lead-in to a story about the siege at the British Embassy in Iran. Mr Williams took a commercial break, but when he came back so did the alarm. Each time, Williams kept his cool, reminding viewers everything was fine, even as his voice was again overwhelmed by the sound as he introduced a piece on Mexican drug wars. Finally, three-quarters of the way through the program, the alarm fell silent. As for the cause, NBC’s PR spokeswoman Erika Masonhall tweeted an explanation: 'This is the first fire alarm in our new NBC Nightly News studio. 'System should have been shut off - but clearly still working out the kinks.' As he closed the program, Mr Williams said: 'With thanks for your co-operation. We hope to get all quiet and see you here tomorrow night.'","Siren goes off moments into Nightly News broadcast...

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:15 AM on 1st December 2011 . Carmen Tarleton, who was burned and disfigured when her ex-husband doused her with industrial lye four years ago has been approved for a rare face transplant. The 43-year-old Vermont woman, who was blinded in one eye and has limited vision in the other, said she hopes to be able to blink again. She wants to be able to breathe through both sides of her nose and eat normally. In 2007, Ms Tarleton's estranged husband broke into her Thetford home and beat her with a baseball bat, fracturing an eye socket and breaking her arm, and pouring industrial-strength chemical on her, leaving her with burns over most of her body. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Inspirational: Ms Tarleton is going on tours speaking of her harrowing experience and the lessons she's learned . Herbert Rodgers is serving a minimum of 30 years in prison for the June 2007 attack. Ms Tarleton has undergone roughly 50 surgeries since then, 14 of them on her neck. 'I can't do those kind of everyday type of things that we all take for granted. I did, I definitely did,' she said Tuesday. Ms Tarleton's transplant would be done at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The hospital has done three full transplants this year, including on Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman who was mauled by a chimpanzee gone berserk. At least 18 face transplants have been performed around the world, said Dr Maria Siemionow of the Cleveland Clinic. Proud daughter: Ms Tarleton's daughter Hannah said she's proud of her mother for having the courage to go out . Her two daughters admire the strength of their mother. Her daughter Hannah told WCAX: 'I am very proud of my mom, because if that had happened to me, I would probably be in my room all the time and she comes out here and tells people about it.' Ms Tarleton had to undergo weekly tests at the Boston hospital to determine if she was eligible for the procedure. They included physical tests, MRIs, evaluation by psychiatrists, blood and tissue tests, and appointments with physical, speech and other therapists. Quality treatment: Ms Tarleton will be treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where chimp attack victim Charla Nash also received a new face . She was listed as a potential recipient seeking a donor on Monday. The hospital said she's the only one seeking a face transplant in the region, but Ms Tarleton expects it will take a couple of months before a donor is found, based on the experience of the hospital's other face transplant recipients. The Department of Defence has given Brigham and Women's a $3.4million research grant for its face transplants. Ms Tarleton's will be covered by the grant, said Lori Shanks, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Domestic horror: Ms Tarleton's ex-husband beat her with a baseball bat and doused with lye in their Vermont home in 2007 . 'I'm excited,' Ms Tarleton said. She hopes the transplant, which she said will include replacing deep scarring on her neck with donor tissue, will relieve her recurring neck pain. The neck discomfort pulls her forward, she said, which has caused back pain. And she'd like to be able to go out in public and eat comfortably without food falling out or drooling, she said. 'I don't want to have to always ask for an extra napkin. It's those kind of everyday things. It's well worth it to me. I have so little function in my face,' she said. Spectacular results: Charla Nash, a 55-year-old from Connecticut received a similar face transplant at the same hospital after being mauled by a chimp . She hopes being able to blink and clear her eye would help her synthetic cornea last longer. 'I want to preserve my vision as long as I can,' she said. Ms Tarleton says she won't look like the donor but will look similar to what she used to look like – maybe a cousin or sister – because she has all of her bones in her face. 'So I'm hoping I look similar. Anything close is fine. Anything's fine anyway,' she said.","Carmen Tarleton, 43, was disfigured after being beaten and doused with lye .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:49 PM on 30th November 2011 . The Dow Jones today closed up almost 500 points in an astonishing rally after the world’s major central banks announced a desperate move to kick-start the global financial system. The operation, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, came amid fears that at least one major European bank . may be teetering on the brink of collapse. The dramatic move to shore up the world's creaking economy was undermined after the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its . ratings on 15 global banks by one notch. All smiles: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange before the closing bell this afternoon . Cheered by traders: A view of a board on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, as the Dow shot up . The central banks of Europe, the U.S. and others agreed to give banks cheaper access to loans in U.S. dollars, which aims to avert a credit crisis like the one after Lehman . Brothers collapsed in 2008. The . Dow jumped 490 points in its biggest gain since March 2009 - rising 4.2 . per cent to close at 12,045. The S&P was up 52 points to 1,245; and . the Nasdaq jumped 105 points to 2,620. This move, akin to interest rate cuts, gives credit markets extra liquidity by effectively providing banks with unlimited U.S. dollars to fund themselves. 'Cutting swap costs is the equivalent of interest rate cuts. The banks will be hoping this is a turning point in the crisis,' economist Jeremy Cook said. But last night John Higgins, . of the Capital Economics research consultancy, . said the central banks’ intervention would provide temporary relief for . Europe, but warned that it was ‘not a game changer’. He added: ‘Welcome . as the news was, we do not think it signals a turning point in the . crisis.’ In a bleak assessment of the crisis engulfing Europe, a UK government spokesman said: ‘We are experiencing a credit crunch.’ The surprise plan was aimed at preventing global financial markets from coming under pressure that could potentially lead to a seizing up of credit. For November, the Dow edged up 0.76 per . cent, but the S&P fell 0.50 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite . dropped 2.39 per cent overall. Gesture: Specialist Michael McDonnell, right, works with traders on the floor of the stock exchange today . Huge increase: The Dow jumped 490 points in its biggest gain since March 2009 - rising 4.2 per cent . The Federal Reserve has joined with other central banks to kick-start the global economy. They want to make it easier for banks to get dollars when needed and avert a credit crunch. Non-U.S. banks need dollars to fund American operations and make dollar loans to firms. But banks are afraid to lend because nobody is sure who holds bad government debt. If a European government defaults then it will probably put the U.S. back into recession, so it is in everyone's interests to avoid this. The central banks will reduce the cost of temporary dollar loans offered to banks - called liquidity swaps - to a half percentage point. The Fed noted banks were not having difficulty now getting funds in short-term markets - but it still has a ‘range of tools’ for use as a backstop. Britain’s FTSE closed up 3.2 per cent to 5,505, the DAX in Germany was up 5 per cent to 6,089 and France’s CAC was up 4.2 per cent to 3,155. Traders said the move recalled the co-ordinated action to steady global markets that was taken during the 2008 financial crisis. Economist Mark Cliffe said policymakers are ‘beginning to address the problem’. He stated there was a ‘very dark mood’ developing last week. Mr Cliffe added that policymakers must step in with ‘aggressive measures’ and begin to ‘confront the financing problems of the sovereigns’. Other economists welcomed the move but warned that a lot of work remains to deal with the underlying sovereign debt crisis. Variations: This is a colour-coded table of credit ratings of euro zone nations, as well as the U.S. and Japan . Compared: This graphic charts latest growth forecasts for major world economies from the OECD . Silvio Perruzzo said 'the ECB has more scope to go' and it is expected to announce more measures in its next policy meeting on December 8. 'Cutting swap costs is the equivalent of interest rate cuts. The banks will be hoping this is a turning point in the crisis'Jeremy Cook . 'Doing more on the collateral side is probably the second step. The ECB is helping the banking system while sovereigns do their homework,' he said. The shock agreement came as European Union finance ministers met in Brussels to discuss radical plans to address the debt crisis. It could see member states handing over control of their finances. Leaders have been warned they have 10 days to complete a crisis response. Euro zone ministers agreed detailed . plans to leverage the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSF), but . warned they may have to turn to the IMF for more help to avert . financial disaster. Europe trouble: The giant Euro sign is seen in the centre of the protest camp Occupy Frankfurt in front of the European Central Bank in Germany . Olli Rehn, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, said: 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union.' Italian and Spanish bond yields resumed . their inexorable climb towards unsustainable levels on today, as markets . assessed the rescue fund boost as inadequate. 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union' Olli Rehn . It comes as stock markets rose after buoyant consumer confidence figures renewed optimism in the strength of the U.S. economy. Europe's ongoing battle to contain its debt crisis will remain a key driver in markets for a while to come, especially if countries continue having to pay elevated interest rates to get investors to lend to them. Italy was yesterday forced to pay a high interest rate on an auction of three-year debt. The 7.89 per cent rate was nearly three percentage points higher than last month. If Italy was to default on its debt of 1.9 trillion euros, the fallout would damage the euro and send shock waves throughout the global economy.","Dow Jones surges as Wall Street markets jump more than four per cent .

"By . Mark Duell and Louise Boyle . Last updated at 9:28 PM on 30th November 2011 . Gary Giordano - the man held in Aruba . over the disappearance of missing Robyn Gardner - arrived home in the . U.S. today after he walked free from an island jail Tuesday. The 50-year-old businessman was taken . into custody four months ago after his lover vanished during a five-day . trip to the Dutch Caribbean island - but he was free to leave on . Tuesday night. Giordano arrived in Miami shortly before . noon Wednesday on an American Airlines flight accompanied by his attorney Jose Baez, who represented Casey . Anthony in her murder trail this year. Scroll down for video . Back in America: Gary Giordano arrived in Miami today after spending four months in an Aruban jail on suspicion of involvement in the death of Robyn Gardner. He could still be extradited back to the Caribbean island . Freed: Gary Giordano, right, is pictured with attorney Jose Baez, left, following his release from custody four months after his lover vanished during a five-day trip to the Dutch Caribbean island . After and before: Giordano is pictured leaving jail, left, and arriving at jail in August, right - with a lot more hair . A video of Giordano leaving jail, before he was seen in an SUV with his lawyers wearing a baseball hat, showed him with remarkably less hair than was previously seen in his mugshot and older videos. Giordano, a Gaithersburg, Md., resident denies any wrongdoing over Miss Gardner's disappearance. He was freed after a judge ruled authorities lacked . enough evidence to continue holding him. Prosecutors have appealed and . await a ruling. Giordano said nothing as he got off the plane. He, Baez and another man . and woman went into American Airlines' private club. It was unclear if . Giordano was awaiting another flight. Giordano will appear on ABC's 'Good Morning America' on Thursday to tell his side of the story. He was told investigators still consider . him a suspect, an Aruba appeals court could put him back behind bars as . early as today and the island's chief prosecutor proclaimed: 'This is . not over'. Aruban defense attorney Chris Lejuez said that his client did not plan on waiting around for Wednesday's hearing. Lejuez said he did not know Giordano's immediate destination but said it . would either be Miami, New York or home to the Washington area. Although Giordano was free to leave the island, a spokesman for the . prosecutor's office said he could be extradited back to Aruba if . necessary. Baez said Giordano, the divorced, 50-year-old owner of an employment . services business, is looking forward to returning home to spend time . with his family. Missing: Ms Gardner is said to have met Giordano on a swingers' website and they travelled together to Aruba on July 31 . Lovers: Giordano, right in Miami today, claims Robyn Gardner disappeared while they were snorkelling . Baez said on ABC's 'Good Morning America' that Giordano wants to spend . time with this children and plans on trying to 'reassemble his life' after nearly four months in jail. Mr Baez said: 'We're hoping that of . course this is the end of it. However, he's not running. So if they have . a legal basis to require him . to come back, he's going to come back.' Giordano has said that Gardner, a 35-year-old from Frederick, Maryland, . was swept out to sea while they were snorkeling in the late afternoon . Aug. 2 off the southern tip of Aruba . Jose Baez propelled himself to become one of America's most high-profile defence lawyers after the Casey Anthony murder trial. The 43-year-old led the team who successfully defended the Florida mother accused of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008. He was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in New York City and Florida with his single mother. Mr Baez ran two bikini companies then became a qualified lawyer in 2005 before the landmark  Anthony case consumed all of his time. Prosecutors said they were still . trying to build a case against him and will seek his extradition if an . appeal's court ruling issues a reversal and orders the businessman back . to jail. ‘Gary Giordano is happy to be out of . prison, yet he is very uneasy,’ said his Aruban attorney, Chris Lejuez. ‘He still feels something could go wrong and he could be back in . prison.’ ‘The case does not end here,’ Aruba's solicitor general Taco Stein said. ‘Mr. Giordano will remain our prime suspect.’ Aruban law allows for pre-trial . detention while authorities investigate a crime, but it is subject to a . judge's review and the threshold of evidence necessary to hold someone . increases as time goes on. A judge ruled last week that . prosecutors had not met the requirement and ordered the release of . Giordano, who is from Gaithersburg, Maryland. The appeals court agreed to hear . prosecutors' challenge to the order at a closed hearing on Wednesday, . and authorities expect a decision later in the day. Giordano has been a suspect since . August 5, three days after reporting to police that Gardner was . apparently pulled out to sea while they were snorkelling off the . southern tip of Aruba. Her body has never been found despite . extensive searches, leaving investigators with only a circumstantial . case that a crime was even committed. Home sweet home: Gary Giordano's house in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It is unclear where he will go now, but his lawyers said if he was extradited back to Aruba he would return . ‘The prosecution conducted extensive . investigations that either confirmed his story or brought up nothing . relevant to the case,’ Mr Lejuez said. ‘Up to this moment there is no proof whatsoever that a crime has been committed or that Giordano may have committed a crime.’ ‘Up to this moment there is no proof whatsoever that a crime has been committed or that Giordano may have committed a crime' Chris Lejuez . Mr Stein added: ‘The investigation must have yielded enough evidence to draft a charge. And we are not in that position yet.’ The case has been compared to that of . Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, who disappeared on Aruba in May 2005 . on the last night of her high school graduation trip to the island. Her body was also never found and the . prime suspect was detained for months before he was eventually released . for lack of evidence. Kelly Reed, a cousin of Ms Gardner's, . said the family hopes attention to the case will generate a lead that . will help investigators resolve the case. Leaving jail: Giordano was told investigators still consider him a suspect, an Aruba appeals court could put him back behind bars as early as today . Out at last: Giordano made an emotional phone call from his hotel room after his release in Aruba . ‘Needless to say, our family is very . disappointed that even after all this time, we are no closer to finding . out what happened to our Robyn,’ the cousin said. ‘We trust that the FBI and the Aruban authorities will continue their fervent efforts to investigate her disappearance.’ 'The investigation must have yielded enough evidence to draft a charge. And we are not in that position yet' Taco Stein . Giordano, the divorced owner of an . employment services company, first drew suspicion with what . investigators felt were inconsistencies in his account of Ms Gardner's . disappearance. Later, they learned he had taken out a . $1.5million accidental death policy on her, which Mr Stein said was . viewed as a possible motive. Ms Gardner's friends and family also . had serious doubts about her disappearance, saying it was unlikely the . 35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, would have gone snorkelling . anyway. The pair had gone travelling with each . other on July 31 after reportedly meeting on a swingers' website called . Adult Friend Finder and were last seen at an island bar at 4pm on . August 2. Last sighting: Ms Gardner, 35, leaves the Rum Reef Restaurant in Nanki with Giordano on August 2 . CCTV video emerged showing them having . a violent fight hours before she disappeared. He allegedly threatened . to kill his friend while grabbing her by the neck and shoving her into a . lift. 'The case does not end here. Mr. Giordano will remain our prime suspect' Taco Stein . A team of cadaver dogs from the . Netherlands were brought in at the end of September but were . unsuccessful in the search of the Dutch Caribbean island. Police also investigated a National . Enquirer report that she was buried alive in a dog’s grave dug up by her . lover who taped a plastic bag over her head. Aruban law allows authorities to hold . someone as a suspect while they investigate an alleged crime. It is . common for people to be held for months before being released without . charge. Free: Gary Giordano was released from prison in Aruba earlier this evening after being held for four months as the only suspect in the disappearance of Robyn Gardner . His American lawyer, Jose Baez, said . in the defence team was grateful for the judge's ruling and that . Giordano was 'excited to return home to his family in the United . States'. 'Needless to say, our family is very disappointed that even after all this time, we are no closer to finding out what happened to our Robyn. We trust that the FBI and the Aruban authorities will continue their fervent efforts to investigate her disappearance' Kelly Reed . Now in the U.S. he is free to file a claim to redeem the American Express travel insurance . policy he took out on Ms Gardner. American Express could not confirm . Giordano has such a policy but said anyone making such a claim would . have to produce documentation such as a death certificate and any police . reports. No claim would be paid if it turned . out there was fraud or 'anything untoward' that would void the policy, . an American Express spokesman said. Mr Stein said authorities have been . conducting active searches for Ms Gardner's body and last week sent . divers and underwater robots to search in the area where Giordano . reported her missing. They are also awaiting additional . forensic evidence, including an FBI analysis of Giordano's Blackberry. Mr Stein and investigators are not convinced by Giordano’s version of . events.

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 9:31 AM on 1st December 2011 . Hillary Clinton today made the first visit to Burma by a U.S. Secretary of State for more than 50 years. The diplomatically fraught trip, which will include face-to-face meetings with former members of the military junta, is aimed at persuading Burma to sever military and nuclear ties with North Korea. During the visit, Mrs Clinton will also visit opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was freed from detention earlier this year. Historic: Hillary Clinton, arriving in Naypyidaw, is the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit Burma in more than 50 years . New ground: Mrs Clinton will visit former members of the Burma military junta, as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi . 'I am obviously looking to determine for myself and on behalf of our government what is the intention of the current government with respect to continuing reforms both political and economic,' she said after arriving in the capital Naypyidaw. 'We and many other nations are quite hopeful that these flickers of progress... will be ignited into a movement for change that will benefit the people of the country.' Mrs Clinton was greeted at Naypyidaw's airfield by a deputy foreign minister, but her presence appears to have taken second stage to the expected arrival tomorrow of the prime minister of Belarus. Posters have been put up for his visit, and Belarus has a similar human rights' record to Burma. Officials said she was seeking assurances from Burma's leaders that they will sign an agreement with the UN nuclear watchdog that will permit unfettered access to suspected nuclear sites. Entourage: Mrs Clinton's motorcade drives through the capital Naypyidaw, but she received a modest welcome . Ceremony: Local police officers salute as Mrs Clinton drives past. The visit is diplomatically fraught because of Burma's human rights record . The U.S. and other Western nations suspect Burma has sought and received nuclear advice along with ballistic missile technology from North Korea. The trip is the first major development in U.S.-Burma relations in decades and comes after the Obama administration launched a new effort to promote reform in 2009. America's special envoy to Burma has made three trips to the country in the last three months. Reforms: A farmer drives is ox carriage in the heart of Burma. The country has undergone decades of brutal rule by successive military juntas . North Korea today said it is making rapid progress on enriching uranium and building a light-water nuclear power plant. A statement from the Foreign Ministry said that North Korea has a sovereign right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and that 'neither concession nor compromise should be allowed'. Concerns about its atomic capability took on renewed urgency in November 2010 when it disclosed a uranium enrichment facility that could give it a second route to manufacture nuclear weapons. North Korea has been building a light-water reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex since last year. Such a reactor is ostensibly for civilian energy purposes, but it would give the country a reason to enrich uranium. At high levels, uranium can be used in nuclear bombs. Washington has said the reactor would violate UN Security Council resolutions. President Thein Sein, a former army . officer, has pushed reforms forward after decades of repression under . successive military regimes which cancelled the 1990 elections that Suu . Kyi's National League for Democracy party won. Last week, Burma's parliament approved a law guaranteeing the right to protest, which had not previously existed, and improvements have been made in areas including media and internet access. But the government that took office in March is still dominated by a military-proxy political party and commitments to democratisation and a willingness to limit ties with China are uncertain. Corruption is rampant and hundreds of political prisoners remain jailed. Burma's army continues to torture and kill civilians in campaigns to stamp out some of the world's longest-running insurgencies. China laid down a marker ahead of Mrs Clinton's trip by having its vice president meet the head of Burma's armed forces on Monday. The country also remains subject to tough sanctions that prohibit Americans and U.S. companies from most commercial transactions in the country.","Secretary of State's visit overshadowed by that of prime minister of Belarus on Friday, for whom posters have been put up .

"By . Stewart Maclean . Last updated at 9:31 AM on 1st December 2011 . A south African businessman was today fined £610 after he spilled a drink on the country's president Jacob Zuma. Daryl Peense, 34, was ordered to pay up or face two months in prison after he was convicted of assault over the incident. The company boss was found guilty in July when a court heard he deliberately tipped a glass of whisky on Mr Zuma, 69, last year at a race course. Victim: A court ruled president Jacob Zuma (pictured) was assaulted by Daryl Peense after the businessman spilled a drink over him . The father of one, who runs an online betting firm, has always claimed the incident was an accident. Today he told of his relief that he had avoided a custodial sentence over the spillage but said he was angry that he had been prosecuted at all. He said: 'This was a total over-reaction to a silly incident. 'They said I deliberately spilled my drink but that's simply not true. 'I'm relieved today as they had warned me I might get sent to prison, but it still feels like a heavy-handed sentence. Assault: Peense was arrested and charged following his encounter with Mr Zuma last July at a racing event in the city of Durban (pictured) 'I'm angry that they prosecuted me at all for something so stupid and will have to live with a criminal record now forever.' Today's sentencing came after Peense was arrested and charged following his encounter with Mr Zuma last July at a racing event in the city of Durban. The businessman was held when of the president's bodyguards told police he saw him deliberately tipping his drink over Mr Zuma from a balcony. This whole thing has been a total nightmare. I have had this hanging over me for more than a year and am badly out of pocket with all the legal fees. Daryl Peense . Mr Zuma had been attending the event with an entourage and was walking around the VIP enclosure when Peense spotted him from a first floor private box. The court heard one of the president's companions used his jacket to deflect the liquid as it fell from above. Peense, from Alberton, near Johannesburg, admitted spilling his Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky but claimed he had done so accidentally. His lawyer told the court he was drunk at the time of the incident, which happened at 4pm. A magistrate today handed him the £610 fine or a four month prison sentence, of which two months were suspended.

"By . Paul Harris . Created 3:15 PM on 14th September 2011 . A UN adviser today compared the eviction of residents at Europe's largest illegal travellers' site to the plight of millions in Zimbabwe as he accused a council of  'violating international law'. In an extraordinary visit to Dale Farm, in Essex, Professor Yves Cabannes claimed Basildon Council had broken human rights legislation in three ways. Speaking outside one of the traveller's homes, with the UN flag hoisted behind him, the UN adviser for forced evictions also drew parallels with China and Nigeria - both notorious for human rights abuses. 'Human rights violation': UN adviser Yves Cabannes, front, held a press conference at Dale Farm travellers' site . He . also said that it was the council, not the Dale Farm residents, who . were 'abusing the law', despite the presence of 400 people on illegal . plots at the site. Those . living at the site illegally are due to be evicted from Monday, but . despite claims this will leave them homeless it was revealed today that . one of the Dale Farm travellers is masterminding a multi-million-pound . property development in Ireland. Professor Cabannes said: 'A study which I led on forced eviction found that at Dale Farm, and the UK in general, the Government is violating international human rights law on three points. 'These are the right to adequate housing, the right to be defended from forced eviction and discrimination.' Prof Cabannes argued that Basildon Council had failed to provide the pitches it should make available to travellers. Outburst: Prof Chabannes, speaking in front of the UN flag, compared the eviction to human-rights abuses in Zimbabwe, China and Nigeria . Conference: Residents and Press watch the UN adviser's controversial speech . He added: 'The people who are abusing the law are the council, not the travellers. The council is not fulfilling its duties. 'There are many Dale Farms which face these issues every day and there needs to be a co-ordinated approach across the country. 'We . are used to see millions of people losing their homes in Zimbabwe, . China and Nigeria - how is one country unable to solve the problem of 51 . pitches?' His visit came as there were signs of travellers beginning to leave the site voluntarily. At least five caravans are believed to have left last night. The eviction is due to start on Monday and follows a decade-long row over illegal plots. Prepared: A large police operation is planned for the eviction on Monday to ensure it passes off peacefully . Moving on: Reports have emerged that several Dale Farm families have already started to leave the site . Although half of the site is legal, an estimated 400 people are said to be living on 51 unauthorised plots. Travellers and supporters say they will resist the eviction peacefully but police are preparing a major operation to ensure the Basildon Council-led operation passes off peacefully. Council leader Tony Ball said: 'For . 10 years we have sought a peaceful and humanitarian solution to Dale . Farm, but it must be one that involves upholding the law of our country. 'The . current site has been illegally developed. After 10 years, when we have . exhausted the judicial process and every effort to negotiate, we have . no option but to resort to direct action to clear the site. 'The . travellers can find a culturally appropriate answer to their housing . problem but it must involve a site with the proper planning permission. 'The . UN ""representative"" may not be aware that Basildon provides more . approved traveller sites than any other local authority area in Essex . and among the greatest number on any area in the country. We have a very . strong record of working with travellers within the law. 'The . UN refers to the rights of the families involved. Basildon Council . respects those along with the rights of the vast majority of its . residents who want this illegal camp moved after 10 years of stalling . tactics by the travellers.' Battle: Police will start to remove families from the Dale Farm site in Essex on Monday . Protest: A traveller family demonstrates against the eviction during Prof Chabannes' visit to Dale Farm . A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'The British courts have found that the developments at Dale Farm are in breach of planning law and Basildon District Council is within its rights to evict travellers from the site. 'It has taken 10 years of failed negotiations and legal process to reach this point, and the unprecedented level of unauthorised development on green belt land has severely damaged community relations.' Prof . Cabannes' accusation comes on the day when it was revealed that a Dale . Farm traveller controls a large development in Ireland. Planning records show that Michael Quilligan, the son of a traveller worth £24million, . is the mastermind behind a multi-million-pound development in the town . of Rathkeale, the spiritual home of travellers in the west of Ireland. The . large detached and semi-detached houses - worth up to £400,000 - are . close to completion and are near to the local equivalent of . millionaires' row, where other substantial gated properties can be . found. Defiant: Travellers living at the Dale Farm site in Essex have vowed to remain there . Mr Quilligan is thought to have sold some of the properties to other travellers. It . is unclear whether Dale Farm residents are among the buyers but one . local report yesterday claimed that a dozen of the families facing . eviction have bought homes in Rathkeale. Members of Basildon Council, which is responsible for clearing the Dale Farm site, are calling for an urgent investigation. This latest twist in the saga blows apart the travellers’ claims that there is nowhere ‘culturally sensitive’ for them to go if they are evicted. Their links with Rathkeale – where around half of the town’s properties are owned by travellers – suggest they have a perfect retreat in their native land. Evictions: The 10-year battle to remain at Dale Farm was lost earlier this month . It also emerged yesterday that Basildon Borough Council had paid housing benefits for some of the Dale Farm travellers directly to a landlord based in Rathkeale. John Flynn, 55, bought the former scrapyard at Dale Farm for £120,000 ten years ago and owns about five caravan pitches on the site. The council admitted it paid money directly to Mr Flynn at an address in Rathkeale to cover the rent of his tenants, who were allowed to claim housing benefits, despite living on an illegal site. Many of the homes in Rathkeale remain boarded up apart from a few months a year and at Christmas when a cavalcade of UK-registered Range Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs and Porsches roll into the town, pulling caravans behind them. Extravagant traveller weddings and christenings in the local Roman Catholic church add to the carnival atmosphere over the Christmas period. Time to move: The illegal site at Dale Farm covers 51 plots and houses around 400 people . Mr Quilligan, a father of four, runs a business called Michael Quilligan Building Contractor and is the son of Rathkeale’s wealthiest traveller, Simon ‘Sammy Buckshot’ Quilligan, an antiques dealer. John Dornan, a Tory councillor in Essex, said: ‘I have long called for an inquiry into the funding of the site. ‘This new information needs to be looked at by the council to compare it with any homeless applications and housing benefits claims. ‘I do not want to prejudice any investigation, but if any of the same people are involved, it would have huge implications.’ Dale Farm, built on green belt land near Basildon, came to the attention of planners around ten years ago when illegal plots started springing up around a smaller approved site. Under construction: The multi-million pound development of large detached homes in Rathkeale in the west of Ireland . Since then it has grown into a 400-strong community of travellers who have built roads and connections to electricity. Bailiffs and police are planning to start removing travellers on the illegal camp from Monday after the council won a High Court battle to evict them. The travellers and supporters . revealed today they have collected a 7,000-strong petition supporting calls to . halt the eviction until suitable alternatives are explored in full. They also presented a letter from Sir . Richard Jolly, a former UN official, expressing concerns that the . clearance may contravene the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Campaigner Grattan Puxon said: 'It is not to late for us to stop this. We have three planning applications lodged and will be returning to the High Court tomorrow to try to stop the eviction.'","UN adviser Yves Cabannes says the UK is breaking travellers' human rights three times over .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 12:40 PM on 1st December 2011 . A Pakistan-born businessman - who last year failed in his bid to buy an NFL team - has struck it second time lucky with the $760 million purchase of the Jacksonville Jaguars. Shahid 'Shad' Khan made headlines in 2010 when he was outmanoeuvred in the buying of St Louis Rams by minority owner Stan Kroenke. Kroenke - who also owns a majority stake in English Premier League soccer team Arsenal - exercised an option giving him matching rights on any outside bids. But 61-year-old Illinois-based entrepreneur Khan's dream of having his very own franchise has now come true - as he takes over from Wayne Weaver as sole owner. Scroll down for video... In with the new: Shahid Khan (left) has bought the Jacksonville Jaguars from Wayne Weaver (right) He has reportedly used $350 million of debt to finance the deal. Weaver said this week: 'We had to have an exit strategy. It's a little bittersweet that it's come as soon as it has.' Khan, who will formally address the press on Monday before the team's game against the San Diego Chargers, will officially take over at the end of the season. And, despite rumours he was thinking of moving the team from its base in northern Florida to Los Angeles, reports suggests he will keep the team in Jacksonville. At the same time, general manager Gene Smith has had his contract extended, while head coach Jack Del Rio, who has run the team since 2003, has been fired. Mel Tucker will take over in his place. Dress code: The Jacksonville Jaguars' team colours are alternated between teal, black and gold . If the deal is approved by the league, the Pakistan-born U.S. citizen will become the first minority to have a controlling owner of an NFL team. Born in Pakistan, moved to the U.S. aged 16 - now aged 61, he is married to Ann Khan. Attended University of Illinois to study engineering . In his 20s, founded Bumper Works firm - developed one-piece bumper design for trucks, making them more durable as not prone to rusting . Bought Flex-N-Gate Group in 1980 - the firm has a full roster of car makers as clients - employs 12,500 people at 57 global sites . A philanthropist - recently donated $10million for Khan Annex to Huff Hall, home of University of Illinois's college of Applied Health Sciences . Has given millions of dollars to other causes . Contributed primarily to Republican candidates in national races . But also gave $100,000 to Chicago campaign of Democrat Rahm . Emanuel, chief of staff for Barack Obama . A federal review of Khan's tax returns from 1999 to 2003 identified five transactions 'potentially abusive tax shelters' Documents filed in court alleged he tried to shelter $250 million to cut tax liability by $85 million . Khan later told the The News-Gazette newspaper in Illinois he had fully paid the money in dispute, which he said was about $68 million. He also said he hoped to recover the money through litigation - a lawsuit by Khan against the IRS is still pending in U.S. Tax Court . He is also pursuing suits against his former financial advisers who helped set up the tax shelters . Weaver said: 'This gentleman is absolutely the American story. He's going to buy a home here in Jacksonville. He's going to spend time here in Jacksonville. 'He's going to keep the Jaguars management group intact. He's keeping the Jaguars staff intact. 'He has a great admiration for what we've been able to accomplish here and the way we run our business here so he's keeping all that intact. 'This is going to be a team that is going to be in Jacksonville many years into the future. It's going to see my grandson grow up as a Jaguars fan and many other kids as well. 'My dream is to see this team be successful in Jacksonville and I found an owner who has that commitment and has that passion.' Although Khan has initially said he will keep the team in Jacksonville, there is nothing written in the deal which legally binds him to do so. Weaver added: 'It's pretty hard to put something in writing saying you have to do something, but you have to trust individuals' integrity and I have no doubt that Shahid is going to do what he plans to do. 'I had to be comfortable that his plan was to keep the team in Jacksonville. There's not a doubt in my mind that this team will be in Jacksonville. 'I have enough confidence in my trust in human nature in people I've gotten to know over a long period of time, that when they tell you something, you can depend on it. 'It's hard to write something that forces somebody to say you're going to keep the team here. 'The only reason I would have ever moved the team is if I couldn't make it sustain itself here and we've been able to do that and there's no reason Shahid won't be able to do that.' Khan, who is the owner of the automobile parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate, which Forbes says has an annual revenue of $2.57 billion, released the following statement after Weaver's press conference. He said: 'I am honoured to have recently signed an agreement with Wayne Weaver and his partners to purchase the Jacksonville Jaguars. 'I have known Wayne for some time and have long admired his spirit, which nearly 20 years ago - against all odds - helped make the Jaguars and the National Football League a reality for Jacksonville and North Florida. 'Wayne's legacy will be lasting, and I will always be grateful for Wayne's trust and confidence in my commitment to the Jaguars, the NFL and the people of the Jacksonville community.'

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 1:00 PM on 30th November 2011 . American Airlines today moved to reassure passengers that their airmiles and existing bookings were safe, but analysts fear the company's bankruptcy filing may affect future plans. The stricken company sent a letter to its frequent flyers saying: 'We want to assure you that your AAdvantage miles are secure'. It also re-asserted its intent to honor existing program awards and promised to honour tickets. In trouble: American Airlines and American Eagle's parent companies are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . It comes as the new CEO admitted there will be tough times ahead, but vowed to turn the company around. 'The path ahead will be tough', Thomas . Horton told NBC's Nightly News program. 'But it's a well-trodden path . and we will make the company successful.' Analysts said passengers would not notice little difference in the short term. 'I think everything's cool,' said Tom . Parsons, head of deals website Bestfares (bestfares.com) and a long-time . observer of the airline industry. 'I have almost 300,000 miles with American, and there's no sweat on my brow.' But the reorganisation of American . Airlines and its parent company AMR Corp could lead to a shakeup in . prices, fewer flights and an altered flying experience, it was warned (see Q&A panel below). The company yesterday filed for . Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a desperate push to unload huge debt from years . of rising fuel prices and labour costs. Reshuffle: The third largest U.S. airline also said its CEO Gerard Arpey, left, will step down and be replaced by Thomas Horton, right - its current president . The third-biggest airline in the U.S. wants to reduce costs and its $30billion debt to stay competitive but insists the restructure will not affect flights. The move to bankruptcy protection is a crushing blow to an iconic brand and represents an alarming symbol of America’s dying economy. Jet fuel cost an average of $3 per gallon so far this year - a record according to government data that goes back to 1990. Jet fuel is more expensive now than the average of $2.96 per gallon in 2008, when oil rose above $147 per barrel for the first time. It has risen 56.4 per cent in the past five years. The average price of jet fuel was $1.92 per gallon in 2006. Parent firm AMR - based in Fort . Worth, Texas - along with regional affiliate AMR Eagle Holding, are . filing voluntary bankruptcy petitions to reorganise. The third largest U.S. airline also . said its CEO Gerard Arpey will step down and be replaced by Thomas . Horton - currently the company's president. American was the only major U.S. airline that didn't file for bankruptcy protection after the 9/11 . attacks on New York and Washington D.C. The last major airline to file for bankruptcy protection was Delta in 2005. Labour costs are a big headache for American. It remains the only major airline that still must fund worker pensions. Big business: The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York . American says labour-contract rules . force it to spend at least $600million more than other airlines. It has . also struggled with rising jet fuel costs. American lost $162million in the third quarter and has lost money in 14 of the last 16 quarters. The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York. ‘We plan to initiate further . negotiations with all of our unions to reduce our labour costs to . competitive levels,’ Mr Horton said. Q: Are my airmiles safe? For now. Airlines tend to protect their mileage programs throughout bankruptcy, airline analyst Tom Parsons said, because they make money selling miles to credit card issuers and even passengers trading in miles fill seats and spend money. But Morningstar airline expert Basili Alukos said that could change. 'My hunch is that, when they come out of bankruptcy, they may make them more difficult to redeem,' he said. 'From what I understand, they can change this whenever they want.' Q: Will my current reservations be honoured? Booked flights are secure as American said it would operate its regular schedule and honor tickets and reservations. But American could reduce its number of flights. That could mean that not all routes would continue indefinitely. Q: Will prices go up or down? American may cut prices to keep planes full, particularly in anticipation of a slow January and February, but those are typical sale periods for the airlines. But the longer-term impact of an airline bankruptcy is higher ticket prices, not lower ones. As American uses this reorganization to get rid of many big, pricey, old planes, it may also cut their routes. 'With fewer planes in the sky and fewer seats, you may be forced to pay more,' said Mr Parsons. Q: Will flights be safe? Federal safety inspectors have stepped up their surveillance of American Airlines and American Eagle (also owned by AMR), according to the Federal Aviation Administration. 'The FAA acts swiftly to aggressively protect the safety of the traveling public any time an airline files for bankruptcy protection,' said a spokesperson for the agency. But there's no reason to believe that the bankruptcy filing of such a large airline would lead to safety problems. Q: Will the new American be better? American passengers may notice positive and negative changes in their flights. As the company gives up its older planes, passengers can expect to see more bells and whistles on the new ones. Q: What about the workers? A: With American's 80,000 employees expected to lose some pensions and other benefits, Mr Parsons expects the company's flight attendants to be crankier than usual. 'Those friendly skies will still need some improvement,' he said. AMR's top rivals, UAL Corp and Delta . Air Lines, which both used bankruptcy protection to slash costs, have . since found merger partners. Delta bought Northwest Airlines and UAL Corp bought Continental Airlines to form United Continental Holdings. AMR has been in labour talks with its pilots for five years and a wave of retirements in October had prompted speculation it was nearing a bankruptcy filing. Some analysts believed pilots chose to retire to lock in pension values that may now be in jeopardy as the company moves through bankruptcy court. Long tradition: American Airlines was formed from a group of companies over a ten-year period and started trading on the stock exchange in 1939 . 'They will have to go through the whole process that their peers have gone through,' aviation analyst John Strickland told Bloomberg. Firms use Chapter 11 bankruptcy for gaining time to restructure so they can still stay in operation. This method allows firms to keep many of their assets as they try to become profitable again rather than going straight into liquidation. 'It’s painful but probably necessary. They have fallen behind what others have done.' AMR shares have fallen almost 80 per cent this year. For the 240,000 passengers who fly American Airlines each day, the airline's bankruptcy filing should have little noticeable impact. Delta, United, Continental and US Airways all went through Chapter 11. Their planes still took off and landed and frequent flier miles were still earned and redeemed. The only risk is if the restructuring fails, the airline liquidates and ceases to fly. But travelers who bought tickets by credit card would be protected. 'Miles are safe,' said Gary Leff, co-founder of frequent flier site MilePoint. Days gone by: Air hostesses are pictured in the 1960s wearing American Airline uniforms from 1933 . American was founded in 1930 from the . combination of more than 80 smaller carriers and started trading on the . stock exchange in 1939. Half of its fleet flew for the military airline during World War Two - and it introduced the first domestic scheduled American freight service in 1944. In 1953 it was the first airline to provide a nonstop trans-continental service. Its holding company AMR was formed after a reorganisation in 1982. American is now the nation's third-largest airline behind United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines. It flies about 240,000 passengers per day, has around 78,000 employees and operates out of five major hubs in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and Miami. But AMR has suffered losses of $162million in the third quarter and $2.7billion in the past year.","New CEO admits 'path will be tough' but pledges to turn company around .

A British soldier whose wife is expecting their first child was shot dead in an apparent training ground accident, it was revealed today. James Wilkinson, 21, died on a military training exercise in Kenya where he was apparently shot in the neck. His wife Sarah, who is seven months' pregnant, is still waiting for the Army to give full details surrounding his death on November 26. Fusilier James Wilkinson served with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. He was on a six-week exercise in . Kenya and had been scheduled to be reunited with his wife, who lives in . Radcliffe, Bury, Greater Manchester, on December 17. Mrs Wilkinson was told of the tragedy on Saturday, hours after the fatal shooting incident. But yesterday she said she was upset the Fusiliers had not made a public announcement about her husband’s death. She said: ‘They are doing everything they can for me. I don’t want the news about James’s death to be swept under the carpet. Fusilier Wilkinson was born into a serving Army family in Germany and lived in various locations. He served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (pictured) ‘I was told James had been shot in the neck while on exercise in Kenya. The Army said it was an accident, but I have not been told enough. I don’t think it’s sunk in yet.’ Fusilier Wilkinson was born into a serving Army family in Germany and lived in various locations. Three years ago, he settled in Whitefield where his parents, Jan and Rob, still live. He joined the Army a year ago before undergoing his basic training in Catterick North Yorkshire. Fusilier Wilkinson and his wife met about two years ago, and they were married at St Thomas and St John Church, Radcliffe, at the end of July. Mrs Wilkinson is scheduled to arrive back in the UK today. When asked about Mr Wilkinson's death, a spokesman for the regiment said: ‘We are aware of an incident of that nature. An investigation is under way.’ An MOD spokesperson said: “We regret to confirm that Fusilier James Wilkinson, who was serving with the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died following an incident in Kenya on 26th November. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult and sad time. 'As an organisation of approximately 172,000 service personnel we unfortunately deal with a number of deaths that occur whilst our personnel are not deployed on operations. For these tragic incidents there is a slightly different process, but one which is no less respectful and dignified and provides support to the family.'",Widow: 'I was told James had been shot in the neck while on exercise'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:28 PM on 1st December 2011 . Streaming movies at home is cheaper than going to the cinema, but that may soon change. Cable and pay-TV companies are trying to find the best ways to profit from the rising demand of Internet bandwidth, in large part because of Netflix and Hulu. Some, including giant Time Warner Cable, are on the brink of imposing new fees based on data usage. So long, cheap streaming? Companies like Time Warner are eyeing usage-based payment models . Analyst Craig Moffett of Sanford C. Bernstein and Company in New York said companies like Cox Communications, Charter Communications, or Time Warner could be the first to start charging for the amount of data users consume on the internet, not just bandwidth. ‘As more video shifts to the Web, the cable operators will inevitably align their pricing models,’ Mr Moffett told the Chronicle. ‘With the right usage-based pricing plan, they can embrace the transition instead of resisting it.’ The San Francisco Chronicle reports that high definition offerings on websites like Netflix and Hulu eat up large amounts of data. Netflix creates 32 per cent of peak downstream traffic, according to the 2011 Sandvine Internet Phenomena Report released in October of this year and their streaming video is responsible for nearly 28 per cent of all bandwidth usage nationally. Usage-based pricing is hardly a new idea. U.S. providers have for years debated whether or not to switch to the model in order to gain more profits from increased Web use. According to the Chronicle, these fees may very well become a permanent fixture in customer’s monthly bills. Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen warned that Netflix subscriptions could again inflate. ‘That Netflix subscription of $7.99 could go to an extra $20 a month for bit streaming,’ he said. Data eaters: Programs streamed in high definition on Netflix and Hulu eat up large amounts of data . Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said increasing broadband prices was ‘not in the consumer’s best interest as consumers deserve unfettered access to a robust Internet at reasonable rates.’ ‘As more video shifts to the Web, the . cable operators will inevitably align their pricing models. With the right usage-based pricing plan, they can embrace the transition instead of resisting it.’ -Sanford C. Bernstein and Company analyst . Netflix customers have already received largely unwelcome news this year, when the company announced it would split its subscriptions. Rather than offering mailed DVDs and streaming together, the two were only offered separately, and at higher prices. The model has already taken part in some inception in Dallas, Texas, where AT&T charges DSL customers who exceed a monthly limited of 150GB an extra $10 for every 50GB of data they use. Not every household will consume that kind of data. Comcast generally offers users 250GB per month, which allows 60 standard definition movies to be streamed and 12,000 emails to be sent and received. In December, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski supported publically a usage-based pricing model.","Streaming video sites like Netflix and Hulu eat up Internet data .

You can buy almost anything cheaply at Walmart stores - but one thing you don’t expect to find hidden inside new clothing is a syringe. A mother claimed her daughter was pierced in her finger and left foot by a syringe while putting on a new pair of pyjamas bought at a Georgia store. Five days later another Walmart shopper complained she was struck by a needle while looking at bras, Bartow County authorities said. Concern: Bartow County sheriff's officials are investigating reports of syringes found in new clothing purchased at a Georgia Walmart . ‘Anytime you buy clothing it's always best to check it and make sure there's nothing in there to hurt you,’ Sergeant Jonathan Rogers said. Walmart has done its own searches and found other syringes but no suspects have yet been identified, reported the Daily Tribune News. The woman pricked when she reached inside a boxed bra to ensure it was the right size was identified by local news sources as Patricia Headrick. ‘It's a waiting game right now,’ Mrs Headrick told WXIA. ‘I'm scared to death,' she said, adding that she is worried she could have contracted HIV.

Many employers use Google to 'screen' potential employees - and look at Facebook profiles - but one American job application appears to show the company demanding passwords to get access to private messages on Facebook and Myspace . Could employers demand your Facebook password as part of a job application? One American was shocked to find a section in an application form that demanded not only his user names - but also passwords that would give his employers full access to his account, including private messages to other people. Employers using Google - or 'people search' engines such as 123People - has become a standard part of job applications, and employers also check Facebook. But asking for passwords that allow access to private communications is a worrying new precedent. In a recent YouGov survey, 42 per cent of British students admitted that they worried that posts on 'social' sites could harm their chances with potential employers.At least 20 per cent and reportedly up to half of employers check Facebook accounts as part of the application process.The launch of Google's rival Plus network was largely sold on the ability to 'control' which information was visible - but if employers were able to demand passwords, then even this protection would be invalid. A recent survey by Telstra revealed that 20 per cent of bosses also check employees' Facebook accounts while at the company.One picture, purportedly of a job application for a clerical position with the police in North Carolina, shows a demand for passwords for 'accounts such as Facebook, Myspace, etc'. The application - purportedly for a clerical position with Maryland police - asks for passwords which would allow access to private messages, pictures and even friends' private details . Tecca, the blog which found the job application, commented, 'Would you agree to a full search of your home and worldly possessions in order to land a job? If the answer is no, then you should be just as hesitant to let someone rummage around inside your online identity.'Various online agencies now offer to 'clean' people's online profiles specifically for job applications, and young job applicants often use pseudonyms on Facebook to prevent employers 'snooping'. After a recent scandal about Australian bosses rejecting applicants because of Facebook posts, Mark Bowles, Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist said, 'We're starting to see a trend towards people setting up two Facebook accounts so they can still have an account to share photos with friends and when it comes to befriending workmates and bosses they have a separate account, which they can keep a bit more sterile.' Be careful: What you post online may come back to haunt you later in life . Christopher Graham, the information . commissioner, said: 'In tough times, young people are clearly less . relaxed about privacy, particularly in relation to information that they . post online - but many may not know what they can do about it.' This . survey comes after Acas, the arbitration service, published a new guide . urging employers not to be 'heavy-handed' by penalising staff for . unprofessional comments left on websites. Employers were warned of the risks of 'Googling' potential recruits and using any personal information from the internet. John . Taylor, Acas’s chief executive, has advised bosses to be wary about . disciplining employees for comments made on social networking websites. Students are also not taking the threat of identity fraud seriously enough . He said: They need to consider the . potential impact of any negative publicity. Heavy-handed monitoring can . cause bad feeling and be time consuming. 'A . manager wouldn't follow an employee down the pub to check on what he or . she said to friends about their day at work. Just because they can do . something like this online, doesn't mean they should.' But . at the same time employees need to be cautious about what they post . online. 'Online conduct should not differ from offline conduct,' he . said. Employees should . assume everything said on the internet is public, and should consider . whether they want their colleagues or boss to read it. He said: 'They . might not mean it, but what they post could end up being seen by . billions of people worldwide.' The .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 6:06 PM on 1st December 2011 . A second iPhone 4 has exploded without warning just days after another device blew up on a flight sparking fears over the safety of the phone. Reports from Brazil say that the iPhone 4 was plugged in to charge overnight when it began to emit smoke and sparks as its owner slept nearby. This is the second high-profile explosion of an iPhone in a week, in the first incident the handheld device spontaneously combusted during landing on a flight in Australia two days ago. Battery issues: Customers have had problems with iPhone batteries in the past - but this is the second explosion incident in two days . Tech and mobile website Mashable, which reported the incident, said: 'Looks like Australia isn’t the only country to have seen an incident of a combustible iPhone 4 over the past week. 'According to Brazilian media reports, the iPhone’s owner emerged unscathed but flustered.' In the first incident, an Apple iPhone began ‘emitting a significant amount of dense smoke, . accompanied by a red glow’, said Australia's Regional Express airline. The fire was put out by a flight . attendant and the device, thought to be an iPhone 4, given to air traffic . safety investigators for checks. No passengers or crew were harmed. A picture released by the airline, Australia’s largest independent regional carrier, shows the . rear casing shattered in parts and scorched in others. Apple Australia says it is ‘looking forward to working with officials’. iFlame: An iPhone began smoking after landing in Sydney, Australia. The fire was extinguished by a flight attendant . The cause has yet to be identified . but experts say that it may be due to the phone’s battery overheating or . to the device being a counterfeit model. Earlier this month, Apple recalled . first generation iPod Nano MP3 players over concerns about defective . batteries overheating. However, these devices were made in 2005 and . 2006 and so are much older than the exploding iPhone mobiles. The drama began when the crew smelt . smoke in the cabin as a flight from Lismore in New South Wales landed in . Sydney on Friday evening. In a statement headed ‘mobile phone . self-combustion’, Regional Express said: ‘In accordance with company . standard safety procedures, the flight attendant carried out recovery . action immediately and the red glow was extinguished successfully. ‘All passengers and crew onboard were unharmed.’ It added that it has reported the . incident to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Civil . Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The ATSB, which has listed the . incident as involving ‘smokes, fumes and fire’ will strip down the phone . to ‘try and understand what happened’. A CASA spokesman said that he had never heard of a similar incident occurring during or after a flight. Mobile phone experts said it is possible the fire was caused by the phone’s battery overheating. Rechargeable lithium ion batteries . are widely used in mobile phones and laptops and, when shipped in large . numbers, have been linked to fires on planes in the past. Last year, the Federal Aviation . Administration in the U.S. issued a safety alert after a cargo plane . carrying a large shipment of the batteries went on fire and crashed near . Dubai, killing both pilots. It read: ‘Overheating has the . potential to create thermal runaway, a chain reaction leading to . self-heating and release of a battery’s stored energy. Flames on a plane: The phone ignited on Regional Express Airlines . ‘In a fire situation, the air temperature in a cargo compartment fire may be above the auto-ignition temperature of lithium. ‘For this reason, batteries that are . not involved in an initial fire may ignite and propagate, thus creating a . risk of a catastrophic event. ‘The existence and magnitude of the . risk will depend on such factors as the total number and type of . batteries on board an aircraft, the batteries’ proximity to one another, . and existing risk mitigation measures in place.’ There are also suggestions that the phone – or battery – may have been fake. Rob Temple, of Technology magazine . T3, said: ‘This is a very rare thing and so it makes you suspect it . might be a counterfeit battery. ‘When you think about the number of people who have iPhones and other smartphones, it doesn’t really happen.’ Chris Althaus, of the Australian . Mobile Telecommunications Association, told ABC News: ‘We urge people to . be very careful if they are buying batteries that they buy them from a . reputable dealer, look for products that are identified by the . manufacturer of your phone as compatible and be very aware of cheap . imitations.’ Many iPhone 4 users have already complained that their battery drains faster than expected.","First iPhone had a meltdown onboard Australian flight .

"By . James Chapman and Becky Barrow . Last updated at 2:29 PM on 1st December 2011 . Militant union leaders failed in their campaign to bring Britain to its knees yesterday. David Cameron dismissed as a ‘damp squib’ a strike billed as the biggest for a generation. With picket lines sparsely populated, only a quarter of civil servants took action, the NHS suffered minimal disruption and Britain’s borders operated more smoothly than normal. JobCentres remained open, courts were sitting, rubbish was collected and driving tests  went ahead. Packed: The combination of striking workers and children off school meant thousands descended on the Trafford Centre in Manchester yesterday, triggering a pre-Christmas mini sales boom . Extra . time off: The Trafford Centre saw a rise in numbers that meant the 11,500 capacity car park struggled to cope . In Scotland, Glasgow's Silverburn shopping centre reported 15,000 extra visitors than on a normal weekday . However, schools were severely affected, with almost two in three in England closing their doors, forcing many parents to take a day off work or make emergency childcare arrangements. Union barons insisted the strike, over reforms to generous public sector pensions, had been a ‘historic’ success and claimed two million joined the action. That figure was rubbished by the Cabinet Office, which said it was a wild exaggeration and probably only half that. Ministers appear emboldened by the failure of the action to cripple the country as unions had threatened. In some parts of the country, the combination of striking workers and parents trying to entertain their children on a day off from school triggered a pre-Christmas mini sales boom. Car parks were packed at shopping centres throughout the country. At the Trafford Centre, near Manchester, there were long queues in the 11,500 capacity car park as families waited to go home. Ignored: Three UK Borders Agency workers picket outside their office, in Croydon, but another seems oblivious to the action . Roadblock: Unite members strike outside the Liverpool entrance to the Birkenhead Tunnel which was closed for the day . Two strikers wore their banners outside St Thomas's Hospital in Westminster, London . Empty: Chaos was threatened at Heathrow bur border controls at the airport actually ran more smoothly than usual . Two civilian police workers had . travelled to the centre after an hour on the picket line. A male . fingerprint officer, aged 42, who wouldn’t give his name, said: ‘We’re . here to do some Christmas shopping as we’re on strike.’ His female co-worker, 39, added: ‘I can’t believe it - it’s full of strikers and people with kids.’ Also there was a 26-year-old teacher whose secondary school was closed because of the strike. Clutching three bags, he said: ‘We needed to make a stand but it’s nice to have a day off to buy some presents. ‘I’ve treated myself to some new jeans as well.’ A spokesperson for the centre said: 'Christmas is well and truly underway at The Trafford Centre today, as people take advantage of a mid-week day off. 'Manchester has experienced a huge jump in footfall, compared to the same day last year.' In Gateshead’s thronged MetroCentre, sisters Antonia Howard, 27, and Natasha Plews, 19, who both work for Durham Council, were weighed down by ten shopping bags each – but denied accusations of hypocrisy. March: Protesters make there way down the Royal Mile from Edinburgh Castle during yesterday's strike . An elderly woman pickets outside the House of Parliament . Miss Howard, who refused to cross a picket line for her job in the council’s regeneration department, said: ‘If people see this as an excuse for public-sector workers to have a day off and come shopping, what they have to remember is that we are losing a day’s pay. So it isn’t a day off and there is a good reason for it.’ A spokesperson for the MetroCentre said: ‘It has been a very, very busy day today.’ A spokesman for Brent Cross Shopping Centre, north-west London, said: 'We’ve had a lot of families and parents who have had to look after their kids because of the strike it’s been a great day. 'It’s felt a bit like a busy weekend not a week day.' In the Commons, Mr Cameron launched an extraordinary attack on Labour leader Ed Miliband for expressing sympathy with the strike, describing him as ‘irresponsible,  left-wing and weak’ and claiming the unions paid him to ask questions. Amid increasing signs that senior Tories want to tighten union law, the Prime Minister vowed to end the £130million-a-year taxpayer funding for the salaries of union officials in  the workplace. Other Cabinet ministers want to go further, and are proposing changes to introduce a new threshold for strike ballots to be legitimate and to make strikers give employers more notice of their intention to withdraw their labour. Mr Cameron said he thought  the Government had made a ‘very reasonable, very fair offer to  public-sector workers’, pointing out that a nurse earning £34,000 would currently retire on an  annual pension of £17,000 but would get £22,000 after the Government’s reforms, though money would  be saved through increased  contributions and later  retirement ages. ‘I don’t want to see any strikes, but this government has to make responsible decisions,’ he said. Mr Miliband said he had ‘huge sympathy’ for those whose lives were disrupted by the strike. But he said he was ‘not going to condemn the dinner ladies, nurses, teachers who have made the decision to go on strike because they feel they have been put in an impossible position by a government that has refused to negotiate properly’.","Just a quarter of civil servants take action .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:02 PM on 1st December 2011 . A plane passenger's family have sued American Airlines after he died following an in-flight meal. Othon Cortes died after eating a contaminated chicken meal during an American Airlines flight from Barcelona to New York, according to his relatives. The lawsuit is the latest unwelcome news to hit the stricken airline, which announced earlier this week it had filed for bankruptcy. Othon Cortes died after eating a chicken meal on an American Airlines flight from Barcelona to New York . The widow and daughter of Mr Cortes, 73, have filed a lawsuit against the carrier following his death shortly after the May 18 flight. In their complaint, his widow Raquel and daughter Sandra allege Mr Cortes was served food contaminated with the deadly bacteria, Clostridium perfingens. After landing in New York, they claim Cortes felt sharp stomach cramps and sudden thirst along with a 'clear outward manifestation of severe physical illness'. His condition deteriorated as Cortes, who was travelling with his wife, boarded the next leg of their trip from New York to Miami. It is claimed Cortes suffered nausea, shortness of breath and a 'cardiac event' on the Miami-bound flight. Despite making an emergency landing in Norfolk, VA, tragedy struck and Cortes was pronounced dead shortly after. His family say American Airlines and its catering company Sky Chefs failed to properly maintain or prepare his meal. The in-flight meal eaten by Mr Cortes (not the one pictured) allegedly contained a deadly bacteria . They add that the airline shouldn't have allowed Cortes access to the Miami flight without first finding him medical attention. The Cortes family are now seeking over $1million in damages, but Sky Chefs say they did not cater that flight and are opposing the legal action. American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy two days ago in a desperate push to offload huge debts following years of rising fuel prices and labour costs. The reorganisation of American Airlines and its parent company AMR Corp could lead to a shakeup in prices, fewer flights and an altered flying experience, it was warned. The airline insisted it would honour existing bookings and airmiles for passengers, but experts fear the company's bankruptcy may affect future plans.","Chicken meal contained deadly bacteria, family claim .

Battlefield 3 has been the hit shoot 'em up of 2011 - selling eight million copies with its hyper-realistic depictions of modern urban warfare. But its depictions of assaults with American armoured vehicles have not been a hit everywhere. In Tehran, the game has been banned as 'propaganda', according to reports in an Iranian computer magazine - and young Iranians are also protesting against it online. The game depicts US Marines with authentic weaponry fighting in Middle Eastern countries - but the level in Tehran's Grand Bazaar has caused fury . The 'Grand Bazaar' level that has caused controversy: The bazaar is a historical market in the centre of the country's capital . The 'ban' - enforced by reported raids on computer shops - is due largely to a level called 'Grand Bazaar', which is set in a clearly recognisable area of the Iranian capital. The game's release comes at a time when tensions between the two countries are high - and Iranians are angry that one of the world's largest game companies would use real-world locations. Rival Modern Warfare 3 is careful to have villains who are rogue Russian extremists - after earlier versions set in Middle Eastern countries. The Asr-e Ertebat publication reported a security source as saying, 'All computer stores are prohibited from selling this illegal game.' The (real) Grand Bazaar in Tehran: The bazaar is a historical landmark still in use as a market today . The game uses real American vehicles and weaponry - and the scenario sails a little too close to political reality for both the regime and young Iranians . An online petition has also drawn a reported 5,000 signatures, saying, 'We understand that the story of a videogame is hypothetical but we . believe the game is purposely released at a time when the US is pushing . the international community into fearing Iran.' There have also been unconfirmed reports that shops selling the game have been raided. The ban is unlikely to bother makers Electronic Arts unduly - the game has not been officially released in the territory, and thus all copies sold are liable to be pirated. The Grand Bazaar level shows a small team of US special forces infiltrating real locations in Iran . The game - often played online in teams - features squads of US Marines fighting in cities including Paris as well as Tehran. The 'Grand Bazaar' level is the one that has caused controversy, though - with US forces fighting hostile militia in a clearly recognisable Tehran, including the city's Grand Bazaar. American games set in the Middle East and beyond are nothing new, of course - many titles have been set in Afghanistan or unnamed Far Eastern countries. The US military also releases its own videogame - America's Army - which is designed as both a recruiting tool and a training tool for soldiers. The game is available free online, and again features Middle Eastern locations as some of its battlegrounds.","5,000 signature petition protests game set in Tehran .

It’s one way to guarantee a white Christmas – but as it requires a £20,000 investment and nine months of preparation, it might be easier just to jet off to Lapland. Paul Toole has transformed his bungalow into a winter wonderland, complete with quarter of a mile of fake snow and 50,000 fairy lights which flash in time to his own radio channel. Visitors to his cul-de-sac in Wells, Somerset, are invited to tune in to his station, which plays 11 festive tracks on a loop while a Father Christmas figurine in his garden moves to the beat of each song. Scroll down for video . Twinkling lights: Paul Toole has spent a huge £20,000 on his illuminations and attracts 100 visitors every night . Completely crackers! Mr Toole decorates his bungalow with 50,000 Christmas lights . Lights... action: Mr Toole puts the finishing touches to his display, which he began putting up on October 24 . Up to 100 guests each night arrive to . view the spectacle, which includes a 20ft Christmas tree, an . illuminated waterfall and glowing polar bears, seals and reindeer. Mr . Toole, 36, who runs karaoke nights, begins preparations for each year’s . display in March. He said: 'Walking into our street is quite magical at Christmas. Some people say it makes them feel cold, it is very Arctic. ‘Our bungalow has been nicknamed “the house on Christmas . Street”. I think about it and plan it every single day of the year. ‘I am slightly wacky about Christmas and I am constantly trying to think of ways I can make our display the biggest and best.’ Mr Toole estimates that this year’s display will add around £150 to his . electricity bill – but the money  thrown into the wishing well in his . garden is given to charity. He has spent £20,000 collecting the illuminations since 1998, when he started with two strings of lights in 1998. Magical: The display boasts penguins, polar bears, a ferris wheel and 400 metres of fake snow . Dashing through the snow: A horse and sleigh in the garden in Wells, Somerset . Celebrities John Challis, who played Boycie in Only Fools and Horses, and American singer Judy Pancoast . visited the close for the big switch-on yesterday. Mr Toole added: 'Our . street looks good in the day as well as at night. You can sit in your . car and enjoy the music on your radio, or come out as we have speakers . playing Christmas tunes. 'It really looks fantastic, I feel very proud of it this year.' More than 1,000 people turned out for the switch-on,held in aid of the Make a Wish foundation, and were each given a mince pie from a local bakery. A team from Starbucks also handed out free drinks. Mr Toole has spent a staggering 264 hours synching his lights to his radio . station and the Father Christmas figure - as one minute of music takes . eight hours to sequence. The House on Christmas Street: Visitors flock to see the display, which will be on show from 1 December to 5 January . He began putting up the . decorations on October 24, and his house and garden are covered with 400 . metres of polyester wadding which looks like a blanket of snow. He was inspired to create a 'House on Christmas Street' after visiting New . Hampshire in the U.S. where homeowners deck out their properties with . thousands of festive lights. He . returned home with just two sets of lights and put them on his mother's . bungalow. The lights stopped working a few years later and he began . stocking up on UK-made decorations. A donation wishing well is left at the front of the display - which attracts up to 100 cars a night. Mr Toole's radio station, 89.2FM, is broadcast . from a transmitter a few hundred yards from his home between 5pm and . 9.30pm from December 1 until January 5. He said: 'I am absolutely thrilled by what we have created and it . is worth every penny.' David Cameron appeared to be rather less filled with festive spirit than our merry bungalow owner. While Paul Toole brings glad tidings to all his neighbours, the Prime Minister had kept the best tree on the block for himself. The bushy fir outside No 10 was laden with huge shining baubles and delicate blue lights, but the Norwegian evergreen in nearby Trafalgar Square was looking decidedly crooked. Sad tidings: The famous tree that appears annually in London's Trafalgar Square looks crooked and plainly decorated . Festive joy: But David Cameron, joined by Blue Peter badge holders and presenter Helen Skelton, has a beautiful fir over in Downing Street . Tourists in Central London were rather surprised to discover the traditional Norwegian tree looking extremely ragged. The tall, skinny centrepiece is decorated carelessly with vertical strips of harsh green lights and a stark bulb on the top. Mr Cameron turned on the lights on in Downing Street with presenter Helen Skelton and a group of young Blue Peter gold badge holders - but the public in Trafalgar Square were left out in the cold. It will be a real a disappointment for children who visit the London landmark in the hope of seeing the most impressive festive scene of the season. The Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree is the City of Oslo's traditional Christmas gift to the City of Westminster as a token of thanks for British support during the years of occupation. Perhaps our Prime Minister could demonstrate equal Christmas spirit in his own country. Austerity Britain: The sparse Trafalgar Square tree has been dressed with little visible effort or love .

Egypt is poised to lurch towards Islamic rule as the first free elections in 30 years get under way today. Islamic parties are set for a democratic coup as Egyptians go to the polls nine months after ousting dictator Hosni Mubarak. The main losers are likely to be the ‘Facebook revolutionaries’, who were hailed as the democratic future of the Middle East when the Arab Spring uprisings began in January. Peace: Young children joined in with the protests in Tahrir Square at the weekend . There was further violence in the capital Cairo over the weekend. At least 40 people have been killed in fierce clashes in the past week as protesters demand the resignation of the military. Yesterday Egypt’s military ruler warned of ‘extremely grave’ consequences if the turbulent nation did not pull through its current crisis. Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi said: ‘We will not allow troublemakers to meddle in the elections. Egypt is at a crossroads – either we succeed politically, economically and socially or the consequences will be extremely grave and we will not allow that. None of this would have happened if there were no foreign hands. We will not allow a small minority of people who don’t understand to harm Egypt’s stability.’ Protesters, who were still in Tahrir Square last night, say they are coming under fire from a police sniper. They have put up wanted posters demanding the capture of ‘The Eye Hunter’ – a police marksman accused of shooting people in the eyes with rubber bullets. Ousted: The Arab Spring uprising against Hosni Mubarak began in January . At least five demonstrators have allegedly been blinded in an eye by the sharpshooter named as First Lieutenant Mahmoud Sobhi El Shinawi. He has become a hate figure among the protesters, who have posted a video on the internet said to show El Shinawi taking aim with his rifle and being congratulated by a colleague on scoring another ‘bull’s eye’ hit. El Shinawi has been ordered by Egypt’s . general prosecutor to submit to questioning over the suspected . shootings. Today’s election is the first of three rounds of voting . spread over two months. But voters face the choice of a bewildering array of 6,000 candidates and dozens of parties and coalitions. It . is expected to be dominated by the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood. Analysts think they could win roughly a third of votes, likely to be far . greater than the hundreds of small parties who will each get only a . fraction of the vote. The Brotherhood’s popularity stems mainly from working-class Egyptians. Outgunned . and outnumbered, liberal candidates are not expected to fare as well. The Social Democratic Party – a grouping of prominent intellectuals who . believe in a market-based economy – has already announced it is . withdrawing from the parliamentary race because of the pre-election . violence. After voting today and tomorrow, two further ballots are planned for the rest of the country on December 14 and January 3. The final election results will be announced on January 13. News of the Muslim Brotherhood’s likely victory comes as an Islamic party is set to form a government in Morocco for the first time in the North African country’s history. Nationwide election results yesterday indicated an overall majority for the Islamic Justice and Development Party (PJD). Although the PJD is considered a moderate party, its success will concern those who believe that religious parties will weaken western influence in the region. Al-Qaeda has struck several times in the country in recent years, including a bomb attack in the tourist city of Marrakesh in April which killed 17, including a Briton. Last month saw Tunisia – the country where the Arab Spring started – electing Ennahda, another moderate Islamic party. Truce: Fighting may have stopped in Tahrir Square, but it has not stopped protesters from taunting police . Protest: At least 35,000 protesters had crowded into Tahrir Square as riot police and military fired tear gas around government buildings last week . Abdelilah Benkirane, the PJD leader who is now set to become prime minister of Morocco, said his party was not made up of Islamic fundamentalists looking to introduce sharia law. ‘We are not trying to set up a religious regime, or a Caliphate, as some suggest,’ he said. ‘This is absurd. We are in the year 2011. ‘We want true democracy and a better life for Moroccans.’ While near-neighbours including Tunisia, Egypt and Libya saw their despotic rulers deposed or  murdered following the Arab Spring rebellions, Morocco has avoided  any serious disturbances beyond street protests.","Islamic parties set for democratic coup .

Police say growing use of the drug means the number of notes carrying traces of the Class A drug has trebled in six years. Worryingly, specialist drugs officers say cocaine taken in combination with alcohol is fuelling violence on Britain’s streets. Tainted: Drugs specialists say users were taking cocaine so they could continue drinking into the early hours . Yesterday, one warned Labour’s 24-hour drinking laws had sparked a rise in cocaine use - as it was taken by drinkers who want to stay out all night. Details of the growing prevalence of cocaine were given to a meeting of the Government’s official drugs body yesterday. Police constable Adrian Parsons, Kent Police’s drug expert evidence coordinator told the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs that users were taking ‘coke’ so they could carry on drinking into the early hours. The 2003 Licensing Act abolished traditional closing time, allowing pubs to stay open routinely after 11pm. He said: ‘It’s my personal view that the change in licensing laws led to a rise in the use of cocaine. ‘We have got extended licensing hours, we have got people who are not ramming as much down their necks as before 11 and who are going all night.’ He added: ‘Cocaine is everywhere, it’s a drug that we see all over the place.’ Kent constabulary, along with 10 other forces in England and Wales, routinely test bank notes seized during raids to test for levels of drugs. Up to 70 per cent of notes taken from suspected drug dealers have cocaine traces on them. But the programme has also tested around 5,000 ordinary notes and has found startling rises in positive cocaine tests in recent years. Six years ago around four per cent of notes showed cocaine residue from a simple swab test. But the most recent figures show that has nearly trebled to 11 per cent. Recent tests have also shown rising evidence cocaine is being mixed with MDMA - the active ingredient in the dance drug ecstasy. Often cocaine is mixed with MDMA and users are unaware they are taking a drug cocktail. Notes are often rolled up by users to ‘snort’ lines of the drug. PC Parsons pointed to figures from Liverpool John Moores university that showed before the Licensing Act - which came into force in 2005 - most cocaine users said they took the drug for ‘confidence in social situations’. But recently the same study - of 17-29 year-olds - has shown the reason given most often was so they could ‘keep going and stay awake’. Around one in 11 adults in England and Wales admit having ever taken cocaine. Figures from the British Crime Survey show that in 2003/4 around 5.4 per cent admitting taking the drug in the previous year. By 2008/9 that peaked at 6.6 per cent -  an increase of nearly a fifth. PC Parsons said cocaine and alcohol in combination led to users having an ‘air of invincibility’, and made them more likely to be aggressive towards the police. Separate evidence presented to the committee showed cocaine use was highest among higher earners. Surveys show it peaks among individuals earning £40,000 or higher. Rates were lower among those on middle incomes but was also high among those with salaries of less than £10,000. Users in England were most likely to be aged between 20 and 24. Drug experts warn cocaine, which is highly addictive, can lead to heart attacks, strokes and brain seizures. Persistent use can also damage the liver, and lead to paranoia, anxiety and depression. The price of cocaine has plummeted in recent years. Figures from Drugscope show cocaine cost £70 a gram in 2003 but now costs as little as £40 a gram. Depending on purity, that amount will provide ten or 20 lines.",Drugs officers say cocaine combined with alcohol is fuelling violence on Britain’s streets .

In an ornate room at Naypidaw's presidential palace - a huge building with 40ft to 60ft ceilings replete with gold gilt, giant teak doors and white marble floors that lies off an enormoU.S. but empty 20-lane motorway - Mr Sein appeared eager to embrace the opening with the United States. He told Mrs Clinton her visit was a 'historic milestone' which would 'enhance relations and co-operation'. A senior U.S. official said Mr Sein had outlined his government's plans for reform in a 45-minute presentation in which he acknowledged that Burma lacked a recent tradition of democracy and openness. He asked for U.S. help in making the transition from military to full civilian rule, according to the official. Mrs Clinton replied that she was visiting because the U.S. was 'encouraged by the steps that you and your government have taken to provide for your people'.

'While measures already taken may be unprecedented and certainly welcome, they are jUst a beginning,' she told reporters. She called for the release of political prisoners and an end to brutal ethnic violence which has ravaged the nation for decades. Mrs . Clinton also warned the country's leadership to break suspected . military, nuclear and ballistic missile co-operation with North Korea . that may violate UN sanctions. 'Better . relations with the United States will only be possible if the entire . government respects the international consensus against the spread of . nuclear weapons... and we support the government's stated intention to . sever military ties with North Korea,' she said.

But a closer look reveals these amazingly intricate artworks are created from thousands and thousands of childlike sketches. Incredibly, Keita Sagaki's works, which can take almost a year to create, are completely improvised and drawn directly onto paper without being drafted first. Keita Sagaki's works, including his version of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper (above), can take almost a year to create. They are completely improvised and drawn directly onto paper without being drafted first . A close-up of the Last Supper drawing shows how they are made up of thousands of childlike sketches (including risque images, such as a naked lady as part of Jesus's face) He uses a tapestry of thousands of cartoon characters - woven together to resemble the famous works they mimic. Blending abstract cartoon animals and iconic characters such as Ronald McDonald in his hand-drawn creations, the artist combines his training in the arts with a childhood love of comics and graffiti to create the clever pictures. However, his decision to incorporate fully naked body doodles, particularly in religious works (see close-up of Jesus, right), may not be to everyone's taste. As well as recreating famous paintings, Mr Sagaki has also drawn doodle montages depicting classic sculptures, and some more personal landscape pieces. And the 27-year-old, originally from Ishikawa, northern Japan, does not draft the pictures, which can take months to create. He said: 'I don't draft my work, I just draw it in pen, directly onto paper. 'I usually use a 0.38mm pen, and sometimes ink thinned with water to achieve a grey tone, but that's all.' Despite his direct approach, Mr Sagaki, who lives in Tokyo, said that some of the pictures have taken him months to complete. He said: 'It varies according to the size of the work. The Last Supper took the longest time. I drew it for approximately ten months. 'But a series of drawings I completed this year took around two to three weeks for each piece.' The artist draws on an unusual set of influences to create the stunning drawings, inspired by his university art degree and his love of popular culture. He said: 'It was only when I was around 20 years old that I became interested in art. 'However, I have liked comics since I was a child - I've probably been drawing comic book pictures since I was seven. Keita Sagaki's recreations, such as his take on da Vinci's Mona Lisa, are inspired by his childhood love of comics and graffiti . The artist's comic-book style can be seen in this close-up of Mona Lisa, which includes a Buddha-like phallus among the more innocent illustrations . 'I loved to draw cartoons and graffiti from a young age, and I get inspiration from rock music or sometimes even novels.' As well as the obvious love of comic book-style art, Mr Sagaki, a graduate of Fukushima University, also has some more highbrow influences. He said: 'I am inspired by Hieronymus Bosch, [Japanese artist] Katsushika Hokusai and Vincent van Gogh. 'I'm also inspired by the Mandala, which is a religious painting illustrating esoteric Buddhism and Buddhism sutras.  It was a feature of my childhood.' The Mandala, or circle, is a feature of Buddhism and Hinduism and is said to represent the 'unconscious self'. Mr Sagaki has displayed his work in a . number of chic art galleries around Tokyo, although he has yet to be . given a solo exhibition for his incredible talents. 'I have a contract with a contemporary art gallery here in Japan. 'Approximately one-third of my pictures have sold now.' But . success comes at a price for the young artist, as selling a picture . means he has to let go of one of his painstakingly crafted works. He said: 'I am glad when a picture sells, but on the other hand, I feel a little sad when they do. 'It's difficult to choose a favourite. The Last Supper took the most time, so I had a strong attachment to that.'","Keita Sagaki recreates classic paintings by drawing them straight onto paper without drafting them first .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:16 AM on 2nd December 2011 . Over the past few months, Google's Android phones have been subjected to increased attacks by malicious software. But it seems millions already come with spy software 'pre-installed'. Carrier IQ - a software package often used by US phone networks to monitor how phones are used - seems to not only read private text messages and Google searches, but transmit that data to Carrier IQ. HTC's Evo 4G handset runs Google's popular Android software: But software used to 'monitor' how Android users use their phones appears to seriously violate privacy . The company denies that its software is designed to spy on users. An Android app developer Trevor Eckhart showed that Carrier IQ - installed as standard on phones such as HTC's handsets, many Android handsets and some BlackBerries - can 'read' what users type. Eckhart demonstrated that not only does the software 'read' every keystroke put into a phone. The software also appeared to read every text message sent to the phone. It also appeared to 'log' location data - and transmit all of this to Carrier IQ. Carrier IQ immediately tried to suppress Eckhart's report. The Electronic Freedom Foundation, an activist group which promotes free speech online, said, 'Carrier IQ fired off a cease-and-desist letter to Eckhart, claiming that he infringed its copyrights and made unspecified false allegations about its software. The Carrier IQ software is used by phone networks to monitor how customers use their handsets - but it appears to significantly overstep the mark by 'reading' private messages and web use . 'Among other things, the company demanded that Eckhart turn over contact information for every person who had obtained the files from him, and that he replace his analysis with a statement - written for him by Carrier IQ - disavowing his research,' said Electronic Freedom Foundation. Carrier IQ is installed as standard on many U.S. handsets to allow phone networks to monitor usage. The company says, 'Carrier IQ delivers Mobile Intelligence on the performance of mobile devices and networks to assist operators and device manufacturers in delivering high quality products and services to their customers.' The company specifically denies that its sotware is used to 'monitor' customers - which appears to directly contradict Eckhart's demo. 'We are counting and summarizing performance, not recording keystrokes or providing tracking tools,' said Carrier IQ in a recent media statement. 'The metrics and tools we derive are not designed to deliver such information, nor do we have any intention of developing such tools.' Dekchart's demonstration, however, showed clearly that the app was not only recording the information, but also transmitting it to Carrier IQ. Eckhart questioned why some of the software's functions were even there at all, 'Why does SMSNotify get called, and shown to be dispatching messages to Carrier IQ?' Eckhard also asked, 'Why is my browser data being read?'","Monitoring app on millions of phones 'reads' and transmits SMS messages .

Arrested: Former News of the World journailst Bethany Usher is under police custody over hacking allegations . A university lecturer was arrested today over phone-hacking at the News of the World. Bethany Usher, who worked at the axed Sunday tabloid and its former rival The People, is being questioned in custody at a police station in Northumbria, sources said. The 31-year-old - who was questioned by officers in 2006 on suspicion of providing false information for a job at Buckingham Palace but not charged - becomes the 17th arrest under Scotland Yard’s Operation Weeting. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘At 6.35am officers arrested the woman on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages... The woman is now in custody at a police station in Northumbria. ‘It would be inappropriate to discuss any further details at this time.’ Ms Usher, who worked in the newspaper industry for seven years, is currently a senior journalism lecturer at Teesside University. Ms Usher studied at Leeds University before getting her first job as a trainee reporter on the Sunderland Echo. According to her biography on the university’s website: ‘Bethany has won four awards and was named young journalist of the year in 2003.’ Regarding her arrest, a spokesman for the university said: ‘We cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.’ Ms Usher has referred several times to the Leveson Inquiry on her Twitter page, @bethanyusher. One tweet yesterday read: ‘For god sake Paul McMullen, shut your sickening trap.’ Another, posted on Monday, said: ‘Am I the only former tabloid reporter who followed the £PCC? £Leveson. Hey kids. They the rules, stick to them. £mediateesside.’ Detectives investigating phone hacking . have arrested a series of high-profile figures, including former News . International chief executive Rebekah Brooks (left) and ex-Downing .

The arrest came as Labour MP Peter Hain met detectives over claims that his computer was hacked while he was Northern Ireland Secretary. Police are examining evidence suggesting that his files, as well as those of senior civil servants and intelligence agents, were targeted by private detectives who may have been working for News International. Media lawyer Charlotte Harris, of Mishcon de Reya, will act on Mr Hain’s behalf for the case, which comes under the force’s Operation Tuleta, running alongside the Weeting phone-hacking probe.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 6:12 PM on 1st December 2011 . Ski resorts in Europe are continuing to struggle with a lack of snow - which has seen the cancellation of a series of World Cup alpine races. The French resort of Val d'Isere was forced to abandon the event, due to take place on December 10 and 11, because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent. Its slopes, seen here in these staggeringly barren photographs, have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the Alps for 147 years. Snow go area: The Val D'Isere resort in France has had the World Cup alpine event taken away from it because it has no snow . Barren: The normally crisp white landscape is instead brown and green because of a lack of snow . It's snow joke: Skiers walk around the resort of Val D'Isere in a state of bemusement because there is no snow . Barren: The slopes of Val D'Isere, seen here in these staggering photographs, have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the Alps for 147 years . As it should be: Val D'Isere is usually covered in snow during the ski season . Solden, Austria: There was a reported 0 - 61cm of snow today, said to be of 'good' condition. The resort says snow is guaranteed from October through to May thanks to the high alpine location of the 148 km of slopes and the two glacier ski areas of Rettenbach and Tiefenbach. Ischgl, Austria: This resort in the ski region of Ischgl-Samnaun in Tyrol opened today and has 77km of slopes with 24 open lifts. As of this morning, much of this was artificial snow but skiiers haven't complained so far.Sierra Nevada, Spain: Surprisingly, this resort in the south-east of Spain has some good snow, particularly on the upper slopes. They are reporting a metre of snow on the upper regions with 41km of skiable pistes.Les Deux Alpes, France: According to the Ski Club of Great Britain's website, Les Deux Alpes were reporting 'a healthy 80cm upper slope depth' - good news as the resort opens on Saturday.Zermatt, Switzerland: This resort opens tomorrow when skiers can enjoy 141km of pistes. Zermatt's website says that the snow conditions are 'top' on the Swiss side and Italian side of the resort.  In fact, it boasts: 'We’ve got snow, great snow!' Information supplied by the Ski Club of Great Britain . The hotter than usual weather is also . posing problems across the rest of the continent, with a number of . tourist destinations having had to postpone opening. St . Anton, in Austria, will not open for at least another week, and . Skiwelt, also in Austria, will not be taking skiers until December 15. In . other areas the situation is so bad that people who have not yet booked . their trips are being advised to only consider resorts with . high-altitude ski areas. This is because springlike temperatures mean the snow line for many resorts is far higher than usual. Scotland, Bulgaria and Germany have yet to open their main resorts. But it is not all bad news for European skiers. Scandinavia has reported up to 55cm of snow in the past week, Zermatt in Switzerland is fully open, and Solden saw 24cm of fresh snow yesterday. Al Morgan, information manager from the Ski Club of Great Britain said skiers should look to glacier resorts to be guaranteed snow but there are some non-glacial locations across Europe where you can still ski. He said: 'There is good news for European ski resorts as snow is forecast for this weekend and next week. 'The heaviest snowfall is expected to fall at the western European resorts, but resorts in the east should receive fresh snow too. 'Around 40cm of new snow could fall over the next nine days in parts of France and Switzerland. The fresh snow should dramatically improve the overall snow cover across the Alps. 'Even without the fresh snow, many European resorts are hoping to open for the winter season this coming weekend thanks to the great efforts of grooming and snow making teams. 'It has been snowing in Scotland this week too and if the snowfall continues, as it is forecast to, then the Scottish resorts should be able to open in the not too distant future.' The Met Office said that a cold front was expected over mainland Europe by the end of this week, starting tomorrow. Its report said: 'A glorious week of bright sunshine and clear skies is expected over the majority of our featured European resorts. Far too green: These snowless slopes on the Rosshuette mountain in the western Austrian village of Seefeld were pictured last week . Depressing: A virtually snow-free Patscherkofel mountain in the western Austrian city of Innsbruck, pictured last week . 'However, on Friday 2nd December a . drop in temperature is expected, snow is therefore forecast to fall, . although this may only be across higher areas up.' But . it warned that: 'At lower altitudes this could fall as rain.' The snow . is expected to fall and settle at heights above 1,500m. Over . in America, where the World Cup races will now take place at Beaver . Creek resort in Colorado, there has been no such problem.

"By . Paul Revoir . Last updated at 11:10 AM on 1st December 2011 . Caroline Thomson, chief operating officer at the BBC, insists that swearing is acceptable in comedies . One of the BBC’s top executives caused fury last night after she insisted it is acceptable for comedies to feature expletives. Caroline Thomson, the corporation’s chief operating officer, claimed that one of the points of comedy was to cause offence and make her ‘flinch’. Many of the popular and award-winning shows in the golden age of TV – including Porridge, the Good Life and Dad’s Army – never featured such bad language. However, yesterday Miss Thomson appeared to condone the use of swearing. Miss Thomson admitted that she did flinch at bad language on comedy shows, but said that was part of the reason for the genre. ‘Yes. I watch comedy shows and flinch,’ she said. ‘But I think sometimes that is one of the points of comedy.’ The BBC executive claimed there was an ‘enormous inter-generational difference about what is acceptable’. She added: ‘It is very tricky because language that will give you offence, won’t give me offence. And language which gives me serious offence won’t give my son offence.’ But she pointed out there were lots of guidelines about the use swearing at the BBC, including adhering to the watershed. Vivienne Pattison, director of campaign group Mediawatch UK, said the comments proved she was ‘out of step with her audience’. She added: ‘Ofcom do research every year asking if there is too much swearing on TV. ‘And more than 50 per cent of viewers say there is too much. ‘The idea that bad language in comedy is good – it’s not big, it’s not clever and it’s not funny.’ Last year, the Daily Mail commissioned a survey that found most people believe swearing on television is behind an increase in swearing by young people. The poll of more than 800 adults by Ipsos Mori found that most people believe swearing on television is worse now than a decade ago, with women and people over the age of 55 the most concerned by levels of bad language. A quarter of people said they had been offended by bad language on TV in the past year. Miss Thomson was speaking at a Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference called Public Broadcasting Under Siege? The executive also admitted TV is guilty of copycat programming, with broadcasters behaving like a ‘herd of sheep’. She said some channels resorted ‘too easily’ to ‘identikit programming’ where good ideas are ‘shamelessly and sometimes badly ripped off’. Golden age: Classic BBC comedies like Dad's Army were popular yet never featured foul language . And she admitted that a few years ago she thought she ‘would scream’ if she saw another property makeover show, before it was replaced by a fashion for history shows and cooking. Miss Thomson did not single out any broadcaster, but the BBC has in the past been criticised – with others – for its reliance on property and cookery shows. Her remarks echoed those made by Sir David Attenborough in 2008 when he accused the BBC of filling its schedules with derivative and formulaic output. Last summer, the BBC Trust criticised BBC1 and BBC2’s daytime programming as too similar, with lots of antiques and property programmes. The BBC is by no means alone in having filled schedules with these types of shows. It still airs property shows such as Homes Under the Hammer, Escape to the Country, and To Buy Or Not To Buy. ITV has May the Best House Win and Channel 4 is known for Grand Designs and Location, Location, Location. Miss Thomson also said that by the BBC taking over direct control of the World Service, it will allow the corporation to remove ‘duplication’. The executive, who earned £385,000 last year, admitted: ‘I think there are three different bureaus in Cairo. That is not a sensible way to spend money.’ She added that the BBC was ‘ruthlessly prioritising’ its spending in sport. This comes as the BBC3 controller Zai Bennett admitted his channel was set to see a large increase in repeats due to cuts.",Caroline Thomson says one of the points of comedy was to cause offence .
"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 11:04 AM on 1st December 2011 . Police had to ferry sick patients to hospital last night as over-stretched NHS services struggled to cope with yesterdays strike. Desperate ambulance chiefs made a plea to the Metropolitan police yesterday evening as they were hit with a deluge of emergency calls. Staff were supposed to provide 'emergency cover', which is the level that unions and the . Service have agreed staff working in frontline roles can provide . while still supporting industrial action. But this morning, Mr Killens said: 'It is disappointing that, . despite asking staff to return to work as normal or volunteer for . emergency cover during the afternoon when we had significant . numbers of patients waiting for ambulances and had declared an . internal major incident, few did so.' Unite members man the picket line outside the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Thousands of operations have been postponed across the country because of the action . London Ambulance Service workers and Unison members try to keep warm around a brazier on a picket line in Waterloo, London . He added: 'We will carry out a detailed review of the events of yesterday, . and we have already started discussions with the unions about . this.' The astonishing scenes were played out as the London Ambulance Service revealed it was under 'increased pressure', with . 30 per cent more 999 calls today than normal, according to NHS London. Some 42 per cent . of its staff are on strike. Commander Simon Pountain in charge of the today's policing operation for the public services demonstration said: 'It is normal for the emergency services to work together on large scale events and incidents and the MPS will provide whatever support is necessary to the LAS. 'Whilst these are exceptional circumstances, we will work with colleagues from the other blue light services to provide whatever support and assistance we can to help. All police officers are first aid trained. Yesterday the Deputy Director of Operations, Jason . Killens, urged patient's only to call them in an absolute emergency, . adding: 'We are still under severe pressure and expect this to increase . over the next few hours as a result of today's industrial action. 'There are still a number of patients . who are waiting for an ambulance response and it is more important than . ever for Londoners to only dial 999 for an ambulance if somebody's life . is in danger. 'We have asked unions to encourage their . members to return to work as normal or increase their emergency cover, . as per the agreement with Union and GMB.' However, the picture varies across the UK, with some trusts facing major disruption while others are working as close to normal as possible. Theatre nurse Alice Ocaten with a placard on a picket line outside the main entrance of University College Hospital in London . Today, the NHS is more or less operating as if it was a weekend or Bank Holiday. Emergency and trauma care will be the priority. NHS trusts across the country have . written to patients informing them not to come in, although they are . still providing emergency and critical care. In . England, the Government estimates around 60,000 non-urgent operations, . out-patient appointments, tests and follow-up appointments have been . postponed while in Scotland at least 3,000 operations and thousands more . hospital appointments are affected. They estimate around 400,000 nurses and healthcare . assistants, paramedics, physiotherapists and support staff like cleaners . and administrators are joining the action. The 24-hour walkout by two . million public sector workers was called in response to the bitter row . over pensions. Unions are furious over plans to reform pensions which . will involve members working longer and having to pay more. As the strike got underway today Health Secretary Andrew Lansley told . BBC News that NHS staff would still have the 'best pension scheme . available' after the changes and negotiations were ongoing. 'Unfortunately this (the strike) is . happening at the point of course when we tend to go into winter . pressures and the consequences of Christmas and New Year,' he said. 'It makes it harder. Not great timing. It will inconvenience patients, I'm disappointed about that.' Mr Lansley added: 'I asked staff to . consider patients' interest first. I hope that many staff who have been . balloted to go on strike will choose not to go on strike.' Mr Lansley said patients who had an appointment today should get it rescheduled so they are still treated within 18 weeks. 'Our objective will continue to be to ensure that patients have their NHS Constitution right to treatment within 18 weeks of referral by their GP, and that diagnostic tests, they get that within six weeks,' he said. 'We will continue to do that.' More than half of the 100,000 Unite members are thought to be taking industrial action, as are swathes of Unison members. However, the British Medical Association, Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives are not. Christina McAnea, head of health at . Unison, said: 'It is outrageous that the Department of Health are . desperately trying to hide the fact that NHS services are being . disrupted across the UK. 'Our members are reporting fantastic support for the day of action.' Most hospitals in Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales said only urgent appointments and surgery were taking place. The Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said all planned operations had been cancelled, together with 'virtually all' outpatient clinics. A spokesman for Colchester Hospital said it had postponed 34 operations and re-scheduled 14. In Manchester, around 200 non-urgent outpatient appointments have been cancelled at the Wythenshawe Hospital. A . spokesman said all other services will be operating as normal and . patients who have not already heard from the trust should attend . hospital as planned. Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . said, so far, 211 out of 1,149 outpatient appointments have been . cancelled and 47 out of 99 elective inpatient and day case operations . have been cancelled. The trust said patients who have not been told their appointment has been cancelled should attend as normal.

One of about 30 protesters who had been on hunger strike in an eastern Ukrainian city over pension cuts died on Sunday night after police broke up their tent encampment, emergency services and the protest leader said. The group were survivors of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear accident and had been staging their protest in the mining city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine since November 14 after reductions in the state pensions they receive for their part in fighting the 1986 disaster. With temperatures hovering around zero, emergencies ministry workers had provided one large tent with heating for the core protesters to sleep in until the issue had been resolved. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lonely protest: Liquidators of the Chernobyl nuclear power station 1986's accident stand near a tent during a protest for better social treatment in the eastern industrial city of Donetsk . But after a court ruled the protest illegal late last week, police stormed into the main tent on Sunday night and removed a power generator, a stove and cut off lighting, the protest leader Nikolai Goncharov told reporters. In the ensuing disorder, 70-year-old Gennady Konoplyov was taken ill and died in an ambulance after the police operation, Goncharov said. ‘The police attack on the tent city was an act of terrorism,’ Goncharov said. The local emergency services said in a statement today the main tent had been taken down swiftly and it was shortly after the police operation had ended that they had been called to give help to Konoplyov. Konoplyov had earlier complained to local medical workers of pains in his chest, but had refused their advice to receive hospital treatment for heart trouble, the statement said. Trying to keep warm: Demonstrators sit beside a fire to try and warm up in zero degree temperatures in the Ukraine protest . Tragic ending: One of about 30 protesters who had been on hunger strike in an eastern Ukrainian city over pension cuts died last night . Emergency services said protesters had initially hindered the movement of the ambulance carrying Konoplyov last night. He died on his way to hospital, the statement said. The incident is a personal embarrassment for President Viktor Yanukovich. Donetsk is his home town and normally a loyal bastion of support for him and his Regions Party. ‘All this has happened with the silent agreement of the guarantor of the Constitution, President Viktor Yanukovich of Ukraine. The death of our comrade will be on his conscience because the president arranged this mayhem,’ Goncharov said.

It is dragging its heels, however, on another promise to the IMF to raise the price of household gas which it fears will dent the popularity of the Regions Party before a parliamentary election next October.

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 3:37 AM on 29th November 2011 . A quarter of patients would not recommend their local hospital, a survey revealed yesterday. Their complaints included ant-infested floors, wards stinking of sewage and uncollected rubbish. Others objected to doctors and nurses who made them feel as if they were on a  factory production line. Some claimed nursing staff spent much of their time clock-watching or failed to wash their hands properly. High risk: Patients taken to hospital over the weekend for emergency treatment have a higher chance of dying, according to statistics (Posed by models) The Dr Foster research firm looked at . the responses of 8,864 patients on the NHS Choices website and found . that 26 per cent of them would not recommend their local hospital to a . friend. However, 58 per cent would do so however, while the remainder had no opinion either way. Lack of cleanliness was one of the . main reasons for the complaints to the website. One patient, who was . treated at Whipps Cross University Hospital in North-East London, said . ants had the run of the ward he was treated on. He also claimed food was . not cleared from his bedside table for four days. A patient admitted to Queen’s Hospital . in Romford, East London, said bloodied dressings covered the floor and . another said the ward stank of sewage. At Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, . a patient said black rubbish bags were left along the corridor. Another . complained that the same hospital was so dirty he ‘feared getting an . infection’. Some 72 per cent of patients who . complained were upset at being ‘left in the dark’ by doctors and nurses . who refused to speak to them about their illness or treatment. One patient who had been brought in to . the A&E department at Newham General Hospital in East London . described doctors and nurses as ‘robotic’ and said they felt like they . were on ‘some sort of mass production line’. A mother who gave birth at . Queen’s Hospital said she had been ‘made to feel like an animal’. The report also found that patients . who are admitted to A&E during the evenings or weekends are 10 per . cent more likely to die. It warned that in many trusts too few . senior consultants work outside of office hours meaning that patients . are left in the hands of junior doctors. In nearly a third of hospitals no . senior staff were on site all weekend. Overall mortality rates, however, . were found to have fallen by 20 per cent over the past decade. The lengthy report also disclosed that . some health trusts put just one nurse in charge of more than 20 elderly . patients at any one time. At South Tyneside NHS trust in Tyne . and Wear the average is one nurse to 29.5 patients while at Frimley Park . in Surrey the ratio is one to 20. Dr Peter Carter of the Royal College . of Nursing said: ‘Trusts now need to look at their staffing levels as a . matter of urgency. Due to the complex needs of many older people, having . staff with the right mixture of skills and experience on the ward is . vital.’ Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of . the NHS in England, said: ‘Mortality rates are going down, but hospitals . with high rates and poor outcomes in the evenings and at weekends must . investigate to see where performance may be falling short and look to . those with the best rates to see how they can improve.’ Professor Keogh added: ‘I will be . asking the NHS medical directors to look closely at weekend services to . ensure patients admitted at weekends receive the same standards of care . as those during the week.’ The Dr Foster report includes an analysis of patient comments made online about their hospital stay. It revealed that disrespect and not being kept informed are the two main reasons why patients would not recommend their hospital. This was found to matter far more than single-sex wards or cleanliness.",Report also finds patients admitted to A&E at evenings and weekends are 10 per cent more likely to die .
"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 4:09 PM on 30th November 2011 . Europe faces a crucial 10 days to save the euro zone after agreeing to ramp up the firepower of its bailout fund. Euro zone ministers agreed last night detailed plans to leverage the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSF), but warned they may have to turn to the IMF for more help to avert financial disaster. Olli Rehn, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner, said: 'We are now entering the critical period of 10 days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union.' Italian and Spanish bond yields resumed their inexorable climb towards unsustainable levels on today, as markets assessed the rescue fund boost as inadequate. Optimism: Global markets rebounded today despite the failure of European finance ministers - including British Chancellor George Osborne, left, Spanish finance minister Elena Salgado and French budget minister Francois Baroin - to agree radical plans to halt the debt crisis . Crunch talks: Mr Baroin, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, European Investment Bank president Philippe Maystadt and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti at the talks in Brussels . It comes as stock markets rose . after buoyant consumer confidence figures renewed optimism in the . strength of the U.S. economy. Early . trading was down, but a raft of . economic data from the U.S. over the rest of the week, including . non-farm payroll figures on Friday, raised hopes the world's largest . economy is faring better than expected. The news saw the FTSE 100 index climb 0.8 per cent at 5,379.8, while Germany's DAX rose 1.2 per cent to 5,870. Wall Street was also heading for a . higher opening - Dow futures rose 0.7 per cent to 11,642 and S&P 500 . futures climbed 0.8 per cent at 1,206. A . decision on how to forge a closer fiscal union between the 17 eurozone . countries has now been postponed until the leaders' summit next week. European . finance ministers did agree to had out 8 billion euros to Greece as . part of its bailout to stem an immediate cash crisis, but they shelved . more difficult issues - such as whether countries should cede some . control over their finances to a central European authority. Stocks had been relatively buoyant this week on the expectation that the 17 countries in the eurozone would finally come up with a plan to deal with the debt crisis. Ben Critchley, sales trader at IG Index, said: 'With the longer term outlook for the U.S. economy becoming increasingly bullish, expectations are for a robust set of numbers to be seen in the days ahead.' Major banks around the globe took coordinated action to ease the strain on the world's financial system, saying they would make it easier for banks to get dollars if needed. The European Central Bank, U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Japan and Switzerland took part. As the eurozone debt crisis spreads, the global economy is showing signs of entering another credit crunch similar to the 2008 collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. The central banks said in a joint statement the moves were designed to 'provide liquidity support to the global financial system'. It said they had agreed to reduce the cost of temporary dollar loans to banks - called liquidity swaps - by a half percentage point from Monday. Europe's ongoing battle to contain its . debt crisis is likely to remain a key driver in markets for a while to . come, especially if countries continue having to pay elevated interest . rates to get investors to lend them money. Yesterday, . Italy was forced to pay a high interest rate on an auction of . three-year debt. The 7.89 per cent rate was nearly three percentage . points higher than last month. If Italy was to default on its debt of . 1.9trillion euros, the fallout would damage the euro and send shock . waves throughout the global economy. Economists . have said the 17 eurozone nations have little choice but to back . proposals for closer coordination of spending and budget policies. This would reduce their ability to . run budget deficits, but could pave the way for more aggressive support . from the European Central Bank. Analysts . at Credit Agricole CIB said in a report that 'until concrete and . detailed plans for a solution to the crisis are announced, the downward . trend' in stocks will continue. Ratings downgrades for many of the world's largest banks has also driven away investors.

A woman has been accused of aborting her unborn baby boy after a dead fetus was found dumped in a New York residential rubbish bin. Yaribely Almonte, 20, has become one of only a handful of people in the city to ever be charged with the offence, following the gruesome discovery in Washington Heights, Manhattan. A superintendent found the seven-inch long foetus, which still had the umbilical cord attached, on Tuesday night while tying up a garbage bag. Charged: A woman was arrested in Washington Heights on suspicion she had self-aborted her unborn baby boy . He said: 'When I found the baby, I didn’t know if it was real at first. It was so bad. After that happened, I just stayed in my apartment for a while because I didn’t feel well.' Police have now charged Almonte, who reportedly rented a room in the building at 191st Street and Wadsworth Avenue for only a short while before moving out, with self-abortion in the first degree. Although it is not known how old the foetus was, the charge is only used when the abortion occurs after 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that point, it is legal only if a woman's doctor says her life is in danger. The superintendent, who did not want to be named, told the New York Times that the suspect was 'not very talkative'. He also believed she had dropped out of school a few years ago. Experts have previously said home abortions are a phenomenon in Latin American cultures, maybe because of a lack of insurance or because of a mistrust of the medical system. This was despite the widespread availability of safe, legal abortions in New York City. They often used medications like misoprostol or herbal concoctions . Elizabeth Toledo, a public relations consultant for abortion rights groups, said: 'It's been well discussed in the Latino community that there’s an issue about health and safety and the use of medication outside of a doctor’s care for pregnancy termination.' Almonte was released and will return to court on January 3. Greg Pfundstein, executive director of the Chiaroscuro Foundation, an anti-abortion group, said: 'This woman has my sympathy. This appears to be a clear case of desperation. 'I wish she had known there are people who would have helped her through this, including the New York Catholic Archdiocese.' In the last 30 years, only four other women have been charged with self-abortion in New York, according to the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services.",Only fourth woman in New York to face charge in the last 30 years .

Republican presidential frontrunner and self-proclaimed nominee Newt Gingrich believes poor kids have no work ethic -- unless it comes to doing something illegal. The former House Speaker is sticking with his argument that child labor laws should be changed and poor children should be put to work mopping the hallways of their schools or greeting patrons at the library. 'Really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and nobody around them who works,' Mr Gingrich told fundraisers Thursday night at a dinner outside Des Moines, Iowa. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sticking with it: Newt Gingrich, the current Republican presidential frontrunner, reiterated his position that poor children should be put to work . 'So they literally have no habit of showing up on Monday. They have no habit of staying all day. They have no habit of ""I do this and you give me cash""... unless it's illegal.' Mr Gingrich has drawn scorn from the left for his remarks about child labor, but the newest contender for the Republican presidential nomination is sticking to his guns. 'I believe the kids could mop the floor and clean up the bathroom and get paid for it, and it would be OK,' he told the crowd. Is Newt Gingrich right to say poor children have 'no habit of working'? Mr Gingrich has said he thinks the poorest Americans have no in-grained work ethic and the surest way to combat poverty is the teach them they can earn money for their labor. Clean up: Mr Gingrich argues that putting the poorest children to work cleaning schools can teach them responsibility and a work ethic . Last month, Mr Gingrich drew fire for saying he believes child labor laws are 'truly stupid' and that kids as young a 9 should be given paying jobs to teach them the benefits of hard work. Thursday, he mocked his critics, saying his proposals would help break the cycle of abject poverty in America's cities: 'And then who would rich liberals worry about?' 'I’m going to be the nominee,' the former Speaker told ABC News in an interview on Thursday. 'It’s very hard not to look at the recent polls and think that the odds are very high I’m going to be the nominee.' The thrice-married Gingrich also said there were no more skeletons in his closet that he was aware of. Gingrich is currently polling six percentage points ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and has about 26.6 percent support in the wildly fluctuating Republican presidential field, according to RealClearPolitics.com. A new poll from Rasmussen Reports also gives him the edge against President Barack Obama with 45 percent support versus President Obama's 43 percent.

"By . Becky Barrow . Last updated at 8:30 AM on 2nd December 2011 . Tax collectors have spent nearly £100million over the past year on training courses – many of which were a waste of time, a damning report reveals today. The study, from the official spending watchdog, is fiercely critical of HM Revenue and Customs for having ‘no strategy’ about how to train staff. The National Audit Office said HMRC did not even know how much it had spent on such courses in the tax year 2010/11. Waste: The HM Revenue & Customs offices in central London. They tax office lavished £100 of ratepayers' cash on staff training . To make matters worse, the report said just 38 per cent of workers found the training ‘had improved their performance’. HMRC employs 68,000 staff, many of whom appear to spend a large amount of their time being trained. Between April 2010 and April 2011, the NAO discovered they had taken part in an astonishing 730,000 courses. An average of  £1,419 was spent on each employee last year, at a total cost of £96.5million. The report comes just a few weeks after an internal survey of the same staff revealed that many are desperate to leave their jobs. Just one in five said they felt proud to work for HMRC. The NAO report found there were more than 2,000 courses for tax staff, which it said seemed a lot, even for a large and complex organisation. Ninety sessions had just one participant, and others were described as obsolete. One course, which cost nearly £10million, was aimed at teaching 15,045 workers about a new penalties regime. The NAO said however it did not achieve ‘the expected increase in penalties collected’. The training had to be supplemented at a further cost of £1.9million. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ‘At the level of the business as a whole, HMRC has no strategy to manage the £96million it spends each year on skills.’ John O’Connell of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Of course, it is important that staff are up to scratch, but HMRC proves time and again that it is incapable of getting the taxes of millions of ordinary taxpayers right. The fact they feel obliged to spend this much on training proves the tax system is far too complicated, meaning families and businesses find it unpredictable, punitive and burdensome.’ Around six million people are being sent letters telling them that they have overpaid tax, and can expect to get back £2.5billion, the equivalent of £400 each. A further 1.2million, including more than 150,000 pensioners, face the shock of being told they did not pay enough. On average, they will have to find £600 each. Meanwhile, Dave Hartnett, HMRC’s permanent secretary on tax, has faced calls to resign after admitting ‘making a mistake’ in allowing the investment bank Goldman Sachs to be let off paying its full tax bill. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Making sure our staff have the right skills is vital. We will take on the NAO’s recommendations to ensure skills development happens where it is most needed.’ HMRC has cut its staff numbers by 29 per cent since 2005 when the Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs and Excise. Over the next four years, it plans to cut a further 10,000 posts. By JACK DOYLE . Civil servants are using taxpayer-funded credit cards to pay for body-building supplements, snooker equipment and wood-burning stoves. Thousands of pounds has been spent on Ministry of Justice procurement cards over the past two months. A payment of £570 went to diywetroom.com, a supplier of materials for designer shower rooms, and £849.75 to onlineturf.com, which sells astroturf football pitches. In September, £2,378 was spent on sports equipment at retailer Barrington and another £813.88 at snooker table maker Thurstons. Flexible friend: Officials at the Ministry of Justice paid for £527 of bodybuilding supplies from 'Monster Supplement' on a credit card . The department recorded spending of £658.80 with the Encyclopaedia Britannica and £1,000 with Gloucestershire Stove Centre, which sells wood-burning stoves. Details of all procurement card expenditure over £500 are published every month by government departments to improve ‘transparency’. Officials said many purchases were made by prison staff on behalf of inmates, who would repay them. 'Transparency needed': Matthew Elliott from the Taxpayers Alliance . Matthew Elliott of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Civil servants have legitimate expenses and procurement cards are actually an effective and efficient way to manage them, but it’s clear that a culture of excess is rife in Whitehall and at town halls. 'It’s good news that the MoJ has decided to publish its spending, as credit card abuse has got out of hand. ‘But publishing this spending should be very easy to do as it is simply a case of putting credit card statements online, so while it’s good to see movements in the right direction, there’s no reason for a £500 limit. ‘We need more transparency and accountability across the public sector as this will help to expose civil servants running up huge expenses and leaving them for taxpayers to pay.’ In August, the cards were used to spend £939.44 with beauty products supplier Avon, and £527.73 with Monster Supplement, which sells bodybuilding supplies. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The government procurement card is only used for essential departmental business, and is a convenient and cost-effective way to purchase products and services. Each card has a limit on any individual purchase. ‘Between 2009/10 and 2010/11 spending on a procurement card fell by 13 per cent. ‘We have a zero tolerance policy on abuse of the system and disciplinary action will be taken against staff where there is evidence of wrongdoing.’ Plan: Ged Curran from Merton Council in Surrey had time off 'to think' A council faced with laying off a third of its 4,000 staff told its chief executive to spend one day in ten out of the office – as time to think. Ged Curran was supposed to be off-site at least fortnightly to ‘review the strategic direction’ of Merton Council, in Surrey. The move, agreed by leading councillors, was abandoned after three months. The out-of-office day was among a number of management targets set out in a leaked document. Mr Curran, who was paid £215,546 last year, is supposed to manage the organisation as it reduces in size by a third and ‘maintain personal perspective and self-knowledge’. Council leader Stephen Alambritis (Labour) said the idea had been for the chief executive to see what other boroughs were doing without the pressure of deadlines and meetings. This plan was axed because of the tough times, he said. A Merton Council spokesman said Mr Curran had worked five days out of the office between April and September. She added that he had studied topics including localism, shared services and caring for the elderly. A health watchdog spent £9million on redundancy packages for penpushers, many of whom could have been retrained as inspectors of hospitals and old people’s homes, a report reveals. Last year the Care Quality Commission paid off 140 managers and other bureaucrats, who received an average of £66,000 each, according to the National Audit Office. But at the time the CQC was also trying to recruit more than 100 inspectors to check hospitals and care homes. Some managers being made redundant were offered the chance to retrain – but many chose to take the generous payoff instead. The National Audit Office also found that last year the CQC inspected just 7,368 hospitals and care homes – less than half the number checked in the previous year. It said the watchdog had devoted its attention to ensuring tens of thousands of care homes and agencies were registered. MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the public accounts committee, said: ‘The findings are deeply worrying and highlight significant failures that put patient care at risk.’ She added there was too much box ticking and too little checking on quality.","From bodybuilding pills to snooker, the MoJ's credit card bill .

Graham Dare, 57, boasts celebrity clients including actresses Joely Richardson and Tamzin Outhwaite and TV presenters Melinda Messenger, Kate Thornton and Michaela Strachan. The boss of Sensitives Clinic in London allegedly ‘groomed’ a 31-year-old Japanese student during her first three genuine appointments, and waived his usual £95 per hour fee until her migraines disappeared. ‘The defendant abused his position, he was building up this young lady’s confidence and trust in him,’ prosecutor Heather Stangoe told Blackfriars Crown Court in London, explaining the abuse began during a fourth appointment on September 14, last year. ‘He asked her to take off all of her clothes and although thinking this was unusual she thought it must have been part of the treatment.’ He reportedly said the clothes were getting in the way of spiritual healing. He then moved his hands all over her body. Miss Stangoe said the student was ‘wriggling in discomfort’ but, believing the treatment was genuine, booked another appointment for September 16. The defendant made her remove her clothes and touched her intimately once again, she said.

Soloist: Samantha Stevenson, star of BBC Two series, The Choir, will be vying with the X Factor winner for the number one spot . An Army wife tipped to take the coveted Christmas number one spot with The Military Wives Choir was once so shy she would breakdown in tears at the mere thought of performing. Samantha Stevenson, star of BBC Two series The Choir, spent years too afraid to sing in public after being turned away by a small church choir. But now thanks to the show's choirmaster, Gareth Malone, and with support from family and friends she has finally conquered her debilitating phobia to take centre stage as a soloist on the choir's charity single, Wherever You Are. The 28-year-old Scot, alongside her fellow military wives from the RMB Chivenor military base in Devon, is now vying for the Christmas number one with the annual crop of X Factor contestants. And their bid to storm the charts is being backed by Radio 2 breakfast show host and One Show presenter Chris Evans who has launched a campaign to promote the single and get it to the top of the festive charts. A Facebook page and a Twitter feed have also been set up to boost the single, which is raising money for the Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families . Association. Following the nationwide appeal William Hill reported the odds are now at 5-4 for the single to top the Christmas charts. The choir of 100 military wives were brought together by singing tutor Gareth Malone . for his popular The Choir series while their husbands were on deployment in Afghanistan. The show tracked the group of shy, Devon-based wives, including Samantha, as they evolved into a pitch-perfect choir. All together now: The choir take a seat with Chris Evans in a fur hooded coat . Samantha told the Telegraph: 'We knew people were going to . watch the programme but we didn’t know how big it was going to be. Never . in a million years did we think people would be backing us for the . Christmas number one. It’s wonderful.' Samantha, currently based in Devon, joined a junior choir in . Perth, Scotland from the ages 12 to 17 and was accepted to study . music at Edinburgh University. But she decided to give up her place when she met her husband, John, 28, who is now a Lance Corporal of the 24 Commando Regiment, Royal Engineers. She said: 'I planned to go . but then I got other priorities - I met my husband. 'I was 17, and when you’re that age . you don’t think about careers, you just think, ‘I’ve got a boyfriend, . that’s more important’.' United in song: From left, Samantha Stevenson, Nicky and George Scott, . Hayley and Ade Bowles, and Emma and Gavin Williams. Uplifting: Choirmaster Gareth Malone encouraged the military wives . to sing and now they are they are taking on The X Factor stars for this . year's Christmas No 1 slot with their charity single . When she got married her dreams of singing were forgotten and her confidence was further shattered when a local church choir rejected her application as they deemed her voice 'too big'. Then her husband left the family home for his first tour of duty in Afghanistan and she was left to bring up . their two children, Elliv, 17 months, and Brodie, seven, who suffers . from an autistic spectrum disorder. She said: ‘When my husband went away, I had no confidence at all. ‘On my long list of priorities, I came at the very bottom. There wasn’t really any worth to me at all.’ But following her screen appearance the army wife has become a singing sensation and has regained her confidence. In November she performed in front of the . Royal Family along with an audience of 2.65 million viewers on national TV, for a Remembrance Day service at the Royal Albert Hall. Samantha added: 'When I first joined Gareth’s . choir, I thought it was fantastic but I still felt he was going to pick . up on my voice and ask me to leave. I just had no self worth. 'Now people stop me in the street . and say how fantastic the choir is - it’s quite overwhelming. And my . husband says I’m a lot more confident than I was. He had never heard me . sing properly until he watched the programme.' The choir along with choirmaster Gareth Malone sang live on Radio 2 this morning on the Chris Evans show and are to sing live on the One Show this evening. The Military Wives choir Christmas single - which is inspired by letters to their loved ones  - will be  released on December 19 and will be available for download from December 5.","Solo star of TV's The Military Wives Choir reveals her lack of confidence when her Commando husband is serving in Afghanistan .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:07 PM on 3rd December 2011 . A prudent pensioner is preparing to celebrate the festive season with the same Christmas tree that he has used for the past 74 years. Derek Parker was bought the dishevelled 3ft tree by his late mother when he was just three-months-old. But the artificial tree, made out of wood, wire and green quilled feathers, has lasted so well Derek and wife Sybil have brought it out every Christmas since 1937. Traditional: Derek Parker, left, his daughter Anita Charles, Sybil Parker and Logan Charles, his great grandson, with the tree which Mr Parker has used for the past 74 years . Incredibly, they still use five baubles and the angel that came with the miniature tree more than seven decades ago for decorations today. The couple have also saved money on their fairy lights as the 20 coloured ones wrapped around the fragile tree are still going strong after 31 years. The last decorations Mr and Mrs Parker bought for the tree were wooden teddy bears and elephants about 25 years ago. The tree is so ancient that four years ago a local history museum put it on display. Every year 74-year-old Mr Parker, a great-grandfather, places the fragile tree on his lounge windowsill and bans any member of his family from touching it in case it falls apart. Ready to celebrate: Other festive celebrations are not quite as traditional as Mr Parker's as this lights and fireworks display in London's Regent Street shows . After Christmas the couple, from Merriott, near Crewkerne, Somerset, gently wrap the tree in polystyrene, place it in a bag and store it in their loft for safekeeping. They don't even take off the decorations because they are afraid of wrecking it. After taking it out of storage for its 75th Christmas, retired lorry driver Derek said: 'Every year I look in the bag its wrapped in to see if its still in one piece. 'We have to be so careful when we lift it onto the windowsill but it amazes me just how well it has lasted. 'We do have a 5ft Christmas tree which we bought five years but I doubt that will last a fraction of the time as my old one.' Mr Parker's mum Lilly paid seven shillings and six pence for the Christmas tree which she bought in Woolworths. When Mr Parker married Sybil he took the tree with him and it has since lasted six house moves. Mrs Parker, 72, said: 'The little tree is part of the family and it wouldn't be Christmas without it. 'Five of the baubles are the same age as the tree and the fairy lights are more than 30 years old. We haven't even had to change any of the bulbs. 'We keep the tree in a bag in the loft and leave on the decorations on otherwise it would fall apart. 'In these hard times when people are struggling for cash they should take a leaf out of our book and keep hold of their Christmas trees for as long as possible.' The couple have two children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Mrs Parker added: 'The kids love it and every December they ask us when we are going to put it up but we get more excited about it then they get.'","Artificial tree has been used every Christmas since 1937 .

So it’s no surprise that the former Massachusetts governor’s biggest vice is not alcohol, drugs or women - but something a little less outlandish. Ann Romney, his wife of 42 years, told Parade magazine that ‘something bad’ he likes to drink is ‘Over the Moon’ low-fat chocolate milk. Happily married: Ann Romney, Mitt Romney's wife of 42 years, said 'something bad' her husband likes to drink is 'Over the Moon' low-fat chocolate milk . Mr Romney enjoys cold cereal and Diet Coke. ‘I’m always trying to get him to drink more water,’ Mrs Romney told Parade. ‘That’s a struggle for me.’ His favourite cereals are Sugar Chex Bites and Quaker Oatmeal Squares, while he loves hot chocolate instead of the Mormon-banned coffee or tea. Mrs Romney also revealed he loves listening to The Beatles, Rolling Stones and Neil Diamond - but his favourite artist is Roy Orbison. ‘People see him as a business guy, but he has a silly side,’ she said. ‘He loves to roll on the floor with our grandkids. And he’s a prankster.’ Chocolate milk: His favourite cereals are Sugar Chex Bites and Quaker Oatmeal Squares, while he also enjoys hot chocolate instead of coffee or tea .

Head-to-head: Mr Romney's campaign team is highlighting his domestic bliss and alluding to competitor Newt Gingrich's three marriages and two divorces .

If there’s any one thing that distinguishes me from everybody else, it’s that person that I share my life with,' he said. Mr Gingrich has been divorced twice, in part because of his infidelity. He’s been married three times and has apologised to potential voters for his bad behaviour. He needs to win the vote of social conservatives, or ‘value voters’ who often come from the Bible Belt and feel his past is a big problem.","Ann Romney reveals Mitt loves 'Over the Moon' milk .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 9:10 PM on 16th November 2011 . The miracle dog who wagged his tail after surviving a gas chamber has found a permanent home. Daniel, a beagle mix named by animal control workers in Alabama after the biblical figure who survived the lion's den, joined four other rescued dogs at a home 1,000 miles away in New Jersey. He surprised workers at the animal control facility in Florence, Alabama, last month on the day he was supposed to be put down with several other animals in a stainless-steel box. Happy: Joe Dwyer, of Nutley, New Jersey, plays with his new dog Daniel, also known as the 'Miracle Dog', on Wednesday. The beagle mix got its nickname after it survived an Alabama dog pound gas chamber . The box, roughly the size of a pickup truck bed, was filled with carbon monoxide - however Daniel emerged frightened but unscathed, still wagging his tail after the scary experience. ‘He's in extremely good shape, especially in light of what he went through,’ his new owner Joe Dwyer, 50, said Wednesday after returning from a trip to the vet’s. ‘His attitude is just incredible.’ The dog was eventually flown to New Jersey by Eleventh Hour Rescue, a non-profit organisation that saves dogs slated for euthanasia, and it received more than 100 requests to adopt him. About half of applications from people around the country seeking to adopt Daniel said they were not interested in adopting another dog if he was not available. New pet: Jenna Dwyer, 20, of Nutley, New Jersey, plays with her new dog Daniel. The family received the dog last Thursday from Eleventh Hour Rescue, the organisation that took possession of him last month . Loving: Ms Dwyer plays with Daniel, who was named after the biblical figure who survived the lion's den . 'Maybe we'll get a cosmetic surgeon to make all our dogs look like Daniel,' the shelter's founder and president Linda Schiller joked last month. 'He's in extremely good shape, especially in light of what he went through. His attitude is just incredible' Joe Dwyer, new owner . Mr Dwyer said he and his family had two ‘meet-and-greets’ with Daniel before being approved for adoption, and the dog has become fast friends with the Nutley family's other four pooches. They have two dachshunds, a beagle mix and a pit bull mix. ‘By Thursday evening they were all lying down together,’ he said. ‘It was wonderful to see.’ Only three animals have survived the gas chamber at the animal control facility in Florence in the past 12 years. 'Maybe God just had a better plan for this one,' city spokesman Phil Stevenson said. Resting: Daniel relaxes on the steps of his new home in Nutley. Mr Dwyer said Daniel has become fast friends with the Nutley family's other four pooches - two dachshunds, a beagle mix and a pit bull mix . He said that the dog may have survived because his breathing was shallow thanks to a cold. Other variables that could allow a dog to survive include the number of animals placed in the chamber. 'Maybe we'll get a cosmetic surgeon to make all our dogs look like Daniel' Linda SchillerEleventh Hour Rescue president . In addition the concentration of carbon monoxide, whether the chamber is airtight or gas is leaking out and the health of the animal can also have an impact on improving their slim survival chances. At least 15 states, including New Jersey and New York, have banned carbon monoxide for euthanising shelter animals, but it is still a method used in many parts of the country. Mindy Gilbert, Alabama director for the Humane Society of the United States, said Daniel's story explains why the group pushed the Alabama Legislature to ban gas chambers for euthanizing dogs. Demonstrators were rallying in Pennsylvania on Saturday for a bill named after Daniel to ban gas chambers in the state, reported the Newark Star-Ledger.","Miracle dog Daniel named after biblical figure who survived the lion's den .

"By . Tom Leonard . Last updated at 1:37 AM on 3rd December 2011 . Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire sex offender friend of the Duke of York, has suffered a major setback in his attempts to rehabilitate his shattered reputation. An appeal court in New York has ruled that he must register in the state as the highest and most dangerous level of sex offender. The money manager’s links with Prince Andrew came out just a few months before the latter stepped down in July as a UK trade envoy following a series of scandals. Prince Andrew, left, was among the many celebrity friends who backed billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, right, after he was convicted of soliciting a girl for underage sex . The prince was among a string of celebrity friends who rallied around Epstein by visiting his Manhattan home after he was released from a Florida prison where he has served 13 months for soliciting a 14-year-old for prostitution. At the same time, Epstein and his army of high-powered lawyers were fighting to lower his sex offender status. Epstein even told reporters his offence would not even be considered a crime in New York and compared it to 'stealing a bagel'. But a New York appeal court has disagreed, ruling that he remains at 'high risk' to repeat his offence and poses a 'threat to public safety'. Although Epstein, 58, only admitted to one count of sex crimes, he was allowed to settle more than two dozen civil claims by other teenage girls who said they were paid for sex or sexually-charged massages at his Palm Beach mansion. Virginia Roberts was one of at least 17 women who settled lawsuits with Epstein in 2005 over the scandal . The girls have been unable to discuss their cases as part of payout deals that are believed to have cost Epstein millions of dollars. But the New York court noted there was 'clear and convincing evidence' that he committed offences against the other girls. Police who handled the Epstein case have suggested he got off too lightly and the New York court’s judgement appeared to agree, describing Florida’s treatment of the financier as 'unclear'. As a Level 3 offender, Epstein will have to spend the rest of his life informing police of his whereabouts and internet activities. He must report to a local police station every year to have his photo taken and verify his address every 90 days with law enforcers. Epstein will even have to tell police what email addresses and web search engines he uses. He can move to other states or countries but must notify the local police and will be subject to local laws on sex offenders. Epstein moves between homes in Palm Beach, Manhattan, New Mexico, Paris and the US Virgin Islands. He will have to register as a sex offender in each place. Epstein’s failure to downgrade his sexual offender status is hardly likely to encourage his many famous friends to want to be seen with him. Prince Andrew stayed with him at his New York mansion in February, just a month after he was released from prison, and the pair were photographed walking together in Central Park. Palace officials are understood to be worried about the prince’s relationship with Epstein with lawyers for some of his alleged victims pushing for new criminal charges to be brought against him.","Jeffrey Epstein told to sign as a Level 3 offender .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:18 PM on 2nd December 2011 . A paramedic has been suspended after he was seen inhaling laughing gas while on duty and driving a Vauxhall Vectra emergency vehicle. Nigel Moore, who had worked for the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust for 26 years, was seen with one hand on the Entonox laughing gas and the other on the steering wheel. He was unsteady on his feet, had slurred speech and appeared intoxicated after he got out of the Vectra, a disciplinary hearing was told. The gas contains 50 per cent oxygen and 50 per cent nitrus oxide and is administered for pain relief. Nigel Moore, who had worked for the ambulance service for 26 years, was seen with one hand on the laughing gas and the other on the steering wheel. A report by the Health Professionals . Council Conduct and Competence Committee said: 'As the registrant left . the ambulance station, in a Vauxhall Vectra East Midlands Ambulance . Service (EMAS) Fast Response Vehicle, he was observed holding an Entonox . demand valve in his mouth with one hand, and the other on the steering . wheel.' As a team leader he was responsible . for managing junior staff, responding to emergency calls and managing . vehicle and equipment problems. Based at Heath Ambulance station near Nottingham, he was later stood down from his duties and was suspended from the Trust. He admitted to using Entonox on September 9 last year, but asked to be given a second chance. The report from the panel said Mr . Moore had been abusing Entonox for a few months, since the beginning of . May 2010. However, said it was not frequent, and it had been brought . about by depression, stress and work pressures. Panel chair Derek Adrian-Harris said: . 'This was not a one-off event. On his own admission the Registrant had . been abusing Entonox for a period of up to five months. 'There is sufficient evidence before . the panel to determine that the registrant has addressed the issues or . shown insight into his behaviour. 'The registrant was in a position of . trust which he abused by using the Entonox, and set a very poor example . to his junior colleagues. He has brought the profession into disrepute. 'There was a real risk that patients could have been put at risk, given the condition in which the registrant was found.' Mr Moore, who was not at the hearing in London, was given a 12-month suspension.","Nigel Moore seen with one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the laughing gas .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:42 PM on 2nd December 2011 . A police officer was so determined to get justice for an elderly war veteran robbed in his own home that he studied law in his spare time to force reluctant prosecutors to act. Detective Constable Stephen Hopkins was appalled when the Crown Prosecution Service refused to take action against a woman suspected of stealing £600 from 85-year-old Edwin Stout. But instead of accepting its decision, he researched the law and consulted a Cambridge professor to prove it was possible to charge the alleged thief, even though the only witness – Mr Stout – had died. Impressive: Detective Constable Stephen Hopkins, left, from Warrington, was honoured for his determined out of hours work to secure a conviction for World War II hero Edwin Stout who died after an attack in his own home . DC Hopkins’ perseverance paid off when a woman of 21 was jailed more than two years after the crime. His hard work and dedication was . recognised last night when he was named runner-up in the UK’s first-ever . Police Federation National Detective Awards. The 38-year-old, who serves with the . Cheshire Constabulary, said: ‘I wanted to get justice for the victim and . his family – I couldn’t let the attacker get away with it.’ Mr Stout, who served in the RAF during . the Second World War, and was battling cancer, was targeted in a . distraction burglary in Warrington in November 2007. A woman, claiming to be from the . council, conned her way into his home before letting in her male . accomplice. The pair then assaulted Mr Stout and fled with £600 in cash. Fingerprints were discovered in the . house but no immediate match was found and, in the days after the . incident, Mr Stout asked for the case to be dropped because he was too . ill to pursue it. High level advice: DC Hopkins contacted Cambridge University law experts in his drive for justice for war veteran Edwin Stout . He was battling both lung and prostate cancer.  He . moved in to a residential home and died five months later. In May 2009, a young woman was . arrested following a violent dispute and her fingerprints matched those . taken from Mr Stout’s home. She was interviewed but denied . involvement, claiming instead that Mr Stout had attempted to sexually . assault her. She later admitted lying and confessed she was present . during the robbery but denied taking part in the violence. However, the CPS refused to charge her . because of human rights laws which state that a defendant’s lawyer . should be allowed to cross-examine the only witness. But once Mr Stout died, police had . only hearsay evidence in statements from his daughter and granddaughter, . whom he phoned immediately after the robbery, and the first police . officer at the scene. DC Hopkins said: ‘I started studying . the law on hearsay. I looked into English case law, European judgments . and the principles of the Criminal Justice Act, in relation to when a . witness has died.’ DC Hopkins also contacted Cambridge professor John Spencer, an expert on hearsay evidence. Prosecutors relented and in early 2010 . the woman admitted robbery and was jailed for four years. Her . accomplice is still being sought. The case is now used as an aide in the training of prosecutors. Mr Stout’s granddaughter Julie . Drabble, 36, said her family were extremely grateful to the detective. ‘He went above and beyond his duties,’ she said. Mr Hopkins’ boss, Chief Superintendent . Richard Strachan, said: ‘This is an excellent detective case, it is a . little bit like an episode of Morse, but this is reality.’ DC Hopkins won a commendation by . Cheshire police authority – its highest accolade – before being . nominated for the national award.","Officer bought law books and contacted Cambridge professor to force prosecution rethink .

"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 1:16 AM on 3rd December 2011 . An atheist campaign to ban the historic practice of saying prayers at council meetings yesterday found its way to the High Court. Former councillor Clive Bone, backed by an anti-religious campaign group, claims the tradition breaches his human right to freedom of belief. Mr Bone said he was ‘disadvantaged and embarrassed’ when Christian prayers were said in the council chamber. Non-believer: Councillor Clive Bone outside Bideford town council offices. He has complained about the prayers . Backed by the National Secular Society, . Mr Bone wants prayers to be ruled out of the formal agenda of any local . authority meetings. His case reached the High Court yesterday at the culmination of a three-year campaign. Success could open the way for a drive to force Parliament to abandon saying prayers as part of Commons and Lords business. The NSS has based its legal challenge on the claim that Mr Bone, as an . atheist, should not be subjected to religious ritual, and that to do so . breaks his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. However it was revealed yesterday that he is no longer a councillor in Bideford in Devon. Town clerk Heather Blackburn confirmed: ‘Mr Bone did not stand for re-election in May 2011.’ The Society said yesterday: ‘The NSS is taking Bideford Town Council to court after receiving a complaint from one of its councillors, Clive Bone, that he was disadvantaged and embarrassed as a non-believer by the saying of prayers as part of council business. Praying: The ritual before council meetings has been described as 'archaic' by the national Secular Society . ‘He has either to sit through them or . leave the room without leave of the Mayor. The Council even rejected a . suggested compromise period of silence.’ Backing for prayers: Communities minister Eric Pickles . Its lawyer David Wolfe, told Mr . Justice Ouseley in the High Court: ‘The claimants challenge the town . council’s practice of holding religious prayers. ‘We say the conduct of holding prayers within the formal part of the meeting is an unlawful practice.’ Bideford council has voted to keep . its prayers. Similar decisions have been taken by other town councils in . Devon when the argument has been raised over the past three years. The council’s legal defence is being aided by another pressure group, the Christian Institute. Mike Judge, of the Institute, said: ‘The Council have debated this several times. They’ve debated it, they’ve sought advice, they’ve held special meetings and they’ve voted on it. ‘And the majority of them said, actually we would like to continue with this practice. It cannot be unlawful for the Council to say prayers if it has democratically chosen to do so.’ Ministers yesterday indicated support for the council. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he could not comment on the issues before the High Court, but added: ‘This Government recognises and respects the role that faith communities play in our society. ‘Prayers are an important part of the religious and cultural fabric of the British nation. While the decision on whether to hold prayers is a matter for local councils, we believe they should have the freedom to do so.’ Mr Bone, a management consultant, is in his 60s and describes himself as ‘semi-retired’. He is a regular contributor of letters to newspapers on subjects ranging from engineering to the forthcoming remake of the Dambusters film.","Former councillor said he was 'disadvantaged and embarrassed'

German motorists will be going green in more ways than one in the coming years when the country's longest autobahn is turned into a giant public park. Part of the A7 will be covered with a 10ft-thick canopy in an attempt to reconnect districts in Hamburg which have been divided for nearly 30 years since the road was built. The three-mile strip will stretch from the city's Schnelson district to Bahrenfeld and will be 100ft wide in some places. Scroll down for video . Green makeover: An artist's impression showing what the A7 at Hamburg will look like before the park canopy is placed over the lanes of traffic . Out of sight: How the autobahn will look once the project is complete. The motorway will run underneath in the hope of reducing noise pollution and re-connecting communities in the city . It is also hoped the $1billion project will tackle what has been a huge source of noise pollution in an area that sees more than 150,000 cars pass through each day. That number is expected to exceed 160,000 by 2025. But the move is not without its critics, who fear the construction will cause major disruptions to traffic. The motorway, which spans more than 500miles and provides a straight passage between Denmark and Austria, is not just important to Germany, but also much of Europe, it was reported on Treehugger.com. Gardening plots in Bahrenfeld's south-east side will also be forced to relocate as a result of the development. Blueprint: This cross-section shows how the park will stretch both lengthways (top) and widthways (bottom) over the lanes of traffic. Each section should take about four years to finish . Park life: The development at Stellingen will include a half-mile green space with a wooded area and community gardens . The project will involve building up the sides of the motorway so the canopy can be built over the lanes of traffic. Work will start next year with the Stellingen district, where the half-mile park will include both a wooded parkland and community gardens. The quarter-mile stretch in Schnelsen will boast a tree-lined promenade to offset the noise caused by the six lanes of traffic underneath.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:07 AM on 3rd December 2011 . Escaped jail: Brian Dodgeon, 61, arrives at Isleworth Crown Court today where he was given an eight month suspended sentence . A university lecturer who admitted . owning the drugs that led to the death of a schoolgirl at his house was . spared jail yesterday. Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, died in April after taking ecstasy at a party at Brian Dodgeon’s home. He had the ecstasy hidden in a . wardrobe in his bedroom, along with LSD, ketamine and a psychedelic drug . known as Foxy Methoxy, but said he never thought teenagers attending . the party hosted by his daughter would find it. Dodgeon, 61, who seriously injured . himself in a failed suicide attempt after Isobel’s death at his west . London home, was at a party in Hastings with his partner, Angela . Hadjipateras, at the time. They had told neighbours and a friend . about the party thrown by his daughter Beatrice on Good Friday and made . sure the parents of the teenage guests knew they were not going to be at . home. Dodgeon, a former research fellow at . the University of London’s Institute of Education, admitted four counts . of possessing Class A drugs. Around 30 teenagers attended the party and were drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. Howard Tobias, prosecuting at . Isleworth Crown Court, said that around midnight Beatrice, 14, went to . search her father’s room for marijuana and found a container with his . drugs ‘at the back of a high-up cupboard’. Isobel took two pills and started hallucinating and frothing at the mouth soon after. When she stopped breathing, her . friends called for an ambulance and attempted mouth-to-mouth and CPR, . but she was pronounced dead at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington later . that morning. The cause of her death was listed as MDMA, or ecstasy, . ingestion. Beatrice and two 14-year-old boys, who all took one tablet each, also went to the hospital, where Dodgeon was later arrested. He told police he had collected the . drugs over 12 years as he was a recreational user. Describing himself as . an ‘old hippy’, he said he occasionally took ecstasy at dance parties . and it had ‘never crossed his mind’ that anyone would find his drugs. Drugs death: Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, died after taking two Ecstasy tablets at the party at this house in west London . After the incident, he jumped off a . flyover on the North Circular Road in Walthamstow, east London, breaking . numerous bones and fracturing his skull. He also had brain surgery . after the leap and now needs weekly physiotherapy sessions. Mr Tobias said Isobel’s family had been left ‘devastated’ by her death ‘at the start of her life’. In mitigation, Sarah Elliot described . Dodgeon as a ‘broken man’, adding: ‘He has to live with the consequences . and the knowledge of the harm he has inadvertently caused.’ Beatrice also suffered with guilt, she said, and a custodial sentence would mean he would not be there to support her. Tragedy: Flowers and tributes are left at a memorial to Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, who died of an Ecstasy overdose . His job, from which he is currently suspended, would also be immediately terminated. She said: ‘He genuinely did not see . that harm would occur. He genuinely believed his actions in permitting . the party were not irresponsible. He and his partner have been proved . terribly wrong in hindsight.’ Sentencing Dodgeon to eight months . suspended for two years, Judge Andrew McDowell said: ‘The worst . punishment you can have is one that will last for the rest of your . conscious life – the knowledge that the possession of these drugs and . your failure to keep them secure from teenage experimentation has . resulted in a death. ‘It seems this is a terrible lapse and a terrible misfortune which you feel as keenly as it is possible to feel.’ Dodgeon will also have to pay £150 costs and stick to a 9pm-to-7am curfew for six months.","Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, died after taking two Ecstasy tablets at the unsupervised house party .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 5:06 PM on 2nd December 2011 . Murdered: Eileen Jones was kicked and stamped to death as she went o take a meal to her blind neighbour . A man who kicked and stamped a great-grandmother to death as she delivered a meal to her blind neighbour has been jailed for life. Pensioner Eileen Jones, 73, was not found until the next morning after the brutal attack by Christopher Newton, 45, in Bethnal Green, east London. Her body was discovered by paramedics in the blood-spattered ground floor flat of blind resident Paul Rangel after he hit an emergency alarm. Mrs Jones, who used a trolley to help her walk, had suffered multiple fractures to her face and body. Newton had left his bloodied footprint on her clothing. He was found guilty of murder after a jury ignored his claims that Mr Rangel, 60, had worn all of his clothes to carry out the killing. Members of Mrs Jones family cheered and clapped in the public gallery as the verdict was announced. Jailing Newton for life with a minimum term of 22 years, Judge Paul Worsley QC said: 'You showed not a flicker of remorse. 'You left the flat taking with you any evidence you thought might implicate you in the killing. 'You had stayed in the flat with the body for a time but you sought no help. 'It is likely she survived 30 minutes after the infliction of the injuries. One can only hope she was unconscious.' Mrs Jones had met Newton by chance as he was in the flat with Mr Rangel when she called on him. She had last been seen after winning £6 at bingo on March 23, when she offered to deliver the uneaten meal to her neighbour Mr Rangel. Guilty: Christopher Newton has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years after being convicted of murder . She agreed to stay with them for a drink, but unbeknown to her alcoholic Newton had been drinking all day. He went out later to buy a bottle of brandy and was known to become 'increasingly aggressive' when under the influence of alcohol. The judge said: 'For reasons known only to you, you carried out an attack on that vulnerable lady who posed no threat to you what so ever. 'The pathologist described the attack as ferocious, so it was. You punched her, kicked her and stamped on her. You broke bones in her face and body and I am satisfied by that attack you intended to kill her.' Mrs Jones who was pronounced dead upon the arrival of paramedics at the property in Bethnal Green on March 23 this year. The pensioner's blood was later found soaked into Newton's trainers, jeans and shirt, while shoe imprints matching his footwear were also found on her face and clothing. His palm print was also found on a wall close to her body, while further bloodstains were found in the flat's kitchen and bathrooms. Mrs Jones was widowed in 2006 after almost 50 years of marriage. A mother-of-four, grandmother-of-three and great-grandmother to four, she moved from Bethnal Green, where she had lived for much of her life, after her husband's death to be closer to her family in Chelmsford. But she returned to the East End after failing to settle in Essex. In a statement her family said they wanted to remember her as 'independent, happy and full of life not how she would have looked after such a merciless assault'. One of her daughter's Jackie Robinson said: 'The vision of what happened to her haunts my every waking moment.' Judge Worsley described Mrs Jones as a 'cheerful friendly and caring lady'. He told Newton: 'She was 73. she was vulnerable, you took advantage of her mercilessly.'","Christopher Newton, 45, claimed he didn't kill her but said it was his blind friend wearing his clothes .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 5:15 PM on 2nd December 2011 . A gang of armed robbers dressed up as firefighters as a ruse to gain access to safe rooms before holding up shops at gunpoint. Darren Lloyd, 35, was the mastermind who led the group as they repeatedly raided cash-in-transit deliveries in east London, using stolen cars and false number plates. The robbers, who included a former police officer, were being watched by Flying Squad detectives as they staked out targets throughout the summer and autumn of last year. Hold-up: An armed robber, dressed in a real fireman's uniform, holds up a Co-op store after talking his way into the backroom . Today Lloyd was facing years behind bars after being found guilty of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob. Six other men had already admitted similar offences. By December the gang changed their strategy by deploying a robber inside shops, dressed in the distinctive maroon firefighter's uniform and yellow helmet to gain access to safe rooms. Lloyd planned 12 separate raids which netted at least £43,000. Some of them were cancelled at short notice. London fireman Russell Williams, 39, . was recruited to supply bona fide uniforms to ex-police officer Gary . Griffiths, 42, who wore the distinctive kit and armed himself with a . pistol to threaten shop staff and demand cash. Griffiths was caught after a detective spotted the 'distinctive features' of his former colleague on CCTV. A shopworker hands over the money to the bogus firefighters who typically used the ruse that they had been alerted to an alarm going off . Weapon recovered: An imitation firearm found in December last year as police arrested ringleader Darren Lloyd . Darren Lloyd was arrested by armed officers in December last year when he was caught red-handed as he scrambled from the wreckage of a high-powered Volvo getaway car, having crashed in to a garden during a police chase. Two imitation handguns he had discarded were found nearby and a shop till was still inside the vehicle. Lloyd's capture ended a year-long Flying Squad operation to round-up members of the robbery team, who had been committing crimes just a few streets away from their own homes in east London. Prosecutor Michael Shaw said: 'They were a pretty close-knit bunch and generally robbed locations close to where they lived, venues they were familiar with and knew how to get away from.' The robberies were clustered around Dagenham and Chadwell Heath in London. Lloyd, from Dagenham, Essex, was . convicted of 12 counts of conspiracy to rob between July 1 and December . 14 last year and four counts of having an imitation firearm with intent, . after a month-long trial at the Old Bailey. Five . others - Griffiths, Joshua McEvilley, Ben Garforth, Jason Stacey and . Peter Henderson have all admitted their involvement in the conspiracy . and will be sentenced alongside Lloyd on a date to be fixed. Facing jail: Darren Lloyd, 35, who was the mastermind behind the robberies, left, is facing a lengthy jail term after being found guilty at the Old Bailey. Gary Griffiths, right, a former Met Police officer is also facing jail for his role in the conspiracy . Facing custody: Ben Garforth and Peter Henderson have also both admitted their role in the conspiracy and will be sentenced on a date to be fixed . An . eighth man, Russell Williams, a firefighter, 39, from Cheshunt, . Hertfordshire, had previously pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. The court heard Griffiths, 42, was captured on camera inside Premier Foods in Dagenham, Essex, posing as a firefighter on December 5 last year and stealing £2,000 in takings. Griffiths could be seen asking to be directed in to a back room where he brandished an imitation firearm and took the cash. Shop assistant Sivavakeethar Sivakumaran said: 'He asked if there was a fire alarm going on and said they had some alarm on their system. 'He was in uniform and I didn't even think about it. I just thought it was a fireman. Then he came to the office and pulled a gun on me and asked for the safe.' On that occasion Lloyd, the second robber, wearing a distinctive patterned bandana across his face, waited at the front door of the shop to make sure they were not disturbed. Awaiting sentence: Frank Nesbitt, left, and Joshua McEvilley who are both likely to be jailed when they are sentenced . Both men then fled in a black VW Passat which was waiting outside. Detective Constable Andy Burrows later spotted Griffiths, who he first met when he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1994, on the footage. Facing jail: Jason Stacey was the final man caught after the year-long police investigation . 'When I began I was based at Bethnal Green police station,' said Det Con Burrows. 'I met Gary Griffiths there. We both played rugby for the station side and I played against him in Sunday matches. 'He is known to me as an associate and from looking at the CCTV the person wearing the uniform is Gary Griffiths. 'There are several points in the footage when his face is directed towards the camera and it is from these shots of his face that I can recognise him. 'His face has distinctive features, especially his nose, which is broken in a few places.' After the verdict, Detective Superintendent John Kielty, from the Flying Squad, said: 'These men made a lucrative career of carrying out robberies and were a highly organised and violent team. They carefully planned their actions and targets using disguises and firearms during offences. 'The Flying Squad began a proactive operation against these armed criminals to make sure they were held to account for the fear they subjected their victims to during these robberies. 'The gang were responsible for a significant number of crimes in Dagenham and the surrounding areas and I'm very pleased at today's convictions which bring an end to this complex investigation by the Flying Squad.' Dave Brown, Assistant Commissioner for the London Fire Brigade's Operations and Mobilising, said: 'If members of the public have any concerns about the identity of our staff they should ask to see their ID card. If people are still unsure they can call the number on the card to verify the identity of the firefighter.'","Mastermind Darren Lloyd, 35, facing years behind bars after planning 8 raids which netted £43k .

An afternoon drive down to the coast may be a relaxing way to pass the time, but if you get too close to the tide it can get messy very quickly. One driver paid a hefty price for some slightly wayward parking when his car was swept into the Bristol Channel during high tide in Mumbles, Swansea yesterday. Worse still for the male driver, coastguard crews have since been unable to recover his silver Vauxhall Corsa and say it could be floating 'anywhere in the Bristol Channel.' All at sea: The headlights of the submerged Vauxhall Corsa can be seen beneath the waters off the Mumbles, Swansea. The car became stuck in sand after heading down a slipway . The man and his wife managed to get out of the car long before it became submerged on the slipway to the water's edge on Monday afternoon. However, despite a two-hour attempt emergency services were unable to recover the hire car. Now a warning has been issued to vessels in one of Britain's busiest shipping lanes. Going, going, going: Waters swirl around the Corsa just before it floated away at high tide. Coastguard officials said it could now be 'anywhere along the Bristol Channel' Officials fear the brand-new vehicle could now have floated all the way to the Devon coast. A spokesperson for the Maritime Coastguard Agency said a man and his wife who drove down the slipway called the coastguard rescue team when their car became submerged. The spokesperson said: 'The Martime Coastguard Agency helped the woman from the car when the water was one foot from the front of the car. 'Because the car had been driven on to soft sand it got stuck.' A spokesperson for Swansea Coastguard added: 'A local recovery service was called out, but they were unable to recover the vehicle. 'We broadcast navigation warnings every four hours, and in that broadcast today we have asked vessels to look out for a silver Vauxhall Corsa. 'It is possible it could be anywhere in the Bristol Channel. 'Police went down to the slipway at 2am on Tuesday and it was nowhere. 'The last time it had been seen it was actually floating away. 'I wouldn't rule it out turning up on the North Devon coast at somewhere like Ilfracombe, or Lynton.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:08 PM on 2nd December 2011 . Brooke is 7 years old and weighs just 45 pounds. But over the course of four months, a medical clinic being paid with state dollars prescribed her a cocktail of anti-psychotic drugs that her family doctor says could be dangerous even for an adult. The drugs didn't fix her temper tantrums and bad moods. Instead, they made her problems worse. And when she tried to go off of them, she became almost uncontrollable. Brooke is just one of millions of foster children across the country who have been prescribed unprecedented levels of powerful mind-altering drugs in an often misguided attempt to control the emotional problems these kids experience after watching their families break apart. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No solution: The heavy doses of dangerous drugs didn't make Brooke's problems better... they made them worse . ABC News reports that foster kids are 13 times more likely to receive 'mind-altering' psychotropic drugs than other children. Taxpayer-funded clinics have even prescribed the drugs, which are often approved only for adult use, to infants. Brooke was already facing an uphill battle to having a healthy childhood. Her mother was a drug dealer and a prostitute. Brooke was placed in a foster home at an early age, removed from her broken family and given to the care of strangers. The freckle-faced redhead counted 10 drugs that she was prescribed to control her temper tantrums and bad moods. But they didn't help, so doctors at the clinic in Florida continued increasing her doses. When foster mom Lisa Ward objected to the heavy medication, she was told that if she didn't follow the instructions of the state-sponsored doctors, Brooke could be taken away from her and placed with another foster family. Happy endings: After Brooke got off the medications, things turned better for her. Her foster mother adopted her and she's learning to deal with her problems . Finally Ms Ward paid to send Brooke to a private doctor. What he saw horrified him: 'The first thing we've got to think about, ""Is the medicine causing this?""' asked psychiatrist Dr Luis Quinones. But now, after a painful process of weening herself off the drugs, Brooke is better. Ms Ward and her husband adopted the 7-year-old and she has a new solution her her problems. 'What's another choice over a tantrum? What's a good choice?' Ms Ward recently asked her adopted daughter. 'To hug you,' Brooke replied. The problem has reached the ears of legislators in Washington, who heard testimony from some of foster children affected by this trend. Ke'onte, 12, tells Congress that he was wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD and given four different medications that left him in a 'stupor' A 12-year-old boy bravely told how he was medicated into a near-stupor as he was passed between foster care homes. The seventh grader, known only as Ke'onte, told Congress that being given the mind-altering drugs was 'the worst thing anyone could do to foster kids'. He revealed that he could barely eat while on the medication and was so exhausted 'it felt like I would collapse wherever I was in the house'. 'I think putting me on all these stupid meds was the stupidest thing I’ve ever experienced in foster care,' he said. Medicated: The Government study found children in foster care were 13 times more likely to be on anti-pyschotics and anti-depressants than other children . Ke'onte's plight came to light as a Government Accountability Office report was released that found the federal government had not done enough to oversee the treatment of foster children with powerful drugs. The study found cared-for children were up to 13 times more likely to be prescribed anti-psychotics and anti-depressants than other children. Ke'onte, who was adopted in 2009, said he had tantrums as a foster child and was inaccurately diagnosed as bipolar and having ADHD. 'I’ve been in the mental hospital three times during foster care, and every time I had to get on more meds or new meds to add to the ones I was already taking,' he said. He was on four different types of medication during his four years in six foster care and the drugs made him feel irritable, gave him stomach aches and affected his appetite, reports ABC. 'I remember having a bowl of spaghetti and had three bites and then I was done,' he said. He has since been taken off the medication and given therapy, and is thriving. He plays clarinet in the school band, competes in cross-country and has had roles in the school play. He said: 'In therapy, you talk about the deepest thing and it hurts, but you can deal with it better the next time. 'I’m not only more focused in school… I’m not going to the office anymore for bad behavior and I’m happy.' video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Government report finds foster children are 13 times more likely to be heavily medicated .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has extended an olive branch to Pakistan's prime minister in America's latest bid to address strained relations between the two countries. It comes exactly one week after the NATO bombing that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the Afghanistan border in an apparent case of mistaken identity. Following the attack, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said his county is re-evaluating its relationship with the United States. Peace offering: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani to offer her condolences for the 'unintended' deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers . But on Saturday Clinton spoke with the Pakistani leader to express condolences to the soldiers' families and to the Pakistani people. A statement from the U.S. State Department said Clinton 'once again expressed condolences to the families of the soldiers and to the Pakistani people for the tragic and unintended loss of life. 'She reiterated America's respect for Pakistan's sovereignty and commitment to working together in pursuit of shared objectives on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect.' She had hoped Pakistan would attend an international conference on Afghanistan scheduled for Monday in Germany. The country's attendance at the conference had been considered essential to ensure stability in the region stands a chance. But a government official told the AFP news agency: 'The cabinet has decided not to attend the Bonn meeting.' Pakistan refused to join in the U.S. investigation of the bombing and has moved to shut down supply lines the . U.S. uses to get food, fuel and equipment to troops in Afghanistan. Protesters burn a U.S. flag in Multan yesterday in response to the Nato air-strikes. It was today claimed that Nato forces may have been lured into attacking friendly Pakistani border posts by the Taliban . Last week U.S. military . reports suggested Nato forces may have been lured into attacking . friendly Pakistani border posts in a calculated manoeuvre by the . Taliban. The attack - which Pakistan claims went on for almost two hours and continued even after soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop - marked the deadliest friendly fire incident with Pakistan since the Afghanistan war began. A joint U.S.-Afghan patrol was attacked by the Taliban last weekend. While . pursuing the Taliban in the poorly-marked border area, the patrol is . said to have mistaken one of the Pakistan troop outposts for a militant . encampment and called in a Nato gunship and attack helicopters to open . fire. U.S. officials, . speaking on condition of anonymity, claim the reports suggest the . Taliban may have deliberately tried to provoke a cross-border fire-fight . that would set back fragile partnerships between the U.S. and Nato . forces and Pakistani soldiers at the ill-defined border. Student protesters shout anti-American slogans during a protest in Peshawar today. There is widespread anger across Pakistan following the air-strikes . The incident sent the perpetually difficult U.S.-Pakistan relationship into a tailspin. General . James Mattis, head of U.S. Central Command, announced he has . appointed Brigadier General Stephen Clark, an Air Force special . operations officer, to lead the probe into the incident. Brigadier . General Clark has been ordered to include input from the Nato-led . forces in Afghanistan, as well as representatives from the Afghan and . Pakistani governments. According . to the U.S. military records described to news agency the Associated . Press, the joint U.S. and Afghan patrol requested back-up after being . hit by mortar and small arms fire by Taliban militants. Before . responding, the joint U.S.-Afghan patrol first checked with the . Pakistani army, which reported it had no troops in the area, the . military account said. Some . two hours later, still hunting the insurgents - who had by then . apparently fled in the direction of Pakistani border posts - the U.S. commander spotted what he thought was a militant encampment, with heavy . weapons mounted on tripods. The . joint patrol called for the air-strikes at around 2.21am local time, . not realising the encampment was apparently the Pakistani border post. Heavily guarded: The 24 Pakistani soldiers who were killed in the attacks are buried yesterday . Salute: Pakistani soldiers march among the rows of coffins during yesterday's ceremony . Records show the aerial response included Apache attack helicopters and an AC-130 gunship. U.S. officials are working on the assumption the Taliban chose the location . for the first attack to create confusion and draw U.S. and Pakistani . forces into firing on each other, it is claimed. At . the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama . considers the Pakistani deaths a tragedy, and said the administration is . determined to investigate. The . Pentagon released a four-page memo from General Mattis directing . Brigadier General Clark to determine what happened, which units were . involved, which ones did or did not cross the border, how the operation . was coordinated, and what caused the deaths and injuries. Brigadier . General Clark must also develop recommendations about how border . operations could be improved. His final report must be submitted by . December 23. The details of . the air-strike emerged as aftershocks were last night reverberating . across the U.S. military and diplomatic landscape, threatening . communications and supply lines for the Afghan war and the success of an . upcoming international conference.

"By . David Wilkes . Last updated at 10:44 AM on 3rd December 2011 . The Duke of Edinburgh made the Queen cry with his ‘almost brutal’ attitude when she refused to take his surname of Mountbatten, a  biography claims. It says the Queen ‘failed to see that her actions would have a profound effect on Philip, leading to strains in their marriage’. And it even suggests that the ten-year delay between the births of the Princess Royal and the Duke of York may have been the result of ‘Philip’s anger over the Queen’s rejection of his family name’. Conflict: Prince Philip and the Queen disagreed over whether she should take his surname, a new biography reveals . Royal: An official photograph of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh taken by Canadian photographer Donald McKague in April, 1959 . The irritation he felt over his wife’s decision to accept the advice of then Prime Minister Winston Churchill and keep the family name Windsor is detailed in Sally Bedell Smith’s book, Elizabeth the Queen. The Duke wanted the Royal Family to be known as the House of Mountbatten when the Queen came to the throne in 1952. He is famously said to have told friends: ‘I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children. I’m nothing but a bloody amoeba.’ In an article in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine, Miss Bedell Smith has written of how in 1960 the Queen, heavily pregnant with the Duke of York, told Harold Macmillan she needed to ‘revisit the issue of her family  name, which had been irritating her husband since she decided  in 1952 to use Windsor rather  than Mountbatten’. Family: The Queen with Philip and the children - Princess Anne, baby Andrew and Prince Charles on holiday in Scotland . Marital debate: The book says that the Queen was left 'in tears' over the issue . The then Prime Minister wrote in his . diary: ‘The Queen only wishes (properly enough) to do something to . please her husband – with whom she is desperately in love. ‘What upsets me… is the Prince’s almost brutal attitude to the Queen over all this.’ Deputy Prime Minister Rab Butler and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, . were assigned the task of resolving the Queen’s ‘tricky’ family problem. In a telegram, Butler told Macmillan the Queen had ‘absolutely set her . heart’ on making a change for Philip’s sake. Miss Bedell Smith, whose . book is to be published in February, said: ‘By one account, Butler . confided to a friend that Elizabeth had been “in tears”.’ Following discussions, it was agreed that the Royal Family would continue to be called ‘the House and Family of Windsor’. But the Queen’s ‘de-royalised’ descendants, starting with any . grandchildren who lacked the designation of ‘royal highness’, would . adopt the surname ‘Mountbatten- Windsor’. In a statement on February 8, 1960, the Queen said she ‘has had this in mind for a long time and it is close to her heart’. ‘It seemed clear cut’, Miss Bedell Smith said. But, 13 years later, ‘Princess Anne....would contravene the policy on . her wedding day by signing the marriage register as . “Mountbatten-Windsor”’. The biography also gives an insight into the lighter side of royal life. It tells of the joy at the news that the Queen’s first child, Prince . Charles, was a boy. Sir John Weir, an official physician to the Royal Family, confided  that . he had ‘never been so pleased’ to see a boy born, Miss Bedell Smith . writes.","'I am nothing but a bloody amoeba', Philip told friends .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:49 PM on 4th December 2011 . Police have launched an international manhunt for a lodger after the bodies of a mother and daughter were found at the house where he lived. The two women, named as Angela Holgate, 54, and Alice Huyton, 75, were found at 5.45pm on Saturday at the property in Southport, Merseyside. Detectives are treating the deaths as unexplained but believe a man who also lived at the address has now gone abroad. Wanted: Merseyside Police have asked lodger Barry Morrow, 51, to contact them to help with their enquiries over the double death . Probe: Forensic officers investigate the house where the bodies of two women were found in Southport late on Saturday afternoon . It is thought the two women may have been strangled or suffocated. Officers want to speak to Barry Morrow, 51, and have urged him to get in contact. Mr Morrow, thought to be an engineer by profession, is understood to have links to France and Spain. He is described as white, 5ft 7in, of medium to stocky build with straight, short brown hair that is receding and blue eyes. Mrs Huyton was last seen on Friday evening when she left her home in Southport to visit her daughter, who had been ill recently and had not been seen out of the house for some time. Search: Officers enter the house near a black garage following the grim discovery on Saturday . She was married and her husband, thought to be in his 80s, was said to be 'devastated' at news of the deaths. Ms Holgate's white Citroen with the registration PN11 RWK is also missing. Chief Superintendent Nikki Holland, area commander for Sefton, said: 'We are investigating the tragic deaths of these two women and our sympathy goes to their families. 'Detectives are investigating the circumstances around these deaths and are trying to piece together the women's last movements. Find: Police are also investigating the whereabouts of Ms Holgate's white Citroen car, which also went missing after the bodies were found . 'We are appealing to anyone with any information that may help us with this investigation to come forward as soon as possible. 'In particular we are keen to trace . Mr Morrow, who lived at the house for a period of time and who we . believe may have vital information for this investigation.' Forensic experts are examining the . scene, officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries and have . stepped up high-visibility patrols. Stunned neighbours described Ms Holgate as a 'lovely, quiet woman'. She had lived in the smart, two-storey semi for around 20 years, raising her two daughters who are both understood to be aged in their 20s. The one-time Avon Lady was divorced from their father several years ago, neighbours said. A forensic officer combs an upstairs room in the property, which also housed a male lodger . Mr Morrow was first seen at the address earlier this year. He had recently re-paved the front garden and driveway. A neighbour who stopped to compliment him on the work said: 'I told him he was doing a good job and he told me he was the lodger. 'He was very powerfully built, he could lift the flagstones with one hand. 'I haven't the faintest idea what could have happened. It's very worrying.' Another resident said there were no police sirens or signs of emergency after the bodies were found last night.

"New fury as £1m-a-year star of Top Gear says 'let foxy woxy eat the gooey parts' of rail suicide victims . He denies that he apologised for saying strikers 'should be shot' BBC insiders are concerned about his state of mind and fear marriage is finally over . By . Lara Gould and Chris Hastings . Last updated at 2:28 PM on 4th December 2011 . Flying into fresh controversy: Presenter Jeremy Clarkson pictured at Heathrow Airport on Thursday . There were growing concerns yesterday about Jeremy Clarkson’s ‘vulnerable state of mind’ and the precarious state of his 18-year marriage after he provoked a fresh storm of protest. The Top Gear presenter made offensive comments about people who commit suicide – the second time that he has been at the centre of controversy in the space of a few days. One senior BBC insider, who asked not to be named, last night said Clarkson had moved out of the  family home he shares with second wife Frances and wasn’t in ‘the best possible place at the moment’. He said: ‘There is a feeling that he’s in a more vulnerable state than he should be and that’s why his judgment isn’t A-grade at the moment.’ Clarkson, who is reportedly paid £1million a year by the BBC, used his weekly column in The Sun newspaper to expand on comments he had made about suicide on The One Show on Wednesday night. He wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains. Last night three of the country’s leading mental health charities  said they would complain to the Press Complaints Commission about the remarks, which they said intruded on private grief and breached PCC guidelines which restrict what newspapers can report about suicides for fear of encouraging copycat incidents. Clarkson, 51, had already provoked uproar on Wednesday by joking on The One Show about suicides and then calling for striking public  sector workers to be shot in front  of their families. The One Show immediately issued an on-air apology for the star’s remarks about suicide but did not address his comments about strikers. The BBC subsequently apologised over the remarks about the strikers, after it received more than 21,000 complaints. It was widely assumed that Clarkson had also apologised for the remarks. But he denied having done so in his column yesterday. Corporation bosses had hoped the apologies would draw a line under the storm but Clarkson’s decision to return to the subject of what he called ‘Johnny Suicides’ in his newspaper column has only plunged him deeper into controversy. Paul Farmer, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘Jeremy Clarkson’s article in The Sun is extraordinarily tasteless and shows an utter lack of understanding of the tragedy of any suicide. ‘Many people who have contemplated suicide seriously or lost loved ones will be shocked by his insensitive tone and needless graphic detail.’ Under the heading ‘Think of the poor driver before your leap in front of Ivor’, Clarkson said he had every sympathy with those who felt the need to take their own lives. But he went on to argue that  suicide victims who ‘hurled’ themselves in front of trains were self-ish and disruptive because they inconvenienced other members of the public. He wrote: ‘It is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense. And think of what it’s like for the poor train driver who sees you lying on the line and can do absolutely nothing to avoid a collision.’ Controversial: Jeremy Clarkson makes his headline-hitting comment on BBC's The One Show . Clarkson then bemoans the fact that trains which are involved in a collision with a person must stop until the full aftermath of the incident has been dealt with and all remains have been recovered from the vicinity. He wrote: ‘The train cannot be moved nor the line re-opened until all of the victim’s body has been recovered. ‘This is the part I don’t understand. It’s not like the poor soul is going to get any better. ‘Change the driver, pick up the big bits of what’s left of the victim, get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find.’ Clarkson advises potential suicide victims to kill themselves quietly and privately. Marriage problems: Clarkson with his second wife, Frances. One BBC insider said the presenter has now moved out of the family home . Catherine Johnstone, the chief . executive of the Samaritans, which is campaigning to reduce the number . of suicides on the railway network, said the comments in the column went . beyond what he had said about suicide on The One Show and were far . worse than anything he had ever said about striking  public sector . workers. Clarkson's first wife: Alex Hall married him in 1989 but the couple separated a year later . She said: ‘His . notion that suicide  is a selfish act shows how little he knows about . the subject because, if he did, he would know that when a person . attempts suicide they are so distressed that they genuinely believe . their families will be better off without them. The fact that he has . chosen to add fuel to the flames of the comments he made on The One Show . again beggars belief. ‘It’s one thing to joke about people on strike, it’s in an entirely different realm of poor taste to joke about  suicide.’ Clarkson’s column also sparked an avalanche of complaints on Twitter and other social networking sites. One fan tweeted: ‘Please stop. Shooting the strikers is one thing, but this is pretty indefensible. Beware sarcasm in print.’ Another added: ‘Really shocked by the  “train suicide” comments. Used  to like Jeremy Clarkson. Not so much now.’ But there were some signs of  support . on Twitter and elsewhere. Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain,  of Maidenhead . Synagogue, said: ‘I am totally sympathetic to the black depression that . overtakes  those who commit suicide, and  certainly want to prevent any . future ones, but Clarkson has done us a favour by saying out aloud that . while people have the right to end their lives, they should not do so in . a way that scars others.’ News . of Clarkson’s marriage  difficulties comes nine months after . allegations surfaced that  the presenter had been having  a 14-month . affair with events organiser Philippa Sage, who works for a company . which helped produce the Top Gear Live show. Two . months later the millionaire presenter was forced to deny reports he . had been thrown out  of the marital home in Chipping Norton, . Oxfordshire, by his  wife after he wrote about the delights of living in . an unfurnished flat in Central London. A day later Clarkson said that . he had simply been using the flat as a bolt-hole while he was filming in . London. The BBC last night declined to comment on Clarkson’s column in yesterday’s Sun. A . BBC spokesman was unable to comment on anything relating  to the . presenter’s private life and was unable to reach Clarkson because he was . in China. Rumour: Clarkson faced allegations that he had an affair with events organiser Philippa Sage (pictured immediately in front of him . By CHRIS HASTINGS . One of the first rules of being a  high-profile media talking head is  that when you’ve gone too far you apologise – and move on. But Jeremy Clarkson appeared to be digging himself into a deeper hole yesterday when he denied that he had apologised for his comments about striking public sector workers. In his column in The Sun, Clarkson insisted that while he had apologised for his remarks about suicide on The One Show he had not said sorry for his demand that strikers should be shot. No regrets: Clarkson denied that he ever apologised for comments me made about striking public sector workers . He wrote: ‘According to Twitter, Facebook and all the other modern-day versions of the Clapham Omnibus, the BBC were forced to apologise this  week after I went on The One Show and said that all public service workers who went on strike should be executed in front of their families. This is not true. ‘I backed the strikers and then, to make a point about the need for impartiality, said they should be shot. In fact, the BBC apologised about my later remarks about people who jump in front of trains.’ Sources close to Clarkson have claimed that the presenter warned The One Show production team about what he was intending to say on air in one of the regular briefing meetings immediately before transmission. They claim fault for the controversy lies not with Clarkson but with the BBC which allowed the item to go ahead. However, insiders on the programme, which is watched by five million viewers every night, dispute this. They insist that Clarkson was told that he should avoid anything that was likely to provoke controversy. One, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Every guest who comes on to The One Show is briefed about the running order of the programme. It is a live programme which features topical news reports and it is only fair guests know what to expect. In the briefing, Jeremy did make reference to comments about shootings and killings as well as a load of other stuff. ‘The producer dealing with the briefing made it clear in no uncertain terms that Jeremy should avoid any comments that would be controversial. ‘He was also reminded of the need  to ensure that his comments were balanced. The One Show team member dealing with the briefing left that room assured that their advice had been taken onboard. ‘It is telling that when Jeremy did make the comments about the executions he very deliberately  made a reference to balance.’ Sources say that The One Show production team were horrified by the comments and gave Clarkson the opportunity to apologise on air. The presenter declined. Insiders also say Clarkson was briefed on the show’s running order four days earlier. The source said: ‘He promised not to say anything controversial. His only concern was that he would finish the programme so he could make his plane to China on time.’","New fury as £1m-a-year star of Top Gear says 'let foxy woxy eat the gooey parts' of rail suicide victims .

"By . James Slack . Last updated at 8:29 AM on 2nd December 2011 . Intervention: U.S. ambassador Louis Susman has made an extraordinary defence of the Extradition Act in two visits to MPs ahead of a crunch vote on the Act on Monday . MPs were last night urged to defy American ‘strong-arm’ tactics and demand a complete overhaul of the unjust Extradition Act. The U.S. ambassador was accused of trying to railroad Britain into sticking with the Act – even though it is plainly skewed against the rights of British citizens such as Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon. Louis Susman’s unprecedented intervention came ahead of a crunch House of Commons vote on Monday in which MPs will be given a landmark opportunity to call for a change to the law. He launched an extraordinary defence of the Act in the course of two visits to Westminster, attacking what he claimed were ‘myths and inaccuracies’ about the lopsided treaty. But, even as he was fighting for the Act, figures emerged showing more than twice as many people have been sent to the U.S. from Britain as have gone the other way. Mr Susman, who personally asked to appear before two parliamentary committees, used unusually blunt language to attack critics of the Act – which is being used to try to extradite Mr McKinnon. It comes ahead of a crunch House of Commons vote on Monday in which MPs will be given a landmark opportunity to call for a change to the law. David Cameron has decided not to impose a three-line whip on his MPs – with scores of backbenchers now expected to vote to renegotiate the 2003 U.S/UK treaty. In a sign of how rattled the Americans have become, Mr Susman visited MPs on both Wednesday and yesterday afternoon. Campaign: Gary McKinnon with his mother Janis. The U.S. are attempting to use the Act to force him to go to America to face charges over computer hacking . He told the foreign affairs committee: ‘The constant use of skewed arguments and wilful distortion of the facts by some to advance their own agendas remains of great concern to the United States.’ In what was considered an attack on the Gary McKinnon campaign, he added: ‘It would be wrong to view the extradition treaty through the prism of individual cases where sentiment and emotion can cloud reality and lead to misrepresentation.’ Campaigners point to the mountains of evidence that the treaty is unfair. Yesterday, Tory MP Dominic Raab uncovered figures showing that, between 2004 and July 2011, 123 people of all nationalities were extradited from Britain to the U.S. During the same period, only 54 travelled in the opposite direction. But, in a statement which appeared to place huge pressure on MPs ahead of Monday’s vote, the ambassador warned: ‘I believe that having signed the treaty, and having had it tested both through the British justice system and by independent experts, it is now incumbent on the UK Government to stand in support of it.’ It is extremely unusual for a foreign ambassador to make an appeal to British MPs over how they should vote in Parliament. Melanie Riley, of the campaign group Friends Extradited said: ‘Why would the U.S. ambassador look to strong-arm the UK government like this – to prevent Parliament improving safeguards for British citizens – unless the U.S./UK Treaty was so blatantly favourable towards U.S. interests?’ Mr Raab, who has secured Monday’s debate, said he had asked the U.S for its figures on extradition but these were not available. He said: ‘It is regrettable that the U.S. ambassador is accusing British Parliamentarians of a “wilful distortion of the facts” without a few of his own.’ Mr Raab, the MP for Walton and Esher added: ‘Parliament must stand up and protect British citizens from arbitrary and abusive fast-track extradition. Visit: Keith Vaz confirmed that Mr Susman had spoken to his home affairs select committee ahead of the debate. He added that he believed that a new treaty was needed . ‘It is vital to prevent a repeat of the kind of treatment we’ve seen Gary McKinnon subjected to.’ Keith Vaz, a joint sponsor of Monday’s debate, confirmed his home affairs select committee had also been visited by the ambassador. He told the Mail: ‘Extradition is an issue about which many Members have strong feelings. It is essential that Members have the opportunity to air these in public. We need a new treaty, it’s as simple as that.’ Monday’s debate calls for MPs to bring forward urgent laws to change both the UK/U.S. Act and the hugely controversial European Arrest Warrant. The Labour leadership – mindful of the fact the party signed the 2003 Act in the first place – is intending to vote against change. However, Labour MPs will not be on a three-line whip, raising the prospect of a sizeable number of its MPs supporting the motion. Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems are long-standing opponents of the Act. The debate is a major breakthrough for the Mail’s Affront to British Justice Campaign, which was triggered by the case of Mr McKinnon, 45. He faces being put on a plane to the U.S. on charges of hacking into Pentagon and Nasa computers – even though experts say he could take his own life. If MPs vote in favour of the demand for ‘urgent change’, Mr Cameron will find himself under huge pressure to renegotiate the deal with the Americans. Mr Susman was appointed as the U.S. ambassador to Britain after raising more than £315,000 for Barack Obama. The 73-year-old ex-investment banker had no previous diplomatic experience. The major criticism of the 2003 UK/U.S. Extradition Act is that it gives British citizens inferior rights compared to Americans. The U.S. can demand a Briton’s extradition without having to provide any evidence – but Britain has to all but prove its case in a U.S. court. Under the Act, if the U.S. government wants to extradite a UK citizen it needs only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought. But to extradite an American from the States, Britain must prove ‘probable cause’ – which the U.S. Constitution’s fourth amendment defines as ‘ information sufficient to warrant a prudent person’s belief that the wanted individual has committed a crime’. Of the ambassador, we would ask this simple question: if the treaty is meant to be fair, why not allow the wording to be changed so that British citizens have exactly the same ‘probable cause’ protection as their U.S. counterparts? The fact that he is going to extreme lengths to oppose such a change suggests that — contrary to his protests — Britons are undeniably getting a very raw deal. So it is over to our elected MPs. MPs have an opportunity to send an unequivocal message to politicians on both sides of the Atlantic that our unjust extradition laws must change. For Gary McKinnon’s sake, we urge each and every one of them to take it. Read more here . In essence, Americans are provided a protection by their own Constitution to which there is no equivalent in British law. The U.S. insists that, in reality, there is no difference between the way U.S. and UK citizens are treated. It is simply a different legal way of expressing the same point, in order to reflect the wording of the constitution, says America. This view was shared by Sir Scott Baker’s inquiry, which has been dismissed as a whitewash. The puzzle is that – if the U.S. is so adamant that its wording offers no greater protection than the British version – why not allow the treaty to be changed? At a stroke, those facing extradition from the UK could be given the same ‘probable cause’ defence and much of the heat would be taken out of the debate. The fact the U.S. is refusing to do so rather suggests that – contrary to the denials – its citizens do have the best deal. It’s worth noting that the hugely respected American Civil Liberties Union entirely disagrees with the position of its own government. ACLU says: ‘We are also concerned about the threats to the rights of British people and the unfair lopsided aspect of the treaty that means that while Americans have basic constitutional protections requiring the establishment of probable cause before extradition can be granted, under the treaty, British residents can be subject to extradition to the US without equivalent evidentiary requirements being made out.’ Campaigners point out that, if a UK citizen is wanted by the U.S., he has no right to an evidential hearing in a UK court. If a U.S. citizen is wanted by the UK, he has a constitutional right to an evidential hearing in a U.S. magistrate’s court.","U.S. ambassador in extraordinary defence of Act .

"By . Chris Hastings . Last updated at 5:46 PM on 4th December 2011 . Sienna Miller is to star in a harrowing new  drama about film director Alfred Hitchcock’s obsession with Tippi Hedren – star of his classic The  Birds – and how it destroyed both their careers. The Girl, to be screened next year, will show how an infatuated 62-year-old Hitchcock sexually harassed the 31-year-old blonde starlet and tried to control every aspect of her life – both on and off screen. Tippi suffered in silence for the best part of three years  but eventually walked out when her mentor made it clear her future career depended on giving in to his sexual demands. New role: Sienna Miller, left, has met Tippi, right who she will play in film The Girl . Gwyneth Hughes, the writer of the BBC2 drama, said: ‘Everyone knows Hitchcock was keen on his blondes. Unfortunately for Tippi, he developed a twisted and obsessive love for her that left her feeling isolated and terrified. He made repeated sexual advances towards her and tried to take over her life. ‘Today we would call it sexual harassment but that concept had not been accepted back then.’ The new film is inspired by the biographer Donald Spoto’s account of the couple’s relationship in his 2008 book Spellbound By Beauty. Hitchcock’s infatuation with Tippi began in 1961 when he spotted her by chance in a television commercial for a diet drink. Convinced he had found the next Grace Kelly, the director ignored the fact that Tippi had no real  acting experience and signed her up for the starring role in 1963 film  The Birds. Controlling: Tippi pictured with Hitchcock at a screening of The Birds in Cannes, France in 1963 . Tippi in a scene from The Birds . The director of Psycho  and Vertigo immediately set about  transforming her into the perfect  Hollywood icon and took control of all aspects of her life, including her off-set wardrobe and diet. Divorcee Tippi – whose daughter Melanie Griffith grew up to be a major Hollywood star in her own right – was initially grateful for the director’s attention. But she grew more and more fearful as his obsession began to spiral out of control, first on the set of The Birds and then during production on their follow-up film, Marnie. Hitchcock, who had taken to  incessantly staring at Tippi between takes, banned her from sharing  cars with her male co-stars and insisted that all their conversations took place in private so they could be alone together. Hitchcock's obsession with Tippi eventually destroyed both their careers . The film maker photographed to showcase the 1955 TV series, Alfred Hitchcock Presents . Sean Connery, left, and Tippi Hedren, right in a scene from Hitchock's film, Marnie . As well as bombarding her with unwanted gifts, he had her followed around town and, totally obsessed, even sent examples of her handwriting to graphologists. Tippi, who had signed a seven-year contract with the director, put up  with his harassment because she was fearful he would blacklist her if she spoke out. But she finally quit when he made it clear on the set of Marnie that she would never work again unless she gave in to his sexual demands. Tippi’s decision to walk away stalled her career because Hitchcock kept her to her contract and refused to allow her to work with other directors. But the collapse of the couple’s working relationship also had a  devastating impact on the director, whose long run of hit, classic movies dried up. Both Spoto and Tippi, who is now 81 and has already met Miller, 29, to discuss the role, are co-operating with the producers of the film. It will begin shooting on Thursday and will be screened on BBC2 next year. Imelda Staunton will play the director’s long-suffering wife, Alma.","Film  will show how Hitchcock sexually harassed the blonde starlet and tried to .

A furious doctor is said to have broken into his former medical centre to rearrange lab rats and steal scientific materials from former colleagues, it has been reported. Dr Mohsen Hosseinkhani, 40, allegedly sought revenge after losing his fellowship at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. The researcher ‘moved all the animals [lab rats] around from cage to cage so they didn’t know which was which’, it was claimed today. Dr. Hosseinkhani was arrested on Tuesday and charged with burglary and grand larceny, with sources claiming his motive was losing his cardiology-fellowship program in June. The source told the New York Post: ‘His work was lacking compared to the others in his group.’ Dr Hosseinkhani allegedly broke into the center on July 1 and also is accused of taking stem-cell cultures and antibodies, along with other materials, according to a Manhattan Criminal Court complaint. The scientific materials taken are said to be worth $10,000 and allegedly included a cancerous chemical. He apparently returned once more to the medical center on November 28 to take additional pipettes, which are used to transport liquids, the newspaper reported. Crime scene: Mount Sinai Medical Center (right) in New York City was where the incident took place . The complaint on court papers reads: ‘[Hosseinkhani] did not have permission or authority to enter into the areas of the above location on either July 1, 2011, or Nov. 28, 2011.’ A statement released by Mount Sinai Medical Center said: ‘Mr. Mohsen Hosseinkhani was a post-doctoral fellow engaged in research until June 2011, and had no contact with patients. ‘Mount Sinai will continue to cooperate with the investigation.’ Hosseinkhani claims on his LinkedIn profile that he received a PhD in Cardiac Regeneration from Harvard Medical School and it still lists him as a current medical doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital Foundation. The doctor is scheduled to appear at court next week and was released on bail on Wednesday.","Dr Hosseinkhani also allegedly took $10,000 of scientific materials .

"By . Robert Verkaik . Last updated at 1:57 AM on 4th December 2011 . Model daughter: Sahar Daftary who died after falling from a high rise building in Salford Quays . For Anisa Daftary, it was the final . insult to the memory of her beautiful daughter, who died after falling . 150 ft from the balcony of her former lover’s flat in Manchester. Police officers had arrived at the . family home in London with two black bin liners, which Anisa thought . would contain her daughter Sahar’s personal possessions. But when she . opened the bags, she  discovered a random collection of clothes and . shoes that were far too big for her petite daughter, a recent winner of . an international beauty contest. When Anisa challenged the officers, . they callously joked that the clothes must be ‘Manchester sizes’ – . implying that women in the North of England are overweight compared with . their southern counterparts. In her first interview since Sahar’s . mysterious death in December 2008, Anisa, a 57-year-old widow from . Afghanistan but now based in Brentford, West London, reveals how the . appalling blunder was typical of a police investigation that she says . betrayed her daughter. Anisa said: ‘I feel the police have . failed to carry out a proper investigation into my daughter’s death. They have let down Sahar and they have let down our family.’ The body of Sahar, a model who was working at Harrods, was found at the bottom of a Manchester quayside tower block. Sahar went there to meet Rashid . Jamil, 36, whom she had secretly married in a Muslim ceremony in 2007, . the same year she won the global Face Of Asia beauty award. Sahar, 23, . had separated from Mr Jamil after discovering her ‘husband’ was already . married to another Muslim woman with whom he had fathered two children. Betrayal: Anisa Daftary and daughter Mariam Daftary-Karim feel the police inquiry into Sahar's death was deeply flawed . On December 20, 2008, Sahar went to . Manchester to take part in a fashion show and afterwards visited Mr . Jamil to retrieve her possessions, which included designer clothes and . family photo albums. Sahar’s sister, Mariam Daftary-Karim, . 33, said: ‘We don’t believe Sahar would have committed suicide. Two . people were alone in that flat, but only one person was left alive. We . want to know the truth of what happened when they were together that . night.’ Despite repeated requests from the . family, it was four months after Sahar’s death before Greater Manchester . Police said they could return her belongings. But the family’s hope quickly turned to despair when they saw the jumbled contents of the bin liners. And when Anisa challenged the . officers, she says their response horrified her. ‘They just laughed and . said the clothes were Manchester sizes,’ she said. ‘I thought I was going to get my . daughter’s clothes back, but they just joked. I was crying. It was so . terrible after all that we had suffered. ‘She was the youngest of my five daughters and, ever since my husband died in a motoring accident, I have tried to protect her.’ Double life: Businessman Rashid Jamil with Sahar at their Muslim wedding in 2007 . Mariam said: ‘My sister was very . petite. She was a size 6 to 8 and these dresses were size 14. The shoes . were several sizes too big as well. ‘They looked as if they had been . picked up from a charity shop and the police hadn’t bothered to check. We didn’t recognise any of the clothes.’The family also claim that police officers didn’t interview them until two weeks after Sahar’s death. The family solicitor, Richard Slade, describes the delay as ‘extraordinary’. He says that because the police had . arrested Mr Jamil over an allegation of murder and he had claimed she . may have committed suicide, they should have prioritised assessing . Sahar’s state of mind just before her death. He added: ‘It’s very disappointing . that more vigorous measures were not taken in this case. It was the . family’s impression that the police seemed to have decided it was . suicide, which tarnished their approach to the rest of the . investigation. The family found it very difficult to get any information . at all from the police.’ The family have instructed leading QC . James Lewis to challenge Mr Jamil over his version of the circumstances . in which Sahar fell from his luxury flat. Mr Jamil’s solicitor has . repeatedly insisted that he was not responsible for her death. The family will also accuse the . police of treating them heartlessly and of squandering vital time in the . initial stages of the investigation. And yesterday it was revealed that . Greater Manchester Police had asked for an 11th-hour adjournment to the . inquest into Sahar’s death, which had been due to start tomorrow, to . allow the force to consult lawyers. Betrayal: Rashid Jamil with Narhisa Amjad, who was also his wife under sharia law . Sahar met Mr Jamil, a businessman, at . a party organised by a fashion magazine in 2006. But because he was . Pakistani, she kept the relationship secret. Her four older sisters had . all married Afghan men. A year passed before Sahar told them . about her boyfriend. Mariam remembers: ‘She was impressed by him. I . remember her saying that he was not like some other Asian men. ‘She said, “He’s open-minded and doesn’t want to control me.” I remember being happy for her.’ But when they met Mr Jamil in . Brentford, the family’s perception of him changed. ‘He drove down in a . black Range Rover, but was drinking vodka and kept getting us to drink. I . didn’t trust him with my sister.’ Her sister Roha was so suspicious she . asked Mr Jamil direct whether he had been married before. Mariam . recalls: ‘He said he hadn’t and claimed he only wanted to marry Sahar.’ Mariam said he appeared very anxious . that their mother wouldn’t approve of him because he didn’t share their . culture. He jokingly told them: ‘Tell her not to worry because, although . I come from Pakistan, I’m not a terrorist.’ When Anisa finally met Mr Jamil at a . restaurant in Knightsbridge, Central London, to mark the end of Ramadan, . the month of fasting in the Islamic calendar, she remembers feeling . ‘instinctively uneasy’ about him. ‘He told me he would “not let me . down”,’ she recalls. But the couple didn’t wait for . Anisa’s approval. Mr Jamil and Sahar moved in together in Manchester . before secretly marrying in a sharia ceremony at a mosque in Southall, . West London, in 2007. Tragic: The flats from which Sahar fell to her death . Just a few months later, Anisa was . contacted by Narhisa Amjad, who claimed to be married to Mr Jamil and . was expecting their second child. Mariam said: ‘It was shocking. We told . Sahar that she must come home to London and leave him.’ But Sahar . didn’t believe the family until she spoke to Narhisa, who had sent two . photographs of her with Mr Jamil, on the phone at a hotel in Manchester . where the model was staying with Mr Jamil. According to the family, . Mr Jamil told Sahar that he didn’t want to live with Narhisa any more . and that she had not been a good wife. ‘He must have persuaded her to stay with him because she wouldn’t leave him,’ said Mariam. It . was only then that Sahar told the family about the secret wedding and . said she wanted a party for all of the family the following year. Concerned for Sahar’s happiness, they agreed to an extravagant ceremony . with 200 guests. Once again, alarm bells started to ring. Mariam . remembers Mr Jamil being reluctant for the event to go ahead and he only . invited one friend to the ceremony. ‘He said his father was very . religious and wouldn’t like him marrying a woman who wasn’t Pakistani,’ she said. ‘But we know now that he liked to manipulate women.’ Soon . after the wedding, the couple started rowing and they broke up when it . became clear Mr Jamil did not want to move to London and wasn’t prepared . to register their marriage with the civil authorities. Mariam said: ‘Sahar came back to London to live with our mother. She had got over him and had everything to live for. ‘She . had started studying finance and accounting at university. On the day . after her death, we were expecting her at home because she was due to . fly out on holiday to Dubai to celebrate her birthday.’ The Mail on . Sunday put the detailed claims of Anisa and her daughter  to Greater . Manchester Police. It refused to comment, instead reissuing a 2010 . statement by Detective Inspector Stephen Keeley relating to the case. He . said: ‘Following the tragic death of Sahar in December 2008, a thorough . investigation was carried out by Greater Manchester Police. A file was . prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviewed the case and . decided that no charges should be brought against the [then] 33-year-old . man arrested. ‘My thoughts go out to Sahar’s  family at this . difficult time but I am  satisfied as a result of our investigation that . there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.’ Mr . Jamil’s solicitor, James Dyson, said yesterday his client had dealt with . these issues during the ‘comprehensive police investigation’. He added: ‘My client has given a full account to the police and he has always denied being responsible for the death.’","Mother and sister's fury over blunders in investigation .

Footage has been unearthed which shows Science fiction author Sir Arthur C Clarke thought Russia would land the first man on the moon in 1968. The late 2001: A Space Odyssey author made his space race forecast in 1961, even predicting  Russia would set foot on the moon on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. Previously thought to be lost, the BBC interview shows Clarke chatting to friend TV astronomer Sir Patrick Moore in an episode of The Sky at Night, the world's longest running television science programme. Predictions: Arthur C Clarke, pictured here in 1974, said the Russians would win the space race . In the interview in 1963 it had been two years since the Russians got the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin, in April 1961, but it was the Americans who would disprove his theory and get to the moon first. It was thought the broadcast had vanished, but it has just been discovered in a television station archive in Africa by collectors looking for lost episodes of Doctor Who. The grainy footage shows Clarke predicted the Americans would lag behind the Russians and reach the moon just two years later. Landing: Although Arthur C Clarke predicted Russia would be first to land on the moon, he did get the date almost right as Neil Armstrong and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin (pictured) landed in 1969 . Flying the flag: Arthur C Clarke thought Russia would win the space race, he was proven wrong as Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin landed on the moon . And he wasn’t far wrong with his prediction of: 'Around 1970, if you want to pin me down.’ It was 1969 when Neil Armstrong put his left foot on to the surface of the moon. He said: 'The American moon project is a colossal thing, costing $10m a day. I believe they will succeed in getting a man on the moon – and back again, which is equally important – not before 1970, but it will not be much after that.' After seeing the film of the interview again after almost half a century, Moore told the Guardian: 'We got some right, some not so right. I don't think we did too badly.' The Sky at Night: Patrick Moore, pictured in 1961 presenting the show, said he was thrilled new footage had been unearthed . The film was discovered in an African television archive by one of an eccentric gang of collectors. Their prime target is lost episodes of Doctor Who, but they recognised the exceptional rarity of the 1963 The Sky at Night interview. The collector, who bought it from the archive sent it back, still in its original film can, as a gift to the current The Sky at Night production team. Footage from the reel will be shown in December's The Sky at Night programme next week. Discovering the footage was incredibly moving for Moore as it is the only record of the only programme which he and friend Clarke made live together in a studio. Although he did interview Clarke again, it was through filmed inserts or taped phone interviews. The British science fiction author, inventor and futurist died in his adoptive homeland of Sri Lanka in 2008 aged 90.

The third victim of a Craigslist job fraud scheme on an Ohio farm has been identified as police try to piece together the story behind the latest Craigslist killer. This is latest victim found in the case where a self-proclaimed preacher allegedly lured middle-aged unemployed men to a remote farm on the promise of work before shooting them dead and burying their bodies in shallow graves. Two bodies were found on the farm and police were alerted the scheme when the another victim escaped after suspect Richard Beasley shot at him. Authorities have identified the dead victim as Ralph Geiger, 52, a native of Akron, Ohio. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Head bowed low: Accused Craigslist killer Richard Beasley was wheeled into Ohio court Thursday, after a Texas judge OK'd his release from an Ohio jail earlier this year on unrelated charges . Mr Geiger's body was found on suspect Beasley's farm on November 25, but it is unknown how long Mr Geiger was missing. The other dead body was identified earlier last week, with police saying that the man was Timothy Kern, 47, who had been missing from his Massillon, Ohio home for a week after answering Beasley's Craigslist ad. The case against Beasley is long and complicated, as previous drug and prostitution charges are brought into the mix. On Thursday he was arraigned in an Akron courthouse on charged with selling the drug Oxycontin, and then on Friday he appeared in the same court facing 15 charges relating to prostitution. Partner in crime: Brogan Rafferty, 16 (right) faces charges of aggravated murder. He allegedly helped Beasley with the . phony Craigslist ads for jobs at a non-existent ranch . Cuffed up: 16-year-old Brogan Rafferty faces juvenile charges of aggravated murder. Authorities say the teenager was involved in the scheme with Beasley . The FBI confirmed that in addition to these charges, Beasley is also a suspect in the murders stemming from the Craigslist ad that called for day laborers . The ad called for applicants to bring all of their belongings as they would be living on the farm while working with the cattle. Police have also arrested Brogan Rafferty, 16, who was said to be an accomplice of Beasley's. Though his mother maintains his innocence, Rafferty faces juvenile charges of aggravated murder, complicity to aggravated murder, attempted murder and complicity to attempted murder in the death of one man and the shooting of another. The complaint against Rafferty says he participated in the crimes with Beasley, who has not been charged in the Craigslist case. Lured: Police believe at least three of the men were attacked after responding to the same advert offering work on a 688-acre cattle farm . Beasley walked into court but later complained that he felt ill, and he was wheeled by deputies before the judge. He ignored reporters' questions outside court on whether there are more buried bodies and about his relationship with Rafferty. His attorney, Rhonda Kotnik, said later that Beasley's mother is worried that he has displayed symptoms of a stroke. Beasley is taking medication for back pain, Ms Kotnik said. His emotional state 'is distraught. He's alert, he's in pain because of his issues, his back issues,' she said. The news of the identity of the second body comes just one day after news broke that the murders could have been avoided. Confusion and bureaucratic mistakes over the extradition of Beasley to Texas on existing burglary parole conviction and Ohio drug dealing charges lead to Beasley being released on parole earlier this year.

The royal household is set to see six consecutive years of funding cuts - affecting the Queen’s income, which has dropped in real terms since 2009. The austerity measures mean the monarch’s royal palace repairs will likely be halted. Funding cuts: The Queen (pictured in Liverpool this week) faces a pay freeze until 2015 . And any extra taxpayers’ money previously used to fund the court of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will also no longer be available, according to the Sunday Times. The Prince of Wales will be responsible for the costs of providing staff for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, until Charles becomes king. While the Queen won’t see a pay rise until at least 2015 following the replacement of the civil list with the sovereign grant. The monarch’s funding is now linked to profits at the Crown Estate instead of taxpayers’ money paying for royal travel and royal palaces. Royal palaces: The Queen's hopes to tackle repairs on Buckingham Palace (pictured) are likely to be halted . Almost two-thirds of people believe living standards will decline in the coming decades with the current generation of children ending up worse off than their parents, according to a new poll. An Ipsos Mori survey for The Observer revealed that 64 per cent of those questioned believe it was unlikely that today's youth would have a better life than their mothers and fathers while just 32 per cent thought it was likely. When asked whether their children would have a higher or lower quality of life when they reached their age, just under a quarter (23 per cent) said they believed it would be higher, while 35 per cent said it would be lower and 32 per cent saying it would be the same. The opinion represents a big swing since April 2003, when 43 per cent of people believed their children would be better off at the same stage of life and 12 per cent thought they would be worse off. The poll was conducted between November 19-21 - before the Chancellor's Autumn statement announced a further raft of austerity measures. George Osborne said the stalling economy meant the Government's efforts to tackle the deficit would have to continue far beyond the next general election and warned the problems could become even worse if the eurozone crisis spirals out of control. The Queen’s funding will now equal 15 . per cent of the profits made two years previously by the Crown Estate, . under the new law which passed six weeks ago. The Crown Estate includes Regent Street, Windsor Great Park and over 50 per cent of the UK’s shoreline. Chancellor George Osborne has imposed the freeze on the Queen’s taxpayer funding – setting payments at £30m per year until April 2013. But she will receive a further one-off payment of £1m to fund the cost of the diamond jubilee. In stark contrast, she received £77.3m from taxpayer funding in 1991-2, but since the recession she’s seen a huge drop. In 2008-9 it had fallen to £38.3m, while last year she received only £32.1m, according to an official Treasury briefing document placed in the House of Commons and House of Lords libraries. The Sunday Time reported that the . Sovereign Grant Bill reads: ‘The grant levels envisaged in the early . years of the new system [starting in April 2013] are, in real terms, . below what the Royal Household spent in every one of the last 20 years.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:09 PM on 3rd December 2011 . Foul-mouthed parents launched a bitter tirade at grotto staff dressed as Santa's elves and fairies in front of their children when a Groupon deal turned sour at the weekend. More than 2,000 families turned up to last weekend's St. Nicholas Fayre in York clutching a voucher from the discount website promising a magical Christmas train ride at the grotto. But the atmosphere turned nasty when staff, decked out in festive fancy dress, were verbally abused after informing families that the website had got it wrong and that there was in fact no train ride. Christmas isn't cheerful: Staff at the grotto in York had to face foul-mouthed parents. From left, Ellie Rushton, Robert Briggs, Donna Parks and Jazzmin Ullah . Voucher blunder: Groupon are at the centre of claims they issued false information tempting 2,000 families to travel to York for a Santa's grotto train ride that didn't exist . As queues grew so long outside the grotto that children couldn't get in, tempers frayed and parents started to shout and swear at overwhelmed grotto staff. Tearful and crying children watched while parents shouted at staff forcing one elf to quit and a woman dressed as a Christmas tree to complain that she had been targeted for abuse. Grotto organiser Penny Ward said: 'One man even verbally threatened the lady who is dressed as a Christmas tree. 'One of the elves was so upset that she has resigned. It was a complete nightmare. Children were crying and upset.' Abuse: Staff in fancy dress had to endue abuse from angry parents at Santa's grotto in York . All dressed up: But staff at the York winter wonderland were abused at the weekend by angry parents who thought they had a voucher guaranteeing a train ride . She added that most of the abusive parents had travelled from Newcastle during last weekend's popular Christmas market in the picturesque city. The grotto was only able to handle 40 children an hour, she said and explained that dedicated staff had worked beyond their normal hours and without breaks to try to ensure excited children did not miss out. Penny had initially been contacted by Groupon and agreed to use its services to help publicise the grotto, but she claimed she had never signed a contract and did not say there would be a train ride. She thought that the York grotto, which runs in York's winter wonderland until Christmas Eve, might have been mixed up with a grotto she ran in Hull, where there was a train ride. A Groupon spokesman said: 'Owing to a technical error, we apologise that the picture and wording used in this promotion may have indicated that a train ride was available at York Winter Wonderland when this wasn't the case. We regret any disappointment this may have caused. 'Although advanced booking is not essential, preferred time slots cannot be guaranteed without prior booking and are subject to availability. We hope that this hasn't taken away from the Santa's grotto experience and we wish everyone a happy holiday season.' The website said it had corrected the promotion as soon as it discovered the error and had yesterday sent out a bulk email clarifying what was included in the promotion for customers that were yet to redeem their vouchers. Groupon is an international organisation which uses collective buying power to offer huge discounts on things to do, eat, see and buy. Recipe for disaster: Rachel Brown had to draft in 25 staff as demand surged for her cupcakes . But it has run into controversy in the past few weeks with companies claiming that they have been unaware of the impact the deals can have on their businesses. Last month baker Rachel Brown, from Woodley, near Reading, told how, who normally makes 100 cupcakes a month, found herself having to bake an astonishing 102,000 after posting an offer on Groupon. Disastrously, because the 50-year-old's deal . had been so generous and the demand so huge, she made a loss on every . order – wiping out her profits for the entire year. And yesterday the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) launched an investigation into Groupon after regulators complained the . daily deals website broke advertising regulations on almost 50 occasions . since the start of the year. The company debuted on the IPO stock exchange last month and, after an early rise, slumped below $20 on concern about competition from rival LivingSocial and how the European debt crisis might affect overseas growth. However, Groupon released strong early holiday sales numbers this week and executives said international growth remains strong. Groupon shares rose more than 7 per cent to an intraday high of $20.82 on Friday. The stock was up 5.5 per cent to $20 in late-morning trading.","More than 2,000 families descended on venue in York demanding festive train ride .

"By . Daniel Martin, Emily Allen and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 5:08 PM on 3rd December 2011 . Apology: Jeremy Clarkson at Heathrow on Thursday following the outcry over his comments . Jeremy Clarkson has caused another controversy after today criticising people who kill themselves on train lines. The notorious presenter said that anyone who committed suicide in this way was 'very selfish' for traumatising train drivers and inconveniencing commuters. His latest outburst comes as it is revealed that his joke about executing public sector workers for going on strike was pre-arranged with television producers. The BBC has so far received 21,335 complaints about Mr Clarkson's comments on Wednesday evening's edition of The One Show. And now he is set to trigger further outcry with his insensitive remarks about suicide victims - whom he calls 'Johnny Suicide' - in his newspaper column today. He wrote that killing oneself by jumping in front of a train 'is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense.' Mr Clarkson claimed that train drivers involved in these cases are 'traumatised for life', and complained that passengers would 'have to sit around for hours'. And he added that trains should not wait until all the remains of the body had been removed from tracks, saying - grotesquely - that drivers should instead 'get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away and hard to find.' However, in his article for The Sun Mr Clarkson stressed that he had 'the deepest sympathy for anyone whose life is so mangled and messed up that they believe death's icy embrace will be better.' Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, described the comments as 'extraordinarily tasteless', especially in the wake of the death of footballer Gary Speed. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I think there will be many people who have lost loved ones to suicide and people who have contemplated suicide that will think it is in extremely bad taste. 'This is a man who really doesn't understand what he is talking about.' Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: 'We are absolutely appalled that Jeremy Clarkson should accuse people who throw themselves on railway lines of being selfish. 'Sadly he is not the first person to show this lack of understanding.' Strike storm: Jeremy Clarkson at Heathrow airport with fellow Top Gear presenter James May (rear) kissing a woman's hand . Earlier this week Mr Clarkson . triggered thousands of complaints after saying public sector strikers . should be ‘executed’ in front of their families. But now it has emerged producers thought it would be amusing if . the Top Gear host offered an extreme view of the strike that was not . meant to be taken seriously, The Times said. The . production team were aware of the contents prior to broadcast but Mr . Clarkson apparently took it one step further than they had expected when . he said strikers should be shot in front of their families. In . a day of extraordinary overreaction yesterday to what was clearly meant . as a joke, one union official threatened to report Mr Clarkson to . police, while another said his comments were worthy of Colonel Gaddafi. Even . the Prime Minister, a friend of Mr Clarkson, was dragged into the row, . describing the remarks as ‘silly’, while Ed Miliband said they were . ‘disgusting’. By Thursday . evening, when Mr Clarkson was finally forced to issue an apology, the . BBC had received almost 5,000 complaints about the interview. Yesterday morning that figure had risen to more than 20,000. In . an interview with The Sun, the 51-year-old likened the incident to . 'Sachs-gate,' the 2008 debacle in which Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand . left messages on actor Andrew Sachs' answering machine claiming Brand . had slept with his granddaughter. The prank sparked a public outcry resulting in Brand's resignation and Ross's suspension from the corporation. In all the BBC received 38,000 complaints about Sachs-gate, putting it only second to a broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera, which garnered more than 55,000 complaints. 'It's like the Jonathan Ross thing - it's a knee-jerk reaction,' Mr Clarkson told the paper. 'I was just making a joke about the . BBC's need to be impartial. If you listen to the whole interview, you'll . see there isn't a case to answer. 'Most people who are complaining haven't seen the full interview.' Controversial: Mr Clarkson said he wanted to see strikers shot when he appeared on the One Show this week . Awkward: Presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones squirmed as Mr Clarkson made his comments on the live programme . The row erupted after millions saw the Top Gear host asked for his views on the day’s nationwide strikes. He started by saying he liked the strikers, because the industrial action had meant there was no traffic on the roads. But after insisting he had to be balanced as he worked for the impartial BBC, he launched into a satirical rant. Thousands of public sector workers joined pickets and marches across the country on Wednesday in a strike over pensions and cuts . He said: ‘Frankly, I would have them shot. I would have them taken outside and executed in front of their families.’ On Thursday the Prime Minister, whose . ‘Chipping Norton Set’ of friends includes Mr Clarkson, former News of . the World and Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and PR man Matthew Freud, was . forced to disassociate himself from the comments. Asked about them on ITV’s This Morning show, Mr Cameron said it was ‘a silly thing to say – I’m sure he didn’t mean it’. Labour leader Mr Miliband said the . remark was ‘absolutely disgraceful and disgusting’, adding: ‘He . obviously does not understand the lives of the people who were going out . on strike yesterday.’ Jeremy Clarkson's remarks about wanting to shoot strikers are the latest in a long line of controversial comments that are likely to add to his ever-increasing list of enemies. In February 2009, he famously called then prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. More recently, in October, it emerged he had taken out an injunction to prevent allegations about his private life being published. Back in September 2005, he had a custard pie thrown in his face by green campaigners after picking up an honorary degree at Oxford Brookes University. Also that year, he offered some 'handy hints' to cyclists, saying: 'Do not cruise through red lights. Because if I'm coming the other way, I will run you down, for fun.' In November 2004, conservationists accused him of ruining virgin hillside during an off-road test of a Land Rover for the motoring programme. And in February 2004, the BBC paid £250 compensation to Churchill Parish Council in Somerset after Mr Clarkson drove a 4x4 Toyota pick-up truck into a 30-year-old horse chestnut tree to test the vehicle's strength. The unions exploded in fury, with . Unison calling on the BBC to sack the presenter and even contacting . lawyers to consider whether he could be reported to the police for . inciting violence. Dave Prentis, Unison’s general . secretary, said: ‘The One Show is broadcast at a time when children are . watching: they could have been scared and upset by his aggressive . statements. ‘While he is driving round in fast . cars for a living, public sector workers are busy holding our society . together: they save others’ lives on a daily basis, they care for the . sick, the vulnerable, the elderly. ‘They wipe bottoms, noses, they help . children to learn, and empty bins – they deserve all our thanks – . certainly not the unbelievable level of abuse he threw at them.’ The union’s health spokesman Karen Jennings went as far as describing the comments as ‘almost like Gaddafi’. Bob Crow, leader of the RMT union, . said Mr Clarkson was a ‘man who bleeds a fortune out of the . licence-payer for poncing around the world driving luxury cars’. ‘Clarkson’s incitement to violence, . and the refusal of David Cameron to roundly condemn it, is grossly . offensive to all public sector workers but even more so to our members . on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary who were on strike on Wednesday and who . risk their lives in trouble spots around the world servicing the Naval . fleet,’ he said. Bert Schouwenburg, of the GMB union, said: ‘Jeremy Clarkson’s vile and offensive comments are insensitive in the extreme. ‘GMB works with trade unions . representing employees on banana and pineapple plantations in Latin . America where activists have met exactly the fate that Mr Clarkson . describes.’ By 5pm on Thursday, the presenter had issued an apology. When Mr Clarkson was asked for his . reaction before flying out of the country, he said: ‘See what I actually . said and then judge. 'I didn’t for a moment intend these remarks to be . taken seriously – as I believe is clear if they’re seen in context. 'If . the BBC and I have caused any offence, I’m quite happy to apologise for . it alongside them.’ The BBC said: ‘The One Show is a live topical . programme which often reflects the day’s talking points. Usually we get . it right, but on this occasion we feel the item wasn’t perfectly judged. 'The BBC and Jeremy would like to apologise for any offence caused.’ Last night Tory MP Douglas Carswell called for a sense of perspective. ‘We shouldn’t rise to the bait on this,’ he said. ‘This is politicians causing mischief.’ Mr Clarkson’s comments have regularly landed him in hot water. Earlier this year, an item on Top Gear led to a complaint from the Mexican ambassador over ‘vulgar’ insults about Mexicans. Mr Clarkson also called the then prime minister . Gordon Brown a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ and triggered 2,000 complaints . when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.","Outspoken character criticises 'Johnny Suicide' for holding up commuters' journeys .

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 5:17 PM on 4th December 2011 . A snow shortage across Europe which put paid to World Cup alpine races last week is now threatening to ruin pre-Christmas skiing holidays for thousands of Britons. Pistes across France and Switzerland have been badly affected by the record-breaking shortages during a week where thousands of Britons are preparing for festive getaways. This time last year, pistes across France - where most UK Alpine sports enthusiasts go - were almost all open. Barren: The slopes of Val D'Isere, seen here in these staggering photographs, have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the Alps for 147 years . World Cup alpine races at Courchevel Alps ski resort are scheduled for later this month but could yet be cancelled due to lack of snow . But nine out of 12 resorts have currently yet to even start their season. These include ones which are particularly popular with the British, including the Grands-Montets at Chamonix, Meribel and Megeve. Les Deux Alpes, which has almost 100 runs open during the high season, currently has just a dozen open. Of the 36 resorts on the other side of France - in the Pyrenees - only two, Puigmal and Vallnord, is open. It is the same in Switzerland, where canons are working overtime to produce fake snow at Klosters, where only a handful of runs on two out of five mountains have opened. Last week the French resort of Val d'Isere was forced to abandon the event, due to take place on December 10 and 11, because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent. Snow go area: The Val D'Isere resort in France has had the World Cup alpine event taken away from it because it has no snow . Markus Unterfinger, a spokesman for the resort, which is popular with both Prince Charles and Chancellor George Osborne, said: 'It was the driest November here for 150 years, since records began.' Although snowfalls and lower temperatures are expected later this week, a spokesman for weather institute Meteo France said an 'exceptionally warm and extremely dry' November included temperatures 2.5C above normal. This has meant that December - traditionally a busy period on the slopes when many families try and use the holidays to ski and snowboard - could be a wipe out. Snow joke: Just nine out of 12 resorts in France have currently yet to even start their season. With government austerity measures biting in the UK, the French fear a lack of spare cash will combine with the poor weather to stop people travelling for last-minute breaks too. In the meantime, those who have already booked will be checking travel insurance policies to see if they are entitled to compensation because of the lack of snow. Most policies pay out nominal fee if . there is no snow, but only if every ski lift is shut down. Resorts are . known to keep one lift open at all times, no matter how poor the snow . cover, to stop this happening. Some 400,000 British people travel to France to ski every season, with 250,000 heading for Austria, and 150,000 to Italy. Only around 75,000 go to Switzerland, but these tend to be richer holidaymakers, making the market an extremely lucrative one. If . conditions stay as they are, then many of them are expected to switch . to skiing holidays in the USA, where conditions are currently far better . than in Europe. Despite . the gloom, a spokeswoman for the Ski Club of Great Britain, said: 'There . is a lack of snow cover lower down in the Alps but snow is forecast . over the coming weeks and this should dramatically improve conditions. Slopes which are normally thick with snow at this time of year are currently barren and brown due to the snow shortage .","Just nine out of 12 French ski resorts open ahead of festive season .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:16 PM on 4th December 2011 . Apology: Britain's Got Talent contestant Reece Davis-James wrote an apology for his actions but was still jailed . A Britain’s Got Talent dancer who reached the semi-final this year has been jailed for looting in the London riots, despite a judge commending him for a letter of apology. Reece Davis-James, 18, was part of the street dance crew Abyss on the hit ITV1 show. But just a few months after his on screen success, Reece was arrested on August 8 during rioting in Catford, south-east London, and has now been sentenced to 14 months in prison. He pleaded guilty at an earlier court hearing to burglary after admitting stealing a £150 stereo from an Argos store. District Judge Ian Baker said he was considering a suspended sentence because he was impressed by Reece's letter, which told him he was teaching dance for free to make amends for his behaviour. Reece, who lives in Catford with his unemployed mother, claimed he was 'a bystander that got caught up in the heat of the moment’ and promised it ‘would never happen again’. But on Friday he was sentenced by a different judge, Judge Robert Fraser, at Inner London Crown Court, who jailed him for 14 months. Reece's mother Fiona James, 36, who watched from the public gallery, shouted at the judge: ‘Thanks a lot’, before storming out in tears. Sobbing outside court, she said: ‘I feel so angry I want to smash up the court. 'Why can't they see the difference between a good person who made a mistake and a real criminal? ‘My boy isn't a criminal. I brought him up decent. Being locked up for a first-time offence isn't fair. ‘I'm scared for him, I don't want to leave him. I want to take my sleeping bag and stay outside the prison until he's released. I don't want him to be inside with all those real criminals.’ Speaking before his sentencing, Reece admitted he was terrified that he might be jailed. He said: ‘I feel stupid and really terrible about what I did. It has jeopardised my career and there's not a day that goes by that I don't regret what I did. Talent show contestant: Reece Davis-James, circled, as he appeared on TV's Britain's Got Talent with dance troupe Abyss . ‘I think in the back of my mind I was thinking everybody is doing it and I literally got sucked in. ‘I wanted to write the letter to the judge so he could see things from my point of view.' Reece said he didn't feel it was right to punish all rioters with prison sentences. He added: ‘I think the harsh . sentences that have been handed out are silly. To jail someone for 24 . months for a first offence just doesn't seem right. ‘I know I have to be punished for what I did, I just don't think it's necessary to send me to prison. ‘It makes much more sense to punish me by making me do community service - that way I can make a positive difference.' After his arrest Reece spent three days in a police cell. He said: ‘When I got out and told the . other members of Abyss they were obviously upset and really . disappointed in me and I have been suspended from the group. ‘It's been a bit of a knock for them . because they've lost quite a few shows because what I did has given them . a bad name. I do feel awful that I've messed everything up. Reece had been about to complete a . two-year course in contemporary, ballet and jazz dance at Lewisham . College, but dropped out after starring in Britain's Got Talent. In court on Friday, Reece's solicitor Manisha Knights pleaded with Judge Fraser to spare him jail. She said through teaching dance he . acted as a mentor to hundreds of children and young people, about 50 of . whom had asked her if they could attend court to support him. She said: ‘They wanted to be here to . say positive things about him, but I dissuaded them from attending . because they would have had to take time off school or college. ‘How can I persuade you, Your Honour, . to let him walk out of court today and continue doing the good work he . has done in the community for the past eight years of his life?' But Judge Fraser ignored her . pleadings and told Reece: ‘You took full advantage of the fact the shop . had been broken into and you went in and stole. 'Like for so many other people, it was an opportunity too good to be missed. ‘The total losses and damages . incurred in London were quite phenomenal and the reality is that you . have played your part in that overall damage. ‘There is strong mitigation in your . case and I entirely accept that. It is quite clear to me you are a . positive role model and have been for a number of years. ‘But by your actions you have . destroyed a very good reputation and the reality is that this was a very . serious matter and as a result there is no alternative to an immediate . custodial sentence.’ The dancer was praised by Simon Cowell during his run on the talent show for doing something ‘positive’ with his life. Cowell told him: 'I actually was very impressed with you. 'I like the fact that when you get an opportunity to change your lives, you made the most of it.' His street dance group were popular with viewers, but split the judges when Amanda Holden controversially said they failed to live up to the 2009 winning dance group, Diversity.","Semi-finalist took a £150 stereo in raid on store .

Glamour: Actresses Dani Thompson, left, and Lynsey Carratt at the Boxpark launch party . Speaking to CNN, he said: 'These containers have a strong symbolism for me.

'Now I think it's fitting that something so closely associated with global trade has ended up itself as a shop.' As well as being highly original and laying claim to be a world first, Mr Wade also believes Boxpark it is the most environmentally friendly shopping centre ever built. It took a year to complete and has a temporary lease of five years. 'The great thing is, if one of these shops doesn't feel it's getting the most out of this location, they can potentially move to another part of the country with a vacant bit of land,without having to close down or dismantle a thing,' Wade told CNN. Once the five-year lease is up, the plan is to return the land back to its owners in the same condition as it was before Boxpark was built. It is then hoped that the community can decide if it wants a more permanent retail space there.",Rapper Dizzee Rascal spotted at Boxpark buying trendy caps and jeans .
"ACPO traffic supremo calls for 'graduated' licences to curb motorway driving, reduce the number of passengers they can carry, and cut their insurance bills . By . Valerie Elliott . Last updated at 10:56 PM on 3rd December 2011 . Shake-up: Suzette Davenport . Newly qualified drivers would be barred from motorways and forbidden from driving at night under changes being demanded by the country’s most senior traffic police officer. Novices would also face limits on how many passengers they may carry, and would be forced to display the currently optional ‘P’ plate – which shows a driver has only recently passed the test. The changes are part of a ‘graduated’ licence scheme proposed by Deputy Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, which would effectively place new drivers on probation and subject them to extra rules for a period, after which they would receive a full licence free of the restrictions. Miss Davenport, who works for Northamptonshire Police, is in charge of roads policing at the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and is the first woman to be appointed to the position. While young drivers may object to the new rules, they will welcome the cheaper insurance experts say will result from the measures. The move would bring Britain into line with other countries and could save hundreds of lives. Miss Davenport, 48, who took up the ACPO post six weeks ago, says she experienced ‘the ruin and havoc’ road accidents cause while working as a traffic officer. Every day, an average of two people die and 16 others are injured in road crashes involving drivers under 25. One in four people killed or seriously maimed in crashes is a young driver or is a passenger driven by one. Miss Davenport told the Mail on Sunday: ‘At the moment, people learn to drive mainly in calm residential streets when it’s light. They don’t have much experience of driving on busy A-roads or in the dark. Safety drive: New drivers will be forced to display 'P' plates . 'Yet as soon as they get a licence they can drive on motorways at speed and carry as many passengers as they like. The vast majority are responsible but some – especially young people – take risks and drive too quickly. I am enthusiastic about graduated licences and I would like to put some constraints on new drivers.’ She is also calling for all drivers to be banned from drinking any alcohol at all and for drivers caught using mobiles, laptops or other electronic devices to be prosecuted. Miss Davenport has promised to raise the subject of graduated licences with Ministers at the Department for Transport next month. ‘The scheme needs further work on exactly how it would operate, but my view to Ministers is that this needs exploring,’ she said. Safety risk: According to Miss Davenport, some young drivers take risks and drive too quickly (Posed by model) But if the graduated licence is to be adopted, she will have to persuade Roads Minister Mike Penning to change his mind. The Tory MP has claimed restrictions for new drivers unfairly penalise those who rely on driving to get to work or college. Graduated licences already exist in Australia, New Zealand and parts of the US. Cardiff University researchers estimate a graduated driving licence for 17 to 19-year-olds in  Britain could cut road deaths by 200 a year and serious injuries by 1,700. The high number of accidents that involve newly qualified drivers has pushed up insurance costs for those aged 17 to 24. Premiums are up to £6,000 a year, often more than the value of a vehicle. The high cost can tempt the young to drive uninsured. The Motor Insurers’ Bureau estimates there are 400,000 drivers aged under 30 on Britain’s roads. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) believes the graduated licence could result in cheaper premiums. A spokesman said: ‘If young drivers had controls on their behaviour after the test, we believe that safety would improve, accidents come down, and premiums follow.’ At present, when someone passes their driving test they can choose to display a ‘P’ (Probationer) sign on their car to alert other motorists to the fact they are an inexperienced driver, but there is no compulsion. Miss Davenport wants serious consideration given to a mandatory ‘P’ scheme. She also believes that new drivers should take extra  lessons in motorway driving. She notched up six penalty points ten years ago when she was twice caught by speed cameras exceeding the 30 mph limit. Miss Davenport is a keen cyclist, and frequently pulls over drivers who fail to give consideration to cyclists. But she also has a reputation for stopping cyclists who are not wearing helmets, have poor lights or are dressed inappropriately.","ACPO traffic supremo calls for 'graduated' licences to curb motorway driving, reduce the number of passengers they can carry, and cut their insurance bills ."
"By . Christopher Leake . Last updated at 12:45 AM on 4th December 2011 . Prison officers are being put up in luxury four-star hotels – costing taxpayers ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ – after being drafted in from hundreds of miles away to man a jail housing thugs who took part in the summer riots. About 15 warders a week are travelling from as far away as the North East and the Midlands to boost staffing levels at the £110 million HMP Isis in South London. Since the riots in August, the jail – which houses male inmates aged 18 to 24 – has been forced to accommodate an extra 160 prisoners, but cannot recruit enough staff to handle the influx. About 15 warders a week are travelling from as far away as the North East and the Midlands to boost staffing levels at HMP Isis, pictured, in South London . During the week the extra staff live in nearby hotels before going  home at weekends. Accommodation includes the four-star Marriott Hotel in Bexleyheath, Kent, where guests can use the hotel’s gym, pool, steam room, spa bath and solarium, and enjoy a £22.50 sirloin steak in the restaurant. Since the riots in August, the jail has been forced to accommodate an extra 160 prisoners . The out-of-town warders are paid 40p per mile if they use their car, a daily £26 allowance and £17-an-hour overtime if they work longer than a 39-hour week. Prison sources say the bill has run into tens of thousands of pounds since the warders on ‘detached duty’ began transfers three months ago. The officers come from jails in Worcestershire, Durham, Cleveland, Northumberland and West Yorkshire. The Prison Service said the money to employ them had come mainly from the budget for the salaries of vacant posts at HMP Isis. But a senior source described the arrangement as ‘economic madness’. The . source said: ‘They are having to pay out a fortune in these difficult . times because they cannot pay newly recruited officers enough money to . join the service. This is a badly planned panic measure and a waste of . taxpayers’ money.’ Newly trained prison officers are paid a basic starting salary of £15,000 a year while experienced colleagues earn an average of £29,000. The move comes 48 hours after the Ministry of Justice said that the prison population in England and Wales had reached a record 88,179 – close to the maximum capacity of 89,000. Accommodation includes the four-star Marriott Hotel in Bexleyheath, Kent, pictured, where guests can use the hotel's gym, pool, spa bath and solarium . This has raised fears that prisoners will have to be kept in cells for long periods each day as the Ministry tries to slash £2 billion from its £9 billion annual budget. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: ‘HMP Isis opened in April 2010 and is currently recruiting for some posts. ‘Surplus experienced staff from other prisons have been filling some of the new posts on an interim basis, funding for which comes mainly from the salaries of the vacant posts. Travel costs incurred are paid in accordance with Prison Service policy.’",15 warders a week travelling from as far as North East and Midlands to boost staff numbers at a London prison .

Police have bought 10,000 sweets to hand out to students to remind them to be quiet when they come home from a night out. Officers will hand the rock sweets, which bear the messages ‘Quiet Please’ and ‘Shush’, to drinkers in Durham. These will be reserved for busy nights in the city and handed out when officers feel revellers need a reminder to keep the noise down as they make their way home. The idea follows complaints about rowdy students in residential areas. Launched as part of the ongoing Safe City campaign, funding for the initiative came from a number of organisations including Durham County Council, the city's PubWatch scheme, Durham University and Teikyo University of Japan in Durham. Inspector Paul Anderson of Durham Police said: ‘The idea of handing out sweets or lollipops at the end of the night has been done in other areas, but we think Durham is the first to include a message aimed at those who might otherwise make a racket. ‘Late-night noise is a genuine issue for a number of our residents and we hope that this initiative will make a difference.

"Damien Fowkes, 36, made weapon by melting razor blade into plastic cutlery . Sentenced to a minimum of 20 years for attempted murder of Huntley and strangling child killer Colin Hatch in a cell . Fowkes already serving life sentence for armed robbery . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 3:13 PM on 5th October 2011 . Lethal: Damien Fowkes tried to kill Soham murdererl Ian Huntley in Frankland Prison, Co Durham by slashing his throat with a makeshift knife . The prisoner who tried to kill Soham murderer Ian Huntley by slicing his throat with a makeshift knife was jailed for life today. Damien Fowkes, 36, was ordered to serve a . minimum of 20 years after he attacked Huntley with a weapon he made by melting a razor blade onto plastic cutlery, leaving the killer with a seven-inch gaping hole in his neck. Fowkes, who is already serving a life sentence for a series of violent armed robberies, admitted at Hull Crown Court yesterday that he tried to kill Huntley at Frankland Prison, Co Durham in March last year. He also admitted to the manslaughter of child killer Colin Hatch at Full Sutton Prison in February. Fowkes spent weeks plotting the murder of 37-year-old Huntley and Hatch, 38, claiming he wanted to be 'notorious'. Huntley was given a double life sentence, with a minimum term of 40 years, for the murder of schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells in 2002. He had been working as a cleaner at the prison when the attack took place. Fowkes waited until Huntley had finished his shift before slitting his throat with the makeshift 'shank'. The . court heard that Huntley ran from his attacker, hiding in a room while . he was stalked through the medical wing. Fowkes managed to evade three . prison officers before he was stopped. Huntley, originally from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, sustained a large wound across his neck which required 21 stitches. Frenzy: Damien Fowkes (left) strangled Colin Hatch and . attempted to cut the throat of Ian Huntley (right) after saying he . 'hated' child killers . Following the attack, Fowkes said: 'I hope I have killed him. I have been planning it for weeks. 'I slit Huntley's throat for the crimes he has committed.' Fowkes also went after child killer Colin Hatch, taking him hostage and strangled him inside a cell at the maximum-security Full Sutton prison, near York. Hatch was serving life for the sex murder of seven-year-old Sean Williams in 1993. Pinned in a cell: Colin Hatch, pictured in 1994, was strangled to death at Full Sutton Prison in February . He . told prison officers he 'hated' sex offenders and said: 'He doesn't . deserve to live. 'They just do my head in. It was the same when I did . Huntley.' The 36-year-old has been described as . a psychopath with a personality disorder in three psychiatric reports. He pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Hatch on the grounds of . diminished responsibility and the attempted murder of Huntley. Known as 'Dib-Dob' to friends, Fowkes is . currently serving a life sentence with a minimum 12-year tariff for a . catalogue of violent knifepoint robberies in Northampton, which left his . victims terrified. He was high on crack cocaine and £4,000 in debt to a drug dealer when he went on a violent spree with a 12-inch knife. Head . of the Complex Casework Unit for the Crown Prosecution Service, Peter . Mann said: 'There was clearly sufficient evidence to prove Fowkes had . killed Colin Hatch and attempted to kill Ian Huntley. 'However, . after carefully considering psychiatric reports, it was clear that, at . the time of killing Mr Hatch, Fowkes was suffering from an abnormality . of mind.' Speaking in court today, Mr Justice Coulson expressed concern about the attacks within high-security prisons, especially in the light of a further death of a prisoner at Frankland in recent days. He said: 'It is troubling that these two attacks were carried out in two different high-security prisons. 'I am particularly concerned that the killing of Hatch took place with prison officers outside the cell but apparently powerless to save him. The judge said that the 'notoriety' of the two victims had no bearing on the sentence. A judge has called for an urgent review of systems at high-security prisons. Mr Justice Coulson made his comments after sentencing Damien Fowkes, 36, to life in prison for the attempted murder of Soham killer Ian Huntley and the manslaughter of child killer Colin Hatch. Today, the judge expressed his concerns following the death of another prisoner at Frankland in Co Durham. Child rapist Mitchell Harrison, 23, was killed at the weekend. He said: 'It is troubling that these two attacks were carried out in two different high-security prisons. 'While everyone is acutely aware of the costs of monitoring vulnerable and high-risk prisoners, from what I have seen in this case it appears that the management systems currently in place require urgent review.' The judge heard yesterday that it was Huntley's 'good fortune' that the 7-inch wound Fowkes inflicted with a razor melted on to a piece of plastic cutlery missed vital parts of his body. He added: 'Whilst I am aware that the view has been expressed in some parts of the press that the killing of Colin Hatch and the attempted murder of Ian Huntley were somehow lesser offences - deserving lesser sentences - because of the crimes that they had themselves committed, such a view is manifestly wrong, both as a matter of common sense and as a matter of law. 'For the avoidance of doubt, can I stress that that would be so whether the Human Rights Act were in force or not.' The court has already heard that sending Fowkes to a secure mental hospital was not an option, partly because of . the danger he would pose to others. During . the trial, Fowkes spoke for the first time about his time in jail, . claiming he has managed to give up drugs and had turned to Islam. In the email, signed Damien P Fowkes, HMP Wakefield, he wrote: 'I have been totally drug-free for over three years. 'It . is still possible to get drugs in prison but ''at a price'', and that . price varies from dealer to dealer, from prison to prison, whether it be . money or ''favour owed''. 'There is not now and never has been any rehabilitation for drug users compatible with those on the outside. 'A . majority of prisoners either continue using whatever drugs they can . get, or go ''cold-turkey'' without any support, which is what I had to . do.' Fowkes also revealed he has been studying Islam for the past five years. Hunted: HM Frankland Prison in Co Durham where Ian Huntley had his throat slashed by Damien Fowkes . He said: 'On my last appearance at court, I was not wearing a ''white beanie hat'', I was wearing a Muslim prayer cap, given to me by the Imam at Wakefield prison. 'I have been studying Islam for the past five years.' As he left court, Fowkes shouted 'Allahu Akbar' - 'God is greatest'. He also denied claims that he had threatened a mother and child at knifepoint during a robbery in Northampton in 2002, which eventually saw him locked up. Fowkes maintained he was trying to rob the house of a known drug-dealer who was in bed at the time with his partner. Fowkes, who now faces spending the rest of his life in jail, also revealed details of his day-to-day life in one of the most secure prisons in the country. He said: 'I have now been in different high category prisons for over nine years and contrary to popular belief, it is not a ''cushy life''. 'I have spent most of that time locked in a single cell for 23 hours a day, without the ''luxury'' of Sky TV, and unless I was lucky enough to obtain a job, I was let out for one hour of recreation a day, which usually consisted of the gym or 'association', which takes place outside only when the weather is fine. 'For some periods I didn't even have access to a toilet, and had to rely on the officers having the time, and the inclination, to escort me. 'As for ''three square meals'', we get fed on a regular basis, whether the food is edible or not is a matter of opinion, and there is no choice for religious or ethnic prisoners. 'Most prisoners buy their own food from the prison canteen and unless you work or have regular money sent in, the allowance doesn't go that far. 'Phone calls and stamps are not free, nor is tobacco or soap.' He also claimed: 'There are no qualified psychiatrists or psychologists inside the prison. There are no qualified counsellors and no qualified mental health staff. 'All the professionals come from outside and because of the high numbers of ''patients'', a prisoner is lucky to get a 20-minute session a week to talk to someone.'","Damien Fowkes, 36, made weapon by melting razor blade into plastic cutlery .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 5:27 PM on 1st December 2011 . The drive to find £20 billion of efficiency savings in the NHS is threatening patient care as medical staff struggle to cope with frontline cuts, it was claimed today. Retired obstetrician Lord Patel told ministers there is now a shortfall of 4,500 to 5,000 midwives in the United Kingdom with half of the workforce aged between 45 and 55. In a Lords debate on nursing, he said: 'Recruitment of a younger workforce is . extremely important. Future of care? Half of midwives are now aged between 45 and 55 . 'There is a need to address the issue of . a midwife shortage if we are going to deliver quality care to mothers . and their children.' Labour's Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe added that cuts in nursing staff could have 'disastrous consequences' for patient care. She said: 'Frontline nursing care is being severely threatened by the £20 billion efficiency savings target set for the NHS.' Analysis by the Royal College of Nursing suggested that across 41 NHS trusts in England, registered nurses and health care assistants accounted for 34 per cent of posts 'earmarked to be cut'. Lady Warwick said: 'Despite Government promises that there would be no cuts to frontline NHS care, clinical services and staffing levels are being severely affected.' Pre-registration nursing places for new entrants were also being cut, she said. 'These cuts to existing posts and new entrants will have potentially disastrous consequences for patient care. 'We must have sufficient nurses and they must be properly equipped and supported to provide skilled care.' Independent crossbencher Baroness Masham of Ilton, a former regional health authority member, said patient care was being compromised. 'We must have sufficient nurses and they must be properly equipped and supported to provide skilled care.' Lady Warwick . 'When nurses retire they are not being replaced,' she said. Anecdotal evidence suggested the district nursing service was being 'stretched to the point of providing a bare minimum service in many areas.' Lady Masham also warned that a 'culture of indifference' to patients seemed to have crept into the nursing profession. She blamed a 'lack of leadership' and called for the return of the 'old type matron' to ensure hospital wards were better run. Lady Warwick said she was 'horrified' by recent stories of neglect of patients but insisted that claims of graduate nurses being 'too posh to wash' those in their care did not stand up. Rejecting the suggestion that graduate nurses thought it 'beneath them to clean-up for the vulnerable and sick in their care', she said studies suggested they spent longer hours in clinical areas than their non-graduate counterparts. 'There isn't and shouldn't be a distinction between... professional academic head and caring heart,' she added. Labour spokesman Lord MacKenzie of Culkein, a former nurse, warned the Government's policies may have put 'a match to a slow-burning fuse'. He said: 'Morale has been hit from a number of areas: the growing public perception that nurses are not capable of compassionate care, the two-year pay freeze and the pension issue, the down-grading of posts, the actual and forecast staffing reductions coming from the Royal College of Nursing and Unison.' Responding to the debate, Health minister Earl Howe, said he emphatically rejected the 'inflated' figures produced by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) which were 'based on an analysis of just 41 trusts'. 'The trusts mentioned in the report have actually disputed the RCN's figures,' he said. 'The RCN haven't offered commentary on the fact that some of these plans are about moving services out into the community to provide better care for people when and where they need it. 'We're not disputing that some trusts have reduced their number of staff - some have - although many of these are support staff and often it has been done through natural turnover.' He said it was up to local trusts to determine their staffing needs and any reduction in clinical posts 'must not have an adverse impact on the quality and safety of patient care'. Lord Howe told Lord Patel that the Government was not reducing the number of midwife training places, with a record high of 2,507 available this year. 'The Government is committed to ensuring we have the right number of trained midwives, especially given the increased number and complexity of births in recent years,' he said.","Nurses and health care assistants make up 34 per cent of posts earmarked to be cut, finds RCN study .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 2:23 PM on 30th November 2011 . A six-month-old girl dices with death every nap time - because of a rare condition that means she stops breathing every time she falls asleep. Jovie Wyse has to spend 21 hours a day on a special ventilator to keep her alive in case she nods off. She had a tracheotomy just two months after she was born in May in a bid to save her life - and now she has finally been allowed to go home for the first time. Jovie will need to rely on a ventilator (pictured) when she sleeps for the rest of her life . Jovie was diagnosed with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) - also known as Ondine's curse - meaning her body doesn't breathe automatically when she is asleep. Her parents, Chris and Lorna Wyse, both 26, from Worcester, have to make sure their daughter is never too far away from her ventilator - as a sudden snooze could prove fatal for her. The . condition is named after the myth of a water nymph, Ondine, who had an unfaithful . mortal lover called Palemon who swore to her that his 'every waking breath would be a . testimony of his love'. Upon witnessing his adultery, she cursed that if . he should fall asleep, he would forget to breathe. The term is considered outdated for children with CCHS, who actually lack an arousal response to low oxygen levels and high CO2 levels in the blood when asleep. Around 300 children worldwide and 30 people in the UK have the life-long condition. The oldest CCHS patients today are in their 30s and 40s - CCHS young adults are in college, in the workplace, and some are having their own families. Mr Wyse, a sales executive, said: 'We were terrified when doctors eventually discovered what was wrong with our little girl. 'She had been born a few weeks premature, and we thought she was just late in developing her breathing. 'But it quickly became apparent there was something much more seriously wrong. 'It's . difficult to play with her and act like a normal family, because we're . always terrified she'll suddenly get sleepy and her breathing will go. 'Most parents probably love to see their little ones nod off in the middle of the day - but for us, it's frightening. 'Her ventilator is her lifeline, and we can't go anywhere without it. 'When she was eventually diagnosed, it almost felt like a relief to know what was actually wrong with her. 'But . then the full realisation of what that meant for our daughter - living . on a ventilator for most of her life - really hit us, and it was . heartbreaking.' Doctors at . Birmingham Children's Hospital carried on months of tests on Jovie when . she was born - even believing at one point she may have meningitis. But it was only after one surgeon who had seen a similar case in another baby that Jovie was tested for CCHS. Six-month-old Jovie was diagnosed with congenital . central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) - also known as Ondine's curse - . meaning her body doesn't breathe automatically when she is asleep . The condition is so rare that there are only about 300 cases diagnosed worldwide.  She underwent a tracheotomy, and was kept on a ventilator 24 hours a day, as her parents watched her battle to breathe. Eventually, she was allowed off the ventilator for short periods during the day - and is now considered well enough to be treated at home. However, she will still have to spend most of her life with access to some form of ventilation, possibly limited to a mask at bedtime when she is older and stronger. Jovie's condition is so dangerous that she will still have to be monitored constantly - including by a healthcare professional who will stay with her at home throughout the night, to ensure her breathing stays stable. Parents Chris and Lorna Wyse with their daughter. She is not attached to the breathing apparatus for three hours a day . Mr Wyse added: 'Lorna and I have both had intensive training of how to monitor Jovie, and what to do if the ventilator or her tracheotomy fails - we have to be prepared for something like that to happen. 'Her breathing equipment needs cleaning every day, and we aren't allowed to leave her to anyone's care who hasn't been medically trained to look after her - so we can't leave her with friends or relatives. 'But it was an amazing feeling to finally bring her home. She smiled and laughed when we put her down to bed - it was wonderful. 'We're hopeful that as Jovie grows bigger and stronger, she won't need to be on a ventilator all the time. 'At the very least, she will always have to wear a ventilation mask when sleeping - but we're hoping she should be able to grow up to live a normal life. Lorna, a nursery nurse, added: 'We are so grateful for all the doctors and nurses at Birmingham Children's hospital - without them, Jovie might not be here today. 'We're planning a big homecoming party for Jovie, and we'll also be running a charity auction for Ronald McDonald House, who helped us enormously over the last 10 months. 'Local businesses have been very generous and we hope we'll be able to raise a lot of money for such a good cause.'",Six-month-old Jovie is closely monitored for the three hours she is taken off the breathing apparatus .
"By . Neil Sears . Last updated at 1:45 AM on 3rd December 2011 . Nosebleeds are fairly common and caused when the tiny blood vessels inside the nose are disturbed. However, Mr Ford died hours after suffering one (posed by model) It was only a simple nosebleed – but within hours, it had killed gardener Robert Ford. Mr Ford, 47, was walking round the shops when his nose started to bleed, and promptly walked into a medical centre for help. The bleeding soon stopped, and doctors just told him to go home and put ice on his nose. Hours later, however, Mr Ford was found by his father, dead in his house. Spots of blood dotted his home – and more had blocked his airways. A pathologist said it was the only fatal nosebleed he had seen in 4,000 post mortems. Mr Ford’s grieving father Michael said after an inquest into his death: ‘We’re not looking to blame anyone, we’re just mystified at our son’s death. ‘He was a much loved son, brother and uncle.’ The tragedy developed as Mr Ford was walking through the town centre of Gravesend in Kent with his friend John Churchill. When his sudden nosebleed failed to . stop, he went to the Gravesend Medical Centre, where doctors were . clearly satisfied it was a routine problem which was likely to sort . itself out. But after he went home, the bleeding clearly started again – and he suddenly realised blood was beginning to clog his throat. Mr Ford senior told an inquest in . Gravesend, held on Wednesday, that he had phoned his son in June last . year, only to be told by Richard to dial 999 because he was unable to . breathe. Mystery: Mr Ford visited the Gravesend Medical Centre, who told him to put ice on his nose . Mr Ford said: ‘We found him dead on . the floor with a small pool of blood around his mouth. There were also . 10p-sized spots of blood around the house. ‘We rang the ambulance and paramedics . who tried to revive him. He was a very well-known character in . Gravesend and it’s a big loss for his family and friends.’ Pathologist Olaf Biedrzycki told the . inquest he had never seen a case like it in the 4,000 post-mortem . examinations he had carried out. Blood had entered Mr Ford’s airways, causing him to die, but Mr Biedrzycki could not explain where the blood came from. He said: ‘This was certainly an odd . case. We don’t really know how to explain it. I’ve looked very hard for a . source of the blood and could not find it.’ Mr Biedrzycki apologised to Mr Ford’s parents and brother who attended the hearing, a local paper reports. He said: ‘It’s something of a mystery. I’m really sorry but I’m not entirely sure where this blood was coming from.’ Coroner Roger Hatch recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Ford senior said: ‘We’re not looking to blame anyone, we’re just mystified at our son’s death. ‘He was a much loved son, brother and uncle.’",Pathologist admits he is stumped as to how blood entered man's airways .
"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 3:37 PM on 2nd December 2011 . Traveller families who were living illegally on the Dale Farm site have been warned they will be charged £80,000 each to cover the cost of their eviction. Basildon Council will demand the families living on the 52 plots pay just over £4million between them. The families were removed from the six-acre site near Crays Hill, Essex, after a 10-year planning row. Dale Farm eviction day: Police use a cherry picker to talk to protesters. Each of the 52 families will be billed for £80,000 to cover the costs . A council source said it would be likely to seek ownership of the land as there is little chance of the traveller families producing the money. 'There is more chance of getting blood from a stone than the travellers handing over money for being thrown off their land,' he said. 'I think realistically, what we will see is the council will take ownership of the land and it will become a council asset. 'The final use of the site has not been decided but there has been talk of it becoming allotments.' Council leader Tony Ball said: 'Some travellers will pay more than others, as there were buildings which had to be removed, requiring more work to do.' The £4million cost was just half of the £8million bill expected if activists had dug their heels in and held out against the bailiffs for months in the 'Battle of Basildon'. A protester holds up a cross in front of a barricade during the eviction at the Dale Farm site in Crays Hill in October . Police use Tasers as they break through a barricade during evictions from Dale Farm . As it turned out, travellers who had pledged to 'fight to the death' walked away from the former scrapyard just two days after the eviction began in October. Essex Police has yet to finalise the costs of the eviction but it is anticipated they too will come in well under the budget of £10million. The Dale Farm site remains blocked off and any families moving back onto the land have been warned they could be arrested. Last month dozens of caravans returned to the site, sparking fears that the council could be left facing another long battle to remove them. But many of the families are now living on plots on the legal part of the Dale Farm site - just 200 yards from where they were evicted. Enforcement: Council workers arrive with injunction notices after the courts ruled the eviction could go ahead following a 10-year legal battle . Others in touring caravans are still parked up on the roadway leading to the site. Former Dale Farm resident Mary McCarthy, 42, a mother-of-three, said: 'People have nowhere to turn to. This is home for them, Basildon is home. Essex is home so that is why we are still here. 'It is getting cold now and people are starting to suffer and that is why the families did not want to return to a life on the road.

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12:30 PM on 29th November 2011 . Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK but a quarter of them are unaware that they have the disease, according to the Health Protection Agency. The latest figures show the number of sufferers has risen from 86,500 to 91,500 between 2009 and 2010. Of the 6,660 people newly diagnosed with . HIV in 2010, half came forward for testing after a time when treatment . should ideally have started. Nearly 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK. This electron micrograph shows how HIV (orange) invades healthy immune system cells . Early treatment boosts chances of living longer with the precursor to Aids. Of the 680 people with HIV who died in 2010, two thirds had been diagnosed late. Heterosexual men were the most likely to be diagnosed late, at 63 per cent compared with 39 per cent of gay men and 58 per cent of heterosexual women. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the body's immune system, which we need to fight disease and infection. The virus specifically attacks CD4 cells. Although the body will try to produce replacements, the number will eventually decline and the immune system will stop working. Once the person acquires a life-threatening condition, such as pneumonia, they are said to have the last stage of HIV - Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is spread through bodily fluids - most commonly during unprotected sex. There is no cure but since the 1990s treatments have been developed to slow down the spread of the disease. This allows people to live with the disease for a very long time. In 2009, the World Health Organisation estimated there were 33.4m people across the globe living with HIV/AIDS. In 2010, more than 3,000 gay men were diagnosed with HIV - the highest ever annual figure. One in 20 gay men are now infected with HIV nationally, rising to one in 11 in London. Today's data also suggests that a stigma is still attached to the condition, revealing that one in five people visiting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in 2010 did not accept an HIV test. The HPA is recommending that, in areas where prevalence of HIV is high, testing should be offered in places where it is not currently the norm. Testing should be offered to all people signing up with a GP and those admitted to hospital, but only with the patient's permission. Dr Valerie Delpech, consultant epidemiologist and head of HIV surveillance at the HPA, said: 'HIV is an infection which can nowadays be treated and those diagnosed promptly can expect to experience similar life expectancy as an individual without the infection. 'However, we are very concerned that a large number of people in the UK are unaware of their HIV status and are diagnosed late. 'We want to see increased access to HIV testing routinely offered in clinical settings such as new registrants at GPs and hospital general admissions, in areas of the country where rates of HIV infection are high. The cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is estimated to be around £18,000 per year when they are not showing any symptoms. This is based on the price of care as well as triple-drug antiretroviral therapy. However, it costs £21,500 to treat patients who are showing symptoms and £41,000 for those with full-blown AIDS. Patients who have four drugs cost the NHS between £22,775 and £48,000 per year. The annual cost of providing HIV treatment and care in the UK could be as high as £758m by 2013, according to a study in PLoS One. 'We are also urging sexual health . clinics to ensure that HIV testing is offered as part of a universal . sexual health screen at every new attendance.' Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The number of people who don't know they have HIV and are diagnosed late is a serious issue. 'Not only does it have a severe impact on health and reduce life expectancy, this largely accounts for the onward transmission of HIV as people aren't taking the necessary steps to avoid passing it on.' She added: 'People shouldn't be scared of HIV testing, but they should be scared of undiagnosed HIV. 'The advances in HIV treatment have been one of the biggest success stories in the 30 years since the virus first emerged, but too many people test too late and so fail to benefit from these drugs.' Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'HIV rates in the UK remain dangerously high and to bring them down we all have to take responsibility for our sexual health. 'We can't just rely on partners, or chance, to keep sex safe.' The HPA has previously predicted that by 2012 there will be 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK. The study comes just ahead of World Aids Day on December 1.","One in four people with HIV don't know they have the disease .

Hillary Clinton has revealed the U.S. has 'serious concerns' about how Russia's parliamentary elections were run - after European monitors revealed the vote was heavily stacked in favour of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's party. The U.S. Secretary of State launched the attack following reports the poll was marked 'by the convergence of the state and Putin's United Russia party' - and amid allegations of ballot box stuffing. She said, during an Afghanistan summit in Bonn, Germany, that her opinion mattered less than that of Russian voters, whom she said deserved the right to know their votes were fairly cast and counted. Concerns: Hillary Clinton said the U.S. was worried about the way the Russian election had been conducted . But she added: 'Russian voters deserve a full investigation of all credible reports of electoral fraud and manipulation and we hope in particular that then Russian authorities will take action on reports that come forward. 'The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. That means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.'

'To me, this election was like a game in which only some players are allowed to compete,' head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe Heidi Tagliavini said. United Russia is still expected to retain its majority in the lower house and Putin is all but certain to win next March's presidential election, but yesterday's vote has badly dented his carefully groomed image. Russia results . It reflected a strong public frustration with the lack of political competition, ubiquitous official corruption and the gap between rich and poor, which will pose a growing challenge to Putin's power. With about 96 per cent of precincts counted, United Russia was leading with 49.5 per cent of the vote, Central Election Commission chief Vladimir Churov said. He predicted that it will get 238 of the Duma's 450 seats, a sharp drop compared to the previous vote that landed the party a two-thirds majority in the State Duma, allowing it to change the constitution. Critics said that even that United Russia performance is strongly inflated, pointing at numerous reports of ballot-stuffing and other violations. The nation's only independent election . watchdog has been subjected to a massive official intimidation campaign . in the week before the vote and saw its website blocked by what it . described as a massive cyber attack it blamed on authorities. United . Russia has been seen increasingly as the party of corrupt officials, . and its description as a 'party of crooks and thieves' has stuck, . flashing up as the first suggestion on Russia's top web search engine. Putin . sought to stem a quick decline in United Russia's popularity by trying . to expand its support base with a so-called Popular Front, an umbrella . group for unions, professional associations, veteran groups and others. But . the effort has brought no visible result, and Putin last month received . a stinging blow to his own ego when he was met with catcalls after a . mixed martial arts fight at a Moscow arena. Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov said after the vote that Putin's 'honeymoon' with the nation was over. 'He needs to hold an honest . presidential election and allow opposition candidates to register for . the race, if he doesn't want to be booed from Kamchatka to Kaliningrad,' Nemtsov said on Ekho Moskvy radio. Seeing . the declining fortunes of his party, Putin named his handpicked . successor as president, Dmitry Medvedev, to lead United Russia's list. The . vote will further weaken positions of Medvedev, whom Putin promised to . name prime minister after the presidential vote, a move that has fuelled . public irritation.

Putting a positive spin on the . disappointing returns, Putin said late Sunday that 'we can ensure the . stable development of the country with this result.' But he appeared glum when speaking to supporters at United Russia headquarters and limited his remarks to a terse statement. The . Communist Party appeared to benefit most from the protest vote, with . exit polls and the early returns predicting it would get nearly 20 per . cent, up from less than 12 per cent four years ago. The socialist Just Russia and the . Liberal Democratic Party led by mercurial nationalist Vladimir . Zhirinovsky are also expected to increase their representation in the . Duma.

Prime minister Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his staff and supporters among the United Russia ruling party's campaigners . Just 20 years ago, they seemed consigned to the dustbin of history - but Russia's communists are enjoying a new found resurgence. Students, intellectuals, and even some businessmen voted for the Community Party (CPRF) in a bid to wound Vladimir Putin's United Russia. The party, which to some may still evoke memories of elderly poor left behind a New Russia of glitzy indulgence, doubled its vote to about 20 per cent. For many Russians disillusioned by rampant corruption and a widening gap between rich and poor, the communists represented the only credible opposition. Through all the turmoil of the early 1990s when the Soviet Union collapsed, the party kept a strong national organisation based on regions and workplace. With access to official media limited for the opposition, it has had a huge advantage. 'The Communists are the only real party out there,' said one Western banker in Moscow. 'United Russia is a joke, Just Russia is a joke and the LDPR is a joke and many people know it. So they vote communist because they realize it is a real vote for the opposition and against United Russia. This is as ironic as you get.' Perceptions among some Russians that the nationalist LDPR party and Just Russia are in the Kremlin's pocket and will vote with United Russia in parliament also helped the communists. Despite that, Putin should still have no problem getting his laws rubber-stamped. Even . the Communists have posed only token opposition in the outgoing Duma, . and the two other parties have consistently voted with United Russia. About 60 per cent of Russia's 110 million registered voters cast ballots, down from 64 percent four years ago. Only . seven parties were allowed to field candidates for parliament this . year, while the most vocal opposition groups were barred. Several parties complained Sunday of extensive election violations aimed at boosting United Russia's results. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov . said his party monitors thwarted an attempt to stuff a ballot box at a . Moscow polling station where they found 300 ballots already in the box . before the start of the vote and pointed at numerous other incidents of . ballot-stuffing. Russia's . only independent election monitoring group, Golos, which is funded by . U.S. and European grants, has come under heavy official pressure in the . past week after Putin accused Western governments of trying to influence . the election and likened recipients of Western aid to Judas. Golos . website was incapacitated by hackers on Sunday, but it was still able . to field more than 2,000 observers, and they reported numerous . violations, director Liliya Shibanova said. She . said many of the violations involved absentee ballots, including . so-called 'cruise' or 'carousel' voting where people with the ballots . are bussed to multiple polling stations. Many people complained that they were forced to get absentee ballots and hand them over to their bosses. Social . media were flooded with messages reporting violations. Many people . reported seeing buses deliver groups of people to polling stations, with . some of the buses carrying young men who looked like football fans.

A woman who put a voodoo curse on her former boyfriend before battering him to death and dumping his body in a lake was jailed for a minimum of 52 years today. Joanne Griffiths, 41, along with her new lover Peter Hood, 43, killed the father of her child, Jason Bissell, 39, after luring him to Stretton Under Fosse, near Rugby, Warwickshire, with the promise of seeing his daughter. But after a brief visit, as Griffith carried the baby back to her car, Hood crept up . behind Mr Bissell and struck him ten times with a hammer. Behind bars: Joanne Griffiths (left) and Peter Hood (right) murdered Jason Bissell after he demanded regular access to his daughter . After the brutal attack the couple bound Mr Bissell's head and face with duct tape before dumping him in a fishing lagoon. Today Griffiths, 41, was ordered to serve . at least 28 years for murder while Hood, 43, was also jailed for life . and ordered to serve 24 years - reduced from 30 after he gave evidence . against Griffiths. During a six-week trial at Birmingham . Crown Court, the jury heard Griffiths had a six-month-old daughter with . Mr Bissell after a brief affair. It was after Mr Bissell demanded to see his daughter Griffiths, who had reconciled with boyfriend Hood, hatched a plot to scare her former lover. The couple launched a bizarre hate campaign against Mr Bissell in the months before his death, putting a witch's spell on him which Hood bought off eBay. Killed: Jason Bissell was brutally murdered after asking for access to his daughter . Griffiths also signed up to a website called getrevengeonyourex.com which sent Mr Bissell threatening texts messages and faxes. The site also offered to put him under a so-called 'voodoo curse'. When their hate campaign failed to deter Mr Bissell, Griffiths and Hood decided to murder him at the remote fishing lake. On the evening of October 17 last year, Griffiths invited Mr Bissell to Lanny's Lagoon at Stretton-under-Fosse. Scene: Griffiths and Hood bludgeoned Bissell with a hammer at this lake, known as Lanny's Lagoon, before duct-taping his body and dumping it in the water . The court heard Griffiths, a hospital . secretary from Binley, Coventry, had been in a relationship with . reporting analyst Hood for 15 months before breaking up with him in . 2009. She had a brief fling with Mr Bissell . and fell pregnant but got back with Hood, from Nuneaton, months later . and they planned to bring the baby up as their own . In an email sent from Griffiths to Hood months before the murder, she told . him: 'You will never know how many times I wished it [the father of her child] was you. 'I would have been happy. Between you and me, I wish I'd never told him [I was pregnant.].' Sentencing them, Mr Justice Globe QC . told them: 'There was a wicked motivation involved in the execution of . the crime. The murder was done for gain.' After last month's verdict Mr Bissell's family paid tribute to their 'bright and loving dad, son, brother and friend.' They said: 'Jason was a bright and loving dad, son, brother and friend. His life was taken in an unbelievable way for trying to do what he knew was right. 'The actions of these people have ruined the lives of so many others and they will have that on their conscience forever.'","Joanne Griffiths, 41, lured Jason Bissell, the father of her daughter, to a fishing lake with the promise of access to his child .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:27 PM on 5th December 2011 . Jailed: Shaun Oates, a City trader who lost his employer £4.8m in a series of reckless gambles, has been handed a five-year sentence . A City trader, who came to the UK to 'seek his fortune' but ended up losing his company £4.8m in a series of reckless gambles has been jailed for five years. Shaun Oates, 31, of New Addington, Surrey, left . TRX Futures with the massive black hole in its accounts after blowing . the cash on speculative deals in the futures, options and foreign . exchange markets. The firm had to cut salaries and lay off two employees in an attempt to balance its books, while Oates pocketed £775,000 for himself. Oates broke company rules by setting up a trading account for his own front company, Cynthen Capital, and then faking records to show it had deposited $5m, the Old Bailey heard. Oates also deleted successful trades from real clients' records, before diverting the profits and buying two houses with £775,000 of ill-gotten gains. Warning Oates that he faces deportation to his native South Africa, Judge Peter Thornton QC said he had engaged in a 'deliberate course of dishonest conduct over nearly two years.' He said: 'It was designed to make money for yourself, which in due course it did - although at the expense of others. 'It goes without saying that fraud of this kind affects public confidence in the City.' The court heard that the con artist, who began working for TRX in 2006, came unstuck when bosses finally noticed the huge losses and called in the police in last November. As the firm's project and risk manager, his job was to minimise the company's exposure to financial uncertainty. Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Oates continued to deny any wrongdoing in meetings with company managers and refused to answer any questions in a police interview after his arrest. After the fraud was uncovered, the firm lost £4.86m, some 30 per cent of its capital. Peter Hunter, defending, said the con failed after the markets 'became turbulent' in late 2008. He said: 'Every time he did a trade and lost, instead of stopping he tried to double his trade to recoup the loss - he tried to trade his way out. Court: Judge Peter Thornton QC warned Oates that he faces deportation to his native South Africa, during the hearing at the Old Bailey today . 'Eventually, the losses became awful and he had no choice but to approach his employers. 'He has asked me to apologise to the court and to all concerned. He is thoroughly ashamed.' Oates first moved to the UK in 2004 after graduating with a degree in accounting and economics from Stellenbosch University, near Cape Town. Mr Hunter said: 'He came to this country, in fact, to seek his fortune. 'Whilst here, his mother came into difficulties with finances, and his brother became addicted to drugs, so he was under pressure to find money. 'The original desire was to help them. 'Every asset he had has been taken, and everything from his bank account to the house he lived in has been repossessed and taken back. 'There was no extravagant lifestyle, he wasn't driving a flash car. 'The profit to this man is nothing.' Oates admitted two counts of fraud by abuse of position.","Oates pocketed £775,000 for himself .

Stopped: Police found Dominique Strauss-Kahn, pictured here with wife Anne Sinclair, trying to 'clean-up' a Paris park notorious for transvestite prostitutes, France's Interior Minister said . Dominique Strauss-Kahn was stopped by police who were trying to 'clean up' a Paris park notorious for transvestite prostitutes, France's Interior Minister said yesterday. Claude Gueant said the former International Monetary Fund chief was spoken to by officers patrolling the Bois du Boulogne. The incident was recorded in a police log five years ago, before being publicly announced by Mr Gueant in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. Asked about the matter, he said: 'Yes, I've heard of this story. 'But there was no action taken over this matter. He wasn't framed by the police. 'He was not being followed. After all, it's not the police's fault if he was there that night.' Mr Strauss-Kahn, who claims there is a conspiracy aimed at stopping him becoming the next president of France, admitted that he had been stopped by police in the park, which is near his home. But he said he was with his wife, the former TV presenter Anne Sinclair. His lawyer Richard Malka said: 'It was nothing more than a routine check', and added that during 15 years living near the park, the couple had been 'stopped several times'. Last week, 62-year-old Mr Strauss-Kahn claimed that his 'uninhibited' sex life cost him his chance to become president. He denied paying prostitutes but admitted attending 'sex parties'. He is at the centre of a judicial inquiry into a vice-girl ring operating out of a hotel in Lille, northern France. But he said: 'I have a horror of prostitution and pimping.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening is considering whether a £500 million tunnel should be bored to minimise impact on the landscape . Ministers are considering drilling a tunnel costing up to £500million under the Chilterns as senior Tories rebel against the new high speed rail link. Transport Secretary Justine Greening will confirm this week that she is delaying the decision over the HS2 route between London and Birmingham until the New Year. The 1.5-mile tunnel would be in the constituency of Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan. She is deeply opposed to the rail link and has indicated she may quit the Cabinet if the route ploughs through her Chesham and Amersham constituency. Other senior Tories opposed to the proposed route include Europe minister David Lidington and Government whip Jeremy Wright. Speaker John Bercow is also reported to oppose it. The 100-mile rail link, which would be built between 2016 and 2026, aims to cut the London to Birmingham journey time to 49 minutes from the current typical time of 1 hr 23 min.

It would join up two other tunnels around Amersham, reducing the impact . on the Chilterns, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty. The Campaign to Protect  Rural England said additional tunnelling would . be ‘essential’  if HS2 is to be built through the Chilterns.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:45 AM on 3rd December 2011 . Britain's ambassador to Iran last night revealed how seven of his staff were seized by protesters during the terrifying attack on UK compounds in Tehran. Dominick Chilcott said some workers and their relatives were sent to the embassy’s residential complex in the north of the city before the protests for their safety, but ended up being taken by demonstrators who surged through security. He spoke out as the last Iranian diplomats left the UK following a decision to close their London base in response to the attacks. Attack: Hundreds of students break into the British Embassy on Tuesday - despite the presence of riot police . On Wednesday Foreign Secretary William Hague gave Iran 48 hours to remove all staff from UK soil in response to the ‘outrageous and indefensible’ incident. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that, earlier this afternoon, all diplomatic staff of the Iranian Embassy in London took off from Heathrow airport.’ Last night Mr Chilcott told how one of his staff at the Tehran residential complex barricaded himself in a panic room for 45 minutes before he was overcome and held with six colleagues. He said staff were in a worse predicament than those in the main embassy as they had gone there thinking it was a ‘place of safety’, so when the attack happened it was ‘more of a surprise’. Protesters break into the British Embassy and tear down the Union Jack. Some then proceeded to ransack offices . Students from some universities and seminaries burned British flags as they clashed with police, while others held flags proclaiming their hatred of Britain . Mr Chilcott added: ‘They did what they had to do, which was go into the safe areas and locked themselves in. ‘One . of our staff was on his own and he barricaded the door with a heavy . safe and a bed and braced himself against the wall. And for 45 minutes . he could hear people bashing down the door, smashing the windows and . trying to get in because they knew he was there. ‘It must have been a very frightening experience – until eventually the door gave way and they got him. ‘It must have been a troubling experience. They were quite roughly handled.’ The staff were later released. Protests: Students set fire to British and Israeli flags after breaking into the British Embassy. Tehran has denied any responsibility - although William Hague has accused officials of being complicit . Breaking in: Dozens of protesters enter the gate of the embassy, throwing rocks, petrol bombs and burning documents looted from offices . Asked if it had occurred to him that he might suffer the same fate as 52 Americans held hostage for 444 days by hardline students at the U.S. Embassy in Iran from 1979, Chilcott said: ‘It would be untrue to say that those thoughts don’t go through your mind, of course, and you hope that that is not going to happen.’ Mr Chilcott, who was appointed to the role in October, added: ‘Iran is not the sort of country where spontaneously a demonstration congregates then attacks a foreign embassy. That sort of activity is only done with the support of the state.’ The last Iranian diplomats left the UK yesterday as David Cameron, the Prime Minister, again condemned the 'appalling' attack on the UK's Tehran embassy that sparked their expulsion. The London embassy of the Islamic republic was being emptied by removal men as a 2pm deadline for staff to leave the country approached. As removal workers loaded luggage on to vehicles outside the embassy , a group of 20 protesters shouted anti-regime slogans such as 'terrorists, terrorists; must go, must go'. Leaving: Removal workers empty the Iranian embassy in London after diplomats were given until 2pm yesterday to get out of Britain . Get out: Diplomats had until yesterday afternoon to leave the Iranian Embassy and get out of Britain . Many were members of the London Green . Movement, which opposes Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and . campaigns on the country's human rights issues. Following . Tuesday's attack on the British embassy, the Foreign Secretary had . announced that all Iranian diplomats had 48 hours to close the embassy . and vacate British soil. He also ordered the evacuation of around 24 British embassy staff from the Iranian capital. The . incident, described by Mr Hague as 'outrageous and indefensible', came . after Britain's decision to impose further sanctions on Iran over its . nuclear programme.

'It was an . opportunity to discuss the appalling events in Tehran and for me to . thank President Sarkozy for the help the French gave to our staff and . our embassy,' Mr Cameron said. At . talks with fellow EU foreign ministers in Brussels yesterday, Mr Hague . welcomed what he described as 'a great deal of solidarity' from other EU . capitals over the incident, with many countries withdrawing their . ambassadors from Iran in protest. But . he said another round of sanctions designed to further isolate the . regime was a separate issue already on the EU agenda and was not . prompted by the disorder. A policeman stands outside the embassy in Kensington, West London . The . new sanctions include adding 180 individuals and Iranian businesses . associated with the Iran regime to a list of those banned from travel in . Europe and whose European assets are frozen.

'There . will be further measures against Iran unless Iran changes its behaviour . and the course of its (nuclear) policies,' he added. Mr . Hague said the UK was pleased with the outcome, but it was not the end . of the issue - further measures to be discussed next month would be . designed to 'severely affect the Iranian financial system and the energy . and transport sectors'.

It appeared to be business as usual for Jeremy Clarkson today after he was spotted sharing a joke with fellow Top Gear presenter James May in China. Despite the apparent banter, Clarkson, 51, showed signs of strain as he shot the new series of Top Gear in Beijing. The controversial host - already under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families' last week - hit the headlines again over the weekend amid growing concerns about his 'vulnerable state of mind' and the precarious state of his 18-year marriage. He also provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'. Something funny? It seemed to be business as usual for Jeremy Clarkson, left, as he shared a joke with fellow Top Gear presenter James May, right, during filming in China . One senior . BBC insider, who asked not to be named, said Clarkson . wasn’t in ‘the best possible place at the moment’ in his personal life. He added: ‘There is a feeling that . he’s in a more vulnerable state than he should be and that’s why his . judgment isn’t A-grade at the moment.’ But there is some good news for Clarkson - despite sparking fury with his outburst, his DVD sales have soared, according to HMV. The DVD titled Powered Up, which sees Clarkson and the Stig in the south of France while searching for his 'favourite car of the year', is set to become a Christmas favourite. An HMV spokesperson told the Guardian: 'We've found in the past that controversy involving artists, with all the media coverage this generates, can boost sales of their products.' Industry experts have suggested that the incident would boost sales up as much as 50 per cent across online and high street sales.

Clarkson, who is reportedly paid £1million a year by the BBC, used his weekly column in The Sun newspaper to expand on comments he had made about suicide, which were aired during the same edition of The One Show last Wednesday. At the . time these were overshadowed by his joke about the strikers, which has so . far attracted 31,000 complaints to the BBC. But in his newspaper column Clarkson wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains. Three of the country’s leading mental health charities said they would complain to the Press Complaints Commission about the remarks, which they said intruded on private grief and breached PCC guidelines which restrict what newspapers can report about suicides for fear of encouraging copycat incidents. The One Show immediately issued an on-air apology for the star’s remarks about suicide but did not address his comments about strikers. Further outcry: However the presenter caused yet more outrage after writing about suicide in his newspaper column on Saturday . It was widely assumed that Clarkson had also apologised for the remarks. But he denied having done so in his column on Saturday. Corporation bosses had hoped the apologies would draw a line under the storm but Clarkson’s decision to return to the subject of what he called ‘Johnny Suicides’ in his newspaper column has only plunged him deeper into controversy. Paul Farmer, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ‘Jeremy Clarkson’s article in The Sun is extraordinarily tasteless and shows an utter lack of understanding of the tragedy of any suicide. ‘Many people who have contemplated suicide seriously or lost loved ones will be shocked by his insensitive tone and needless graphic detail.’ Under the heading ‘Think of the poor driver before your leap in front of Ivor’, Clarkson said he had every sympathy with those who felt the need to take their own lives. Controversial: Jeremy Clarkson makes his headline-hitting comment on BBC's The One Show . But he went on to argue that suicide . victims who ‘hurled’ themselves in front of trains were selfish and . disruptive because they inconvenienced other members of the public. He . wrote: ‘It is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes . is immense. And think of what it’s like for the poor train driver who . sees you lying on the line and can do absolutely nothing to avoid a . collision.’ Clarkson then bemoans the fact that trains which are involved in a collision with a person must stop until the full aftermath of the incident has been dealt with and all remains have been recovered from the vicinity. He wrote: ‘The train cannot be moved nor the line re-opened until all of the victim’s body has been recovered. Marriage problems: Clarkson with his second wife, Frances . ‘This is the part I don’t understand. It’s not like the poor soul is going to get any better. ‘Change . the driver, pick up the big bits of what’s left of the victim, get the . train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble . away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find.’ Clarkson advises potential suicide victims to kill themselves quietly and privately. Clarkson's first wife: Alex Hall married him in 1989 but the couple separated a year later . Catherine Johnstone, the chief . executive of the Samaritans, which is campaigning to reduce the number . of suicides on the railway network, said the comments in the column went . beyond what he had said about suicide on The One Show and were far . worse than anything he had ever said about striking  public sector . workers. She said: ‘His . notion that suicide is a selfish act shows how little he knows about . the subject because, if he did, he would know that when a person . attempts suicide they are so distressed that they genuinely believe . their families will be better off without them. 'The fact that he has . chosen to add fuel to the flames of the comments he made on The One Show . again beggars belief. ‘It’s one thing to joke about people on strike, it’s in an entirely different realm of poor taste to joke about  suicide.’ Clarkson’s column also sparked an avalanche of complaints on Twitter and other social networking sites. One fan tweeted: ‘Please stop. Shooting the strikers is one thing, but this is pretty indefensible. Beware sarcasm in print.’ Another added: ‘Really shocked by the  “train suicide” comments. Used  to like Jeremy Clarkson. Not so much now.’ But there were some signs of  support . on Twitter and elsewhere. Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain,  of Maidenhead . Synagogue, said: ‘I am totally sympathetic to the black depression that . overtakes  those who commit suicide, and  certainly want to prevent any . future ones, but Clarkson has done us a favour by saying out aloud that . while people have the right to end their lives, they should not do so in . a way that scars others.’ The BBC declined to comment on Clarkson’s column in The Sun. A . BBC spokesman was unable to comment on anything relating to the . presenter’s private life and was unable to reach Clarkson because he was . in China.","£1m-a-year Top Gear star spotted sharing joke with James May in Beijing .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 5:05 PM on 6th December 2011 . Around 200 bears were killed on the first day of a controversial black bear hunt that animal rights groups had done all they could to block. New Jersey state officials have said the six-day hunt is needed to reduce the state's bruin population, now estimated at about 3,400. But critics say the state’s bear management policy is flawed and is illogical, while animal advocates went to court in an attempt to block the hunt. Scroll down for video . Dead: New Jersey state officials have said the six-day hunt is needed to reduce the state's bruin population, now estimated at about 3,400 . They were rebuffed last week by an appeals court and spent part of Monday gaining permission to protest at various bear check stations. The group wanted to protest at the Franklin bear check station in Sussex County, which they said was the most visible spot for their message. But wildlife officials wanted to keep them away from there over safety concerns, noting its limited space and location on a major highway. A state Superior Court ruled up to 25 people could protest there and gave demonstrators the right to have larger protests at two other weigh stations. Shooting: Around 6,500 hunters have been given permits for this year's hunt, allowing them to patrol 1,000 sq miles of northern New Jersey . One protester was arrested at the Franklin site for refusing to move from a restricted area. Officials said the hunt's first day went smoothly. The hunt comes with rules on weapons, ammunition and transportation. Officials weigh the bears and take skin, blood and tooth samples. About 150 bears had been processed by late afternoon, with 200 in total expected by nightfall, the environmental officials said. Around 6,500 hunters have been given permits for this year's hunt, allowing them to patrol 1,000 sq miles of northern New Jersey. Protests: Critics say the state's bear management policy is flawed and is illogical, while animal advocates went to court to try to block the hunt . Officials say this area has one of the highest population densities of black bears in the U.S. But critics are not happy with the hunt taking place. 'A bear hunt doesn't protect property, a bear hunt doesn't protect public safety and the bear hunt will not reduce the population' Angie Metler . ‘A bear hunt doesn't solve nuisance complaints,’ Bear Education and Resource Group spokesman Angie Metler told Fox News. ‘A bear hunt doesn't protect property, a bear hunt doesn't protect public safety and the bear hunt will not reduce the population.’ Susan Kehoe, another protester, said there is ‘no need for the hunt’ and said it’s all about a ‘trophy hunt’ rather than safety. Taken away: The hunt comes with heavy rules on weapons, ammunition and transportation. Officials weigh the bears and take skin, blood and tooth samples . But state officials say there has been a rise in ‘public complaints about bear and human encounters’ and so the population must be reduced. 'I don't think you want to come home and find a black bear in your kitchen when you are ready to make dinner' Larry Rudolph . Dr Larry Rudolph, of Safari Club International, said that bears can ‘definitely be a danger in New Jersey this year’. ‘New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection cited almost 3,000 instances where there was human-bear interface,’ he told Fox News. Forty-six of those involved bears going into a residential home, he said. ‘I don't think you want to come home and find a black bear in your kitchen when you are ready to make dinner,' Dr Rudolph added.

Towering over the skyline of the Taiwanese city of Taichung, this superstructure could become one of the most surreal buildings on the entire planet. Huge 1,000ft high beams of steel stretch into the sky creating a giant triangular frame which will house the world's highest roof garden for visitors to enjoy. As tall as the Eiffel Tower, the Taiwan Tower is the brain child of Tokyo based architect Sou Fujimoto, who won an international competition to design the building. The Taiwan Tower: This steel superstructure is to be built in the city of Taichung following a competition that was won by Tokyo based architect Sou Fujimoto . Imposing: The triangular shaped structure will be around 1000ft in height, which is around the same height as Paris's Eiffel Towel . Labyrinth: Hundreds of steel beams stretch into the sky but allow a natural light in to create a semi-outdoor space, while the tower will be surrounded by parks for visitors to use . Landmark: The Mayor of Taichung has said the tower will act like a sun for the city, with the city's districts as planets . Fujimoto claims the building is his 'oasis', which he says is trying to embody the 21st century spirit of the East Asian island. The tower project is composed of two main parts, that of the steel frame and the roof garden. The design is inspired by the Taiwanese Banyan tree. A labyrinth of beams is designed to create a semi-outdoor space, while the garden above seemingly floats in the sky. The garden is said to be a continuation of the vegetation from the country. The building is also being touted for . its environmental credentials, which Fujimoto says he hopes is a model . for green architecture of future generations. It . will use renewable energy systems to power it, while also having . rainwater harvesting facilities and solar panels to create hot water. Stunning views: The roof garden, described as a 21st century oasis that floats in the sky, will house vegetation from the nation . Big budget: The building is expected to cost around 6.59bn Taiwanese dollars and is due for completion in 2017 . The structure itself will be composed of numerous beams of 800mm in diameter. A completion date in 2017 has been set for the project, which has a total budget of 6.59bn Taiwanese dollars. Speaking about the project Taichung Mayor Jason Hu told the Taiwan News website the building will be 'a spot bright enough for the whole world to see.' At a press conference Mr Hu made reference to the solar system, claiming the Taiwan Tower will be like the sun, with Taichung's many districts acting as planets. Hu added that the tower will also bring a large amount of revenue to the city.","Design won international architecture competition .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:16 PM on 6th December 2011 . Patricia Dunn, the former Hewlett-Packard chairwoman who authorised a boardroom surveillance probe that ultimately sullied her remarkable rise from investment bank typist to the corporate upper class, has died after a long bout with cancer. Ms Dunn, 58, died on Sunday at her home in Orinda, California, surrounded by her family. Her sister Debbie Lammers said Ms Dunn's ovarian cancer had returned. Once one of the most powerful women in corporate America, Ms Dunn saw her career tarnished in 2006 when she was ousted from HP and brought up on criminal charges - which were ultimately dropped - for approving the company's plan to snoop into the private phone records of board members, journalists and HP employees to catch people leaking to the media. Scandal: Former Hewlett-Packard Chairwoman Patricia Dunn attends a hearing at Santa Clara County Superior Court in October 2006 . The scandal unfolded as Ms Dunn continued to battle a disease that had haunted her through a sparkling investment banking career and a stormy nine-year stretch on the board of HP, one of the world's largest technology companies. She had spent time on philanthropic matters in the years since the scandal, Ms Lammers said. She said she wanted people to remember her sister's 'incredibly influential rise in her professional life and her courage and valiant battles over the course of her treatments'. Ms Dunn's time at HP coincided with some of the most contentious and challenging periods since the Palo Alto-based company was founded in 1939. She joined HP's board in 1998 and was instrumental in the hiring and firing of chief executive Carly Fiorina, whose flamboyant personality and ferocity in securing the 19 billion-dollar purchase of Compaq Computer Corporation ultimately helped hasten her departure amid a sagging stock price and disappointing results from the combined company. Ms Dunn was the one who announced Ms Fiorina's sacking in February 2005 and named her low-key successor, Mark Hurd, previously CEO of NCR. Mr Hurd himself was ousted last year after an investigation into a sexual harassment claim found inconsistencies in expenses reports filed. Ousted: Patricia Dunn, left, with Mark Hurd, former president of HP who was suspended from the company last year following inconsistencies in expenses reports filed . Ms Dunn also assumed Ms Fiorina's role as chairwoman at the time. But she was forced out of that role in September 2006 in an embarrassing scandal involving spying on the telephone records of board members and journalists to ferret out the source of leaks to the media. Just a month later, California's attorney general charged Ms Dunn and four others with four counts each of conspiracy, fraud, identity theft and illegally using computer data. That came just two days before she started chemotherapy treatments for advanced ovarian cancer. The criminal charges against Ms Dunn were eventually dropped, as prosecutors said she had little involvement in the actual 'pretexting' - the ruse used by investigators to view private telephone records by pretending to be someone else - and because of her ailing health. Charges against the other defendants were also dropped, with a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge calling their . conduct 'a betrayal of trust and honour' at worst that was not criminal . behaviour at the time it occurred. Once . an aspiring investigative reporter, Ms Dunn, a graduate of the . University of California, Berkeley, found more immediate and lucrative . work in the financial world and made her mark in investment banking. After . working briefly as a part-time reporter for a community newspaper in . San Francisco, she began her corporate climb by capitalising on a . temporary typist job that she landed at an investment firm in the 1970s. Public address: Patricia Dunn speaks, after being inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Bay Area Council, during a dinner in San Francisco . She was able to turn the two-week typing assignment into full-time work and managed to quickly rise through the ranks by earning a reputation as a hard-edged businesswoman. That reputation eventually helped her earn the promotion to CEO of fund management behemoth Barclays Global Investors in 1995. But Ms Dunn's life had been far from charmed. Financial difficulties dogged her family throughout her childhood and her father, a vaudeville actor, died of a heart attack before she was a teenager. After his death the family moved to Marin County, north of San Francisco, and her mother's emotional health deteriorated. She later died of breast cancer. It was at the height of Ms Dunn's corporate success when she was diagnosed with cancer herself, forcing her to step down in 2002 from her role as Barclays CEO to fight breast cancer and melanoma. Two years later she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and in autumn 2006 she underwent surgery for a metastasised tumour - three weeks before the public learned of the HP investigation that spawned congressional investigations, criminal probes and forced Ms Dunn's resignation. Ms Dunn is survived by her husband Bill Jahnke; three adult children, Janai Brengman, Michelle Cox and Michael Jahnke; 10 grandchildren; a brother, Paul Dunn, and sister Ms Lammers.","Career tarnished in 2006 following criminal charges over allegedly approving HP's plan to .

Dozens of volunteers are today searching for a missing two-year-old girl while police probe her father’s claim she was taken during a carjacking. Bianca Jones, 2, of Detroit, Michigan, has been missing since Friday when D'Andre Lane claims she was in his car’s rear seat and taken in a robbery. But police are questioning the 32-year-old’s story, searched his home and were holding him on an outstanding warrant from an unrelated case. Where is she? Bianca Jones, 2, of Detroit, has been missing since D'Andre Lane claims she was in his car's rear seat and taken in a robbery on Friday . Makibla Gideon, 39, is on the search team and was stepping among discarded tyres, piles of soggy clothing and nail-pierced wood boards. She said: 'You have to put all that aside when it comes to a precious little girl. If it was my son or me missing I would want somebody looking for me.’ She looked for a purple toddler's jacket or pink shirt, barely avoiding oily pools of filthy rain water in alleys not far from the alleged carjacking. Many who canvassed the area in 30F temperatures that gave way to snow returned to Metropolitan United Methodist Church and vowed to try again. Father: Police were questioning D'Andre Lane's story, searched his home and were holding him on an outstanding warrant from an unrelated case . Lane was being held in nearby Oakland County on an outstanding warrant from an unrelated case, but was later released on Monday. 'You have to put all that aside when it comes to a precious little girl. If it was my son or me missing I would want somebody looking for me' Makibla Gideon . Investigators were questioning his story and searched his home yesterday. No suspects have been identified in relation to the alleged carjacking. Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee said the search for Bianca is of the ‘highest priority’ in relation to ‘dedicated resources’ on the case. ‘The Detroit Police Department will not comment on the quantity nor the quality of any evidence or information we have gathered to date,’ he said. Bring her home: The girl's mother Banika Jones said she last saw her daughter on November 26, when family and friends celebrated her birthday . ‘However… the authenticity and credibility of the original version of events is under intense scrutiny by our investigative team.’ 'Mr Lane has fully cooperated and will continue to cooperate with police agencies to assure the safe return of his daughter' Terry Johnson . Lane's lawyer described his client as a ‘loving father’ and said he has been straightforward with police and will be so in the future. Terry Johnson said Lane ‘has fully cooperated and will continue to cooperate with police agencies to assure the safe return of his daughter’. The girl's mother Banika Jones said she last saw her daughter on November 26, when family and friends celebrated her birthday. Carjacked: The silver car driven by Bianca's father that was allegedly held up . Ms Jones said Lane had taken Bianca to see a movie, brought her back to her mother's house for the party and then the girl left with her father. 'We love her and we want her home. Bianca, Mommy has lots and lots of gingerbread men for you when you get home' Banika Jones . ‘We love her and we want her home,’ Ms Jones said. ‘Bianca, Mommy has lots and lots of gingerbread men for you when you get home.’ Lane was jailed for more than three years on drug and firearm possession charges stemming from a 2003 arrest and was paroled in 2007. He served a more than four-year probation starting in 1996 after being convicted of assault with intent to commit armed robbery and conspiracy. Aged two: Banika Jones said Lane has a good relationship with Bianca, who is described as 2'5"" and weighing about 25lbs, with brown eyes and black hair . A pre-sentencing report from 2007 shows Lane, a father of three other children from three other relationships, wanted to shield his incarceration. 'He has unfettered access to her; welcome to come anytime. He's never been anything but loving and committed to her' Banika Jones . Lane did not want his children to come to see him in prison because he did not think it was a place for them to visit, a probation officer wrote. Ms Jones said Lane has a good relationship with Bianca, who is described as 2’5” and weighing about 25lbs, with brown eyes and black hair. ‘He has unfettered access to her; welcome to come anytime,’ she said. ‘He's never been anything but loving and committed to her. Questions: D'Andre Lane's lawyer said he 'has fully cooperated and will continue to cooperate with police agencies to assure the safe return of his daughter' ‘I know he probably wants to see Bianca home as much as I do. I have no information on the investigation. My focus is on finding Bianca. 'They were never officially in a relationship. There was no problem and now Bianca's gone. Let's just find her' Kelly Jones . ‘That is what I'm driven to do right now is bring my daughter home. I just want to see Bianca again. We are going to bring Bianca home.’ Lane has been close to the Jones family for years, said Ms Jones sister Kelly Jones. ‘They were never officially in a relationship,’ she said of Lane and Banika. ‘There was no problem and now Bianca's gone. Let's just find her.’ Investigation: No suspects have been identified in relation to the alleged carjacking but this is a sketch of a subject wanted for the incident last Friday . Locating a child that some fear is somewhere shivering in the cold is what prompted Michelle Carter to join the search on Monday. 'We went through the alleys. We searched porches, under debris, moved bags and went through trash. We called Bianca's name' Michelle Carter . ‘We went through the alleys,' she said. 'We searched porches, under debris, moved bags and went through trash. We called Bianca's name.’ The 39-year-old nail salon owner refused to think the worst and admitted to having no idea what Bianca's mother may be feeling. ‘I don't want to imagine. No,’ Ms Carter said. ‘Being a mother and not even knowing where your child is - I know is devastating.’","Bianca Jones, 2, has been missing since last Friday .

Cleamon ‘Big Evil’ Johnson committed or ordered a total of 20 murders in the 1980s and 1990s, according to police, including the 1991 deaths of two men slaughtered at a Los Angeles Car wash. But his death penalty conviction was tossed out by the California Supreme Court on Monday because of a technical error. The high court unanimously found that a juror in the case had pre-judged the1997 murder case based on his opinion of one of the witnesses. Free on a technicality: Cleamon 'Big Evil' Johnson's murder conviction was overturned by the California Supreme Court . Juror 11, who remains unidentified, didn’t believe the testimony of witness Carl Connor, according to other jurors. Mr Connor said he saw the murders at the South Los Angeles car wash, but records show he was clocked in at work. Associate Justice Carole A Corrigan explained to NBC Los Angeles: ‘Conner explained that he and a co-worker, “Jose,” often clocked in for each other, so the records would indicate they were at work when in fact they were not.’ Juror 11 was doubtful of the explanation, saying he didn’t think Hispanic people were likely to lie at work. 'Because the record does not show to a . demonstrable reality that Juror No 11 was unable to discharge his duty, . the (trial) court abused its discretion by removing him.' -California Supreme Court . The juror denied making up his mind before deliberations began, and the Supreme Court said it appeared he was a responsible juror. The court wrote: 'Because the record . does not show to a demonstrable reality that Juror No 11 was unable to . discharge his duty, the (trial) court abused its discretion by removing . him.' Los Angeles Superior Court Judge . Charles Horan had ruled in December 1997 that both Johnson, 44, and . co-defendant Michael 'Fat Rat' Allen, 39, should face the death penalty. He had called execution the ‘only appropriate sentence in this case.' Cleamon ‘Big Evil’ Johnson led the 89 Family Bloods during the 1980s and early 1990s. Authorities allege the 80 members of Johnson's gang were responsible for more than 60 slayings on their turf, which stretched for a quarter of a square mile in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles. Johnson was convicted in 1997, along with Allen, of murdering two rival gang members six years earlier. Prosecutors allege that Johnson ordered Allen to kill the rivals with an Uzi. Rarity: The high court unanimously decided to toss out the murder conviction because they believe a juror was improperly dismissed from the 1997 trial . The victims were killed because they lived on a street dividing territory between the Crips and the Bloods. The rivals were killed at a South-Central car wash before dozens of witnesses, but no one would admit to witnessing the shooting. A task force with the help of federal officials finally got witnesses to come forward and put Johnson behind bars. It is a rarity for the California court to do a double-reversal of the death penalty. The immediate fates of Johnson and Allen are unknown. A spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris told NBC Los Angeles that it was up to Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley to decide whether to re-try the two men.","Cleamon 'Big Evil' Johnson and Michael 'Fat Rat' Allen murder charges overturned in rare high court move .

Her daughter, of Stafford, Virginia, is upset by the emails with subjects such as ’male enhancement’, ‘work at home’ and ‘cheap Viagra’. Scroll down for video . Extremely upset: Cassie Woods says her mother Paula Chase's Yahoo email account was hacked in September and is sending out spam messages . ‘I don't think it's fair that me and my sisters have to suffer seeing an email from my mum that's not even here,’ Mrs Woods told WTSP. ‘I was kind of hysterical,’ she told the Free Lance-Star. ‘I fell on the floor crying.’ Everyone in Ms Chase’s address book is getting the emails. Ms Chase died in October 2009 aged 46 from the auto-immune disorder ‘scleroderma’ - but the emails began around two years later.

Harry Patterson was killed when the parked car began rolling backwards after the hand brake failed, and trapped him against the side of the family's house. His mother Michelle, 38, had left the car in neutral when she had parked in her driveway but could only look on in horror as the silver Seat pinned her son to the wall after the brake discs slipped while they were cooling. Harry Patterson (right) with his older brother Dylan, who screamed for help as he watched his sibling being crushed . A coroner yesterday warned other drivers of the dangers of failing to leave their cars in gear on hills and slopes. An inquest heard Mrs Patterson had just brought Harry and brother Dylan, eight, home when the accident happened. She said: 'I parked the car on the drive and put the handbrake on firmly. I was in the habit of shaking the car to make sure it was secure. 'Dylan and I got out of the car but Harry stayed inside. I told him, ""Jump out Harry, I’m going to put the dinner on"". Michelle had decided to make faggots - a large type of meatball - especially for Harry. because he told her they were 'blinking beautiful'. But the inquest heard those were his final words. His mother said: 'I went into the house and that’s when I heard Dylan shouting, ""Mummy the car’s rolling down the drive"". 'The first thing I thought was what damage is this going to cause; then I thought, ""Where’s Harry?"".' Happier times: Harry's father Christian and mother Michelle who saw her son pinned against the wall . The car rolled down the driveway of the Patterson's home (pictured) after the brakes failed and crushed Harry against a wall . Drama teacher Michelle rushed out to see the car trapped her son against the side of the house in the village of Alltwen, near Swansea, South Wales. She said: 'He was on the driver's side of the car standing up with the car pushing him against the wall. 'I couldn’t pull him out, I tried to get in the car but I didn’t have keys. I ran and got them and went back the car. 'Harry had fallen to the floor, the car had gone back into my little boy. 'I lifted his head and I could feel it had been crushed inwards. There were horrific amounts of blood. Dylan was screaming, ""My brother is dead"".' Harry was taken by helicopter to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, where he was pronounced dead. The family’s silver Seat Altea was taken away for examination by police accident investigators who found it had no defects. But Philip Painting, of the South Wales Police collision investigating unit, said: 'A lot of people don’t realise that when a car is parked on a steep drive such as this one it needs to be left in gear. 'This is because when the vehicle is parked when the rear brakes are still hot as they cool down it can cause the disk brakes to slip. 'I don’t think the hand brake could be released by either of those boys. 'It is my opinion that as the brakes slipped it rolled down the hill and hit Harry.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, Cardiff coroner Mary Hassel said: 'Harry was out playing around the car as little children do. 'It seems the car crept backwards as the discs were cooling. It was an appalling accident. 'Lots of people aren’t aware that this can happen and it is something which needs to be better publicised.' Speaking after the inquest, Harry’s father Christian said: 'I was not aware of parking in first gear, and its a very high price to pay to find that out. 'We have set up a fund in Harry’s name and the first thing we will be doing is trying to make people aware so they will hopefully learn without having to suffer what we have. 'It was 13 weeks ago to the day that Harry died and we are just lost without him and that will always be the case.'","Michelle Patterson parked in the drive but the brakes failed as they cooled .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 9:27 PM on 5th December 2011 . Fight continues: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has been granted leave to pursue his appeal at the High Court . Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has been granted permission to continue his legal battle to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex crimes allegations. However, Assange was warned by judges today that his chances of beating extradition are slim and he could still be extradited within 10 days. At a hearing at London's High Court, senior judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said Assange would be allowed to apply to Britain's Supreme Court to argue that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed. The Wikileaks' chief now has 14 days to submit a written request for a hearing at the country's highest court, Gareth Peirce, a lawyer for Assange, said outside court. The decision means Assange won't face immediate deportation, and is likely to spend a second Christmas living under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England. Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors - like the Swedish prosecutor seeking to bring Assange back to the country for questioning - are not a proper judicial authority, and shouldn't have the right to order extraditions. Judges said Assange's lawyers had raised a legal question of 'general public importance,' which is necessary to win an audience at the Supreme Court. But Thomas added that the appeal's 'chances of success may be extraordinarily slim.' Assange, who listened attentively and scribbled notes throughout the hearing, was cheered by a small group of supporters - including several demonstrators from the nearby Occupy London encampment - as he left the court. 'I am thankful': Assange said decision was the correct one and that his long struggle for justice will continues . Still in the dark: Assange is free to appeal but his chances are extremely slim and he still has no idea if he will face extradition . 'The High Court has decided that an issue that arises from my own case is of general public importance and may be of assistance in other cases and should be heard at the Supreme Court,' said Assange, speaking on the steps of the courthouse after the hearing. 'I think this is the right decision and I am thankful. The long struggle for justice for me and for others continues.' Assange, 40, leads the foundering Wikileaks anti-secrecy movement, which has been hit with a series of legal and financial setbacks. He was accused of rape, coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and sexual assault accusations, and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010. Assange was released on bail on the condition that he lives under curfew and wears an electronic tag. In February, Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Assange can be extradited to Sweden to face questions about the allegations, rejecting his claims that he would not receive a fair trial there. Still a free man: Assange (second from left) leaves the Royal Courts of Justice in London today . Masked faces: Members of the hacker group Anonymous and supporters of the Occupy protest mingled with Wikileaks activists outside the court . Assange appealed against the decision. He also insists that the sexual encounters were entirely consensual, and legal in the context of English law. Judges said on Monday that they believed Assange would have faced charges if the incidents had taken place in Britain. Per E. Samuelsson, Assange's Swedish lawyer, hailed the court's decision to allow him to continue his legal fight. 'This is positive news for Julian Assange and means he will remain in the U.K. while the court assesses his appeal,' said Samuelsson. 'It is something we have fought for.' Backing: Some of Assange's supporters were outside the courthouse to greet him . Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer representing the two women bringing sex crime charges against Assange, called the decision regrettable. 'My clients have waited for over a year for a legal conclusion of this and now they will have to wait even longer,' Borgstrom said. 'Then it will still end with Assange being transferred to Sweden. The rules are very clear about this.' 'I regret he himself doesn't choose to hand himself over. 'Now they have to wait for another few months. We are hardened by now, but of course this is still stressful.' Peirce said a panel of three Supreme Court judges will review Assange's appeal for a hearing at the court. If accepted, it could be several more months before his fate is decided conclusively. However, if the judges reject the plea for a hearing, Assange could be sent to Sweden within 10 days, she said. The High Court judges appealed to their colleagues at the Supreme Court to resolve the case as speedily as possible. 'We would, for obvious reasons, ask that the point is decided as quickly as possible,' Thomas told the hearing. Outside the court, masked members of the hacker group Anonymous and supporters of the Occupy protest - some of whom wore the cartoon-style masks that have become synonymous with the demonstration, mingled with Wikileaks activists. One banner draped over railings outside the court read 'Free Assange. Free Manning,' referring to U.S. Army analyst Bradley Manning who is in custody at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas, suspected of disclosing secret intelligence to Wikileaks.",Wikileaks founder could still be sent to Sweden in 10 days over sex crime allegations .

A council has spent almost £21,000 on leaflets asking taxpayers for ideas on how it can save money. Sheffield Council will send out 230,000 forms asking for ways on how to cut £57m from the 2012-13 budget. Leader of the Labour-run council, Julie Dore, said each leaflet had cost 9p to produce, which was 'value for money'. Council leader Julie Door said the leaflets, which are being sent to 230,000 residents, were value for money . Among other things, residents will be asked whether they feel grass could be cut less frequently. Opposition Liberal Democrat councillors called it a 'glorified PR stunt' and said the money should have gone towards protecting vital services. The council said the leaflets had cost a total of £21,000 to produce and post. Ms Dore said the letters are needed to allow members of the public to put forward their views. She said: 'This is [the public's] . opportunity to respond and participate in what is a very, very difficult . budget-setting process. 'They wouldn't get a chance to understand what dire circumstances we're in with these cuts and what it means to Sheffield.'

The . leaflet explains to members of the public that the council has a £1.5bn . annual budget and gives examples of some of the big costs involved. Maintenance of the city's parks cost . about £7m a year, while libraries, museums, galleries and leisure . centres altogether cost £33m a year. 'It's all those other things that we need to know what's important to people,' said Ms Dore. '[For . example], is it important to cut the grass in parks on a weekly basis . or would it be acceptable to cut them fortnightly, so we can keep . libraries open more than we would?

Shaffaq Mohammed, leader of the opposition Lib Dem group, said the money should have been saved by the council. 'Instead of wasting thousands on this glorified PR stunt, the leader of the council should be using this money to protect vital front line services such as street cleaning or road repairs,' he said. Mr Mohammed added that the consultation should have been carried out three or four months earlier because some decisions about next year's budget must have already been made. 'We are now almost at the door of the final closure of the budget process as far as I'm concerned,' said Mr Mohammed. 'If Julie Dore was really concerned about consultation [she] should have started this much earlier... Where are the options? What are the details? Where are you going to cut? There's no detail.' People are being given until 6 January to comment.

"Last updated at 1:41 PM on 2nd December 2011 . YouTube has had its first major redesign since Google bought the site - and it's clearly aimed at making the video site more 'TV-like'. It's now easier to find 'channels' from the front page, with a black navigation menu on the left hand side which allows users to organise channels, rather than simply search for video using Google search. 'More and more, behind every great video is a great Channel,' said YouTube via its official blog. New look: The new look gathers 'Channels' in the black navigation bar on the right hand side of the . page making it more like Google's homepage . Three billion videos are viewed on YouTube every day. Google is attempting to 'shift' the way people use the site, with the increased focus on 'Channels' a clear attempt to mirror services offered by TV stations. It also ensures that users are logged in via a Google account. The new look for YouTube mirrors the redesign announced earlier this week of Google's home page. Professional approach: Advertisers prefer not to be next to . user-generated content so earlier this year, YouTube announced a range of professionally produced channels from celebrities such as Madonna . 'With our announcement last month that more Channels are coming to YouTube, we want to make it easier for you to find and keep tabs of what you want to watch,' said the company via an announcement on the official Google blog. The final YouTube look comes after Google . unveiled an experimental design in July called Cosmic Panda and used . feedback from users to establish the finished appearance. According to their official blog . Google believe the new design provides a 'simpler YouTube, with a . consistent grey background, bigger video thumbnails and a more . streamlined watch page.' Google also aims to offer more professional content on the site - and, as usual, everything will be free, supported by the internet giant's advertising system. 'DIY' channels allow users to earn a percentage by signing up for Google's 'Partner' programme, where they earn some of the advertising revenue generated by the site. But YouTube will also offer professional content. The changes follow a move earlier this year when the site launched 100 new . professionally produced TV channels in partnership with stars such as singer . Madonna and actor Ashton Kutcher. The . move is designed to turn YouTube - already available via many internet . TVs - into a rival to cable and satellite TV channels. Owner Google says that the channels will be on-demand services, each offering 25 hours of programming a day. The . arrangement should work in YouTube's favour when it comes to . advertising. Many big-ticket advertisers are relucant to be seen . alongside 'user-generated' videos, and would be happier with . professionally produced, star-studded content. YouTube is said to be paying up to $100million to producers to take part, and up to $5million per channel.

People with two or more sexual partners in a year could be considered too promiscuous to donate organs, according to new health guidelines being drawn up in the U.S. Both living and dead donors who had not been monogamous in the past 12 months could be too much of a risk for transmitting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C - even if they were otherwise healthy, according to the proposal. The move has been proposed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, who said they wanted to make the supply of organ donation safer by preventing accidental transmission of life-threatening infections. Controversial: It is hoped the guidelines will make the supply of organ donation safer by preventing accidental transmission of life-threatening infections . However, it has sparked controversy among transplant experts who fear the guidelines could eliminate too many potential donors, it has been reported. Dr Harry Dorn-Arias, a transplant surgeon at the University of Virginia, told MSNBC's Vitals health website: 'With the new guidelines, every college student in America will be high risk. 'Right now, it's probably a prostitute or a guy with a needle in his arm. Next time, it will be just a young guy.' CDC officials said the guidelines wouldn't ban somebody outright fro donating, but that they would by subject to more scrutiny and testing. Dr Matthew Kuehnert, director of the CDC's office of blood, organs and other tissue, defended the move, adding: 'It’s geared for the patient so the patient knows as much as they can about the organ being transplanted in them.' Transplant experts have accused the CDC of arbitrarily focusing on monogamy which, they believe, could scare off patients from accepting organs. Scared off: It is feared people could be put off donating if they know their sexual history alone could question their suitability . They also fear people could be put . off donating if they know their sexual history alone could question . their suitability - particularly if the person they want to donate to is . a family member. Dr Dorn-Arias said: 'If you were going to give your organ to your mom or dad or sister, you’re going to be ashamed of that. 'You’re either going to say no, or you’re going to lie.' If the policy is put into action it could also require families of dead donors answering uncomfortable questions about the sexual history of their loved ones. More than 28,000 organs are transplanted each year in the U.S., but more than 112,000 people are on organ waiting lists, according to figures from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

If Apple’s critics thought the intense fascination with the company would die down in the wake of the death of Steve Jobs, then this huge store opening will surely prove them wrong. One of the world's largest Apple stores - covering 23,000 sq ft - is opening this week at the landmark Grand Central train station in Manhattan, New York, and will start selling to the public on Friday. The owner of the space, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which runs the city's bus and subway system, says technology firm Apple is paying $180 per square foot for its lease. Brand new: Apple employees look at iPad tablets on display inside an Apple store in New York City's Grand Central station on Wednesday, during a press preview of the store, which opens to the public on Friday . Exciting fans: One of the world's largest Apple stores - covering 23,000 sq ft - is opening at the landmark Grand Central train station in Manhattan, New York . Impressive: A view of the entrance of the latest Apple store inside Grand Central Station on Wednesday . This is slightly less than the $200-per-square-foot top rate at the century-old transport hub. By leasing to Apple, the MTA says it is quadrupling the rent for Grand Central's east balcony and an adjacent one overlooking the cavernous main concourse with its famed night-sky ceiling. The store includes a basement storage area that was never leased before. The transit agency says the draw of the Apple name promises to increase foot traffic to other businesses at the terminal. Apple is behind iconic products such as the iPod, the iPad and the iPhone - and will set up in a station that is visited by about 750,000 people daily and home to the Metro-North commuter line.

Famous: The Apple logo is seen on the steps of the East Balcony leading to the Apple store in Grand Central . Up above: The Apple store is seen atop steps on the East Balcony behind passengers on the floor of the main lobby of New York City's Grand Central station . Apple is making it easier than ever to spend money at the new store in Grand Central. Visitors to the station can buy personal electronics without the help of a human being. They just slide an iPhone across a product's bar code and grab the item. The receipt comes by email. 'It's all about putting the customer in charge,' an Apple spokesman said. The store also offers one feature not available at any other Apple store - 15-minute training sessions for rushed New Yorkers. The company signed a 10-year lease with the MTA for the space once occupied by Charlie Palmer's Metrazur restaurant, which got $5million from Apple to clear out early. MTA says the $180-per-square-foot cost reflects this $5million payment, plus Apple's $2.5million capital investment in the space and a $1.1million annual rate that will rise each year of the lease. Apple will not share any portion of its revenue with the MTA, as other retailers do at the terminal, and it is considered by the transport group as an ‘anchor tenant’ at Grand Central. This is equivalent to a prominent store in a shopping centre that serves as an attraction surrounded by smaller retailers. An anchor tenant typically does not share revenue.

"Last updated at 2:59 PM on 5th December 2011 . Passions run high: An Apple employee with the company's logo shaved in his hair - today, the company lost one round in its copyright battle with Samsung, as Samsung won the rights to sell Galaxy tablets in Australia . Samsung has won the most important round yet in its global legal battle with Apple - after the Californian company's bid to halt U.S. sales of Samsung's Galaxy products was rejected. The companies are embroiled in bitter patent disputes in 10 countries - but none is more important than the U.S., Samsung's biggest market. The victory comes in the wake of an Australian court's ruling that Samsung was free to sell its Galaxy tablets in that territory. Shares in Samsung Electronics Co rose more than 2 percent. Samsung surpassed Apple as the world’s top smartphone maker in the third quarter and a ruling to temporarily halt U.S. sales of Galaxy smartphones could have negatively affected its growth momentum just as Apple released the iPhone 4S in early October. 'We believe the legal uncertainties between Samsung and Apple are waning, or put in another way, the situation is turning positive for Samsung,' said Nomura analyst CW Chung. Morgan Stanley analysts said the ruling removed the worst-case scenario for Samsung’s operating profit of a hit of as much as $1.5 billion and was 'clearly a major and favourable event' for the company. The battle has only intensified as sales of Samsung's cult Galaxy handsets have bitten into Apple's market share. Samsung is now the biggest smartphone company on Earth, by revenue and by volume, beating both Nokia and Apple. Android  phones now account for 52.5 per cent of the smartphone market - and Apple's just 16.6. But its Galaxy Tab isn't going to have an easy ride, even if it DOES go on sale - both Galaxy and iPad 2 are now being aggressively undercut by Amazon's new Kindle Fire tablet, which is roughly half the price of either. The Apple store in Sydney, Australia: A dispute between Apple and Samsung has erupted over Samsung's Galaxy S 10.1 tablet . A Samsung store in Sydney: Customers will be free to buy Galaxy tablets from Friday afternoon - unless Apple appeals the court's decisions . Fire has remained Amazon's best-selling item for eight weeks running. At least one major American retailer said it outsold iPad 2 on Black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza seen as 'kicking off' the shopping season in America. 'It’s hard to expect the ruling to have a major positive impact on Samsung’s tablet business or legal cases in other countries as Apple could appeal - and sales won’t be restored anytime soon,' said Song Myung-sub, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities in Seoul. A Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 on display in Seoul: Despite the Australian ruling, legal battle still rages between the two companies and Apple is to sue for a European ban on December 22 . 'Apple will continue to dominate the tablet market as Amazonappears to be the only viable threat at the moment and other vendors, including Samsung, continue to struggle.' Apple's move to win a stay preventing Apple selling the devices may allow it to lodge an appeal. The ruling is, however, a timely boost for Samsung ahead of the busy pre-Christmas shopping season. While the Australian market is not large, it is a key launch market for Apple products outside the United States. Apple and Samsung have been locked in a battle in 10 . countries involving smartphones and tablets since April. At one point, Apple forced Samsung to withdraw its Galaxy tablet from a technology trade show where it was not even on sale. Samsung has attempted to ban iPhone 4S in several territories. The . Australian dispute centres on touchscreen technology used in Samsung’s . new tablet. The quarrel had triggered expectations that some of the pair’s $5 . billion-plus relationship may be up for grabs. Samsung openly describes Apple as its 'biggest customer'. Ironically, the A5 chip in both iPad 2 and iPhone 4S still seems to be made by Samsung. Apple was granted an injunction against Samsung in October, temporarily barring Australian sales of the Galaxy 10.1 tab, which had been seen as the hottest competitor to Apple’s iPad until Amazon.com Inc launched its Kindle Fire. Amazon said this week it saw a surge in sales of its tablet devices on the crucial “Black Friday” shopping day after Thanksgiving. Samsung is the world’s top smartphone maker, but a distant second to Apple in tablets. The intensifying legal battle has undermined its efforts to close the gap. Apple also filed a preliminary injunction request in Germany on Monday to ban sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1N, a re-designed version of 10.1-inch Galaxy model, whose sales are already banned in that market. 'We believe the (Australian) ruling clearly affirms that Apple’s legal claims lack merit,' Samsung said in a statement, adding it would soon make an announcement on the market availability of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia. Justice Lindsay Foster told the court he would grant a stay on orders until Friday 4 p.m. (0500 GMT), noting Apple would have to go to the High Court if it wanted this extended. Copyright experts have been aghast at some of the issues raised - claiming that some of the legal measures used by the companies could result in bans of other devices, or even whole classes of technology.","Samsung 'free to sell' Galaxy devices in America .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 7:44 PM on 6th December 2011 . The norovirus outbreak at Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berks left hundreds of people unwell . A norovirus outbreak linked . to oysters served by Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant may have been . worse because he delayed notifying health chiefs. The concern is identified in . a major investigation into the outbreak that left hundreds of people ill after . eating at the restaurant which has three Michelin stars. The study, conducted by . experts from the Health Protection Agency (HPA), also found that staff continued . to work, preparing food, despite being ill or potentially contagious. Norovirus, which leads to . vomiting and diarrhoea, is highly contagious - and the outbreak at the Fat . Duck in 2009 was the biggest ever recorded involving a single restaurant. Subsequently, it has emerged . most oysters sourced from British waters are contaminated with low levels of . norovirus, probably linked to sewage outfalls. Diners, including a number of . celebrities, fell ill after eating from a special 'tasting menu' at the restaurant, specifically an oyster, passion fruit jelly and lavender dish. The HPA study reveals that . the celebrity chef, famed for his chemistry set gastronomy, did not contact . health authorities until six weeks after the first case of norovirus was reported. Rather than alerting public . health authorities to get help in tracking the source, the chef brought in . private consultants to investigate. It was only after they were . unable to find the cause that the chef voluntarily shut down the Fat Duck, . ordered a deep clean and finally called in the HPA and local council. Diners, including a number of celebrities, fell ill after eating from a special 'tasting menu' at the restaurant in 2009, specifically an oyster, passion fruit jelly and lavender dish (file photo) By this time, the chef . and his team had received 66 complaints of illness, while several hundred more . subsequently emerged. Significantly, in a study . published in the journal Epidemiology and Infection, the HPA investigators . highlight the delay and point out this could have left diners vulnerable. It concluded: 'Delayed . notification of the outbreak to public health authorities may have contributed . to outbreak size and duration.' Eventually, some 591 people . reported feeling ill after eating at the restaurant in January and February . 2009, while the experts were confident that at least 240 were likely to have . contracted norovirus. As well as diners, a number . of staff fell ill, either through eating or handling the contaminated oysters. In 2010, Mr Blumenthal told . the Daily Mail that the restaurant had a training manual that ensures staff who . fall ill do not return to work until at least 48 hours after symptoms have . disappeared. HPA experts found that the restaurant ordered a deep clean before notifying health authorities, which made it difficult for them to identify the source of the illness . However, the HPA study found: . 'Of those staff reporting illness, six reported working while unwell... Nine . reported returning to work prior to being asymptomatic for 48 hours and all . without negative laboratory tests.' This also raised the risk to . customers. The study concluded: 'The on-going risk from dining at the . restaurant may have been due to persistent contamination of the oyster supply . alone or in combination with further spread via infected food handlers or the . restaurant environment.' The experts found that the . restaurant ordered a deep clean before notifying health authorities, which made . it difficult for the authorities to identify the source of the illness. They said: 'A 'deep cleaning' exercise of the premises had been conducted immediately after closure and . preceding notification of authorities, thus severely limiting the potential . findings from environmental sampling as the environmental samples were taken . one week after closure.' The Fat Duck has faced a . number of legal claims from diners who fell ill, including the TV sports . presenter Jim Rosenthal, who was left 'disastrously' sick. He and his wife, who had been . eating with boxing promoter Frank Warren and three other guests, spent a total . of £1,346.33 on a 'gastronomic evening' which turned to 'catastrophe'. Blumenthal has cooked for notable people such as the Queen, pictured grimacing as he makes ice cream using liquid nitrogen . Research published by the . Food Standards Agency last week found that 76 per cent of oysters tested from UK . waters contained norovirus at a low level. Mr Blumenthal has refused to . serve oysters at his restaurant since the outbreak because he cannot be sure . that they will be free from contamination. Last night, a spokesman for . his restaurant said: 'We are satisfied with all our procedures that were in . place and strongly refute any accusations of wrongdoing. 'We co-operated with all . parties fully and transparently and received a clean bill of health to re-open . after a ten-day investigation. 'We also received full . support by our insurers who found no fault in our practices following a report . from a leading UK independent specialist. 'There is still no guaranteed . safety measure in place today to protect the general public with regards to . shellfish and viral contamination.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 2:40 PM on 7th December 2011 . Carollers singing 'O Christmas Tree' crashed Rhode Island's Statehouse tree lighting yesterday after Governor Lincoln Chafee unwrapped a hubbub by calling the 17-foot spruce a 'holiday' tree. Mr Chafee insisted his word choice was inclusive and in keeping with Rhode Island's founding as a sanctuary for religious diversity. But his seasonal semantics incensed some lawmakers, the Roman Catholic Church and thousands of people who called his office to complain that the independent governor was trying to secularize Christmas. Christmas spirit: Carollers singing 'O Christmas Tree' crashed Rhode Island's Statehouse during the tree lighting ceremony . 'He's trying to put our religion down,' said Ken Schiano of Cranston, who came to the tree lighting after hearing about the controversy. 'It's a Christmas tree. It always has been and it always will be, no matter what that buffoon says it is.' Mr Chafee did not address the several hundred people who filled the Statehouse to watch the tree lighting. Afterward, he said he was surprised by the heated reaction to his word choice. Mr Chafee argues that he is simply honouring Rhode Island's origins as a sanctuary for religious diversity. Hung up on semantics: The 'holiday' tree was lit in the rotunda of the statehouse in Providence. Carollers stormed the statehouse because they said the state is trying to 'secularize' Christmas . Religious dissident Roger Williams founded Rhode Island in 1636 as a haven for tolerance, where government and religion would forever be kept separate. Mr Chafee's immediate predecessor also referred to Statehouse trees as 'holiday' trees. 'If it's in my house it's a Christmas tree, but when I'm representing all of Rhode Island I have to be respectful of everyone,' Mr Chafee said after the tree lighting. 'Now we can get back to next year's budget ... with pleasure.' Religious freedom: Governor Lincoln Chafee says he's only trying to protect Rhode Island's origins as a haven for religious diversity . After Mr Chafee lit the 'holiday' tree, a few dozen carollers interrupted a performance by a children's chorus to sing 'O Christmas Tree.' The dispute also prompted the Providence diocese to schedule a competing Christmas tree lighting a block from the Statehouse. A Republican state lawmaker erected a tree in a Statehouse hallway to give Rhode Island residents an alternative to the official state 'holiday' tree. 'If it's in my house it's a Christmas . tree, but when I'm representing all of Rhode Island I have to be . respectful of everyone. Now we . can get back to next year's budget ... with pleasure.' -Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee . After the flap made national news, Mr Chafee's office received 3,500 calls of protest, with all but 700 coming from out of state. According to a tally by Mr Chafee's spokeswoman, his office received only 92 calls supporting his choice of words. Rhode Island has one of the largest percentages of Catholic residents in the country. Timothy Reilly, chancellor of the Providence diocese, said Mr Chafee's desire to be inclusive is laudable, though he chose the wrong way to do it. He said he hopes the controversy will prompt Christians to contemplate the holiday's true meaning, which he said far outweighs any spat over what to call a tree. 'He probably had the best of intentions but somewhere, somehow we lost hold of the true meaning of the season,' Reilly said. 'It's all about the baby Jesus. We tend to almost forget this.' Rival lighting: The dispute prompted the Providence diocese to schedule a competing Christmas tree lighting a block from the Statehouse . But by citing Roger Williams, Mr Chafee is upholding Rhode Island's legacy as one of the first secular governments in the modern world, according to Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. 'Rhode Island is Roger Williams country,' said Mr Lynn, who is also a United Church of Christ minister. 'He was one of the great champions of religious freedom and diversity in our history. There is no war against Christianity. We have a dizzying level of religious freedom in America.' The state House of Representatives in January passed a symbolic resolution declaring that the tree traditionally erected in the Statehouse be referred to 'as a `Christmas tree' and not as a `holiday tree' or other non-traditional terms.' O Tannenbaum: Puritan leaders of 17th century Massachusetts outlawed the celebration of Christmas because they didn't like the boisterous celebration . Squabbles over nativity scenes and trees have become a regular occurrence, though the first shots in the so-called War on Christmas were fired long ago. Aside from the uproar over the tree, Tuesday's lighting ceremony was traditional. A giant gingerbread house was on display, along with a 'heroes' tree decorated by the families of fallen service members. Choirs and a military band performed standards including 'White Christmas' and 'Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.' State employees served cookies. Some attendees said both sides of the tree spat need to focus more on the spirit of the season and not a label given to a blue spruce. 'Why are they making such a big deal about this?' asked Deborah McNerney of Pawtucket, who came to the Statehouse to see her son perform with a children's chorus. 'It's Christmas, after all.' The controversy highlights a very old . tension between the holiday's Christian roots, its links to . pre- Christian celebrations and the many now-familiar traditions that are . relatively new, according to Stephen Nissenbaum, a professor emeritus . of history at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the author of . 'The Battle for Christmas.' Early Christians wouldn't recognize the . modern holiday, with its reindeer, Santa Claus, 'round-the-clock . shopping and poinsettias. The tradition of Christmas trees was brought . to America in the 1830s by German immigrants who were continuing a . centuries-old practice from their homeland, though the use of evergreens . and candles or bonfires in winter holidays dates back to pre-Christian . Europe. The Puritan leaders of . 17th century Massachusetts actually outlawed the celebration of .

It comes as the nation faces an enduring Taliban-led insurgency and possible financial collapse. 'The United States is prepared to stand with the Afghan people for the long haul,' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told a global conference on Afghanistan's future, that was overshadowed by the absence of key regional player, Pakistan. 'In it for the long haul': Afghan President Hamid Karzai (bottom right) sits with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the Afghanistan Conference. Clinton said America would support Afghanistan beyond 2014 . The international community has 'much to lose if the country again becomes a source of terrorism and instability' she added. The conference is focused on the transfer of security responsibilities from international forces to Afghan security forces during the next three years, as well as long-term prospects for international aid and a possible political settlement with the Taliban to ensure the country's viability beyond 2014. Clinton stressed that in return for continued support the Afghans must live up to their commitments 'on taking difficult decisions to embrace reform, lead in their own defense and strengthen an inclusive democracy rooted in the rule of law'.

Friendship: Clinton speaks to two Afghans at the conference as she told them they must live up to their commitments 'on taking difficult decisions to embrace reform, lead in their own defense and strengthen an inclusive democracy rooted in the rule of law' About 100 countries and international organisations were represented among the 1,000 conference delegates in the German city of Bonn, including some 60 foreign ministers. 'Together we have spent blood and treasure in fighting terrorism,' Afghan President Hamid Karzai said. 'Your continued solidarity, your commitment and support will be crucial so that we can consolidate our gains and continue to address the challenges that remain. We will need your steadfast support for at least another decade.' Afghanistan is economically dependent on foreign aid and spending related to the huge military presence, currently totalling about 130,000 international troops. The country seeks assurance that donor nations will help fill the gap after most forces leave by 2015. Although donor nations will not commit to specific figures at the one-day session today, they will sign up to the principle that economic and other advances in Afghanistan since the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001 should be safeguarded with continued funding.

Afghanistan estimates it will need outside contributions of roughly $10billion in 2015, or slightly less than half the country's annual gross national product, mostly to pay for its security forces, then slated to number about 350,000. The conference's final declaration outlines a series of mutual commitments for the decade following the troop withdrawal, strongly conveying that Afghanistan 'will not be left alone', a German diplomat said. 'On the other hand, there is a clear Afghan commitment do to its homework in terms of reform, fighting corruption, good governance and strengthening democracy,' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the summit conclusion was not yet made public. The international community also pledges to support the process of reconciliation with the Taliban, 'with its basic principles being no to violence, no to terrorism and respect for the Afghan constitution and human rights', he said. Pakistan is a central player in regional efforts to improve trade and strengthen its weak economies. But its boycott has cast a pall over the session, because it points out that nation's influence in Afghanistan and its ability to play the spoiler. Pakistan is seen as instrumental to ending the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan because of its links to militant groups and its unwillingness, from the U.S. and NATO perspective, to drive insurgents from safe havens on its soil where they regroup and rearm. United: An animated Clinton shakes hands with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Karzai told the conference: ''Together we have spent blood and treasure in fighting terrorism' All together: The conference was well attended but was overshadowed by the absence of key regional player, Pakistan, which stayed away in protest at the Nato airstrike which killed 24 of their troops . Pakistan cancelled its participation in protest over last month's NATO air assault, carried out from Afghan territory, that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. The deaths fed the popular perspective in Pakistan that the U.S. and NATO, not the Taliban, are Pakistan's principal enemies. 'Nobody (...) is more concerned than the United States is about getting an accurate picture of what occurred in the recent border incident,' Clinton said with an edge in her voice. In Lahore, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said his country remained committed to working with Afghanistan to bring insurgent leaders into talks with the government. 'I think we have evolved some mechanisms, and we are ready to cooperate' he said, referring to meetings with Afghanistan's military and intelligence chiefs on a framework for talks. 'We are committed (to reconciliation), despite that we are not attending (the Bonn meeting),' he said. Pakistan's army accused NATO of a 'deliberate act of aggression', an assertion the Pentagon hotly denied. Pakistan has received billions in U.S. aid since 2001, largely in expectation of cooperation against militants. Afghanistan's western neighbor Iran joined the conference, and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said the country stands ready to support Afghanistan and 'welcomes the departure of the international military', condemning the idea of any bases remaining after 2014. The U.S. is currently seeking an agreement with the Afghan government establishing operating rules for the small number of remaining U.S. forces and other issues after international forces withdraw. 'Any international or regional peace initiative to restore peace and security in Afghanistan can only be successful if it discards the presence of foreign military forces,' Salehi said. The U.S. had once hoped to use the Bonn gathering to announce news about the prospect for peace talks with the Taliban, making it a showcase for political reconciliation, but Afghan and U.S. outreach efforts have not borne fruit and no prominent Taliban representatives were attending the conference. The reconciliation efforts suffered a major setback after the September assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was leading the Afghan government's effort to broker peace with the insurgents. Violence in Afghanistan is up sharply this year, and has spread to the once-peaceful north of the country. And widespread corruption is bedeviling attempts to create a viable Afghan government and institutions to take over when the U.S. and NATO leave. 'The road ahead will remain stony and difficult. It will require endurance and tenacity,' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said.","Karzai warns country will need $10bn of outside contributions to pay for security in 2015 .

"By . Daniel Miller . Last updated at 2:19 PM on 7th December 2011 . An airport baggage handler who was fired for refusing to load a sick and starving dog onto a plane has been offered her job back after news of her dismissal prompted a national outcry. Lynn Jones was fired from Reno-Tahoe International Airport last month after breaking down in tears and refusing to obey her supervisor, fearing the emaciated animal would not survive the flight. But after news of her sacking spread, hundreds of supporters bombarded airport bosses with angry phone calls and emails demanding that she should be rehired. Caring: Baggage handler Lynn Jones, pictured at home with her three dogs, has been offered her old job back after being fired for refusing to load a sick animal onto a flight . Now Airport Terminal Services the private company who employed her for more than five years, has offered her old job back, complete with back pay. The firm's president Sally Leible claims she regretted the way the incident was handled and that she hoped Ms Jones would come back to work. Ms Leible said she now believes that Ms Jones 'was trying to protect the dog' She added: 'I think she was courageous in doing that. 'I really, truly hope she will come back."" Ms Lieble said the company would use the incident as a learning tool to educate workers at the 38 U.S. airports ATS serves and renew the company's commitment to recognize and report animal abuse of any form. However as of Tuesday night, Ms Jones had not accepted the job offer, Leible said. A statement on ATS's website read: . 'ATS takes this situation extremely seriously and commends this . employee's situational awareness and her desire to raise the concern on . behalf of the canine involved.' The firm has also pledged to contribute an unspecified amount of . money to the Nevada Humane Society over the next three years. Ms Jones, of Lockwood, said her supervisor had ordered her to load the pointer dog lying in a pet carrier because the its paperwork was in order and its condition wasn't her concern. She said at the time: 'The dog was so weak and torn up. It didn't look like it could survive the flight. I was crying. I kept saying that dog could not be put on a plane.' 'Everybody who saw it, the ATS people, the airport police officers, the girls at the ticket counter, was concerned. Outcry: Hundreds of supporters bombarded bosses at Reno/Tahoe International Airport demanding Ms Jones be rehired . Ms Jones said she was then fired on the spot, adding: '[My supervisor] kept yelling, ""That's it, you're done, you are out of here, go home"".' She says her employers deactivated her security badge and refused to return her phone calls. The airport police phoned Washoe County Regional Animal Services, who took custody of the animal which is owned by a hunter who, according to authorities, has it shipped to places he hunts. It was allowed to fly three days later and was taken back to Texas. Ms Jones added: 'I just couldn't turn my back on that dog. My supervisor said it wasn't my concern, but animal abuse is everyone's concern who sees it.' Krys Bart, CEO of the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority - who is also on the board of directors of the Nevada Humane Society said she was proud of how airport police intervened. She said: 'In all my years here, this is the first time I'm thoroughly disgusted over what I understand to be the situation this animal was put in. 'They (officers) had an affirmative responsibility to deal with this, and that's what they did,' Ms Bart said. Speaking on Monday Ms Jones said that she didn't know what she would do if offered her old job back. She said: 'I would have to really think about it.'","Company president now describes employee as 'courageous' and hopes she'll come back to work .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:32 PM on 7th December 2011 . Germany and France - who have been behind an action plan to save the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis - are at risk of not signing it off this week. French officials have said the leaders of both countries will not leave Friday's European Union summit until a 'powerful' deal is reached. But a senior German official has given a downbeat assessment of its prospects and said the first step in the deal may not be agreed until at least Christmas. Conflicting reports: A French minister has said a deal will be thrashed out by Angela Merkel (left) and Nicolas Sarkozy (right) on Friday, but Germany officials are not so sure . The official said: 'I have to say today that I am more pessimistic than last week about reaching an overall deal. A lot of protagonists still have not understood how serious the situation is. 'My pessimism stems from the overall picture that I see at this point, in which institutions and member states will have to move on many points to make possible the new treaty rules that we are aiming for.' The German comment is being seen as apparent effort to jolt partners into accepting Berlin's terms and restrictions. The news has sent European share prices tumbling. The FTSE 100 closed 0.77 per cent down at 5,526; Germany's DAX ended 0.73 per cent down at 5,985; and France's CAC 40 finished 0.38 per cent down at 3,167. And it comes hours after a leaked report from European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said a quick-fix solution to the eurozone debt crisis could be achieved without changing the treaties that bind the European Union. In his interim dossier, prepared for the crucial EU summit that starts tomorrow, he said only minor tweaks were needed to save the euro. His 'fiscal compact' plan would not need to undergo the lengthy process of ratification by parliaments or national referendums. Leaked report: EC President Herman Van Rompuy . (left) says only minor tweaks are needed to save the euro, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner (right) is in Europe for a three-day . blitz of eurozone officials . The draft report states that tougher . fiscal reforms can be adopted simply by amending a protocol, which would . only need national consensus. Van Rompuy, who will chair the two-day . summit, said this would speed up the implementation of reforms, and . remove any potential political complications. He . proposed that each eurozone member's budget should be below 3 per cent . of GDP, national debt under 60 per cent, and a 'golden rule' should be . enshrined to guarantee balanced budgets in the medium term. It . also suggested that the eurozone bailout fund should be given a banking . licence to borrow directly from the European Central Banks, and that . the EC should have the power to impose austerity measures automatically . on countries which require bailouts. French . President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European . Central Bank Chief Mario Draghi and even U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy . Geithner are all starring in the financial drama leading up to this . Friday's summit of 27 EU leaders. If . the summit is a failure, Sarkozy warned last week, 'the world will not . wait for Europe' and it could spell the end of the 17 country eurozone. Today, Geithner is in France for talks with Sarkozy . and the prime minister-elect of Spain, Mariano Rajoy Brey. He will also . meet Italian PM Mario Monti in Milan just before the new Italian leader . heads for the EU summit in Brussels. Later . on, many of Europe's most important leaders will be in Marseille, . France, for a meeting of the conservative-leaning European People's . Party. Merkel, Sarkozy and Spain's new conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will all be there. And tomorrow, the European Central Bank holds its monthly policy meeting. Many analysts expect one or more actions by the bank aimed at boosting growth and steadying the financial system. But Germany has opposed the ECB funding move by saying it would breach a ban on the bank's financing governments. And the same official said that such a plan to merely amend existing regulations would 'fall short of what we want, which is a clear legal framework to institute a new stability culture'. Some of Van Rompuy's plans are the . same as those proposed on Monday by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and . French President Nicolas Sarkozy. But . Merkozy, as the pair have been dubbed, want to push through more . radical measures in a bid to introduce a new EU treaty by March. They want to automatically penalise countries that run up a deficit of more than 3 per cent of its GDP and are urging eurozone leaders to meet every month until the crisis is over. And they have said that if all 27 EU members cannot agree on a way forward, then they are prepared to work towards a new treaty involving the eurozone bloc and any other country that wants to join. This could leave Britain, which is not part of the eurozone, feeling more isolated. Van Rompuy also acknowledged that more far-reaching reforms would eventually require a change in EU treaties. Plans are also being drawn up for a financial 'bazooka' that would see the creation of two separate rescue funds. It would also involve winning increased support for the International Monetary Fund. This three-pronged rescue system would form part of a carefully crafted package EU leaders hope will win over financial markets and would be introduced alongside plans to re-write EU treaties. Sources have said negotiators are debating letting the eurozone's existing 440 billion euro bail-out fund to continue working when a new 500 billion euro facility comes into force in mid-2012. This would almost double the firepower of the financial rescue system. Merkozy's plans have been backed by the U.S. in their plans, with its Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner currently on a three-day blitz of eurozone officials. Up and down: European markets have fluctuated today with the announcement by the EC President, and then the warning an agreement may not be reached by Friday . He said yesterday that the U.S. Federal Reserve had no plans to give money to the International Monetary Fund to boost the eurozone's bailout fund. Geithner stressed more action was needed to boost economic growth in Europe, alongside the longer-term reforms. He will meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris today. His support for the Franco-German blueprint came after credit rating agency Standard & Poor fired two warning shots at the bloc. Confident: French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said neither Nicolas Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel would leave the negotiating table of the summit until there is a powerful deal . Just hours after the two leaders announced their plan on Monday, S&P put the credit ratings of 15 countries, including Germany and France, on review for a downgrade. It cited 'continuing disagreements among European policy makers on how to tackle the immediate market confidence crisis'. And today Geithner told reporters after talking with French Finance Minister Francois Baroin: 'I have a lot of confidence in what the president of France and the minister are doing, working with Germany to build a stronger Europe.' Baroin added: 'Neither Nicolas Sarkozy nor Angela Merkel will leave the negotiating table of this summit until there is a powerful deal.' Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of euro zone finance ministers, said he was astonished by S&P's announcement, which he called 'a wild exaggeration and also unfair' because it failed to take account of Italy's new austerity plan. It then went a step further yesterday , placing the top-notch rating of the eurozone's 440 billion euro rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), on negative watch since it depends on the creditworthiness of the bloc's six AAA-rated countries. Spanish Prime Minister-elect Mariano Rajoy - who is due to meet Geithner later on Wednesday at a congress of European conservative leaders in the southern French port of Marseille - said he would support a new treaty. But some other EU governments, notably Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, are reluctant to amend the EU charter, either due to eurosceptics at home or because they fear losing possible referendums on ratification. Figures released on Wednesday showed just how urgently some European banks need help. Italian banks had to borrow 153.2 billion euros in emergency liquidity from the European Central Bank in November, up from 111.3 billion euros at the end of October. It was another big leap in reliance on the central bank which has almost quadrupled since June, when Italian lenders took 41.3 billion euros. Eurozone banks took more than $50 billion in the ECB's first dollar funding operation since the world's leading central banks agreed last week to cut their cost, five times the $10 billion forecast in a poll of money market traders. And Germany is set to reactivate a bank rescue fund created at the height of the 2008 financial crisis at next week's cabinet meeting, a government official said.","But French vow not to leave Friday's summit until 'powerful deal' reached .

"By . Jason Groves and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 7:29 PM on 7th December 2011 . Rebekah Brooks was told by lobbyists to carefully select which police station she should be taken to for questioning, it emerged last night. It appears she was encouraged by senior executives at Bell Pottinger, who had links to the police, to rule out stations that gave easy access for the media. A senior executive at the firm also claimed that the former News International boss was 'in tears' when Rupert Murdoch was attacked during his appearance at the Culture Select Committee. It has also been revealed that the lobbyists claimed they had access to Vince Cable as well as the Prime Minister. Rebekah Brooks: The former editor prepared for her select committee appearance, pictured, by receiving a grilling from Bell Pottinger lobbyists, according to the firms's managing director . Tim Collins, the firm's managing director, told undercover reporters that the company had been representing Ms Brooks since she resigned in July over accusations of phone-hacking at the News of the World. The Independent reported that the firm's advice, from both Mr Collins and chairman David Wilson, even went as far as helping choose the police station she should be questioned at. Mr Collins said: 'Dave was on the phone...""No that nick's not quite right, no no, that one's got a car park, not that one's down a tunnel""... and I thought he was on to some very dodgy part of the criminal underworld but in fact it was his brother-in-law who's a police officer.' After her arrest for allegedly assaulting her then husband Ross Kemp in November 2005, she was taken to Wandsworth police station, but released without charge. The newspaper also reported that Mr Collins claimed Bell Pottinger employees spent a morning giving Ms Brooks a 'very rude' mock interview ahead of her giving evidence to the select committee. He added: 'We were four hours in a waiting room adjacent to the committee room . waiting to go in. She was really upset actually, in tears when Rupert . got attacked because he is her mentor. 'He's almost like a father . figure to her. I know there are stories about her in the past, I didn't . know her too well in the past, so I won't comment on whether she was . ruthless or whatever, I must say I see a very honorable, honest woman . who's trying to fight to clear her name at the moment.' The lobbyist also criticised News International's handling of the hacking scandal, saying it had been a PR disaster. Ms Brooks has not commented on the reports. Boasts: Tim Collins, left, claimed to have access to Business Secretary Vince Cable through his aide . Mr Collins, also told reporters posing as potential clients that the Business Secretary could be accessed through his aide Giles Wilkes. The former Tory MP added that as a result of the relationship Mr Cable had visited a factory owned by a Bell Pottinger client that was seeking help from the Government. Mr Collins said: ‘Stephen Lotinga, my colleague, knows Giles very well, he headed up the Lib Dem home policy unit until ... the general election so all the people who went into government and became Liberal Democrat special advisers all worked for him. ‘So he knows all of them, still talks to them socially. ‘We actually took a client in to see Giles last week, last Thursday, so it’s not something that is difficult for us to do.’ Undercover reporters filmed executives at Bell Pottinger boasting of their round-the-clock access to David Cameron, William Hague and George Osborne. The Independent reported that Mr Collins described Mr Cable as ‘cantankerous’ and was recorded saying it was ‘not a problem’ to get a message to the Prime Minister on behalf of clients. Caught on camera: Former Tory MP Tim Collins at a meeting with undercover reporters in which he claimed to have access to the Prime Minister and Vince Cable . He claimed the firm had succeeded in getting Mr Cameron to speak to the . Chinese premier on behalf of a client within 24 hours of being asked to . do so. And it was said . that in return for a £1million fee, the company would act to improve the . image of the totalitarian regime in Uzbekistan, which has one of the . worst human rights records in the world. Downing Street was forced on to the back foot by the allegations yesterday – and insisted that the claims of influence were untrue. But last night Labour wrote to Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell calling for an inquiry into the affair. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ‘It seems that if you have £1million you can get access to the Prime Minister without anyone knowing about it. That is wrong.’ Mr Trickett urged Sir Gus to focus his investigation on claims by Mr Collins that Bell Pottinger had persuaded the Prime Minister to intervene on behalf of the UK engineering firm Dyson earlier this year. But the Prime Minister’s spokesman suggested Mr Collins had greatly exaggerated the firm’s influence: ‘Clearly it is in their interests to tell their clients that they can provide them with a service and that is what they appear to be doing. ‘It simply isn’t true to say that Bell Pottinger or any other lobbying company has influenced Government policy.’ But the allegations are an embarrassment for a Prime Minister who has pledged to curb lobbying. In a speech in February last year, Mr Cameron described the £2billion lobbying industry as ‘the next big scandal waiting to happen’. Inquiry call: Labour's Jon Trickett, left, has called on Sir Gus O'Donnell to launch an investigation into the affair . Government . sources last night confirmed that plans for a statutory register of . lobbyists have been delayed and are unlikely to take force before 2013 . at the earliest. Yesterday’s . allegations emerged after reporters from the Bureau of Investigative . Journalism posing as agents of the government of Uzbekistan secretly . recorded conversations with Mr Collins and other Bell Pottinger . executives. Mr Collins . told the reporters he had worked with Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne in the . Conservative Party’s research department, where Mr Cameron’s policy guru . Steve Hilton was also a senior figure. ‘I’ve been working with people like Steve Hilton, David Cameron, George Osborne for 20 years-plus. I mean I know all these people, there is not a problem about getting the messages through to them,’ he said. Bell Pottinger yesterday condemned the undercover operation as an ‘unethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story’. But Tory backbencher Jesse Norman said the latest disclosures reaffirmed his view that lobbying was a ‘canker on the body politic’. A spokesman for Mr Cable said Mr Wilkes did know Mr Lotinga, but not especially well.","Former News International boss was 'in tears' when Rupert Murdoch was attacked at the Culture Select Committee .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 6:47 PM on 7th December 2011 . 'Murder in slow motion': Stalking can destroy its victims . The world’s first clinic aimed at rehabilitating stalkers to help prevent violent crimes such as murder, rape and sexual assault, will open its doors tomorrow. Experts behind the National Stalking Clinic (NSC) say stalking, which has been described as 'murder in slow motion', can be stopped through proper assessment and treatment. The NSC will open at Chase Farm in London and will be run by the by Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust. Statistics show one in five women and one in 10 men fall victim to stalking, a crime that can lead to murder, rape and sexual assault. A typical assessment at the clinic will cost between £1,500 and £2,000, which will be met by the referral agencies, which can include courts or probation officers. Dr Frank Farnham, a consultant psychiatrist and one of the founders of the clinic, said: 'If we can treat stalkers, then we can save lives. 'There is great need for a co-ordinated national service that can provide specialist advice and treatment. 'The psychological impact on victims is corrosive, with many suffering months and, in some cases, years of harassment leading to a variety of illnesses including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. 'Victims live in a permanent state of hyper-alertness which is physically and mentally draining.' Tragedy: Tricia Bernal with her daughter Clare, who was shot by her stalker in 2005 . The NSC will assess stalkers referred by other agencies including the courts, police, probation service and the NHS. Tricia Bernal said her daughter Clare, may have been spared harrassment if such a clinic existed before the Harvey Nichols beauty consultant was shot dead at the perfume counter of the Knightsbridge store. Her 22-year-old daughter had been harrassed by her killer for months, even though he had been slapped with a series of restraining orders. Former store security guard Michael Pech, 30 was on bail awaiting sentence for harassment of his former girlfirend when he murdered her in September 2005. The Czech-born immigrant then killed himself. Police, magistrates and the Crown Prosecution Service were heavily criticised for not doing enough in the months before the attack. Today, Ms Bernal, 56, from Tunbridge Wells, told The Evening Standard,: 'This sort of early intervention really could have helped Clare. 'I'm thrilled this is happening. It's wonderful progress. It's all about early intervention. 'Stalking affects so many people, families are affected for a very long time after.' Alexis Bowater, chief executive of UK charity Network for Surviving Stalking, said: 'The launch of this clinic is a ground-breaking move and makes the UK one of the world leaders in tackling this devastating crime. 'The treatment and rehabilitation of stalkers is vital if we are to stop lives being lost to stalking.' Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'I'm pleased to support the launch of this unique clinic that aims to prevent stalkers from reoffending. Garry Shewan, lead on stalking and harassment with the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Stalking is a crime which steals lives. 'The assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of perpetrators is a vital part of tackling stalking and of preventing reoffending.' 'It would be no more expensive than if a court contacted a psychiatrist, for example, for a report,' said Dr Farnham. If further treatment was needed, Dr Farnham said an 18-month course could cost between £7,000 and £10,000. He said it could give courts a cheaper and more effective option than a short prison sentence for stalking-related offences, such as assault. The overall average cost of a prison place per year is £45,000, according to the Prison Reforms Trust. 'Stalking itself isn't a crime,' said Dr Farnham. 'If people have committed an offence that is more serious they are sentenced in court for that offence. 'It is our experience that individuals get shorter prison sentences that won't make any difference and they go back to stalking. 'We are not going to be taking risks with dangerous people but it gives the courts an option.' Last month, the Government announced a three-month consultation on the problem of stalking after victims complained of feeling 'let down' by the justice system. Riley Lison-Taylor, 33, and Jaime . Perlman, 37, of Putney, south west London, were found dead in a . fume-filled rented flat just five days after they met on the internet. In . the hallway were a series of letters in which they hit out at officers . who investigated their harassment cases, Detective Inspector Glen Lloyd, . of the Metropolitan Police, told Westminster Coroner's Court. Tragic: The scene last year on Pentlow Street in Putney where the bodies of Riley Lison-Taylor and Jaime Perlman were found . Two-thirds of stalking victims who contacted the police were unhappy with the way the officers or the Crown Prosecution Service handled their cases, according to the Protection Against Stalking report. The Home Office will be seeking the views of victims and police in their review, due to finish in February. An inquest last month heard that an escort girl and dominatrix who were stalked by their clients left notes criticising police as part of an online suicide pact.","Groundbreaking clinic aims to rehabilitate offenders to prevent violent crime which springs from stalking .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 10:28 AM on 7th December 2011 . A festive ice rink erected in a town centre has been branded a 'diabolical mess' after bungling contractors built it on a slope. Hundreds of parents and children were left disappointed by the shoddy winter centrepiece in Evesham, Worcestershire, after builders left the slope uneven and resembling a 'cobbled street'. The 'hazardous' skating rink in the town's Market Square has since been pulled down less than three weeks before Christmas due to health and safety concerns. Shut: This ice rink in Evesham, Worcestershire, has been shut for health and safety reasons after it was built on a slope . As well as erecting the rink on an uneven surface, contractors used dozens of panels which were also uneven, leaving the arena looking like a 'cobbled street'. Inspectors ruled last Friday that the rink was unsafe, and despite contractors attempting to rectify the problems, the attraction was shut down at the weekend. Father-of-two Daniel Lewis, 45, said: 'The ice rink looked down right hazardous. For starters it was on a slope which was quite steep in some places. 'In the middle and around the edges of the rink the panels were sticking up all over the place.  It looked like a cobbled street. My kids were gutted. 'They were inconsolable when I had to tell them they couldn't use it because it was unsafe.' Evesham town clerk Frank Green said: 'We have organised the rink for the past two years with the same company and never had any problems but the rink which was used this time was different. 'The panels that formed the floor of the rink were sticking up and were trip hazards and those at the side of the rink were also unsuitable. Shoddy winter centrepiece: The ice rink went up in Evesham's market Square, pictured, which slopes into the middle in this picture. The rink was described as a 'diabolical mess' 'The rink was inspected on Friday and it was found to be unsafe and the contractor was asked to rectify the safety issues. 'Attempts were made but after further inspection on Saturday morning safety concerns still remained.' Evesham town council ordered the rink, which measures 50ft by 50ft, from company Skate Spectacular. Mayor of Evesham cllr Jim Bulman added: 'It was a diabolical mess. 'The town council feels badly let down by the contractor who provides the facility. 'The ice rink was supposed to be the centrepiece for the whole weekend, which was totally ruined. 'It's a huge disappointment. I know how much distress it will have caused local children because they would have been really looking forward to it.' Owner of Worcestershire-based Skate Spectacular Ronald Bishton yesterday admitted the blunder. He said: 'It's just gone pear-shaped. I wasn't there myself so I don't know what's gone wrong. 'I'm just very disappointed with what's happened. I'm gutted.

Almost a century after Captain Scott and his team perished on a polar expedition, the final letter from their ill-fated adventure has been uncovered for the first time. The moving message from Scott's closest comrade Sir Edward Wilson reveals that the party were resigned to their fate as the end approached. 'This looks like a finish to our . undertaking,' Wilson wrote as the party attempted the return from the South Pole, 'for we are out of food and oil and not able . to move for three days now on account of the blizzard.' Brave to the last: The final moving letter written from Captain Scott's doomed South Pole expedition by Sir Edward Wilson . Stoic explorers: Lieutenant Bowers, Dr Edward Wilson and Mr Cherry-Garrard beside their sledge, just before starting on their doomed Antarctic journey . His letter to publisher Reginald Smith had remained undiscovered since 1913 until an archivist happened to inspect an old box of documents. Addressed to 'my dear good friend and my dear Mr Smith', the communication shows a man who was stoic until the last. Ill fated: Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott . Wilson wrote: 'We have had a long struggle against intense cold on very short fuel, and it has done us in.' The story of the Terra Nova . expedition is explored in a mixture of newly discovered and rarely seen . letters, diaries and photographs of its members, in an exhibition at . Cambridge University’s Polar Museum. The exhibition tells the full story . of the fateful expedition, not just through the famous journals and . letters of Scott, Bowers, Evans, Oates and Wilson, who died on their way . back from the Pole, but through other members of the ship’s crew and . shore party. Curator Kay Smith said: 'This really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see these manuscripts exhibited together. 'Some of them are so fragile and valuable that they probably won’t go on display again for another hundred years. 'We’re not just talking about the . ‘race to the pole’ here, we’re talking about an entire crew of men, each . telling their own story in their own way - and perhaps a different . story from those you’re already familiar with.' Among . items on display is the rarely seen second journal of Henry Robertson . 'Birdie' Bowers who accompanied Scott to the Pole and died alongside him . on the return journey. This . fragile volume has been repaired especially for the exhibition and the . full text will be published for the first time, along with Bowers’ letters home, in a limited edition in mid-December. Archivist Naomi Boneham said: 'This is not the journal of somebody who set out knowing they were going to die. 'As the expedition progresses, his notes become much less detailed as he concentrates on survival. Sketch book: This book belonged to polar explorer Sir Edward Wilson, which goes on show at The Scott Polar Research Institute Museum at The University of Cambridge . Last letter: Captain Scott's last letter to his widow, left, is part of a new exhibition showcasing many rarely seen letters and artefacts from his expedition to the South Pole in 1912, right . Heroic adventurers: Wilson's letter reveals that the crew knew they were going to die as the end approached . 'It . becomes very focused on the distance travelled each day as that was . vital to calculate how far they were from food supplies.' It includes a reference to Edgar Evans, the first to die, which reads: 'Bill legs still bad, also Edgar’s fingers.' Also on display is Scott’s journal . which includes Captain Oates’ famous parting comment: 'I’m just going . outside and may be some time.' Scott reflects on this: 'We all hope to meet the end in a similar spirit, and assuredly the end is not far.' Alongside this is the seal skin sleeping bag used by Oates. Polar journal: Naomi Boneham, archivist at The Scott Polar Research Institute Museum at The University of Cambridge, holds the journal of polar explorer Henry Bowers . Flashback to 1911: Captain Robert Falcon Scott pictured writing at a table in his quarters at the British base camp in Antarctica . Detail of a letter from Captain Scott describing the last time he saw Captain Oates, saying 'I'm just going outside and may be some time' Captain Scott led the expedition, officially called the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, with the aim to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole. But when his team of four companions got there on January 17, 1912, they found a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had already arrived 33 days earlier. Scott’s entire team died in March during their return from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. Captain Scott was a Royal Navy officer and explorer from Devon, who had previously led the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic from 1901-1904. The exhibition highlights the 'Worst . Journey in the World' - the winter journey to collect eggs from the . Emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier. It . also showcases the largely forgotten Northern Party - six men stranded . for 21 months when the ship could not reach them through the heavy pack . ice and forced to shelter from the brutal Antarctic winter in a cave dug . into the snow. Heather . Lane, keeper of collections, said: 'In order to preserve naval . discipline they drew an invisible line, demarcating the officers’ mess. 'There was a rule that if the other . ranks heard something they should not have heard, they did not hear it. This rule was meticulously observed.' Dr Wilson’s sketchbook including . drawings of the tent belonging to Roald Amundsen - who beat Scott’s team . to the pole - is also displayed. Alongside the written material are items including the Christmas decorations made by the 33-strong show party, showing the realities of day-to-day life in the Antarctic. The title of the exhibition - These Rough Notes - comes directly from Captain Scott’s message to the public written at the end of his journal, just prior to his death. Dated March 29 1912, it reads: 'Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. 'These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale, but surely, surely, a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for.' Next to the journal is Scott’s last letter to his wife, which begins: 'Dear widow.' The exhibition runs until May 5.","'This is not the journal of somebody who set out knowing they were going to die', says archivist .
New artefacts include the last letter written by Scott's closest comrade before he died ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:49 PM on 6th December 2011 . A police force which initially failed to fire a hero officer who allegedly had sex with his mistress while on duty is to be investigated itself, it emerged today. The police watchdog will look at how Gwent Police dealt with the controversial case relating to armed response officer Pc Shaun Jenkins. The 35-year-old was only fired after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ordered a re-investigation of his case. Tryst: Armed response officer Shaun Jenkins (pictured) apparently wore his uniform and left his gun on the dressing table during his alleged sex session . The IPCC said today that it was 'concerned' at how Gwent Police dealt with such a serious complaint. It fears the matter could potentially undermine public confidence in the complaints system itself. Jenkins, who had two awards for bravery, was sacked in December 2010 for gross misconduct. It followed allegations he drove to the home of his lover for afternoon sex while an officer apparently waited outside in a squad car. Jenkins allegedly wore his uniform and left his loaded firearm on the dressing table during the 40-minute daylight tryst. His secret life unravelled when the woman's husband found out and complained and Jenkins was hauled before police chiefs. Probe: The IPCC is looking again at the way Gwent Police handled the case of Pc Jenkins, which it said may damage public faith in the complaints system . When he was given a final warning but . allowed to continue patrolling the streets of Caerphilly, the woman's . husband complained to the IPCC. It ordered the re-investigation of the complaint which culminated in Jenkins being sacked. Now it has decided to investigate the way Gwent Police dealt with the disciplinary matter. 'The IPCC has received a voluntary . referral from Gwent Police which relates to how a complaint received by . the force on November 2, 2010 was dealt with and the subsequent . disciplinary action on December 2, 2010. 'The . investigation is into how a complaint was dealt with against a police . officer who was alleged to have had sex on duty with the complainant's . wife. 'The complainant appealed to the IPCC about the discipline outcome, which was a final written warning. 'The IPCC upheld the appeal and the force then held a full powers misconduct hearing which decided to dismiss the police constable.' Tom Davies, IPCC Commissioner for Wales, said: 'I am concerned at how Gwent Police dealt with a serious complaint, as this could potentially undermine public confidence in the complaints system. 'I have therefore decided this matter should be investigated by IPCC investigators. 'The case itself has recently been reported extensively in the media and relates to a firearms officer. 'We will publish our findings in due course, which I hope will help allay any public concerns about the way police complaints are dealt with.'","Pc Shaun Jenkins was initially given a final warning .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 11:29 PM on 6th December 2011 . At least 59 people have been killed in rare sectarian bombings on civilians in Afghanistan. The two blasts, targeted at Shiite worshippers, occurred during a festival known as Ashoura, and were the first major sectarian attacks for a decade. In the more deadly of the two, a suicide bomber struck in the middle of a crowd outside a mosque in the capital Kabul. Split-second: People rush to help those caught in the blast seconds after the bomb exploded at a Shi'ite shrine in Kabul, Afghanistan . Carnage: Bodies lie strewn across the ground after the powerful explosive went off this morning . The group had gathered at the Abul  Fazl shrine to commemorate the seventh century death of the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson. The bomber detonated his explosives near one of the gates to the shrine, killing 55, including two women and four children.More than 160 people were wounded. It was the deadliest attack since a suicide bomber killed 60 people near the Indian embassy in the city in 2008. At roughly the same time, 185 miles away in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, four people were killed when a bomb strapped to a bicycle exploded as a convoy of Shiites drove down a road. Grief: Men weep after a suicide bomber detonated their device inside a . packed Abulfazel Shrine in Kabul yesterday, killing 59 . people . Deadly: Afghan men shout as they help to move the bodies of victims. Women and children were among those killed in the blast . No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, which have been condemned by the Taliban. Suspicion centered on militant groups based in Pakistan where Sunni attacks on minority Shiites are common. A man claiming to be from Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Pakistan-based militant group that has carried out attacks against Shiites, called media outlets to claim responsibility for the Kabul bombing but his claim has not been confirmed. Witness Mahood Khan, who is in charge of the Abul Fazl shrine, said: ‘It was a very powerful blast. It was out of control. Everyone was crying, shouting. It is a disaster.’ Rescued: A man carries a wounded boy past the bodies of those killed in the blast . Wounded: A man covered in blood is lifted out of the back of an ambulance in Kabul . High alert: Police officers stand guard at the scene of the attack in the Afghanistan capital. Shi'ite Muslims are celebrating the Ashura festival and the mosque was packed . Mourning: A police officer moves to stop an Afghan woman as she tries to find her loved ones after the blast . Guard: Police tape blocks off the bomb site in Kabul. There was also a second blast in Mazar-i-Sharif, which killed four people . Among the victims the body of a woman, clutching a dead child in each arm, was sprawled along a dirt road littered with shoes and bloodstained clothing, while survivors with blood-smeared faces screamed  for help. Religiously motivated attacks on minority Shiite Muslims, who make up about 20 per cent of the country’s 30 million people, are rare in Afghanistan. The country’s Ministry of Interior blamed the Taliban and ‘terrorists’ for the blasts. President Hamid Karzai said the Kabul attack was unprecedented. He said it was ‘the first time that on such an important religious day in Afghanistan terrorism of that horrible nature is  taking place. Anguish: An Afghan man is comforted by relatives outside a hospital after the suicide bomber struck this morning . Secular: A man with a head injury after the explosive went off. The bomber detonated his device as people stood queuing to get into the shrine . Rescue: A man carries an injured victim from the bomb blast at a shrine on the river in Kabul .

"Ryan Brunn lived and worked at same apartment complex where the girl disappeared . Body of Jorelys Rivera found brutally disfigured in dumpster on Monday . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:39 AM on 8th December 2011 . The 20-year-old man arrested today in connection with the killing of a seven-year-old girl lived and worked at the same apartment complex where she disappeared. Ryan Brunn was a maintenance worker at the complex and tips from the public led investigators to him, investigators said. Jorelys Rivera was abducted, stabbed and sexually assaulted before her body . was thrown in a bin at the complex in Canton, Georgia. Autopsy results showed the girl died of blows to the head. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Ryan Brunn, 20, worked at the apartment complex where the body of Jorelys Rivera, seven, was found in Canton, Georgia . Picture of innocence: The body of seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera was found sexually assaulted and beaten to death in a dumpster near her home after she went missing on Friday evening . Brunn doesn't have a criminal history  but Georgia Bureau of Investigation director Vernon Keenan told reporters: 'We are confident that Brunn is the killer and that is why he is in custody.' Prior to being arrested on murder charges today at 12.40 pm, Brunn had been under surveillance. Jorelys Rivera was last seen on Friday evening at 5pm leaving a playground at her apartment complex. The chief investigator into the death of Jorelys Rivera was so distraught over the girl's wounds he refused to describe them yesterday. The . seven-year-old girl, whose body was found in a Georgia dumpster, was . bludgeoned, sexually assaulted and stabbed in a particularly vicious . attack by a killer who police believe lives in her apartment complex. Keenan said Brunn had keys to both the empty apartment and the trash compactor bin where Rivera's body was placed. Tip off: Ryan McCabe Brunn, 20, in his police mugshot today (left) and after he was charged in connection with the death of seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera (right) In custody: Ryan Brunn (with an unidentified friend) does not have a criminal record said police . Suspect: Ryan Brunn was arrested over the death of Jorelys Rivera, seven. Veteran detectives struggled to speak about her death because the injuries she suffered were so severe . The wounds to her body were so severe Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan would not give any details. Mr Keenan would only say she had . blunt force trauma to the head and stab wounds and that the crime as a . 'very horrific and brutal murder.' Brunn's Facebook page, which was public but has since been taken down, said he is originally from Brooklyn and speaks both Spanish and English. The information section said: 'Hello! I'm Ryan I live in Canton GA I have a wonderful Life/Family/Friends. Im very outgoing not shy at all so if ya wanna get to no me hit me up. :-)' Recent entries were filled with sports references. The last post on November 28, read: 'Gettin off here bout to eat some PIZZA! Hit me up! Lets go GIANTS.' In an entry dated July 6, Brunn appeared to be commenting on the July 5 Casey Anthony acquittal. He appeared to have moved to Canton on November 5, which he refers to as 'moving day' on Facebook.""Not ready to go but i got to,"" he wrote. ""Im gonna miss yall/Dahlonega... I Love yall hit me up n we'll do something sometime.. Got my own place now. :-)"" Investigators are working to piece together Brunn's back story. Police said the girl was taken to a . vacant apartment where she was sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten . to death. The killer then threw Jorelys Rivera's brutally disfigured body into a trash bin near her home in Canton, Georgia where it was found by police. It came about 60 to 90 minutes after she disappeared, he said. This was a very calculated and planned crime,’ Keenan said. 'A child who dies under extreme violence is absolutely the worst thing that can happen to a human being.' DNA evidence had been collected from the . child's body and the vacant apartment. Rivera was last seen on Friday afternoon, and her body was discovered around 12.30 pm on Monday. Police and volunteers had spent the weekend combing the area around the apartment complex playground where she was last seen. At the time of her disappearance, the child was being looked after by a teenage babysitter along with her two siblings. She had left the park to go and collect . drinks from home for her friends, and disappeared between the playground . and her home at the River Ridge Apartments. Brunn began working for the apartment . complex last month, according to residents and his Facebook page. He . had previously lived in Dahlonega, Georgia, and Dumfries, Virginia. Captured: Brunn was arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera of Canton, Georgia after she disappeared after leaving a play park on Friday evening . Grim task: Investigators comb through piles of garbage from a trash container where the body of 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera was found . His mother, Karen-Ann Whiteley, filed for bankruptcy last month. She lives in Dahlonega, about 50 miles northeast of Canton where the killing happened. In July, when Florida resident Casey Anthony was acquitted on charges she killed her daughter, Brunn wrote on Facebook that Anthony will 'get hers'. Nancy Hudgins, 57, who lives near trash bin where Rivera's body was found, said she talked with Brunn on Monday as police searched apartments in the complex for clues. She said Brunn told her that he was nervous about allowing officers into his apartment because he had beer bottles and is not of legal drinking age. 'He was just kind of scared about them going in,' she said. Autopsy: The little girl died from a blunt head trauma an hour after she went missing while on her way to collect drinks for her friends . Taken: Police believe she was then taken to an empty apartment, sexually abused and beaten before being dumped in the trash . Distraught: Jorelys' mother Joselin had appealed for her daughter's safe return . Police had sent several Coca-Cola . cans found nearby for forensic testing to see if these are the drinks . that the child had gone to collect for her friends. Jorelys' mother Joselin Rivera had made . an emotional plea for her return and her father, who lives in Florida, . had flown to the city in Cherokee County. A friend translated for Spanish-speaking Mrs Rivera to local TV station 11alive.com. She said her daughter was 'friendly, sweet, had lots of friends and everyone just loved her'. Keenan said investigators have . received numerous tips from the public and said valuable evidence has . come from residents at the apartment complex. Several sex offenders living at the complex have been identified and interviewed, Keenan said. But he added: ‘We have no reason to believe, at this point, that sex offenders are involved.’ About 65 local, state and federal . investigators are working on the case and several hundred interviews . have been conducted, authorities said. Maria Rodriguez, a former resident of the apartment complex, said she works with Jorelys' mother at a nearby poultry plant. Remembered: Children who lived near Jorelys pay respect to her in the park . Vigil: Neighbours and friends meet on the playground where Jorelys Rivera was last seen alive in Canton, Georgia to hold a candlelit vigil and leave gifts . ‘She was a very sweet girl,’ Rodriguez . said as she held her own four-year-old daughter. ‘She was the type of . little girl who likes her presence to be known. It's just so sad.’ Police have removed two other young children from the Rivera home over ‘concern about the supervision of Jorelys,’ said Lt. Jay Baker with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department. A prayer vigil was held late Monday at the playground, where people left flowers, balloons and stuffed animals at a makeshift memorial for Jorelys. Eerie: Authorities removed the dumpster in which the seven-year-old was found to a nearby field to search for evidence .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 4:53 PM on 7th December 2011 . Hero's rest: The ashes of Pearl Harbor survivor Lee Soucy have been interred on the USS Utah, his ship that sank during the attack and still rests in Pearl Harbor . The 70th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack which brought the U.S. into World War Two will take place today - at the exact moment the bombing began. A large ceremony to remember the 2,390 Americans killed in the devastating attack by Japan will take place at 8am Hawaii time. Pearl Harbor was hit by hundreds of Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes launched in two waves from aircraft carriers. Four of the eight U.S. Navy battleships at the base were sunk in the surprise assault, as well as several cruisers, destroyers and anti-aircraft ships. The attack shocked the U.S. as Japan attempted to prevent the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with its plans in Southeast Asia. The following day, December 8, the U.S. declared war on Japan after President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the attack 'a date which will live in infamy'. Previously, the U.S. had pursued a policy of isolationism and kept out of the war. But instead of deterring the U.S. from stopping Japan's plans to expand its empire, the attack galvanised America behind the war and led, ultimately, to the two atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945. Although tensions between Japan and the U.S. had increased and conflict was expected, most thought an attack would come in the Philippines rather than in Hawaii. Most of the 12 ships that sank or were beached during the two-hour attack on December 7, 1941, have since been removed from the harbor, their metal hulls salvaged for scrap. Only the USS Utah and the USS Arizona remain in the water. Nearly half of those who died were onboard the battleship USS Arizona, which was sunk early in attack by torpedo bombers with the loss of 1,177 of its 1,400 crew. Memorial: Mr Soucy's ceremony is one of five being held this week for servicemen who lived through the assault and want their remains placed in Pearl Harbor . Later service: A larger ceremony to remember all those who perished will be held this morning, just before 8 a.m. Hawaii time when the attack began . Pride: Eleven members of Mr Soucy's family, including his three children, several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, attended the sunset ceremony . Hero: A pharmacist mate, in 1941 Mr Soucy took care of the sick and wounded for two days straight following the December 7 attack . The USS Arizona Memorial, built over the remains of the ship, now forms a centrepiece of the World War Two Valor int he Pacific National Monument. Veterans, relatives and dignitaries will bow their heads for a moment of silence at 7.55am local time - the time the attack began - as military jets soar overhead in a 'missing-man' formation. Guided-missile destroyer USS Chung-Hoon will render a salute to the fallen crew of the Arizona, and more than 100 Pearl Harbor survivors - many of them in their late 80s - will end the morning service with a 'walk of honor'. Inspired: Mr Soucy decided to have part of his ashes buried inside his former battleship after visiting Pearl Harbor for the 65th anniversary in 2006 . Seven of the last known 18 survivors from USS Arizona will be present. Mal Middlesworth, former president of the National Pearl Harbor Survivors' Association, estimates there are around 2,700 Pearl Harbor veterans still alive. One of them, Lou Gore, describes being confronted by pandemonium after he rushed on deck as an 18-year-old during the attack. He was confronted by flames shooting skyward, roiling clouds of dark, acrid smoke and swarms of fighter-bombers buzzing low overhead as he emerged on the deck of the USS Phoenix. He said: 'We didn't know (at first) those were Japanese planes. We didn't know what was happening. I just did my job.' The 88-year-old's vessel was anchored a short distance from a stretch of the harbor known as Battleship Row, where the Arizona was moored when it was hit. Mr Gore said: 'I'll never forget watching the... USS Arizona battleship jumping up out of the water, landing and rolling on its side. 'There were bodies everywhere. Brooms floating in the water, canisters. 'I'm grateful to still be alive. So many lost their lives for no reason... I wish I had been able to save more.' Veterans of the attack have been laid to rest in the wrecks of the ships they once served in or in the waters of the harbor. This year, five memorials will be held for servicemen who lived through the assault and wanted their remains placed in Pearl Habor out of pride and affinity for those they left behind. Among them was Lee Soucy, 90, whose ashes were taken in a small urn and placed in a porthole of his ship, the USS Utah, during a service yesterday. Mr Soucy, the youngest of seven children, was a pharmacist's mate and was trained to care for the sick and wounded. He had just finished his breakfast on that fated morning when he saw planes dropping bombs on airplane hangars. Promise: The other half of Mr Soucy's remains will be laid to rest with his wife, as originally planned, at a church in Utah . Defense: Mr Soucy swam to shore during the attack and made a makeshift first aid center to help the wounded and dying as the USS Arizona went down . History: The ashes of three other survivors will be scattered in the harbor Wednesday morning . He rushed to his battle station after feeling the Utah lurch, but soon heard the call to abandon ship as the vessel began sinking. Mr Soucy swam to shore, where he set up a makeshift first aid center to help the wounded and dying and worked straight through for two days. The Utah lost nearly 60 men and around 50 of those are still entombed in the anti-aircraft ship. Today, the rusting hill of the Utah sits on its side next to Ford Island - not far from where it sank 70 years ago. Margaret Soucy, his daughter, said her parents had initially planned to have their ashes interred together at their church in Plainview, Texas. But he changed his mind after visiting Pearl Harbor in for the 65th anniversary in 2006. Later ceremony: An urn carrying the ashes of Vernon Olsen, who was among 334 on the Arizona to survive, will be interred in a gun turret on the vessel today . USS Arizona: Seen in 2002, the battleship rests beneath the sea, visible from above and to visitors who come to pay their respects to the 843 who died . on the battleship in 1941 . USS Utah: The rusting battleship is seen off Ford Island, lost nearly 60 men, about 50 of whom are still entombed in the sunken battleship . She said: 'He announced that he wanted to be interred on the Utah. And my mother looked a little hurt and perplexed. 'And I said, ""don't worry Daddy, I'll take that part of your ashes that was your mouth and I'll have those interred on the Utah"". 'And you can then tell those that have preceded you, including those that were entombed, what's been going on in the world. 'And the rest of your remains we will put with mother in the church gardens at St. Mark's. 'And then my sister spoke up and said, ""yes, then mother can finally rest in peace,""' she said. Mr Soucy's three children, several grandchildren and great-grandchildren - 11 in total - attended the sunset ceremony yesterday. Remains: All but two of the 12 ships that sank or were beached that day were removed from the harbor, their metal hulls salvaged for scrap . Stricken: The USS West Virginia battleship burns as it sinks in Pearl Harbor. Some 2,390 Americans were killed in the surprise attack on December 7, 1941 . Base: A satellite image showing Pearl Harbor as it is now. The yellow box shows where the USS Arizona Memorial is located . The remains of Vernon Olsen, who was among the 335 to survive the attack on the Arizona, will be interred in a gun turret on the ship this afternoon. Mr Olsen died in April at the age of 91 after a bout of pneumonia. Pearl Harbor internment and ash scattering ceremonies began in the late 1980s, and started growing in number as more survivors heard about them. To date, 265 survivors of the attack have been buried or laid to rest there.","Ceremony to commemorate 2,390 killed in 1941 attack will take place at 8am Hawaii time (6pm GMT)

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 9:19 AM on 7th December 2011 . 'Systematically bullied': Sarah Mulvey was found dead by her boyfriend at their North London home after she had taken a drug overdose . A high-flying Channel 4 executive overdosed on drugs after she was 'systematically bullied' by her bosses, a coroner heard yesterday. Sarah Mulvey, 34, who made programmes such as Ten Years Younger, Brat Camp and How To Look Good Naked with Gok Wan, was in a state of 'acute stress'. After difficulties at work she sought treatment at the £10,000-per-week Causeway retreat. But the Oxford graduate went into a severe decline at the clinic in Osea Island, Essex, used by stars such as Amy Winehouse. It is believed that while staying there she obtained the drugs she later used to kill herself. Sarah's boyfriend Mark Gillett discovered her dead in their £350,000 two-bedroom rented flat in Hampstead, North London, in January last year after she had taken an overdose. Her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, told the inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court that treatment had 'made matters worse' for Sarah. When asked why she had gone to the Causeway, Dr Mulvey, a mathematician at Sussex University, replied: 'She had been systematically bullied by her bosses at Channel 4.' But he was stopped by coroner Dr Andrew Reid who said that Channel 4 had not been listed as interested parties. Tragedy: Sarah Mulvey, 34, right, had been trated at the Causeway, a celebrity clinic in Essex . Grief: Sarah Mulvey's boyfriend Mark Gillett pictured at the inquest. He found her dead at their flat in Hampstead, North London . It was recognised that the commissioning editor was off sick, and was in redundancy and grievance negotiations with her bosses. Paul . Spencer, representing the Mulvey family, said that she had mentioned . the year-long bullying to clinicians and it 'potentially led to the . circumstances of her death'. Dr . Reid said that the cause of her death in January last year had been . established as opiate toxicity, and questioned where she might have got . the drugs. Sarah's father said there was 'evidence from a number of her friends that at the Causeway there was 'a fairly easy access to the drugs that were held, presumably for clinical use.' Dr Mulvey said: 'In April 2009 she was working absolutely full pelt. She was an extremely hard worker because she loved her job. 'She was able to function in a high-achieving way right up to the point when she said ""Enough, I have to take some time out and I need to take it somewhere where I can have treatment to help me recover as quickly as possible so I can return to the job I love"".' Celebrity rehab: The Causeway on a . remote island off the Essex coast was closed down in May . Commissioning editor: The TV executive worked on How To Look Good Naked with Gok Wan (centre). Each episode sees the stylist boost the body image of a different woman while a team of experts offer health and beauty advice . Brat Camp: The teenage reality TV show, which ran for just one series, was another programme Sarah worked on . Jean Mulvey, Sarah's mother, outside St Pancras Coroners' Court in London . The inquest was told that after spending four months at the Causeway she was asked to leave. Her father added that she was in a 'terrible state'. She was allowed to return home after being assessed by NHS mental health teams in North London. Dr . Mulvey said Sarah had been suffering from stress since early 2008 as a . result of the 'unpredictable and aggressive working situation' she . experienced at Channel 4. Brendan Quinn, a registered nurse and director of the clinic which has since been closed and been fined for not having registration, denied that Miss Mulvey had 'stockpiled' the drugs she overdosed on when at the clinic. He said staff were 'highly qualified', they also had 'robust' measures to ensure drugs were administered properly. Miss Mulvey was a problem patient who had 'categorically refused' to leave despite the advice of staff, he added. The inquest was adjourned for further investigations to see whether the clinic had access to drugs which the television executive could have stockpiled. The case will resume early in the new year. A spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'We feel very deeply for Sarah’s family and partner at this difficult time. 'Sarah’s tragic death shocked and saddened everyone who knew her at Channel 4. 'Since then we have worked with the Mulvey family to support them and to celebrate Sarah’s career and achievements. 'As the inquest has been adjourned until 2012 and it would not be appropriate for us to comment any further at this time.'","Sarah Mulvey's father says she had been suffering from stress because of 'unpredictable and aggressive' working situation .

"By . Ben Todd, Sara Nathan and Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 6:48 PM on 7th December 2011 . Shaken up: Tamara Ecclestone claims she is being blackmailed by someone threatening to reveal details of her relationship with an unnamed man . Police are investigating an attempt to blackmail socialite Tamara Ecclestone. The alleged blackmailer threatened to reveal details of a relationship between the daughter of billionaire Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and an unidentified man unless she paid a ‘tidy sum’, according to a source. The amount involved could be as much as six figures, the source added. Metropolitan Police officers are investigating the suspected blackmail attempt after Miss Ecclestone, 27, reported an alleged ‘inappropriate communication’ on Monday. One source told the Mail: ‘Tamara has been really shaken up by all this. ‘It has been a huge weight on her mind so she decided she had no option but to go to the police.’ Miss Ecclestone’s 82-year-old father is estimated to be worth £2.5billion. He recently bought her a £45million house on one of London’s most desirable streets in Kensington. Miss Ecclestone is having £18million of renovations carried out on the 55-room property. These include installing an underground nightclub, bowling alley, beauty salon and a dog spa for her five pets. Other additions will be a vast dressing room to store her wardrobe – and £500,000 handbag collection – and a vehicle lift for her supercars. Miss Ecclestone recently admitted her lavish lifestyle made her a ‘prime target’ for criticism in gloomy economic times, but claimed she was ‘like any other girl’. Desirable: The £18million renovation of Miss Ecclestone's £45million mansion in Kensington, London, was featured in the Channel 5 series Billion Dollar Girl . She said: ‘People assume I’m a monster, have no emotions, and bad things haven’t happened to me. ‘I’m vulnerable like every other girl in the world – good days, bad days.’ In . August, her younger sister Petra, 23, was married in a £12million . extravaganza in Italy paid for by Mr Ecclestone and his ex-wife, former . Armani model Slavica, the mother of both heiresses. Miss . Ecclestone, whose parents divorced in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, . recently featured in the Channel 5 series Billion Dollar Girl, a . three-part documentary detailing her extravagant life. She has been dating stockbroker Omar . Khyami, 37, since last year. She recently told how he had already agreed . to sign a prenuptial agreement if they married. Putting worries aside: Tamara shrugged off the threat today to help raise money for ICAPís 19th annual global Charity Day . She said: ‘We have talked about it [a . prenup]. I’ve never brought it up, but when my sister’s wedding came . round, Omar said he would want that, which is so nice.’ A . Metropolitan Police spokesman said yesterday: ‘On Monday December 5 . police from Kensington and Chelsea borough received a complaint . regarding an inappropriate communication relating to the release of . personal information. ‘The . allegation was assessed and is now being investigated at this early . stage as blackmail. CID in Kensington and Chelsea are investigating. ‘No one has been arrested.

"By . Katherine Faulkner and Andy Dolan . Created 11:35 PM on 6th December 2011 . Fatal infection: Harry Mould died four days after he was admitted to hospital . A five-year-old asthma sufferer admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties died within five days after a string of shortcomings, an inquest heard. Harry Mould’s family claim he was not checked enough by overworked staff or given medication when he needed it. He was so breathless on admission that he had to be given oxygen and treated with nebulisers, which turn liquid drugs into a spray to be more easily inhaled. The inquest heard the ‘gifted and talented’ boy, from Greenleys, Buckinghamshire, initially seemed to improve after being given the nebulisers every hour. Consultant Abraham Oommen then changed this to using an inhaler. He said he observed Harry for ‘about 15-20 minutes’ before his decision in March 2009. The doctor also did not order an X-ray for a suspected chest infection. He admitted Harry, who died of a respiratory infection, ‘did not receive the treatment he should have’ Consultant paediatrician Oommen said: 'The general impression was that he seemed to be improving. 'He was alert, he seemed quite comfortable. 'He seemed reasonably well. 'I was speaking to his mother about (Harry) going home.' He said he had ordered Harry to be treated every two hours with an inhaler, but  Donald Coutts-Wood, the Deputy Coroner for Leicester City and South Lincolnshire,  pointed out: 'it doesn't say that anywhere in the notes', which  recorded that Harry should have the treatment ever four hours. When asked by Mr Coutts-Wood why he did not keep Harry on the nebulisers, Dr  Oommen replied: ‘I thought he was an older child who would cope well with an  inhaler. It can be seen as a more gentle treatment.' The consultant said he arranged for Harry to  be reviewed again by a colleague at 3pm, although the coroner again pointed out  that 'this was not documented anywhere.' The colleague found Harry 'did not look as well as he had that morning' and had needed to be given oxygen to breathe. Harry was then put back on the nebuliser treatment. By 6pm, Harry was assessed as needing ‘frequent’ observations from medics, but  was not seen again until 9pm. Dr Oommen agreed that he ‘would have expected more’ than three-hourly  observations of the boy, given his condition. The court heard Dr Oommen also prescribed a course of antibiotics over a  ‘suspicion’ Harry had a chest infection, but did not order a chest X-ray to investigate this further. As Harry’s condition worsened, the court heard he needed four doses from the nebuliser over a three-hour period, but only received three. Pathologist Dr David O'Neil told the hearing the youngster had at some point  during his treatment suffered a brain injury, which could have caused Harry to  not respond to treatment as well as he should. The inquest, which is expected to last 14 days, continues. Speaking before the hearing began, Harry’s parents, Lee, a data engineer, and  Odette, both 33, described him as a ‘lovely boy, our little ray of sunshine. Mrs Mould has since had another son, Isaac, aged 18-months.","Harry Mould was so breathless on admission he had to be given oxygen and treated with nebulisers .

"Said that the year she was a contestant 'everyone was really gagging for it.' 'Dancing is a very flirtatious sexual thing. Every year somebody gets together!' On X Factor rivalry: 'I actually don't think the public give a sh**.' By . Holly Thomas . Last updated at 7:53 AM on 6th December 2011 . She's a picture of professionalism when on duty as a judge during BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. But normally cool and composed Alesha Dixon lost control a little after she was offered a glass of wine on Alan Carr's Chatty Man last night. As she worked her way through the rest of the bottle, the star offered her- extremely frank- . thoughts on Strictly romances, the X Factor, and whether dancers are . better in bed over the course of the rambunctious interview. Loosening up: Normally cool and composed Alesha Dixon lost control a little after she was offered a glass of wine on Alan Carr's Chatty Man last night with Strictly fellow judges Craig Revel Horwood and Brunmo Tonioli . Things kicked off when Bruno accepted . Alan's offer of a rosé, quipping 'Oh if you twist my arm', before . admitting 'I'm anybodies after two glasses.' Alesha took her generous helping with a civilised 'that looks lovely', while Craig demurred 'if it's the rosé'. However things took a turn for the tipsy when Alesha let the boys shoulder most of the burden at the start of the interview, sipping steadily away as she sat between them. The first sign of high spirits came when Alan asked the threesome how close they were to getting Pippa Middleton onto the show. Can I tempt you? Everyone on Alan Carr's sofa was keen to quench their thirst . Alesha emitted a gleeful cackle, leaning back into the chair before agreeing enthusiastically to Bruno's suggestion that Alan should appear on Strictly. Alesha admitted that she thought a 'boy could win this year', candidly saying 'The reality is, all the girls really like Harry.' When Alan said that he felt sorry for aging dancer Anton de Beke Alesha, who'd nearly finished her tall glass of wine within a few minutes - interrupted with 'I don't' before bursting into yet more giggles. Getting into her stride: Alesha drank the bulk of her first glass within minutes . She then plunged into juicier territory, declaring: 'Everybody is really frisky on the show though, you've got to be honest.' She continued: 'Everybody is horny - the year I was a contestant everyone was really gagging for it' - at which point Bruno removed her now empty glass from her hand, exclaiming 'no more drink for you!' Alan gasped 'This is chat show gold!', frantically grabbing the bottle to refill her glass. Going to your head? Alesha was unable to stop laughing as her wine took effect . Two steps ahead, Alesha snapped 'give me the bottle'- seizing it with one hand and taking a long swig- lasting several seconds. As Bruno and Craig collapsed with laughter Alesha picked up where the conversation had left off. The audience still clapping, she ploughed on: 'As I was saying, eight to ten hours a day, rubbing up next to each other, of course you're going to get a bit frisky!' Take it away! Bruno removed Alesha's glass as things started getting rowdier . Alan then pointed at Bruno, exclaiming 'look, he's touching  himself!' - to which the Italian replied: 'I can't help it, she gets me going!' Bruno then commented on Alesha's claim, saying 'I've done it for nine years and I've never seen any boner.' Alesha immediately rebuffed him, saying 'dancing is a very flirtatious sexual thing. Every year somebody gets together!' 'This is chat show gold!': Alan couldn't wait to pour Alesha another glass as her answers became increasingly graphic . She then contradicted herself, backtracking 'Well no-one this year, although there's always a rumour. I've not heard anyone this year. Boring.' Alan then asked them whether they thought that good dancers are better in bed - to which Alesha enthusiastically replied: 'Well I should think so Alan!' At this, Bruno removed the (nearly empty) bottle from her hand, and Alan showed the group a unbelievably raunchy clip from the Argentinian version of Strictly Come Dancing. Throwing herself into the debate: Alesha said that the problem with X Factor is 'they focus too much on the drama, and everything else other the singing' His tipsiest guest was stunned into a brief moment of calm by the sight of contestants across the pond gyrating naked on stage, but it wasn't long before she was back on exuberant form. When Alan mentioned X Factor, Alesha gave a little victory jiggle, before diplomatically commenting 'I don't understand why we can't just enjoy both shows, I actually don't think the public give a sh**. It's the producers and the media. The public will just sky plus one and watch it later, they don't care.' Alan commended her saying 'I can't believe Alesha's become the voice of reason after a whole bottle of wine!' Rude not to! Alesha enthusiastically accepted Alan's offer of the whole bottle . He may have spoken too soon however, as Alesha continued 'The problem is Al, they focus too much on the drama, and everything else other the singing.' Alan intercepted with 'You see at this point you've crossed the line from being a fun drunk to a violent one'. Alesha took this in good humour, laughing uproariously once again before excusing herself 'you know what it is, I just feel like I'm at home with my mates having a gossip'. Telling it like it is: When Alan asked whether dancers are better in bed Alesha immediately replied 'Well I should think so Alan!' She then added: 'It's swings and roundabouts, next year they'll be beating us, the year after we'll beat them, who cares! Jog on Christmas.' At this Bruno laughed 'If you can't beat them, join them, and downed his own drink. A more bashful Alesha later took to Twitter  to excuse her uncharacteristic behaviour. She wrote: 'Apologies for being pickled on Alan Carr! I did have fun though!' 'I am officially a light weight and clearly a cheap date!!! :) xxx'","Said that the year she was a contestant 'everyone was really gagging for it.'

"By . Rob Cooper and Arthur Martin . Last updated at 9:28 AM on 7th December 2011 . Accused: Mundill Mahil is accused of luring her ex-boyfriend to her flat in Brighton where she was attacked. She denies murder . A medical student ordered two ‘gangster friends’ to kill a ‘besotted’ television executive in revenge after he tried to rape her, a court heard yesterday. Mundill Mahil, 20, lured millionaire Gagandip Singh to her house, where he was beaten unconscious then bundled into the boot of a car and burned alive, the jury was told. She allegedly told friends she wanted Mr Singh dead – and, the court heard, persuaded another man who was infatuated with her to murder him. Mr Singh, 21, was killed in February, after the ‘intelligent and attractive young woman’ convinced him, through a series of  text messages, to come to her student digs in Brighton at 11pm, the jury was told. But when he walked into her bedroom, carrying a teddy bear and flowers, he found Harvinder Shoker – who was also in love with Mahil – and ‘hired muscle’ Darren Peters waiting for him, the court heard. During the beating Mr Singh – the owner of a new broadcasting service called Sikh TV – screamed Mahil’s name and begged for help, it was claimed. The two men, both 20, wrapped the victim in Mahil’s duvet and bundled him into the boot of the Mercedes he arrived in, then drove to a quiet street in Blackheath, south-east London, doused the car in petrol and set it alight, the Old Bailey was told. A post mortem examination revealed Mr Singh was still alive when the fire was started. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told the jury that the attack was carried out to ‘exact revenge and retribution’ on Mr Singh, whom Mahil knew ‘remained besotted by her’. ‘At the heart of this case there lies some unattractive and raw human emotions at work,’ he said. Mahil, of Chatham in Kent, Shoker, of Greenwich, south-east London, and Peters, of Blackheath, all deny murder. ‘Gagandip Singh was plainly, on the evidence, besotted with her,’ Prosecutor . Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors of the relationship that began in 2009. Murdered: Gagandip Singh, 21, was in a car that was set on fire . He . wooed her with gifts, while she provided him with emotional support - . particularly when his father was murdered on a visit to India in . September 2009 - and would spend hours chatting with him on the phone . and internet, the court heard. Gagandip's father's . packaging business had been turning over more than £2million year when money started going missing from the firm. His accountant was based in India and the father went to investigate but was murdered there. His son took over the firm and also started the Sikh TV channel on Sky. However Gagandip's relationship with his . girlfriend Mahil broke down in August 2010 after Mr Singh 'attempted to . rape' her in her student house. A housemate, Becky Edwards, . described Mahil as an 'agony aunt' and said: 'During our first year she . talked to him about very intimate, personal things. 'He was a millionaire who offered her . lots of gifts which she refused. After his father died they became . closer and he was dependent on her.' But Mr Jafferjee said the attempted rape changed everything. He said: ‘It is common ground that he tried to have sex with her by getting into her bed. ‘Both were to describe it as an attempted rape - although in fact her description of events, even to her friends, suggest it did not get as far as that. ‘It is common ground that he tried to have sex with her by getting into her bed.' ‘She forced him away, he broke down in tears and he left.’ Mahil became increasingly upset and angry, and spurned Mr Singh’s attempts to strike up further contact with her, jurors were told. She became so resentful that after the attempted rape she referred to him only as s***face,' the court heard. 'That she disliked him intensely there can be little doubt,' the barrister said. 'She can be extremely manipulative. She knew that he was completely besotted by her and would jump at the . chance of contact with her.' At the same time, she also began a relationship with Shoker, who Mr Jafferjee told jurors was also ‘besotted’ with her. ‘She told her housemates about how on . occasions certain of her male friends, which she referred to as gangster . friends, wished to exact revenge and retribution on him (Mr Singh) but . that she would discourage it,’ he added. Tributes: Flowers next to the charred tree where the dead body of Gagindip Singh was found in the boot of a burnt out car . ‘Unfortunately . by February this year, far from discouraging anyone from harming him, . she lured him to Brighton, suggesting a meeting at the same house at . 11pm.’ The victim was both ‘excited’ and ‘wary’, he said, adding: ‘He . asked her whether she was sure this was such a good idea.’ Mr Jafferjee added: ‘On February 25 he drove down in his sister’s Mercedes. ‘But laying in wait for him in the basement of the house, where her bedroom was, were Ravi and Darren Peters. ‘He had no idea what lay in store for him. He was attacked and beaten unconscious. ‘He . was then wrapped up in Mahil’s duvet and carried by Ravi and Peters and . dumped in the boot of the Mercedes he had arrived in.’ After the car had been driven to Blackheath it was set on fire with Mr Singh still in the boot. ‘Petrol was poured on to the car, including onto him as he lay either still unconscious or on any view completely helpless inside the boot,’ said Mr Jafferjee. ‘It is scientifically clear beyond any doubt that he was still alive at that point. ‘The car was then set alight with him in the boot and that is how his life was ended.’ The prosecutor added that Mahil was key to the killing and initiated it. 'Her . role was central. If she had agreed to lure him to Brighton that . fateful evening the deceased would have been safe and alive today,' Mr . Jafferjee said. 'No-one else had the ability to get the deceased to a place where he was completely vulnerable.' ‘It is scientifically clear beyond any doubt that he was still alive at that point. The car was then set alight with him in the boot and that is how his life was ended.’ Her new boyfriend, Shoker, 'almost certainly had his own agenda and it was not of the righteous crusader protecting a young woman's virtue,' the barrister added. 'He being besotted with her was more than happy to get rid of Gagandip.' Peters was hired to help deal with the victim who was one grade below black belt at Taekwondo, the court heard. 'Mahil was the person who lured the victim into the trap that had been laid,' Mr Jafferjee said. 'Peters and Ravi were the hired muscle who would draw this plan to its awful conclusion.' Housemate Live Thorsen said on the night of the killing she saw sobbing Mahil coming up from the basement. 'She was shaking with tears in her eyes. She was very traumatised. She said ""He's been here."" She said she had a flashback (to the attempted rape) on seeing his face. 'I could hear noise coming from down the stairs. It was very loud like someone was trying to tear the house down. It was a loud fight.' Mahil told her she had asked Mr Singh to come to the house and he had turned up with a teddy bear for her. 'She said that she was told to get him into the house and get him downstairs and then open the door to her room and then run upstairs. 'She described how once she had opened the door they had leapt straight on him and she remained on the stairs unable to move. 'The deceased had been screaming her name asking for help, but she couldn't bring herself to help.' Later Mahil told her the two men were taking the victim to the car, the court heard. The trial continues.","Gagandip Singh, 21, beaten, put in a car, driven to London and set on fire .

"By . Jaya Narain . Last updated at 1:33 AM on 7th December 2011 . When wheelchair-bound grandmother Kay Ennis saw a young man spitting on the pavement as they waited at a bus stop she decided to give him a piece of her mind. But the dressing down turned into a furious row which ended with the  58-year-old driving over the man’s foot in her electric wheelchair. Police were called and Mrs Ennis was charged with assault. Ordeal: Kay Ennis was charged with assault after berating a man who had spat on the pavement . Yesterday, the frail grandmother, who is recovering from a brain haemorrhage that has left her with poor sight and partially deaf, condemned the decision to take the matter to court, where she was given a  12-month conditional discharge. After pleading guilty only because she wanted to avoid going through a trial, she said: ‘Driving over someone’s foot in an electric wheelchair could hardly be called an assault. It is ridiculous.’ The incident happened last December as Mrs Ennis was  waiting to board a bus in Walkden, near Manchester. Shahan Hannan, 25, was waiting with his girlfriend, Amy Budgen, 23, when he spat on the pavement. Outraged, Mrs Ennis, from Walkden, remonstrated with Mr  Hannan. She said: ‘All I did was ask the man to stop spitting. It was making me feel sick.’ Mrs Ennis said she had just taken her anti-epilepsy medication, which she relies on to prevent her having fits and losing consciousness. She said: ‘I didn’t want to be sick. If I am sick, I don’t know how much medication I have in me. The last time it happened I ended up in a coma. I felt really scared.’ Foot 'attack': Kay Ennis, 58, ran over Shahan Hannan's foot at a bus stop on this road in Walkden . Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard that after Mrs Ennis ran over Mr Hannan’s foot, the grandmother allegedly slapped Miss Budgen’s face. Austin Welsh, defending, told the court that Mrs Ennis accepted running over Mr Hannan – who claimed he was spitting to clear his throat – but that she had merely pushed his partner away when she got too close during the confrontation. Sentencing Mrs Ennis, Judge  Jeffrey Lewis said: ‘I am sure everyone concerned wishes that the clock could be turned back.’ Mrs Ennis said: ‘The ordeal has dragged on for a year and had a really bad effect on my health. ‘This didn’t need to go to court – I’m not some sort of criminal.’","Kay Ennis, 58, says 'It's ridiculous I was even charged with assault. I was on my own and scared to death'
