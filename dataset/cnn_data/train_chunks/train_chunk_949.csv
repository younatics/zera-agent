"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . These jaw-dropping pictures show the moment a bright flash of lightning strikes through the center of an eerie, UFO-shaped cloud. The unusual clouds filled the skyline over farmland near Broken Bow, Nebraska, during an incredible supercell thunderstorm. Freelance photographer Vanessa Neufield, 36, couldn't believe her luck when she caught the amazing lightning strike on camera. A huge bolt of lightning flashes through the center of a tremendous supercell storm over farmlands in Nebraska . The bizarre UFO-shaped phenomenon is created by a rapid updraft of warm air, which creates a cyclone with winds as fast as 170mph . Ms Neufield, from Calgary in Alberta, Canada, said: 'Getting the shot through the clouds was luck and great timing. 'The lightning was very consistent and I just set my camera up at a nice exposure for the natural light on the event of a strike. 'Then I got very lucky.' The unusual shaped clouds are part of a low precipitation supercell storm where updrafts of air rotate around a vertical axis, creating UFO-like shapes. The formations last for around 30 to 40 minutes, eventually becoming smaller until they disappear. Ms Neufield said: 'The power of nature fills me with awe. The sun breaks under the monstrous clouds, which were seen by freelance photographer Vanessa Neufield, from Calgary, Alberta, Canada . Ms Neufield said she was just setting up her camera when the lightning struck, and that she 'got lucky' with the jaw-dropping images . Swirling above the farmyards below, the supercell looks like something out of a sci-fi film as it begins to drift away . Supercell storms can happen anywhere in the world, but they are most commonly found in the Midwest of the U.S., as well as the plains areas of South America. 'I'm a photographer so I'm extremely visual and there is nothing more stunning than a storm to me and I'm right in my element then. 'I have seen and photographed many tornadoes but the storms that produce great cloud structure and lightning instead are my favorite. 'Lighting sometimes scares me more than a tornado. 'I usually can't tell how close I'm getting to where the lightning is but I'm usually very careful and have thankfully only had one close call.' A supercell, which is not always a thunderstorm, is a weather phenomenon in which converging low level winds create an updraft which rotates on a vertical axis. This is also known as a mesocyclone. Warm air in the mesocyclone can rise as fast as 170mph. Supercells are known to create large hailstones, damaging winds, and tornadoes, and can last for hours if conditions permit. These kind of storms can take place anywhere in the world, but are most commonly found in the Midwest of the United States, as well as the plains areas of South America.

"By . Alan Baldwin . Formula One championship leader Nico Rosberg felt sore enough at losing Sunday's Italian Grand Prix without then having to face conspiracy theories suggesting he had done it deliberately. The Mercedes driver, who finished second after making a mistake at the first chicane while under pressure from winning team mate Lewis Hamilton, could scarcely believe anyone would suggest such a thing. 'I've heard about that, but what would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately?,' asked the German, who saw his lead cut to 22 points with six races remaining. Winner: Lewis Hamilton gives the thumbs up as Rosberg looks on after giving up his lead at Monza . Wrong turn: Nico Rosberg goes off the track after a mistake which saw him lose first place to Lewis Hamilton . 'There is no possible reason. There is no reason why the team would ask me to change position, or something like that. 'The only thing in people's minds could be Spa, but Spa was a mistake which I've apologised for,' added the German, who hit the back of Hamilton's car on the second lap of the Belgian Grand Prix two weeks ago. Hamilton said after that race that Rosberg had 'done it on purpose' but he was certainly not accusing him of any such intent in Italy. Rosberg accepted blame for the Spa incident, which led to Hamilton's race retirement, and was handed an unspecified punishment from his angry team who reminded their drivers they could race each other but must not make contact on the track. If there were some wondering whether a restitution of points might form part of that penalty, an idea that was discussed and swiftly dismissed by some paddock pundits post-race, the driver and team ridiculed the very thought. Braking point: Rosberg attempts to brake but is forced off the track under pressure from Hamilton . Mistake: Rosberg ran straight on at the chicane on lap 29 to hand the lead to Mercedes team-mate Hamilton . 'It's not something where I have to give back something. Mistakes, errors happen, and that's the way it is, (I make) an apology and on we go,' said Rosberg, who braked late and continued straight on at the chicane. He then had to slow and zig-zag to get back on track. 'It's not like we now start shuffling and things like that, so there is no reason why I would do something like that on purpose,' added Rosberg. Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff found the idea even more mind-boggling after being asked by BBC pundit and former team owner Eddie Jordan. 'I said to Eddie that only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea,' he said. 'I think there was lots of pressure on Nico because Lewis was so quick yesterday and you could see that today as well,' he added, explaining also that Rosberg had to miss the chicane because the alternative was to damage the tyres. Decisive moment: Rosberg denied that he had deliberately given up the lead to his teammate . Pivotal: By the time the German had negotiated the bollards Hamilton had emerged into the lead . Theories: It was suggested that Rosberg gave the place up on purpose after the incident at Spa . That would have entailed another pitstop and lost time. Television images also showed Wolff smiling apparently as Hamilton took the lead after Rosberg's error, providing more fuel for the conspiracy theorists, but he dismissed any suggestion the two things were linked. 'Whoever picks that up and tries to interpret anything in such a picture must be out of his mind,' said the Austrian. 'First of all, it's not live. 'It wasn't synchronised with the picture.' Wolff explained that he had smiled when his two drivers were closing up, with Hamilton chasing down Rosberg, out of a sense of 'here we go again' and anticipation of sparks to come. The footage was then spliced into the live action later. Hamilton had started from pole position on Sunday, with Rosberg second, but fell to fourthÂ at the start after a problem with his car's race start settings .","Rosberg finished second after error on lap 29 .

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists he did not make a mistake resting Raheem Sterling in the defeat to Aston Villa but the teenager will be straight back in the starting line-up for their Champions League opener. Sterling has emerged as a key player for the Reds over the last 10 months but having played 180 minutes in England's two matches last week he was benched for the 1-0 loss to Aston Villa. He was introduced after an hour with Liverpool struggling to break down their opponents but even he could not unlock a resilient Villa rearguard. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Brendan Rodgers reflect on a disappointing result . Raheem Sterling had to settle for a brief appearance on Saturday evening against Aston Villa . Substitute Raheem Sterling had 30 minutes to make an impact at Anfield but failed to deliver . The 19-year-old will be back in the team for Tuesday's visit of Bulgarian outsiders Ludogorets as Rodgers looks to get the club's return to Europe's elite off to a flying start. But the Northern Irishman stressed that did not mean he got it wrong against Villa. 'We have an exciting couple of months and this was a game I felt we could do that,' he said. 'If he didn't have international football then it would have been the case. 'He is a big player for us but we have built a squad here where I have to trust all the players but as a team and a squad we didn't deliver. 'He will certainly play on Tuesday night.' Brendan Rodgers didn't look amused, as he watched from the sidelines at Anfield . Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor scored the only goal of the game in the 9th minute . Liverpool's starting XI contained five summer signings - with midfielder Adam Lallana making his debut after an injury in pre-season - but Rodgers said that was not the reason for defeat. 'We had new players against Tottenham (whom they beat 3-0 before the international break) and we were outstanding,' he said. 'The players we have brought in are very good players and I am delighted with them but we just failed to open them (Villa) up. 'We just lacked that bit of quality. We have seen many games here where we ended up with 15-20 shots on target but that didn't happen.' For some time Liverpool's Achilles heel has been set-pieces and they conceded from another when from an avoidable corner Philippe Senderos's header created enough confusion for Gabriel Agbonlahor to score. Senderos had a couple of opportunities to double their lead in the first half but also escaped punishment for what looked like a kick at Mario Balotelli. Mario Balotelli constantly found himself on the end of rough treatment from Philippe Senderos at Anfield . Raheem Sterling played a starring role in England's win over Switzerland on Monday . After the break Liverpool stepped up the pressure but the closest they came to an equaliser was when Philippe Coutinho curled a shot against the post. Defender Dejan Lovren admits conceding like they did is a painful experience. 'It hurts for everyone, especially for the defence, especially when you see the game and they didn't have many chances,' he told LFC TV. 'They are really good at corners and that was their only chance but we have lost the three points.' Rodgers hopes the return of the Champions League will give his side the chance to bounce back. 'This game has gone and we now have to focus on that,' he said. 'There is nothing better than to get going again on Tuesday night in a competition we love. 'Hopefully we can start that competition with three points.' Brendan Rodgers insisted that leaving Raheem Sterling out of his starting eleven was the right decision . Villa boss Paul Lambert, who has two wins and a draw from his last three visits to Anfield, believes the faith he placed in the club's young talent a couple of years ago is now starting to pay off. 'The young lads are not young any more, they have grown into men and it was a massive three points,' he said after his side went second in the Premier League with their third victory. 'Tom Cleverley (signed on loan from Manchester United) was outstanding, Fabian Delph carried on where he left off the other night (for England) and Ashley Westwood is a lad who is unfairly not spoken about because his performances have been excellent. 'We are only four games in but we have had a fabulous start. Any given day you can win a game but it has been a big start and having lads that are playing at the top of their game certainly helps you.'

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Natasha Calcraft, 29, has told how she tried to save her husband Luke's life after he suffered a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting . The wife of a British Mormon father-of-six killed by a severe reaction to a bee sting has paid tribute to her 'soulmate' and told of how she struggled in vain to save his life. Luke Calcraft, 46, was rushed to hospital after being stung by a bee while cutting down trees in the garden of his family home inÂ Pennsylvania, but died four days later. Now his wife, 29-year-old Natasha, has recalled how she injected her husband with three EpiPens as he went into anaphylactic shock, and performed CPR until an ambulance arrived. The mother-of-two said: 'We were cutting down trees, trying to clear about an acre of land for a garden and at the very end of the day Luke lit a fire to burn all the branches we had chopped down and that is when he was stung. 'He ran over to me and said ""I've been stung in the arm, can you see anything""? 'There was no immediate reaction - but then he got woozy and said ""run and grab my EpiPens"" so I grabbed all three of them and administered the first one and he went unconscious, I administered the second one but he was foaming at the mouth and was struggling to breathe. 'I ran to my neighbour, who is a nurse, and she gave him the third one but he went into anaphylactic shock which caused a cardiac arrest and he started turning purple. 'We tried doing CPR but his throat was so swollen that the air could not get through.' Natasha revealed Luke's extreme allergy to bees and wasps only began affecting him after he moved to America from Chelmsford in late 2011. A previous wasp sting whilst in The States left Luke unconscious for 12 hours on the floor of his bathroom, and a GP later confirmed he had a severe allergy. Luke had been taking a series of venom injections in a bid to build up his immunity but they were not enough to help him. He suffered a severe lack of oxygen for 30 minutes and by the time he had arrived at hospital he was already brain dead. As the days passed at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Luke's condition deteriorated. Scroll down for video . Natasha said she injected Luke with three EpiPens after he was stung cutting down trees in the garden of their family home, but he went into anaphylactic shock and was struggling to breathe . After Natasha was given the devastating news that there was nothing that could be done to save her husband she spent Luke's final days at his bedside, along with her two children. She added: 'I knew from Luke's will that he would not want to remain on life support so we took him off life support and it was within a minute he was gone.' Natasha could not bear to be at Luke's side as the machines keeping him alive were turned off. Natasha said: 'That was not the way I wanted to remember Luke.Â I wanted to remember him alive and well. I have pictures all around the house at times in Luke's life when he was happy - pictures of the family all together. 'That's what I look for to help me remember him. If I focus on the hospital, it is too much. I want to focus on all the good times we had together.' Natasha only married Luke last year following a whirlwind romance after the couple met at the headquarters of Olympus, where Luke was president of the Medical Systems Group. She said: 'It was so crazy - it all happened so fast, between the time we met and then got married and a house. 'Even though we were only married for a year, it felt like we were together for 40 years, that was just how it felt. 'It just all clicked into place really early on in our relationship but because we were both going through divorces, we wanted to be extra cautious. Natasha performed CPR on Luke until an ambulance arrived and took him to hospital, however by the time he arrived he was already declared brain dead . Natasha paid tribute to Luke as a father, saying he treated her two children as if they were his own. She added: 'Not many people are lucky enough to find what me and Luke found in each other' 'Looking back on it, we would have gotten married after a month or so of dating - we knew it was right, it was that soulmate connection. 'Not many people are lucky enough to find what me and Luke found in each other.' Luke has four teenage children from his previous marriage and treated Natasha's two children, Rhonin, four, and Arija, two, as if they were his own. Natasha had Rhonin from her first marriage but a month after she started dating Luke, she discovered she was three months pregnant with Arija - to her ex-husband. She said: 'Most people would have run in the other direction but Luke's response was ""you poor thing, what can I do to support you"". 'That blew me away - that really spoke so much about his character. He really was ""dad"" to them. 'Rhonin has really understood everything. He seems to be coming around and is glad daddy is heaven, but he really is comprehending some complex things. 'My daughter, who is two, she just knows that daddy is gone. 'When people come through the door she will say ""daddy"" and go looking for him, so she has not really comprehended the fact that he is not coming back yet.' She paid tribute to her husband's approach to business which saw the Royal London University graduate rise through the ranks of Olympus during a career spanning nearly a quarter of a century. Natasha said Luke was her 'soulmate', calling him the 'perfect guy' and saying he was always happy . Despite a 17-year age gap between the two, Natasha described her husband as 'young at heart' and said the couple enjoyed days out together, including sightseeing and kayaking . Natasha, a member of the Mormon Church, said her faith is the only thing keeping her going after Luke's death . 'If you were the janitor or if you were the Olympus president in Tokyo, you were the same to Luke. He had such a dynamic personality and everyone at his work warmed to him. 'But he will be missed by as many children as he will adults - kids just gravitated towards him. 'He was always serving people, always happy and he really was the perfect guy. I can't think of a single thing he did wrong - which was the only thing that would frustrate you with him. 'I would ask ""are you ever upset or miserable or do you ever have a bad day"" but he was always so happy and realising how blessed he was compared to others so instead would be looking to see how he could help others.' Despite the age gap of 17 years between the pair, Natasha described her husband as 'young at heart', with the pair enjoying kayaking as he became a 'true American'. Natasha is a member of the Mormon Church and said her faith was helping her through the dark days since Luke passed away last month. She said: 'Without my faith and without my children, there is no way I would be dealing with this as well as I am. 'The one thing that our faith believes is that there is life after death so when I die Luke and I will be re-united. I just have to get through the next 50 or 60 years and then I will see him again. Luke previously lived in Chelmsford but moved toÂ Pennsylvania in 2011 after landing a dream job as president of the medical systems group Olympus Corp, where he met Natasha . 'And for the kids I have to get up each day and eat food, feed them and take care of things around the house and manage the estate now that Luke has gone. 'They are giving me the drive to move forward each day.' Natasha, who worked as clinical project co-ordinator at Olympus, said she was now under financial pressure after Luke's death because the couple did not have a life insurance policy in place. She cannot afford to pay the mortgage on her own and may even have to sell the family home. Luke worked at the Olympus headquarters in Center Valley in Pennsylvania. A spokesperson for Olympus in America said: 'We are deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected loss of our friend and colleague, Luke Calcraft, president of the Medical Systems Group at Olympus Corporation of the Americas. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Luke's family and friends.'","Luke Calcraft, 46, fell into anaphylactic shock from sting while cutting trees .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as having special educational needs as girls, new Government figures have revealed. Across England there are almost 1.5 million children in state schools, classed as having some form of learning difficulty or disability that makes it harder for them to learn than most children of the same age. Of those, 911,900 boys have been diagnosed with SEN compared to 487,885 girls. They include issues including behaviour problems, emotional and social difficulties and speech, communication and language needs. Pupils from poorer backgrounds, those from some ethnic minorities and children in care are more likely to be considered to have a special need, the Department for Educationâs (DfE) data shows. Boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as having special educational needs as girls, new Government figures have revealed. File picture . It reveals that as of January, just over one in six pupils (17.9 per cent) were considered to have special educational needs (SEN) - a total of 1.49 million youngsters. This figure has been in decline since 2010, when 21.1 per cent of children were classed as having SEN. The latest statistics also show a continuing gulf between the sexes, with almost a million boys (911,900 youngsters) considered to have SEN, either with or without a statement of needs, compared to less than half a million (487,885) girls. Boys are known to be more prone to being diagnosed with autism, though scientists are undecided as to why. A recent study, published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, suggests girls require more extreme genetic mutations than boys to develop the condition. As a result, it is less likely that they will be pushed over the diagnostic threshold for autism. The new Government figures also show that pupils with SEN are more than twice as likely to be eligible for free school meals - a key measure of poverty - than those without learning difficulties (29.1 per cent compared to 13.4 per cent), while almost seven in 10 (67.8 per cent) of children in care have special needs. Black pupils are most likely to be diagnosed with some form of learning difficulty or disability, the figures show, while Chinese youngsters are the least likely. The most common types of need for pupils classed as having special needs are speech and language difficulties and behavioural and emotional issues, a Government analysis of the data concludes. This analysis goes on to look at the achievement of SEN pupils, and shows that at the end of primary school, 34 per cent of youngsters with learning difficulties achieved the level expected of their age group in reading, writing and maths, compared to 88 per cent of their classmates. Across England there are almost 1.5 million children in state schools, classed as having some form of learning difficulty or disability that makes it harder for them to learn than most children of the same age. They include issues such as behaviour, emotional and social difficulties and speech, communication and language needs . At GCSE, in 2012/13 just under one in four (23.4 per cent) of SEN teenagers gained at least five C grades, including English and maths, compared to 70.4 per cent of those who were not considered to have a special need. Todayâs data comes just days after a new system of support for children with special needs came into effect. Under the reforms, new education, health and care plans, which stretch from birth to 25, will replace SEN statements and learning disability assessments to create a 'simpler and more joined up' system in England. Researchers in Switzerland suggest girls require more extreme genetic mutations than boys to develop autism, explaining why more boys are diagnosed . A team of researchers earlier this year claimed to have discovered why autism is more common in boys than girls. A study, published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, suggests girls require more extreme genetic mutations than boys to develop the condition. As a result, it is less likely that they will be pushed over the diagnostic threshold for autism. Study author Dr SÃ©bastien Jacquemont, of the University Hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland, said: âThis is the first study that convincingly demonstrates a difference at the molecular level between boys and girls referred to the clinic for a developmental disability. âThe study suggests that there is a different level of robustness in brain development, and females seem to have a clear advantage.â Research has previously shown that autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are both more common in boys. Indeed, about 1.8 per cent of boys have autism compared to just 0.2 per cent of girls. Some researchers have suggested that there is a social bias that increases the likelihood of diagnosis in boys, whereas others have proposed that there are sex-based differences in genetic susceptibility. However, past studies investigating biological explanations for the gender bias have proved inconclusive. To examine this question, Dr Jacquemont teamed up with Dr Evan Eichler, from the University of Washington School of Medicine, to analyse DNA samples from 16,000 people with neuro-developmental disorders - impairments in the development of the brain and central nervous system - and from 800 families affected by autism. Neuro-developmental disorders include autism but also Downâs syndrome, ADHD, Touretteâs syndrome and traumatic brain injuries. The researchers analysed both individual variations in the number of copies of a particular gene and DNA sequence variations. They found that girls diagnosed with a neuro-developmental disorder including autism had a greater number of harmful genes than did boys diagnosed with the same disorder. And women diagnosed with autism had a greater number of harmful DNA sequence variations than did men with autism. The findings suggest that the female brain requires more extreme genetic alterations than does the male brain to produce symptoms of autism or other neuro-developmental disorders. The results also take the focus off the male X chromosome for the genetic basis of the gender bias â they suggest that the genetic difference is seen across the DNA. Dr Jacquemont said: âOverall, females function a lot better than males with a similar mutation affecting brain development. âOur findings may lead to the development of more sensitive, gender-specific approaches for the diagnostic screening of neuro-developmental disorders.â","New government figures show there are 1.5 million children in state schools classed as having a learning difficulty or disability .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Archaeologists more accustomed to unearthing coins and jewels during digs have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. While the artefact is less glamorous, it is perfectly preserved and incredibly rare because it is thought to be the only seat of its kind used by the Romans to have survived. The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and could have been used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay. Archaeologists used to unearthing treasure such as coins and jewels have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. It is thought to be the only set made of wood that has survived since Roman times . Dr Andrew Birley, director of excavations at the fort, has previously dug up gold and silver or artefacts which relate to the military might of the Roman army, as well as everyday items like letters, shoes and babies' booties. He made the discovery himself in a muddy trench which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it, providing oxygen-free conditions. There are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the Roman Empire but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many Roman soldiers. Dr Andrew Birley discovered the toilet seat in a muddy trench (pictured) which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it . The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort (pictured) on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and was likely used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay . Vinolanda was a Roman fort south of Hadrian's Wall in northern England. It guarded the Roman road from the River Tyne to Solway Firth. Wooden tablets were discovered there which are considered the most important examples of military and private correspondence found anywhere in the Roman Empire. The garrison was home to auxiliary infantry and cavalry units - not parts of Roman legions. Roman boots, shoes, armours, jewellery, coins and tablets have all been found there. In 2006, a richly-decorated silver brooch featuring the figure of Mars was found. It belonged to Quintus Sollonius, a Gaul, whose name was inscribed on the brooch. It was dumped near the fort which predates Hadrian's Wall, which was constructed from the early second century. âThere is always great excitement when you find something that has never been seen before and this discovery is wonderful,â Dr Birley said. âWe know a lot about Roman toilets from previous excavations at the site and from the wider Roman world which have included many fabulous Roman latrines but never before have we had the pleasure of seeing a surviving and perfectly preserved wooden seat. âAs soon as we started to uncover it there was no doubt at all on what we had found. It is made from a very well worked piece of wood and looks pretty comfortable. âNow we need to find the toilet that went with it as Roman loos are fascinating places to excavate - their drains often contain astonishing artefacts. âLet's face it, if you drop something down a Roman latrine you are unlikely to attempt to fish it out unless you are pretty brave or foolhardy.â The toilet seat will go on show at the fortâs museum once it has been preserved.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . An elaborate grave belonging to a tall and fearsome warrior (illustrated) who lost his left arm in battle, has been unearthed in Russia . An elaborate grave belonging to a tall and fearsome warrior who lost his left arm in battle, has been unearthed in Russia. The 11th century burial includes a death mask, arrows and the fang of a bear to highlight the strength and power of the warlord. The man towered one foot (25cm) over his companions, but despite his bulk, his skeleton reveals that his arm was severed in his final battle. Archaeologists discovered the remains of the man they named Bogatyr - meaning 'great warrior' - in an ancient burial mound near Omsk in south western Siberia. He was buried with the tooth from a bear on his nose and his face was covered with a fabric death mask,The Siberian Times reported. Pockets in the mask contained metal fish figurines which had deliberately had their heads broken off. It is thought they may have some religious importance. A decorated bronze mirror-like plate  lay on his chest inside a cover and experts think it was intended as a tool with which to communicate with the gods. Bronze tools and 25 sharp metal arrows were found around his remains and a bronze cauldron complete with food at his feet, to help him in the afterlife. Archaeologists also discovered fragments of leather and fur, which might have been part of the warriorâs outfit, or from a quiver of arrows. Mikhail Korusenko, of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said the find came just as his team were finishing their research. âSuddenly this warrior decided to meet with us,â he said, describing the find as âsensationalâ. The warrior was buried with the tooth from a bear on his nose (marked 4) and his face was covered with a fabric death mask, which contained decapitated metal fish figurines (marked 2 and 3) thought to be of religious significance - although experts do not know what they mean . The man towered one foot (25cm) over his companions, but despite his bulk, his skeleton reveals that his arm was severed in his final battle. 1 marks the bridle, 2-5 show details of his death mask, 7 is the location of a bronze mirror and 10 and 11 a cauldron . The 11th century burial includes a death mask, arrows and the fang of a bear to highlight the strength and power of the warlord.

The skeleton of the warrior showed his arm was buried separately next to the rest of his body. âBogatyrâ was 5ft 11inches (180cm) tall â much taller than Siberian natives at the time.

A  bridle placed beneath Bogatyrâs head, suggests he was a skilled horseman. He explained that a  bridle placed beneath Bogatyrâs head, suggests the warrior had been a skilled horseman. Dr Korusenko said the warrior was killed in battle and his severed left arm placed beside his broken shoulder. âHe was buried according to ritual which means he was a respected person. All the elements of the ritual give us an opportunity to discover historical and political conditions of the epoch the warrior lived in'. Bogatyr was thought to be around 40 years old when he was killed and was probably a member of the indigenous Khanty and Mansi peoples. Experts think he would have stood out among them because of this height. At 5ft 11inches (180cm) he was significantly taller than many Siberian natives who were constantly trying to protect their homes from attack. Dr Korusenko believes there is no doubt that the burial belonged to the Ust-Ishim culture and it was dated to the 11th and 12th centuries AD. âIt is a truly unique find which would allow us to fill pages about not only the cultural, but the military history of this part of the region, as we know very little about this particular period of time,â he said. Archaeologists discovered the remains of the man they named Bogatyr, meaning great warrior, in an ancient burial mound near Omsk in south western Siberia (marked on the map) Bronze tools and 25 sharp metal arrows were found around the warrior's remains at the site (pictured) and a bronze cauldron complete with food at his feet, to help him in the afterlife .","Elaborate grave in Omsk,Â southÂ western Siberia, belonged to 'Bogatyr'

But now intrepid cyclists can keep dry using an umbrella that has been specially designed to clip onto bikes. A Dutch firm based in Delft has invented a simple clamp that fits a bikeâs handlebars and holds a windproof umbrella firmly in place to protect a rider from wind and rain. Easy rider: A Dutch firm based in Delft has invented a simple clamp that fits to a bikeâs handlebars and holds a windproof umbrella firmly in place to protect a rider from wind and rain (pictured) The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too. The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph). The aerodynamic design directs wind over and around the brolly, which holds its shape and keeps people dry underneath.

The Denny bike  lots of safety features, an automatic gear shifter, built-in lights and a motor to help cyclists up hills. A London-based company named Blaze showcased a safety feature called Laserlight, which projects an icon onto the road, helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist, even if they cannot see them. A green image of a bike is beamed between 16 and 19ft (five and six metres) in front of a cyclist, signalling that a driver should not turn across their path. While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling. A spokesperson for the Dutch firm said: âRuining your hairdo, ending up with dripping clothes after a quick ride to the shops will be a thing of the past with the Senz umbrella holder. âThe clamp allows you to attach your umbrella on your bike, while keeping both hands on the handle bars and giving a good sight of traffic. âWhen it is not raining the holder is easily folded back and the brolly attached to the bike forks.â The clamp costs â¬39 (Â£31) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for â¬25 (Â£20) and â¬50 (Â£40). The aerodynamic and wind-resistant umbrella was invented by engineering student Gerwin Hoogendoorn after storms broke three of his standard umbrellas in a week.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Some scientists believe alien life was transported to Earth on a comet - a theory known as panspermia. But if alien life can travel between planets, the opposite may also be true, and parts of Earth could be 'seeding' life elsewhere in the solar system. The theory has gained traction over the past few years, with scientists claiming that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs took Earth-life to Mars and the moons of Jupiter. Some scientists believe alien life was transported to Earth on a comet. But if alien life can travel between planets, the opposite may also be true, and Earth could be 'seeding' life elsewhere in the solar system . In a paper last year, Rachel Worth, a PhD candidate at Penn State University said that it's likely that life from Earth has already been brought to other planet. Ms Worth's team first looked at the number of rocks bigger than 9.8ft (3 metres) that were thrown out to space from Earth by major impacts, according to a report byÂ Maddie Stone inÂ Motherboard. The size of rock would shield microbes from the sun's radiation over a journey across the solar system. Using computer simulations, the team then mapped the fate of these rocks. While many didn't survive the journey, thousands of rocks hit Mars and about six rocks made it as far as Europa, a moon of Jupiter with an icy crust. In a paper last year, Rachel Worth, a PhD candidate at Penn State University said that it's likely that life from Earth has already been brought to other planet, such as Mars (pictured) 'At the end of the day, it's not the numbers themselves that matter, but the order of magnitude,' Ms Worth told Motherboard. Building blocks of life can spring into existence spontaneously when icy comets smash into planets, a study has shown. A similar process can create amino acids - bits of proteins - when a rocky meteorite strikes an ice-covered world. How often the building blocks end up constructing proteins and living organisms is an unanswered question. But the research last year helped fill in another piece of the puzzle of life's origins on Earth.Scientists believe that about the time life first emerged, between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago, Earth was being bombarded by comets and meteorites. âOur work shows that the basic building blocks of life can be assembled anywhere in the Solar System and perhaps beyond,â said Dr Zita Martins, from Imperial College London. âHowever, the catch is that these building blocks need the right conditions in order for life to flourish.â 'If the numbers were much lower than one, we'd assume this event is unlikely to have occurred since the origin of life on Earth. 'But one to ten impacts over the last several billion years tells us we can't rule out the possibility of life from Earth seeding an outer solar system moon.' The theory has let some scientists to imagine a future in which humans could colonise space by sending DNA to distant planets and 'printing' a new civilisation. In a talk at the Smithsonian Magazine's 'The Future is Here Festival' in Washington DC in May, Nasa engineer Adam Seltzner spoke about the future of space exploration. And aside from reiterating the importance that we continue manned exploration, he spoke of a lesser-known method of space exploration â sending the human genome to far-flung planets. The idea was first dreamed up by Harvard biologists Dr Gary Ruvkun and Dr George Church, as reported in a Harvard Medical School release. How these bacteria would grow into humans is up for debate. They could simply be left to evolve, as life did on Earth, seeding another planet with our own organisms. Alternatively, an autonomous machine capable of creating cellular life could be sent thousands of years in advance to a habitable exoplanet outside the solar system. Upon arrival, information on how to genetically construct a human would be beamed to the machine. Of course, these proposals are something that will only be possible for humans hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years in the future. But many scientists are of the belief that we will one day be able to create multicellular life - and it stands to reason this could include an organism as complex as a human.","Asteroid that killed dinosaurs may have taken life to Mars and Jupiter .

And now the British appliance firm has taken to YouTube to tease a new mystery device. The video shows various ground-level moving robots and engineers tinkering with parts â leading many to speculate that a robotic Roomba-like hoover is on the horizon. Is this the vacuum cleaner of the future? Dyson has released a video to tease a new product (a still is pictured) but hasn't revealed what it is.

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . The IRS wants a bite out of Silicon Valley's free lunches, which the agency says are a fringe benefit and therefore taxable. Tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are known for their freebies - including lavish free lunch offerings for members of staff. The IRS has informed tech giants that the free gourmet grub could be subject to a tax of up to 30 per cent of the meal's 'fair market value.' No lunch tax breaks: The IRS has listed 'employer-provided meals' as a top priority for the next fiscal year . Facebook perks: Employees at tech companies such as Facebook have meals provided to them free of charge which the IRS says should be considered part of their taxable income . According to the Wall Street Journal, the IRS is scrutinizing the tax filings of companies during routine audits and seeking back-taxes on employee meals. Google reportedly serves 50,000 meals per day in its 120 cafes worldwide. Facebook has several free restaurants at its Menlo Park, California location. Twitter has coffee bars, four different types of kombucha tea and huge cafeterias serving everything from oysters to burgers. The IRS and the Treasury Department listed 'employer-provided meals' as one of their top priorities for the next fiscal year, an issue on which they are currently 'seeking guidance.' If free meals are classed as income, employees would be liable to pay tax on it, but it's more likely that the IRS will seek back-taxes from the companies themselves. Moving forward, companies would have to add the value of the free food each employee consumes when calculating their withholding tax. Hashtag lunch: One of the many areas of the Twitter cafeteria that offer various types of food free to employees . Feed the fire: Google restaurants and cafeterias around the world serve about 50,000 free meals a day . However, the argument isn't clear-cut. Meals are exempt from taxes if the companies can prove they are 'non-compensatory' and a 'convenience to the employer.' Proving that 'reasonable lunch breaks aren't feasible' is also a legitimate way to claim exemption. Tech workers are concerned at the possibility of being taxed for their free meals and snacks. 'You start doing that, well then, do you start taxing free coffee as well?' Nathan Grady, a front-end engineer at Weebly, told Fortune. 'It just doesnât make sense.' A Wall Street Journal analysis estimates that if a meal's 'fair market value' is between $8 and $10, a Google employee who consumes two meals a day at work could be liable to be taxed on an extra $4,000 to $5,000 per year. Larger companies like Facebook and Google could offset the tax on the employee by supplementing their annual wage while maintaining the free lunches. However, smaller tech companies may have to scrap free meals altogether. Free meals are considered an essential employee perk in Silicon Valley, the provision of which is a major recruitment tool. The Journal reports that rather than pay the tax or pass it on to their employees big tech companies are likely to fight it out with the IRS in court.","The IRS wants to tax Silicon Valley tech companies' free lunches .

If Brazil was a destination Rickie Lambert could never have envisaged appearing on the landscape this time last year, the same could surely be said of his native Liverpool. Twelve months on, after firmly establishing himself as one of the Barclays Premier Leagueâs most accomplished strikers, both are dominating the skyline for the 32-year old. Not only is he Brazil-bound with Englandâs World Cup squad, heâs heading there as a Liverpool player. It is a remarkable development for the former Southampton frontrunner, and if he was even more taken aback by Liverpoolâs Â£4million outlay than the call-up from Roy Hodgson, he was not alone. On his way: Rickie Lambert (left, next to Adam Lallana) is ready to sign a two-year deal at Liverpool . Decent in the air: The signing of Lambert draws obvious comparisons with West Ham's Andy Carroll (right) Change of heart? Brendan Rodgers allowed Carroll to leave Liverpool because he didn't fit the club's ethos . After making Andy Carrollâs departure the main priority on taking over at Anfield, few expected Brendan Rodgersâ summer spending plans to include an archetypal bustling British No 9. He will argue they donât, despite Lambert set to sign a two-year deal with last seasonâs runners-up after passing a medical. In Rodgersâ view, Lambert does not fit the description. While Carroll needs a steady supply of aerial ammunition to make his mark, Anfieldâs latest acquisition has a far more varied game that will slot seamlessly into the Rodgers way. âHe has probably never got the recognition for what a really good footballer he is,â said the Liverpool manager. âHe is probably seen as a traditional big No 9, a typical British striker, but he is actually one of the most accomplished footballers I have seen. âLook at his touch and the different types of goals he scores. He is a terrific player, one with a lot to offer.â There can be little doubt part of the appeal for Rodgers lies in Lambertâs ability to offer an alternative approach, should Liverpoolâs slick passing style flounder against the sort of safety-first approach that proved so effective for Chelsea at Anfield last season. Dismal: Carroll has had a tough time in front of goal and with injuries since a Â£15m move to the Hammers . On that plane! Lambert, on the other hand, is ready to embark on the World Cup in Brazil at the age of 32 . He can put himself about and ruffle defences with the most robust of aerial challenges. But while Carrollâs threat basically boils down to winning headers, Lambert is nothing like as one-dimensional. Not only is he a far more dynamic prospect when spearheading an attack, the new man scores more goals, registers more assists and fires off more shots. The pair's minutes per goal ratio is barely comparable. Comfortable with the ball at his feet, Lambert holds it up adeptly for others and has an eye for a pass that contributed significantly to Jay Rodriguez also emerging as a World Cup candidate, prior to his hopes being dashed by a knee injury against Manchester City two months ago. The former Burnley striker readily acknowledged his old sidekickâs input as a creator as well as taker of chances, saying: âItâs unbelievable playing alongside Rickie. We work well together, and I have learned so much from him. We complement each otherâs game, and he has done a lot for me. He is much more than just a good finisher, and if you look at some of the goals Iâve scored for Southampton, youâll see that.â Snarling: Lambert has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League for the last two years . Link-up man: Lambert does an awful lot of work when coming deep and playing off his midfielders . Get hold of it! Carroll finds it difficult to keep hold of possession and often finds himself isolated up top . 43 - Luis Suarez . 29 - Yaya Toure . 28 - Daniel Sturridge . 27 - Wayne Rooney . 26 - Steven Gerrard . 24 - Olivier Giroud . 23 - RICKIE LAMBERT and Sergio Aguero . Of course, Lambert is no slouch at helping himself in the opposition area, as demonstrated by a record of 106 goals in 207 appearances for Southampton and a strike rate that puts Carrollâs in the shade. It all points to Rodgers, who helped transform Daniel Sturridge into an automatic choice for England after plucking him from the fringes of Chelseaâs team, possibly pulling off another transfer market masterstroke, with his first signing of the summer. While some may struggle to picture Lambert trading back heels and one-touch flicks with Sturridge or Luis Suarez, Rodgers is convinced he will take it in his stride. He can be even more certain that settling in off the pitch will be a formality. Born and raised in the Westvale area of Kirkby, Lambertâs parents Ray and Maureen still live there and were part of a four-car convoy that motored down to Wembley for his England debut against Scotland last August. He has come a long way since asking non-League Marine for a trial after being released by Liverpool as a teenager. As he packs his bags for Brazil, he may just shake his head in wonder at how far.","Liverpool set to land Lambert for Â£4m from Southampton .

Scans revealed a ruptured cruciate ligament, and after operating on him, Bradford-based surgeon Steve Bollen spelled out the possible consequences. âNever mind kicking a ball, he told me I might never walk properly again,â Meyler, 24, reflected. The worst-case scenario was avoided after a gruelling nine-month rehabilitation, but he was leftÂ  fretting over his future once more when the same knee buckled beneath him against Aston Villa in 2011.

He trod on the Manchester United midfielderâs shin but escaped punishment from the FA. âIt could have been taken the wrong way, but it was an accident in the sense that it was clumsy from me,â he said. Accident: Meyler claims that he didn't mean to catch Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj . Unlucky: Meyler says Januzaj's speed was the reason he ended up standing on his leg at Old Trafford . âI was tired, it was the 90th minute and Januzaj was too quick for me. My leg is in the air, heâs kicked the ball away and as Iâm coming to plant my foot to push off, Iâve ended up accidentally standing on him. âOf course, there was worry and anxiety. Sometimes things can be taken the wrong way or over the line, but it is all done and dusted now and I can look forward to the Cup final.â Meyler knows what it is like toÂ  be on the end of a controversial incident; he was the victim of Alan Pardewâs headbutt earlier in the season. Pardew apologised to Meyler straight after the game and, he says, âthat was the end of itâ. Forgotten: Meyler has moved on after being headbutted by Newcastle boss Alan Pardew in March . The 24-year-old from Cork hasÂ  blossomed under Hull manager Steve Bruce. He described the sales pitch that persuaded him to followÂ  manager Bruce from Sunderland to Hull: âWhen I spoke to him, he said, âMeyler, I want you to come and be a part of thisâ. I said, âHow do I know you are going to be promoted?â So he just said, âTrust me, I will get this team promotedâ. âAnd within one year he did. Youâve got to give him credit for that.

Despite serial biter Luis Suarez shaming his country in Brazil and President Jose Mujica calling the FIFA hierarchy âold sons of bitchesâ, Uruguay are favourites to host the finals in 2030. With the United States already earmarked for 2026, following Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, that makes 2034 the earliest possible date for England to have any hope of staging its second World Cup.

But with two other powerful candidates emerging for that year, the odds are lengthening against the finals coming here during most of our lifetimes. FIFA are acutely aware that Uruguay have not staged the finals for almost a century, even though they have won the World Cup twice and reached the semi-finals on three other occasions. The difficulty of taking the tournament back to the land of its inaugural hosts and winners â in 1930 â is that Uruguay is a small country with a population of only just over 3.3 million. That is . where Argentina come in. The concept is for Uruguayâs neighbours to be . co-hosts. Although FIFA have always expressed some resistance to joint . hosting, a precedent was set by the 2002 tournament in Japan and South . Korea. In fact, a successful two-nation event in South America would be more bad news for England.

Disgrace: Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini marred Uruguay's World Cup campaign . Aftermath: Suarez's actions earned him a lengthly ban from all football . Fresh start: Suarez has arrived in Spain following his move to Barcelona . Attack: Jose Mujica has blasted the FIFA hierarchy . However, the emergence of Belgium as a competitive nation encourages the prospect of those two neighbours being given the honour.

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . A week is a long time not only in politics but also in football. Just as governments can be brought down in seven days, so the world game can be changed irrevocably in that brief time span. The carnival which has kicked off Brazil 2014, in all its multi-coloured spectacle and dazzling excitement, has altered long-held perceptions about football in the minds of millions. Dazzling excitement: The World Cup in Brazil has got off to the perfect start with plenty of goals and shocks . Carnival: The first week of the World Cup has altered the perception of football in the minds of millions . Suddenly the Champions League is no longer the zenith, nor the Premier League or La Liga the blinkered obsession. Something far more profound and enchanting is happening here. Something which is capturing the hearts of the worldâs population. It can be seen on the faces of the fans in the stadiaÂ  as they exude a passion for their national teams which transcends the tribal support for club football. It is inspiring a a fraternity between peoples of nations who, eager though they are to win, are finding a bond with rival supporters which is rooted in their fascination with the game. Quite simply, it means more. Also to the players, many of whom are surpassing themselves as they respond to the hopes and exhortations of their public. Emotional: Brazil star Neymar breaks down in tears during his country's national anthem on Monday . There is nothing wrong with patriotism providing it is married to mutual respect. So even as many of the physical challenges have bordered on the brutal, still sportsmanship flourishes. The most vivid example of that came when Thiago Silva, the Brazilian who is probably the best centre-back in the world, lunged into a desperate assault on Mexicoâs Chicharito. Silva knew in his heart he had done wrong. He shook the hand of the referee who booked him, in contrition not irony. Then he helped his victim back to his feet and could clearly be lip-read repeating to him âdesculpa.â Forgive me. Which Chicharito did, with an embrace. Reaching for the stars: Daniel Sturridge points to the sky after scoring against Italy . That exchange was as important in its way as the goal rush which has hall-marked a World Cup imbued with the ambition to win, not crippled by fear of defeat. How pleasing it is to include England in that recognition. As Roy Hodgsonâs team launch us into week two of this tournament they do so admired by all, even though they lost game one to Italy. Given a manager deeply schooled in international football, England have caught the spirit of Brazil. Hodgson sent them out to attack the Italians even though he was conscious of the risks and they were winners in the estimation of most who watched them despite being narrowly defeated. When Jose Mourinho, the arch pragmatist, commends you for the manner of your losing then you must have done an awful lot right. Now, in Sao Paolo against the Uruguay of Luis Suarez, England have a wonderful opportunity to justify all the praise. These South Americans, with Suarez watching from the bench in the last phase of his recovery from injury, were truly awful in their defeat by Costa Rica. This Is Englandâs chance to begin that rare process in World Cups, qualifying after losing the opening match. That does not mean, however, that they should simply carry on where they left off against Italy. Hodgson needs to make adjustments which can take maximum advantage of Uruguayâs weaknesses in defence and midfield. He must also tighten up his own rear-guard against Suarez and Edison Cavani. There was a slight but critical imbalance in the team edged out by Italy. With Wayne Rooney played out of position on the left to help accommodate that trio of young forwards â Sterling, Sturridge and Welbeck â Andrea Pirlo was able to control the game. That also exposed space behind attack-minded left back Leighton Baines which Pirlo and Co cleverly exploited. Ready to roar: England boss Roy Hodgson may have to make some adjustments ahead of the Uruguay game . Shoring up the defence is not merely a matter of changing personnel in the back four, even though of the two Phils I personally would prefer Jones to Jagielka.Â  They need better protection by the midfield and one way of doing that would be to define captain Steve Gerrard as purely the anchor there and bring back Frank Lampard to play in front of him, there to offer his experience to Sterling and Barkley. With Rooney and Sturridge up front, something like this 4-1-3-2 team would be more like it: Hart â Johnson, Jones, Cahill, Baines â Gerrard â Sterling, Lampard, Barkley â Sturridge, Rooney. Hodgson can find now the template for a run at least as far as the quarter finals. And if that surprises many, well this World Cup is full of surprises. Most of them pleasant, including Van Persie and Robben leading the Dutch demolition of Spanish tiki-taka, the one surge of genius with which Lionel Messi dragged himself out of a trough and Argentina to much-need victory over Bosnia Herzegovina, the brush strokes from Neymar which suggests Brazil are still just about favourites,Â  Mullerâs clinical finishing which raises the prospect that Germany might become the first European winners of a World Cup in the Americasâ¦ and all those goals. In with a shout: Lionel Messi roars with delight after scoring for Argentina against Bosnia on Sunday . None of this happened in South Africa four years ago.Â  It needed football to come back to the spiritual home of the beautiful game. All the doubts aboutÂ  that decision by FIFA have been swept away on a tidal wave of brilliance, with hardly a dull moment. A week a long time in politics? The football has also given the Brazilian government a respite from the social unrest fuelled by poverty, deprivation and economic inequality. That first match of week one, played by Brazil and Croatia in Sao Paolo last Thursday to a sound-track of protesters battling riot police in the streets, seems a very long time ago.","Brazil 2014 has been one of the most exciting World Cup's in living memory .

"By . Stuart Broad . We spoke yesterday about our last-wicket pair frustrating the Indians for maybe half an hour, so to manage three hours was pretty special. It felt like we were watching Test history unfold and to watch Jimmy Anderson, who had never scored a first-class 50, make 81 was amazing. Heâs been working on his batting with our assistant coach Paul Farbrace and I canât talk highly enough of the way he played here. Superstition: Stuart Broad and his England team-mates were afraid to move from their seats on the balcony as James Anderson and Joe Root put on a record-breaking last-wicket stand of 198 at Trent Bridge . On the front foot: Anderson hit 81 as England established an unlikely lead in their first innings . Cricketers are a superstitious lot, so we decided at the start of the day that we werenât going to move from our seats at all. The only exception was for toilet breaks but even then the pressure was on. Youâre allowed to nip out to the gents but only if youâre back in time for the start of the next over. Iâve been in that situation before, where someone doesnât make it back in time and then gets blamed if a wicket falls. The pressure of being an international sportsman comes in all shapes and sizes. VIDEO Anderson and Root reach record heights . Applause: England captain Alastair Cook salutes Anderson and Root after their world record stand changed the course of the first Test . Game changer: Joe Root's unbeaten 154 turned the match in England's favour though they were unable to turn the screw further with the ball later on . We saw when Indiaâs last pair added 111 how easy it is to bat on this pitch, even if youâre a tail-ender and especially when the ball goes old and thereâs no bounce in the surface. We saw Jimmy reaching 50 by charging Indiaâs opening bowler and hooking him in front of square, which just highlighted how poor this surface has been for Test cricket. In the end, Jimmy was probably unlucky that his nick carried to slip. I canât have been the only one in the ground who thought he might have been on his way to a maiden Test hundred! Batting . Iâve worked really hard on my batting since I got back from Australia and itâs really pleasing that it seems to be paying off. Paul has played a big part and heâs encouraged me to be attacking. I remember reading Michael Vaughan say he always looked for a four early on and thatâs what Iâm trying to do. Iâve added a little trigger movement too and feel like Iâve got time to hit through the ball. Collapses . It does seem over the past year weâve been prone to some collapses and itâs something we have to improve. Itâs a collective effort and thereâs no blame involved because the bowlers are part of the batting effort too. My knee . With so many tests squeezed into such a short space of time anyone with half a cricket brain understands rotation could be on the agenda. Hopefully the knee will be OK but letâs be honest, if we keep bowling 160 overs an innings then none of the bowlers will get through the series. Staying at home . Itâs nice to be able to wake up in my own bed and itâs always special playing at your home ground. Itâs definitely more friendly than Brisbane!","England frustrated India with a world record last-wicket stand .

"By . Stuart Broad . Mail on Sunday columnist Stuart Broad returns to give us his views from a week of cricket. He discusses the 'run-out' of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston and comparing it to not walking, why there is no logic behind it, how exciting it is to have three debutants, his own fitness, and how their Ashes humiliation is being put behind them. I think anyone trying to compare the âMankadâ run-out of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston this week with not walking is very naive. Some people have tried, no doubt with what happened with myself in the Ashes at Trent Bridge last summer in mind. But thereâs no comparison. Iâve never played a game at any level, including schools cricket, where Iâve seen a batsman run outat the non-strikerâs end. Thatâs why I think it is completely wrong and anyone who compares it to not walking is being naive. Don't compare the run-out of Jos Buttler (left) at the ODI match between England and Sri Lanka to not walking. Sachithra Senanayake (right) appeals for the wicket of Buttler during the fifth ODI between England and Sri Lanka . Buttler leaves the field after controversially being run out at the ODI match in Birmingham . Why? Because Iâve only ever played with one consistent walker and that was Graeme Swann. Not walking is the norm â you wait for the umpireâs decision. Thatâs fair. Thereâs a vast difference with âMankadingâ. Itâs not the norm. I was actually surprised Angelo Matthews, as Sri Lankaâs captain, upheld the appeal. But I think the major problem is it shouldnât even be in the playersâ hands. This goes above pointing at players or captains. Leave it up to the umpires. It shouldnât be an option to have a dismissal like that because at the end of the day if youâre a supporter youâve not seen a ball bowled, youâve not seen a shot played but youâve lost a world-class batsman. I canât see any logic behind that being a mode of dismissal. It seems a really strange rule that someone can be run out like that because youâre getting no entertainment from it as a fan. I wasnât in the one-day squad so I actually watched the incident in the Notts changing room during ourgame at Hove and everyone was pretty surprised. The one consistent walker I ever played with was Graeme Swann. Not walking is the norm. You wait. As I said earlier, I think it should be in the umpiresâ hands. Sri Lanka said Jos was stealing runs at Lordâs and he had a warning at Edgbaston, so the decision shouldnât be up to the player to take the stumps, that should be the umpire saying: âLook, weâve gone upstairs, youâre stealing a few toomany yards, if you do it again weâll take five off your score or weâll take 10 off your score.â That would stop people doing it. We are all excited about starting the Test series this week. Regardless of what happened at Edgbaston, we wonât need any extra motivation as weâre kicking off a new era in the first Test of the summer at Lordâs. Weâre going to have three debutants who will be buzzing and Lordâs Tests always bring out a huge amount of excitement. So I canât imagine it will add any extra spice because I expect there to be plenty of spice anyway. Youâve got the honour and pride of playing for your country at Lordâs. We have a lot to prove after what happened over the winter. And with the new players coming into a much-changed side, we know we have to gel quickly. Fans might not know some of the new guys and Iâve only met Sam Robson for about 30 seconds in my life, so it will be very important we get to know our team-mates as well and as quickly as possible. Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan have shown they have got what it takes in international white-ball cricket and Samâs county pedigree proves he is a fantastic cricketer, too. They just have to believe what they have done to get selected in the first place means they belong at this level. I've only met Sam Robson for about 30 seconds in my life, so it will be very important we get to know each other . Moeen Ali (left) and Chris Jordan (right) have shown they have got what it takes in international cricket . My knee is doing fine, thank you... Itâs great to be back in an England squad after missing the start of the summer with patella tendinitis. It flared up on harder surfaces in the winter but the knee was fine down at Hove last week so Iâm very confident it will not be a problem for the rest of the summer. It was always planned, even before the Ashes, that I would probably not play in the one-day series against Sri Lanka. I could have played but we decided I would miss it. The physio Jon Alty, who is in his first year at Trent Bridge, has always been at the end of a phone and has been exceptional. When Iâm playing I have two physio sessions a week that will help strengthen the leg and it takespressure off the knee. Iâm having ice and compression after bowling, a lot of heat before bowling and massage through the quads to take the pressure off the knee. It is actually landing on my knee that brings inflammation so Iâm going to be wearing a knee pad to make the impact of falling on a small square slightly less. It might not do the job, itâs just to try to take off some of the impact. I suppose itâs a bit like what youuse in gardening, the knee pads an old bloke might use doing the flowerbeds. I just put it on and bowl in it, it took a little bit of getting used to but it helps diving in the field because fielding is an important part of international cricket so you can't hide. The knee was fine at Hove last week, thankfully. Two physio sessions a week help strengthen the leg. ...and we're leaving the Ashes defeat in the past - exactly where it belongs . A lot has been said about last winter, especially what happened in Australia. But the message we have got from Peter Moores since he came in as coach is âwhatâs done is done, itâs in the past. We donât want to look backâ. You obviously have to learn from what happened but we donât want to talk about the winter because itâs about pushing this team forward now. I think having three debutants this week is a big statement because thatâs evidence weâre looking to the future now. It is going to be crucial the senior players and management involved in that Ashes series donât keep talking about it, because weâve got a big job to do this summer.","Anyone comparing the 'Mankad' run-out of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston with not walking is very naive, says Stuart Broad .
There's no logic to that dismissal and it's bad for the fans because they get no entertainment from being run out like that, he explains .
Broad says it is great to have three debutants but thinks they have to get to know one another - and fast .
His knee is doing fine, and England are leaving the Ashes firmly in the past ."
"By . Patrick Collins . As an oppressively hot and dusty Lordâs afternoon dawdled towards its concluding stages, Liam Plunkett found the edge of Cheteshwar Pujaraâs bat and Matt Prior held the routine catch. A slumbering Lordâs came abruptly to life. A spasm of relief ran through the England fielders, while Alastair Cook danced his delight, swapping high-fives and thumping backs. At Plunkettâs next delivery, Virat Kohli shouldered arms, and the swinging ball punished his rashness by flicking the top of off stump. This time the reaction was clamorous. His time is now: Alastair Cook must stand up and lead England to victory with a big score to even has a chance of retaining his captaincy past the second Test against India at Lord's . Poor form: Cook (centre) looks despondent as he walks off after being dismissed while Sri Lanka celebrate . The ranks of egg-and-bacon striped ties came tottering to their feet. The drinkers in the Harris Garden pushed aside their fizz and hurried back to the grandstand. Cook danced with more urgency, bawled with more vigour. Three overs later, a brute of a lifter from Stuart Broad took Ajinkya Rahaneâs armguard and floated high behind square on the leg side, where the diving Prior plucked the catch. The umpire, deceived, lifted a finger, and the old ground erupted in a merry madness. Three wickets had fallen for five runs in 19 balls. A match which had promised England only pain and extended suffering was now alive with possibilities. When Cook looks back on his career as England captain, these are the moments he will treasure. Sadly, such moments have been too few, and the time for rueful reminiscence is drawing closer. The termination of an England captain is not easily achieved. Whereas an unsuccessful football manager or an unpopular Education Secretary may be packed off in short order, the sacking of the cricket skipper is something akin to the defrocking of an archbishop. It is done only after immense official consideration and wide-ranging public debate. Well, both conditions have been fulfilled and, even if England were to win a notable victory in this Test, the signs are Cook may not survive. Can't buy a run: Cook averages just 24 with the bat in the last year and has not scored a century in 26 innings . Pondering: England coach Peter Moores stuck with Cook when he took over but must make a decision now . Alastair Cook will be glad to see the back of 2014, a year which has seen his England captaincy called into serious question. The opener has failed to hit a century now for more than a year and, as his team toils against India at Lordâs, Sportsmail takes a look at where it all went wrong: . January . Questions begin to be asked over Cookâs captaincy as England lose the Ashes series in Australia 5-0. January . Cook captains England in the ODI series but is unable to make a big contribution as England lose 4-1. January . England coach Andy Flower resigns but under-fire Cook vows to continue as captain and is backed by the ECB. February . Fall-out from Ashes continues as the ECB axe batsman Kevin Pietersen effectively ending his England career. May . Cookâs mentor Graham Gooch is sacked as England batting coach â on the captainâs advice. June . More doubts are raised over Cookâs captaincy as the opener is dismissed for just 17 in the first Test against Sri Lanka. He scores only 28 in the second innings, before making just 17 and 16 in the second Test. July . Dismissed for just five runs in the first Test against India at Trent Bridge, before getting out for only 10 in the first innings of secondTest. To watch him at work on Saturday was to study a man painfully aware of his predicament. He stood hopefully at first slip through much of the long day, crouching as Broad or Plunkett, Jimmy Anderson or Ben Stokes hustled in. He would bring his hands together in supplication, watching the ball fly past to the keeper, then placing one hand beneath his chin while the other propped an elbow. From time to time, he would exchange a few words with Prior, another England player on Death Row, if the rumours are true. Then, at the end of the over, he would gather up the close fielderâs helmet and jog dutifully to the other end. At one stage after tea, the entire England team gathered around the drinks waiters as Pujara was treated for a minor injury. Cook stood his ground, quite alone, staring into the middle distance. You never saw a man look quite so lonely. It is said that Cook does not sweat. It is difficult to determine if that is a tribute to his glands or his temperament, but it is the reason why he is the fielder chosen to handle the new ball on its way back to the bowler. And yet, with the pressures mounting and the speculation raging, one imagines that the hands must have been more than a touch damp as Indiaâs total took shape. Nervous times: Cook could find his position untenable if England continue their poor form against India . You found yourself trying to recall other, equally unfortunate, captains: Bligh of the Bounty, or the chap who presided over the Good Ship Venus. But precious few have stirred the sympathy in the manner of poor Cook. The ancients, in merciless mood, combined to criticise the skipper for his failings. Mike Brearley, most cerebral of former skippers, conceded that Cook was vulnerable. He understood, all too well: âYou feel awful, you begin to doubt, and you need a lot of support around you,â he said. Geoffrey Boycott, more forthright, announced that Cook desperately needed runs in Englandâs second innings. âIf he doesnât, he should leave himself out,â said Boycott. âItâs not helping the team.â When men as different as Brearley and Boycott make common cause, then the writing is spreading all over the wall. In fairness, Cook is being attacked for all manner of perceived failings, some of them quite delusory. In this match, for instance, he has been pilloried for his âfailureâ to reprimand his quick bowlers for their wasteful line and length on the opening morning. While a public rebuke might have been excellent public relations, one wonders why the bowlers themselves had no awareness of the appropriate plans. But once a captain is at bay, any stick will do. Lack of support: Giles Clarke (centre) reacted angrily when asked about Cook's (right) future by journalists . He wears a faintly haggard look, like one who knows he is the subject of too many conversations, one who has overheard things which are certainly unkind but which might well be true. You suspect he is now listening to the critics; not the knee-jerk dullards who yearn for the restoration of Kevin Pietersen, but those who wish Cook well and have come to believe that a rest - hopefully temporary - would be the kindest course. He may well score the big second-innings hundred of which Boycott spoke, but even that may not be sufficient. In any case, what score would merit another Test, another chance? Sixty? Seventy? Ninety? The fact that we can indulge in such speculation is testimony to his plight. For the plot has moved on, and what was once mischievous speculation has now become a matter of time. Through all his trials, Cook has handled himself with appealing dignity. He has concentrated on his team, probably at the expense of his personal form, and he is paying the protracted price. If he does decide to go - and the decision must surely be his own - then one hopes that his return will not be long delayed. He is a considerable man and a considerable cricketer. And he will surely know better days, when he can dance his delight and flap his high-fives, and bring the champagne guzzlers hustling in from the Harris Garden, to join his England party. D-Day: Cook must lead his side to victory with a big score against India to have any chance of keeping his job .","The writing appears to be on the wall for Cook's England captaincy .
A big score in the second innings for England against India in the second Test at Lord's may not even be enough to save his job .
If he does go then he can have a rest and hopefully come back refreshed ."
"By . Sam Peters . Alastair Cook faces D-Day over his future as England captain this week, with calls growing for him to resign before he is sacked. The 29-year-old has endured a torrid time with the bat in recent months, is without a Test hundred in 26 innings and has averaged less than 24 over the past year. His captaincy style has also been heavily criticised as England have slumped to a string of humiliating defeats. Insiders insist that the captain retains the support of the dressing room, and senior ECB figures have much to lose if he flops after they backed him following this winterâs Ashes debacle while sacking Kevin Pietersen. But with his batting technique in disarray and his leadership style under intense scrutiny, Cook must decide this week if he wants to carry on. D-Day: England captain Alastair Cook must lead his side to victory with a big score against India to keep his job . Woes: Cook has struggled with the bat for more than a year and needs to find form in the second Test at Lord's . Poor form: Cook (centre) looks despondent as he walks off after being dismissed while Sri Lanka celebrate . âThe worst thing he could do is drag his heels and be stubborn,â one former England captain told Sportsmail on Saturday. âSometimes in life you just have to accept something is not for you. Itâs not looking good for him.â Cook is likely to have to bat at some point on Sunday in Englandâs second innings in the Lordâs Test against India. An unlikely victory, with runs from the left-handed opener, would probably buy Cook some time, but defeat and another low score would make his position almost untenable following the 5-0 Ashes humiliation and last monthâs home series defeat by Sri Lanka. Huge questions would also need to be asked of Peter Moores, who has so far failed to make a visible impact on Englandâs performances in his second incarnation as head coach. But for the time being the focus remains on Cook. Alastair Cook will be glad to see the back of 2014, a year which has seen his England captaincy called into serious question. The opener has failed to hit a century now for more than a year and, as his team toils against India at Lordâs, Sportsmail takes a look at where it all went wrong: . January .

Pondering: England coach Peter Moores stuck with Cook when he took over but must make a decision now . Looking behind: Cook must find his form again if he is to retain his captaincy - and his place in the England side . One England team insider told Sportsmail on Saturday that the Essex opener remains in good spirits around the dressing room, refusing to allow his own struggles outwardly to affect his mood. It is understood he went out of his way to take newcomer Gary Ballance out for dinner last Wednesday in an effort to reassure him about his future after pictures emerged of the 24-year-old cavorting drunkenly in a Nottingham nightclub upon the conclusion of last weekâs Trent Bridge Test. âGaryâs a very sensitive young man and he was extremely worried about the implications of the pictures being publicised,â the insider said. âCooky made it his priority to make sure Gary didnât have dinner on his own the night the pictures came out. He has not got to the stage where heâs so worried about his own form that heâs stopped thinking about his players.â Can't buy a run: Cook averages just 24 with the bat in the last year and has not scored a century in 26 innings . Positive influence: Cook helped England batsman Gary Ballance after he was pictured topless last weekend . But although Cook retains the support of the dressing room and those close to it, there are worrying signs that senior figures at the ECB are beginning to distance themselves from him. On Saturday, England team managing director Paul Downton, the man responsible for sacking Pietersen after taking over from Hugh Morris, declined to support Cook publicly, and ECB chairman Giles Clarke reacted angrily when approached by journalists. The ECB do not have a track record of sacking captains, with Alec Stewart being the last to lose his job for on-field reasons in 1999 (although Pietersen was sacked following a behind-the-scenes fall out with Moores in 2009), but defeat at Lordâs would leave Cook facing the axe. Writing on the wall? England team managing director Paul Downton declined to publicly support Cook . Lack of support: Giles Clarke (centre) reacted angrily when asked about Cook's (right) future by journalists . Rarity: Alec Stewart was the last England captain to be sacked for on-field woes back in 1999 . New era? The ECB supported Cook despite sacking Kevin Pietersen but they may change their stance . âItâs a position I recognise,â said former England captain Mike Brearley on Friday. âMy record was rather like Alastair Cookâs since he got the last of his 25 hundreds. You feel awful, you begin to doubt and need a lot of support around you.â No doubt Cook has that support, but he also has his detractors and those who fear the end is nigh. One of those is his former team-mate and close friend Graeme Swann, whose resignation mid-series against Australia arguably did more damage to Cookâs long-term captaincy ambitions than his lack of creativity over field positions or predictable bowling changes. âI feel very deflated for Cook,â said Swann. âI feel for him as a mate. Hopefully heâll get a second chance in the match. I hope nothing crazy happens but I think everything is coming to a head.â Cook was adamant he would not resign after defeat at Headingley last month saw England lose a home series to Sri Lanka for the first time. Friends at Essex also insist he is ânot the resigning typeâ. But defeat at Lordâs on Sunday, and a failure to score runs, would leave Cook with nowhere to turn.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From the mysterious decapitated heads of âgladiatorsâ unearthed in the City to human remains from the infamous âBedlamâ psychiatric hospital, recent construction projects re-shaping Londonâs skyline have revealed some unusual historical treasures. And now prehistoric remains that suggest the presence of a campsite for cavemen have been discovered on the building site of the new U.S. Embassy in Vauxhall, South London. A Palaeolithic flint tool pulled from the site could be one of the earliest objects found in London, dating from anywhere between 700,000BC and 10,000BC. A Palaeolithic flint tool (pictured) pulled from the construction site of the new U.S. Embassy could be one of the earliest objects found in London, dating from anywhere between 700,000 and 10,000BC . A Palaeolithic flint tool could be one of the earliest objects found in London, dating from anywhere between 700,000 and 10,000BC. It could be a tool or a flake from a larger tool. Charred remains suggest campfires, which could have been used at temporary sites ideally based for hunting and fishing. A fish trap was found measuring 39ft (12metres) long. Archaeologists discovered tools from the Mesolithic - 10,000 to 4,000BC â and Bronze Age, between 4,000 and 2,600 years ago. Charred remains suggesting campfires, animal bones and a fish trap were also identified. Archaeologists from Museum of London Archaeology (Mola) also discovered tools from the Mesolithic -10,000BC to 4,000BC â and Bronze Age, between 4,000 and 2,600 years ago. The site in South London, which is being developed to make way for the embassy as well as a whole host of new flats and buildings, was once a river consisting of smaller channels with sandy and gravelly islands in between. Some of the islands were large enough and dry enough for prehistoric people to settle on. The fertile, marshy banks provided access to rich food sources and were a perfect hunting ground for prehistoric communities. Charred remains suggest campfires, which could have been used at temporary sites ideally based for hunting and fishing. These wooden posts might have been part of a fish trap used to catch dinner 11,000 years ago . Prehistoric remains that suggest the presence of a campsite for cavemen have been discovered on the building site of the new U.S. Embassy in Vauxhall, south London (marked on this map) The etymology of London is uncertain but it is thought that it is Roman in origin, despite evidence of prehistoric settlements stretching back thousands more years. The first recording of the name Londinium dates from the second century. There was a theory that it originated from a 'King Lud' but this has been discarded. Historians in the 17th Century maintained that the city's name is Celtic and means 'place belonging to a man called Londinos,' but again, this theory has been thrown out. In 1998 Richard Coates suggested that London is pre-Celtic for (p)lowonida -Â  'river too wide to ford' - suggesting that it is named after the River Thames. It could have a Welsh and Roman origin. Until 1889 the name 'London' only applied to the City of London, which was the Roman part of the city, but it now applies to the county and Greater London. The flint itself could be a tool in its own right or a âflakeâ from a larger tool and was probably swept away by water, making it difficult for experts to date the find precisely, Live Science reported. Other discoveries on the site include a prehistoric fish trap, approximately 39ft (12metres) long, and evidence of camp fires, demonstrated by scorched patches of earth and burned bones. âWe think that [the fires] are potentially marking a spot that people were coming back to seasonally,â Kasia Olchowska, a senior archaeologist at Mola. She believes that the ancient site was probably too wet to be a permanent settlement for ancient people, but the open space might have proved a good camp site from which to hunt and go fishing for food. âWhat we have found may be the earliest archaeological evidence currently known from London,â âIt will be interesting to see how this evidence relates to other prehistoric structures on the nearby Thames foreshore. 'We hope to be able to reconstruct and have a better understanding of the prehistoric landscape of a much wider area than at present.â The flint tools are a rare discovery in London as the city has seen so much development that fleeting glimpses of prehistoric people rarely survive. Dr Olchowska thinks they were made between 100,000 and 12,000 years ago. Experts will analyse the tools to establish firm dates and work out what they may have been used for, to paint a picture of life in London over 12,000 years ago.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . President Barack Obama said Friday he would act 'fairly soon' on immigration if Congress doesn't enact reforms of its own. Obama had said in June that he expected a list of policy proposals from his advisers 'before the end of summer' and he would 'adopt those recommendations without further delay.' The White House has since backtracked from that timeline after getting grief from Democrats facing difficult reelection bids this fall. Executive action on immigration could lead to a trouncing at the ballot box, they say, and Obama should wait until after November to make an announcement. President Barack Obama denied on Friday that he was getting cold feet about acting on immigration. Obama said he would roll out his own reforms 'fairly soon' if Congress didn't enact their own . Endangered Democrats worry that the Obama could motivate conservatives - who are already up in arms over the his decision two years ago to give illegal immigrants who came to the country as children amnesty - to come to the polls in droves. Asked about the link between the lag in movement on the issue and the upcoming elections on Friday, Obama said the crises in Ukraine and Iraq had been dominating his time as of late. 'I have to tell you that this week Iâve been pretty busy, focused on Ukraine and focused on ISIL and focused on making sure that NATO is boosting its commitments, and following through on whatâs necessary to meet 21st century challenges,' he said during a press conference in Wales after the conclusion of a North Atlantic Treaty Summit there. Immigration activists and hardline Democrats have become increasingly suspicious that the president is dragging his feet on purpose, however. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest poured accelerant on progressives' concerns on Tuesday when he confirmed to reporters that Obama may not act on immigration reform in the next few weeks after all. 'There is the chance that it could be before the end of the summer,' he said. 'There is the chance that it could be after the summer.' National Council of La Raza spokeswoman Janet Murguia said on Friday that 'the time for waiting has come and gone' and that the immigration reform advocates expect Obmaa to 'fulfill his promises.' 'The president, in March, when we asked him to take administrative action, asked us to wait, because there was still going to be a chance for some legislative action. And we waited then,' she told MSNBCâs Jose Diaz-Balart. 'And now there are some Senate Democrats who are asking us to wait again,' she said, according to The Daily Caller. 'You know, weâre done waiting. Weâve waited long enough. Every day that we wait, 1,100 lives are shattered as a result of deportation and separation.' Murguia was referring to a report in Politico this week that Sens. Bill Nelson of Florida, Al Franken of Minnesota and Angus King of Maine, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats - want Obama to keep his power dry until after November. All three men are are up for reelection this year. Obama said he would be reviewing a list of recommendations from his advisers on the way home from his trip to Wales and promised that he would be 'making an announcement soon' Illinois Rep. Luis GutiÃ©rrez, who represents a heavily Democratic district and is assured to win his own election this fall, said on Wednesday that Obama should not allow politics to stand in the way of his principles. In a conference call with immigration reform advocates,GutiÃ©rrez said the president needs to act 'in a transparent manner, before the election.' 'We should not put partisan politics and political â¦ considerations ahead of fairness, ahead of justice, and ahead of good public policy,' he said, per Politico. 'Democrats have to come to understand that you canât pick and choose when [immigrants] are good for you.' Earnest had denied on Tuesday that Obama was getting cold feet about taking action, but his assurances did little to calm progressives down. 'The president is determined to act,' Earnest said after indicating that Obama may wait to tackle the issue. 'That has not changed and it will not change.' Obama recommitted to rolling out his own reforms on Friday in a statement of his own. 'In the absence of action by Congress, Iâm going to do what I can do within the legal constraints of my office,' he said, 'because itâs the right thing to do for the country.' Leadership in the House, where Obama's favored immigration bill hit a snag last year, indicated this week that they would not take up in the issue during the 12 days they'll be in Washington ahead of the election, making it clear that Obama needs to go it alone if he wants to see reforms any time soon. The president said today that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder had begun providing him proposals. 'My expectation is that fairly soon Iâll be considering what the next steps are,' he said. Among the problems Obama said he was looking to address were the lack of resources on the border, the length of time illegal immigrants already in the U.S. have to wait for a court date and the absence of a pathway to citizenship for those illegals. The president indicated that he would use the flight back from Wales to study those issues and promised that he would 'be making an announcement soon.'","Obama told reporters at a press conference in Wales following a NATO summit that 'he would be making an announcement soon' on immigration .

"By . Harriet Arkell for MailOnline . If you're the son of a billionaire banker, dropping Â£50,000 on a passionate kiss with Elizabeth Hurley is no problem. Explaining it away to your wife, however, may prove a little more challenging. Julian Bharti, 27, showed no sign of worrying about that, though, when he successfully bid for a kiss with the 49-year-old British actress at Elton John's annual ball near Windsor last night. Standing up to claim his prize, the married father of three took to his task with gusto, clasping Hurley close to him and kissing her full on the mouth to the cheers of the watching celebrity crowd. But today Mr Bharti, who runs his own mining investment business and has homes in Beverly Hills, Toronto, the Great Lakes and Florida, told MailOnline his wife of five years, Christy, wasn't in the least bit troubled by his kiss with the model and actress. He said: 'She's totally cool with it.' Married businessman Julian Bharti, 27, was the top bidder for a kiss with actress Elizabeth Hurley, 49 . The couple, who met in 2008 and married in 2009, have three children, the oldest of whom, Sienna Monique Bharti, will be five this November. Mr Bharti, who was privately educated at The York School in Toronto, Canada, before leaving in 2004 and going to McGill University in Montreal, is the eldest son of billionaire founder of Forbes & Manhattan founder and CEO, Stan Bharti. After school he studied at McGill University in Montreal for two years before dropping out, saying: 'I felt I understood the capital markets business more than most of the professors'. He went to work for his father in junior roles before going it alone and setting up an investment banking business, Delano Capital Corp, in 2008 - happily for him, this was perfectly timed to take advantage of the bargains in the market. In an update written for his old school, Bharti said: 'I'm quite proud of my success at this age, but I do also admit that I had a huge leg-up into the business from my father.' That same year he married blonde Christy, whom he described as 'the girl of my dreams', beside the lake at Muskoka, in Canada's Great Lakes.

When his wife gave birth to Sienna Monique in November 2009, Mr Bharti said: 'I really couldn't be happier with life.'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . These extraordinary pictures show a five-legged cow, whose extra limb is rather bizarrely attached to its neck. Many believe the four-year-old animal brings good luck to whoever touches the extra limb - with some claiming it is a manifestation of a Hindu deity. Owner Laxman Bhosale, 35, tours the country with the animal - with hundreds regularly turning out to catch a glipse of the creature. A five-legged cow with an extra limb attached to its neck tours around India with its owner . The creature tours India with its owner because many believe it is lucky . Laxman said: 'Cow is our holy animal. We call her our mother. With this extra limb, God is indicating to us that we must respect the animal and seek her blessings. 'Touching the limb of mother cow will bring good luck and help you fulfill all your wishes.' After setting off last July from his home in Solapur, Maharastra, where he owns a cow shelter, Mr Bhosale's journey has seen him visit six states and 15 major cities. Laxman said: 'People used to come to our house to see the cow. People used to come from far off districts to seek blessings. A close up of the additional limb, which appears to be attached to the animals neck and side. Some believe touching the leg will bring good luck to them and their family . The hoofs attached to the limb. Some think the animal is a manifestation of a Hindu God . 'I decided to set out on an all India tour with the cow so that people across the country can see this wonder and take her blessings. 'The cow holds the essence of Hindu religion. I am only trying to further that cause.' Most people who come to see the five legged wonder pay their respects with some making donations. Laxman added: 'I passed through the entire length and breadth of Maharastra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The cow on the back of a lorry, ready to go to its next location. The animal first set off on tour last July . 'And everywhere, people welcome the mother cow and enjoy her blessing. Most people wanted to touch the cow's fifth leg.' Laxman has now arrived in New Delhi, India's capital. But he says it is only a temporary stop. 'I plan to take mother cow around the city for a few days. Then I will take her further down to Mata Vaishno Devi (a holy shrine) in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he added. 'I want all of humanity to benefit from the blessings of mother cow and her fifth leg.'

"By . Paul Hirst . Ryan Giggs wants to sign off his spell as Manchester United manager by leading the club into the Europa League. Giggs' final act as interim United boss will come on Sunday when he takes his team to Southampton for the last match of what has been a dreadful campaign. Ever since he made his debut back in 1991, Giggs has never ended a season without having the prospect of European football to look forward to after the summer break. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Giggs talk ahead of the final game of the season . All smiles: Interim manager Ryan Giggs has said that Manchester United main aim remains getting into Europe . Resurgent: Wayne Rooney has scored 17 league goals this season despite facing time out on the sidelines . Lifetime Achievement: Giggs received the lifetime achievement award this year's United Awards dinner . But this year United are looking increasingly likely to finish outside the qualification places. Already without a chance of making the Champions League, United will miss out on the Europa League unless they beat Southampton and Tottenham lose at home to Aston Villa. Many United fans want their team to finish seventh. The Europa League is far less prestigious than the Champions League and not qualifying for Europe can help a team's domestic fortunes - as everyone has seen with Liverpool this year. Giggs does not agree with those who say the Europa League would be more trouble than it is worth, though. 'I maintain my stance, we want to be in Europe,' United's interim player-manager said. 'We can only qualify for the Europa League and we will carry on trying to do that. 'It would have been in our hands now if we had beaten Sunderland (last week) because Tottenham lost (to West Ham). 'That was disappointing for us.' Europe or no Europe, whether Giggs will be involved with United - either as a player or a coach - is still up in the air. 'I am going to take a holiday as soon as the season finishes and discuss with family and friends what to do next,"" said the Welshman, who came off the bench for a 20-minute cameo in the 3-1 win over Hull on Tuesday night. 'It is not something I am thinking too much about, but I will.' The skills are still there - that much was evident when he went tearing down the left wing at Old Trafford in midweek. Farewell: Nemanja Vidic played his last home match for United on Tuesday with the defender set to move . Below par: Javier Hernandez has endured a below par season and struggled to get into the squad . It is just a question of whether Giggs is ready to commit himself to another year of strict diet, fitness regimes, and the pressure of performing for a new manager, expected to be Louis van Gaal. When Giggs took the microphone and addressed the 75,000 plus fans inside Old Trafford after the Hull win, it seemed like it was the end of an era. Giggs' future is still up the air while Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra both could leave the club next month. United are yet to exercise their option to keep Ferdinand for another year. Under the terms of his current deal, Evra has the option to extend his contract, but he has yet to do so. Part of Giggs' mission when he was appointed interim manager was to lift the spirits of the dressing room and he has certainly done that. Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie and Anders Lindegaard, who compared Giggs to Pep Guardiola, have all said Giggs has made a huge impact since taking over from David Moyes, who was sacked just 10 months into a six-year contract. Don't go! Fans hold up a banner begging their beloved player/manager not to retire at the end of the season . New beginning: Some United fans are hoping that the class of 92 will be in charge for a long time to come . Striker Javier Hernandez added his name to that list at the club's annual awards ceremony.'He has been incredible,' the Mexican told MUTV. 'There are no words that can describe him. 'You don't know if he is going to stay here next year, but for these games it has been unbelievable to have played for Ryan Giggs.' Not good enough: David Moyes lost his job at the helm for Manchester United after just 10 months . Nicky Butt, a fellow Class of '92 graduate who has been a member of Giggs' backroom staff in his three matches in charge, has been impressed by how his former team-mate has taken to management. 'He has stepped up really well,' Butt said. 'It's difficult for him because he has played with (this squad) for a long time - he knows them as friends, so not to drop them has been difficult for him but he is a mentally strong lad. 'He has taken to it like a duck to water.'","Manchester United manager wants Manchester United to be playing in Europe next season .

"By . Fiona Macrae . The British Heart Foundation described the research as 'an exciting development' but stressed that early diagnosis is essential . A cheap, simple blood test could save thousands from life-threatening blood pressure problems each year, scientists claimed last night. Research from Cambridge University suggests at least one in ten of Britainâs 16million patients with high blood pressure could be cured if diagnosed early. The study centres around a form of the condition caused by tiny, benign tumours of the adrenal gland, a hormone-producing organ on top of the kidney. Although it is particularly dangerous, it can be detected with a Â£15 test and wiped out by removing the tumours with keyhole surgery. This would remove the need for life-long blood pressure drugs and would also greatly reduce the odds of heart attacks, strokes and other potentially fatal conditions. The treatment works best for the under-forties, and up to 10,000 men and women in their twenties and thirties could benefit each year. The British Heart Foundation described the research as âan exciting developmentâ, but stressed that early diagnosis was essential. High blood pressure affects a third of adults and trebles the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Known as the silent killer, because the symptoms often go unnoticed until it is too late, it is the single biggest cause of death worldwide. The type caused by benign tumours of the adrenal gland is especially worrying. Patients are five times more likely to have a heart attack than those whose blood pressure has been increased by other factors, such as smoking or stress. Doctors have long known that the tumours increase blood pressure, but it was thought only a relatively small number of patients were affected. However, the Cambridge study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, suggests these adrenal tumours are responsible for one in ten cases of the condition. Researchers took enhanced scans of men and women with high blood pressure to detect the tumours, which can be just 3mm across. They then removed the growths and analysed their DNA. The tumours were long known to increase blood pressure but it had been thought they were behind a relatively small number of cases . This showed the vast majority to have a mutation that increases production of aldosterone, a hormone that raises blood pressure. Professor Morris Brown, of the team . that carried out the study, said: âWe think these could be present in up . to 10 per cent of all people with high blood pressure. âThese have to be diagnosed in young . people if removing them is going to completely remove the high blood . pressure and save them from a lifetime of drugs.â The tumours can be detected by an . âexquisitely accurateâ and inexpensive blood test and then removed. Patients typically need two days in hospital for keyhole surgery and a . fortnight off work. The operation works best in the under-forties, when removing the tumours should mean blood pressure returns to normal. As the tumours do not grow back, the patient is cured and no longer needs medication. At the moment, this operation is done only about 300 times year. Professor Brown, an honorary . consultant physician at Addenbrookeâs Hospital in Cambridge, estimates . the number who could benefit is around 30 times higher. He wants those in their twenties and . thirties whose blood pressure is found to be high during a routine . doctorâs appointment to be given the blood test. He added: âMost people have their blood pressure tested at least every five years.â Although the operation can be done on . those over 40, it is lessÂ  successful because years of high blood . pressure have taken their toll on the body. Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the . British Heart Foundation, which part-funded the study, said: âIt is an . exciting development, as this group of patients can be completely cured . of high blood pressure.â","At least 10% of the 16 million .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Snejana Farberov for Mail online . An Arizona man accused of kidnapping and killing his friend's 8-year-old daughter had been smoking methamphetamine all day before the child was reported missing, according to police. A probable cause affidavit released Tuesday stated that Justin Rector, 26, of Bullhead City, told police that he had been getting high in an upstairs bedroom of his mother's home where Isabella 'Bella' Grogan-Cannella lived with her family. The 8-year-old girl went missing while playing hide-go-seek with Rector September 1. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Justin James Rector, 26 (left), told police he had been smoking meth in the hours before Bella Grogan-Cannella, right, was reported missing September 1 . Bella's body was discovered buried a shallow grave two days later a half mile from her Bullhead City home. An autopsy determined that the little girl died of asphyxiation by strangulation. Grogan-Cannella was found naked from the waist own, raising suspicions that she may have been sexually assaulted. Recort was indicted last Thursday on first-degree murder, felony counts of child abuse, abandonment of a dead body and kidnapping a minor under the age of 15. He is being held in jail without bond pending his arraignment Friday, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Justin Rector had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before she went missing in the early hours of September 1, Police Chief Brian Williamson said at a after the suspect's arrest. Bella's 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw the girl with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said. Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am. Later that morning, Rector allegedly stoles clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said. Police arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance. Killed: Bella's body was found in a shallow grave near her family's home September 3 . Grieving: Bella poses for pictures with her mother, Tania, who had reported her missing September 2 . When her body was found on September 3, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said. The 26-year-old family friend has been charged with kidnapping and murdering Bella, and police have not ruled out the possibility of additional charges. Rector has a longÂ criminalÂ history, including more than a dozen arrests in the past 10 years. Just hours after Bella was reported missing, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect. 'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote. 'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives. Suspect: Rector, who is also from Bullhead City, was friends with some of Bella's family members . Heartbroken: Bella's mother Tania was seen screaming at the scene where the body was found . Two weeks ago, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up. Bella lived at the Bullhead City residence with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father is not in the area. Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs. Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was ultimately found as relatives held each other and wiped away tears. The girl was discovered wearing the same green, ruffled, sparkly tank top she had on when she was last seen, police said. However, authorities said she didn't have any clothing on her lower half, and they still are looking into whether she was the victim of sexual assault. Scene: Her murdered body was found in this wash in Bullhead City, Arizona around noon on Wednesday .","Justin Rector, 26, has been indicted on murder and kidnapping charges in the death of Isabella 'Bella' Grogan-Cannella .

"By . Ap . Pizza Hut is testing out a lighter pizza in two U.S. markets as it seeks to freshen up its menu and regain its footing against competitors. The tests of the 'Skinny Slice' pies began this week at several dozen restaurants in Toledo, Ohio, and West Palm Beach, Florida. The pies simply use less of the same dough used for regular pies and are lighter on the toppings, said Doug Terfehr, a Pizza Hut spokesman. Lighten up: Pizza Hut is testing out a lighter pizza in two U.S. markets as it seeks to freshen up its menu and regain its footing against competitors. Currently, a regular pepperoni slice from a large pie contains 370 calories . Several fast-food and restaurant chains have turned to lighter offerings over the years as a way to update their images, with varying degrees of success. Burger King, for instance, recently said the majority of its U.S. restaurants would stop offering lower-calorie french fries less than a year after the so-called 'Satisfries' were introduced. The test by Pizza Hut comes as the chain fights to win back market share. Last year, Pizza Hut sales fell 2 percent at U.S. locations open at least a year. Domino's, by contrast, saw the figure rise 5.4 percent while Papa John's saw sales rise 4 percent in North America. Darren Tristano, a restaurant analyst with industry tracker Technomic, noted that Pizza Hut may be suffering in part because it's the biggest player and has the most to lose at a time when the pizza business overall is seeing moderate growth of about 2 percent to 3 percent a year. But he also noted that the chain has failed to 'evolve its product,' while Papa John's has played up its quality and Domino's improved its pizza. Pizza Hut is owned by Yum Brands Inc., which also owns Taco Bell and KFC. Pizza Hut is testing out a lighter pizza in two U.S. markets: Toledo, Ohio and West Palm Beach, Florida . Pizza Hut's test varies in the two markets. In Toledo, customers can create their own Skinny Slice pies with up to five toppings, with each slice having 300 calories or less. In West Palm Beach, customers can pick from one of six pre-determined pies, with each slice having 250 calories or less. The Skinny Slice pies are intended as a lighter version of Pizza Hut's hand-tossed crusts; a plain slice of the regular hand-tossed pie has 300 calories, according to the chain's website. A slice of the pan pizza has 350 calories and a slice of the 'Thin `N Crispy' has 260 calories. Pizza Hut also rolled out 'Fit n' Delicious' pies more than a decade ago that had even fewer calories than the new Skinny Slice pies by going lighter on toppings. If the test proves successful, the Skinny Slice pies would replace the Fit N' Delicious pies, which are still available on request, Terfehr said in an email. Other pizza chains have tinkered with alternative crusts as well. Domino's introduced a gluten-free crust in 2012 that is still on the menu. During the Atkins craze, Domino's also tested a whole wheat crust but ultimately abandoned the idea. 'It did not take us very long to learn that people did not want that from Domino's,' said Chris Brandon, a Domino's spokesman.","Pizza Hut is testing out a lighter pizza in two U.S. markets: Toledo, Ohio and West Palm Beach, Florida .

"By . Pete D'amato for MailOnline . Health researchers tracking the size of American waistlines found that over a little more than a decade, Americans have added an inch of girth. The Centers for Disease Control published the results of a study Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association that suggested obesity is on the rise across the United States. Researchers suspect that sleep deprivation and overmedication are to blame. Expanding: Based on waistline measurements, American obesity is still on the rise, with belt sizes increasing by an average of 3% . The researchers used waistline measurements of adults over 20 collected by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2012 to examine trends among the US population. What they found is that Americans could stand to lose a few. In the period of 1999 to 2000, the average adult had a waistline of 37.6inches. By 2011-2012, the measurement was up 3% to 38.8inches. The study disputes some earlier findings that Americans had finally managed to stop obesity rates from increasing, as Bloomberg reported last year. The studies that finding was based on used body mass index instead of waist measurement. The Los AngelesÂ TimesÂ writes that researchers pointed out five demographics among the 32,800 people in the study saw 'particularly large increases.' The average African-American woman in her 30s had a waistline increase of about 4.6inches, while white women in their 40s saw waists increase by 2.6inches. African-American men in their 30s saw an increase of 3.2inches. Mexican-American men in their 20s increased 3.4inches while Mexican-American women in their 70s added 4.4inches. A person is considered abdominally obese with waistline measurements of 40inches for men and 35inches for women. A variety of factors, including sleep deprivation, were cited for the increase. The New York TimesÂ reports that sleep deprivation may change brain patterns that prevent a person from feeling full after eating. The authors also cited overmedication as well as endocrine disruptors, which are chemicals found in consumer goods like plastic bottles and in environmental pollutants like pesticides.","Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control studied waistline measurements of 3,816 men and non-pregnant women over 20 years old .

Police are looking for the remains of Katherine Lyon, ten, and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon, according toÂ Captain Paul Starks, spokesman for the Montgomery County police department in Maryland. The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations. Scroll down for video . Sheila Lyon, 12, (pictured left) and her 10-year-old sister Katherine Lyon (right) vanished on March 25, 1975, after walking for lunch to a mall in Wheaton, Maryland. Police began a new search for their remains last week . The girls walked just half a mile from their home to the mall with four dollars between them. They were seen walking home to meet their 4pm curfew but never made it. Police were alerted to the missing girls at 7pm. The Montgomery department has had investigators in Bedford County, Virginia, since last week. The Bedford County Sheriff's Office confirmed that officers were assisting 'with a homicide investigation'. Cold case investigators were also on the scene. 'Recent developments in the investigation have led law enforcement to the Taylor Mountain area of Bedford County,' the Bedford County Sheriff's Office said. The parents of the missing Lyon sisters still live in the same neighborhood and have asked for privacy, NBC reported. Their father was a well-known radio presenter in the area and their elder brother Jay became a police officer after his sisters' disappearance. In February, police said they had identified a convicted child sex offender in a Delaware prison as a person of interest in the case. Lloyd Lee Welch, 57, also known as Michael Welch, was at the mall the day the girls vanished and was seen paying attention to them.

Mincks said leads on the case have been followed over the last three decades, but efforts to find the killer were ramped up in January 2011 with the creation of a cold case squad in the sheriff's office. He said an anonymous tip apparently provided the necessary connection to charge Ruble with the crime. 'This case was a prime reason we put the cold case squad together,' he said. 'We had answered every complaint and followed every tip, and finally in 2011 we were able to begin nailing a few things down.'

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . A Lebanese man has been arrested after a sickening video emerged showing him wielding a knife and threatening to behead three Syrian refugee children left in his care. The footage, which was filmed in Lebanon's southern Nabatiyeh province, shows three terrified children sobbing uncontrollably as the man shouts and thrusts a large knife in their direction. At one point the man cruelly asks who he should behead first - to which the traumatised children, the eldest of which appears to be no more than seven years old, respond by pointing at each other. Lebanese security officials said a man was detained at the weekend over the incident pending further investigation, adding that the children's mother - who has reportedly confessed to enjoying the 'sick joke' - was also briefly detained before being released.

Traumatic: Lebanese security officials said a man was detained at the weekend over the incident pending further investigation, but added that the children's mother has confessed to enjoying the 'sick joke' The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Friday, shows three young children - a girl and two boys - crying and cowering in fear as a man stands over them shouting and holding a knife. As well as verbally abusing the young children, he also repeatedly asks them which one he should behead first - to which they respond by sobbing uncontrollably and pointing at one another in fear. A security official said the video proved to be a 'sick joke,' and that the Syrian refugee children had been left in the Lebanese man's care by their mother, his neighbour, while she was out at work. 'The intelligence branch of the Internal Security Forces has detained the man who made the video,' said the police official, adding that the incident had taken place in the southern Nabatiyeh province. Disgusting: The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Friday, shows three young children - a girl and two boys - crying and cowering in fear as a man stands over them shouting and holding a knife . Sick joke: At one point the man cruelly asks the who he should behead first - to which the traumatised children, the eldest of which appears to be no more than seven-years-old - respond by pointing at each other . A security forces statement added that the children's mother was also briefly detained. 'At the very end of the filming, the mother arrived from work and [said she] enjoyed the scene and asked [her neighbour] to send her the video.' The woman was released shortly afterwards, after pledging to treat her children better. While describing the incident as 'an isolated incident,' the official said the video was yet another sign of the effect of the Syrian war on Lebanese society. Lebanon hosts more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees, and fighting related to the conflict frequently breaks out in the tiny Middle Eastern country. Shocking: A security official said the video proved to be a 'sick joke,' and that the Syrian refugee children had been left in the Lebanese man's care by their mother, his neighbour, while she was out at work . Tears: While describing the incident as 'an isolated incident,' the official said the video was yet another sign of the effect of the Syrian war on Lebanese society . Last month, Sunni militants took a number of Lebanese soldiers and police hostage after clashes. They subsequently beheaded two of the soldiers, and widely distributed images of their corpses. 'We call on everyone to make sure we maintain our awareness, but of course this video shows the depth of the impact of the Syrian crisis,' said the police official. 'People are affected by seeing images of beheadings, and some people will start to imitate them. Poor children; they were terrified,' he added.","Syrian children were filmed being threatened with knife by Lebanese man .

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . A married Chinese man has been ordered to pay a woman Â£3,000 compensation for 'violating her right to virginity' because he pretended to be single when they slept together. The man, identified only by his surname Li, was fined and told he will have to write his younger lover an apology letter during sentencing at Pudong New Area People's Court in Shanghai yesterday. The couple first met online five years ago but did not begin a relationship until September last year, at which Li told the woman - whose surname was given as Chen - that he was a bachelor. Violated: The man, identified only by his surname Li, was fined and told he will have to write his younger lover an apology letter during sentencing at Pudong New Area People's Court (pictured) in Shanghai yesterday . The court rejected Li's claim that the couple had not had a sexual relationship and found him guilty of taking Chen's virginity by deception. Chen met Li on an online forum several years ago, but the couple only started dating last September - at which point Li insisted he was not already in a relationship, according to theÂ South China Daily Post. The couple had sex for the first time during a visit to Singapore later in the year, but Li broke off the relationship shortly after they returned to China and refused to respond to any of Chen's repeated attempts to speak with him. Frustrated by the lack of contact, Chen broke into Li's apartment in Shanghai in February this year - where she was shocked to discover he was living with wife of several years. A month later she filed a lawsuit alleging Lu hadÂ 'violated her virginity by deception' and demanding he pay her Â£50,000 in compensation as well as write her a letter of apology. Deception: There have been several similar cases of men being ordered to pay compensation for breaching the virginity or chastity 'rights' of women  in China. While some are purely symbolic, others result in heavy fines . The Pudong New Area People's Court agreed that virginity was a civil right that must be protected, adding that having sex with Li had negatively impacted on Chen's health and reputation, but ruling that a written apology and a reduced compensation package of Â£3,000 is the correct punishment. It is the first time a case arguing sexual 'rights' has been upheld in a court in Shanghai - although there was previously a similar successful trial inÂ Fujian province. In that instant a married man who told a woman he was single before having a one night stand with her was ordered to pay symbolic compensation of 1 yuan - roughly 10p - becuase he had violated her 'right to chastity'. He was also ordered to make a written apology. Compensation for a breach of 'chastity rights' has also been ordered inÂ Kunming and Shenzhen provinces, but only when the victims were virgins.","Man from Shanghai claimed to be single upon meeting his younger girlfriend .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been awarded France's top civilian honor at a low-key ceremony in Paris. The 72-year-old billionaire blushed and grinned as he accepted theÂ Legion d'Honneur - or Legion of Honor - from France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the Quai d'Orsay on Tuesday. 'Many thanks to Laurent Fabius and the French Legion of Honor, which embodies the ideals of liberty our nations share,' Bloomberg wrote on Twitter following the ceremony. Bloomberg, who stepped down following his third term as mayor last year, is in France to speak about climate change at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development conference. Tres bien: France's Foreign minister Laurent Fabius, right, awards the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg at the Quai d'Orsay in Paris on Tuesday . The Legion of Honor, which was created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, is the highest decoration in France 'created to honor extraordinary contributions to the country', according to the consulate. The award is divided into five degrees: Knight, Officer, Commander, Grand Officer and Grand Cross - and Bloomberg was promoted with the Commander grade. Bloomberg proudly shared a snap of the moment he received the award on Twitter, while Fabius also commended the achievement by tweeting an image showing the pair smiling together. The former mayor has long nodded to France's support in the U.S. Chuffed: The award is the highest decoration in France and honors 'extraordinary contributions to the country' Worn with pride: Bloomberg, who stepped down from office last year, wears his award following the ceremony . While in office in 2011, he co-hosted an event at the Statue of Liberty with then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy to celebrate '125 years of friendship between New York City and France'. There, Bloomberg said the U.S. should not forget France's support during the American Revolution, while Sarkozy agreed France and the U.S. shared 'bonds of blood' and a common value of freedom. And last year - in a show of just how much he appreciates the country - he famously spent $13,300 on a custom copper bath made by skilled French craftsmen for his five-storey Manhattan home. Bloomberg is not the first American - or New Yorker - to receive the award. Happy to be there: Bloomberg has previously thanked France for helping the U.S. throughout history . Pose: Bloomberg poses for photographers with Fabius at the Quai d'Orsay. He later thanked the minister on Twitter, saying the award 'embodies the ideals of liberty our nations share' In 2006, former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, who was in office under Bloomberg, was awarded the LÃ©gion d'honneur during a ceremony at the French consulate in Manhattan. Other notable American recipients include Walt Disney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bob Dylan, Danielle Steele, Julia Child, Toni Morrison and the later-disgraced General David Petraeus. In addition, most American veterans who served in France during World Wars I and II are inducted into the LÃ©gion d'honneur after they apply.","Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg received the Legion d'Honneur from France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on Tuesday .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has been criticised for using the term 'Shylocks' in a speech . U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has been criticised by Jewish groups for using the word 'Shylocks'  to describe money lenders during a speech. The term, which derives from the name of a vicious money lending character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice', is considered anti-Semitic. National leader of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxton, said Mr Biden 'should have been more careful' after his mishap at a conferenceÂ marking the 40th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation. Mr Biden was speaking about his son's year serving in Iraq, and recounted how people would speak to him about financial and legal difficulties back home. 'That's one of the things that he finds was most in need when he was over there in Iraq for a year, that people would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being... I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas,' he said in the speech, reported byÂ CNN. 'When someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden, uses the term ""Shylocked"" to describe unscrupulous moneylenders dealing with service men and women, we see once again how deeply embedded this stereotype about Jews is in society,' Mr Foxman said. The Vice President's office has not yet returned requests to comment. The national leader of the Anti-Defamation League said Biden 'should have been more careful' after his mishap, which occurredÂ at a conference marking the 40th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation . Shylock was the antagonist in Shakespeare's c.1596 play 'The Merchant of Venice', a romantic comedy centred around the merchant Antonio, but of which Shylock is by far the most famous and memorable character. He was a Jewish money lender, and the villainous nature of his character has raised questions as to whether Shakespeare held anti-Semitic views. Shylock is defeated at the end of the play, and forced to convert to Christianity. The word came to represent a negative stereotype of Jewish people relating to a meanness in relation to money, and to mean a heartless or demanding creditor. Mr Biden had been praising the Legal Services Corporation during the Washington speech - a group which provides lawyers to people who could not otherwise afford them. Shylock, 'The Merchant of Venice's' chief villain, is one of the most hated characters in all of Shakespeare's plays, and his name came to be associated with negative stereotypes of Jewish people. In the play, Shylock memorable demands a 'pound of flesh' from the merchant Antonio if he does not repay a loan. This is not the first time Biden has made a race-related slip-up - in 2007, he described Barack Obama as 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy'. And while talking about his home state of Delaware in 2006, he said: 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.'","Referred to money lenders who took advantage of people as 'Shylocks'

"By . Annabel Grossman for MailOnline . A 16-year-old mother and her boyfriend shot dead a man during an attempted theft of a PlayStation the victim was trying to sell them after putting an advert on Craigslist. The teenager's 16-moth-old baby was just a few feet away at the time of the botched robbery and shooting of 28-year-old Daniel John Zeitz in Sandy Springs, Georgia. The girl, whose name has not been released, and Nathaniel Vivian, 20,Â met Mr Zeitz in an apartment parking lot, posing as potential buyers, after he advertised hisÂ PS4 on Craigslist. Daniel John Zeitz, 28, was shot dead in a botched robbery for a PS4 he had advertised on Craigslist . Police said Vivian, who was in the driver's seat of the car, struggled with Mr Zeitz for the PlayStation while he was standing outside the vehicle. During the struggle the girl fired a shot from a .25 caliber handgun, Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. The bullet passed through Vivian's hand and struck Mr Zeitz in the side of his chest, wounding him fatally. The couple were later arrested when they went to Northside Hospital for treatment of Vivian's gunshot wound to the hand. Sandy Springs police Sgt. Ron Momon said: 'Brookhaven police were at the hospital interviewing the injured man, who told them he was a victim of a crime in Brookhaven, but later told them he was shot while he and his girlfriend were at the Legends of Dunwoody Apartments to rob a man of his PS4 video gaming system that was advertised on Craigslist.' Nathaniel Vivian, 20,Â is being held without bond in the Fulton County Jail following the shooting . 'Detectives also learned that the juvenile's infant child, approximately 16 months [old], was in the back seat of the car during the robbery and shooting,' he added. The baby was later turned over to the girl's relatives and the teenager remained in custody. Vivian is being held without bond in the Fulton County Jail. The Fulton County district attorney's office yesterday released a statement saying that the 16-year-old girl would be charged as an adult. 'This case has been forwarded to our office for review,' it said. 'After consulting with the Sandy Springs Police Department, we have determined that the suspects in this matter should be prosecuted together. As such, we have decided to seek prosecution against the 16-year-old minor as an adult.' Sgt. Momon said Vivian did not have an adult criminal record prior to the robbery and shooting and also said he did not know if Vivian was the father of the 16-month-old child. Mr Zeitz, from Roswell, was known by the name 'Phobos' in online gaming circles. One of his online gaming teammates set up a Go Fund MeÂ page to raise money for  funeral expenses. By Wednesday, the page had raised close to $17,000. One person wrote: 'I am so sorry for your loss. I can't even begin to imagine what your family and friends are going through. Your sons [sic] life was worth a million times more than a PS4.' Mr Zeitz (left), from Roswell, was known by the name 'Phobos' in online gaming circles.

"By . Associated Press . Colorado marijuana advocates are fighting back against the Cheech & Chong stereotypes and ominous anti-drug campaigns with a series of advertisements  encouraging users to 'consumer responsibly.' To get their message across, they are skewering some of the old Drug War-era ads that focused on the fears of marijuana, including the famous 'This is your brain on drugs' fried-egg ad from the 1980s. They are planning posters, brochures, billboards and magazine ads to caution consumers to use the drug responsibly and warn tourists and first-timers about the potential to get sick from accidentally eating too much medical-grade pot. 'So far, every campaign designed to educate the public about marijuana has relied on fear-mongering and insulting marijuana users,' said Mason Tvert, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, the nation's biggest pot-policy advocacy group. Fighting stereotypes: This new pro-pot billboard by the Marijuana Policy Project will appear near legal pot dispensaries in Denver encouraging users to 'start low and go slow' If you use marijuana: The MPP mocks anti-drug campaigns and promotes marijuana education that 'makes sense' The MPP plans to unveil a billboard on Wednesday on a west Denver street where many pot shops are located that shows a woman slumped in a hotel room with the tagline: 'Don't let a candy bar ruin your vacation.' It's an allusion to Maureen Dowd, a New York Times columnist who got sick from eating one on a visit to write about pot. The campaign is a direct response to the state's post-legalization marijuana-education efforts. One of them is intended to prevent stoned driving and shows men zoning out while trying to play basketball, light a grill or hang a television. Many in the industry said the ads showed stereotypical stoners instead of average adults. Even more concerning to activists is a youth-education campaign that relies on a human-sized cage and the message, 'Don't Be a Lab Rat,' along with warnings about pot and developing brains. The cage in Denver has been repeatedly vandalized. At least one school district rejected the traveling exhibit, saying it was well-intentioned but inappropriate. 'To me, that's not really any different than Nancy Reagan saying 'Just Say No,'' said Tim Cullen, co-owner of four marijuana dispensaries and a critic of the 'lab rat' campaign, referring to the former first lady's effort to combat drug use. A spokesman for the state Health Department welcomed the industry's ads, and defended the 'lab rat' campaign. 'It's been effective in starting a conversation about potential risks to youth from marijuana,' Mark Salley said. Up in Smoke: Activists aim to terminate stoner stereotypes made popular by the Cheech & Chong franchise . Snack responsibly: The campaign often alludes to Maureen Dowd, the New York Times columnist who got sick after eating too much pot . The dueling campaigns come at a time when the industry is concerned about inexperienced consumers using edible pot. The popularity of edibles surprised some in the industry when legal-marijuana retail sales began in January. Edible pot products have been blamed for at least one death, of a college student who jumped to his death in Denver in March after consuming six times the recommended dose of edible marijuana. The headlines, including Dowd's experience, have been enough for the industry to promote moderation with edible pot. 'I think the word has gotten out that you need to be careful with edibles,' said Steve Fox, head of the Denver-based Council for Responsible Cannabis Regulation. The group organized the 'First Time 5' campaign, which cautions that new users shouldn't eat more than 5 milligrams of marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, or half a suggested serving. The campaign warns users that edible pot can be much more potent than the marijuana they're smoking â and that the pot-infused treats on store shelves are much stronger than homemade brownies they may recall eating. The advocacy ads tackle anti-drug messaging from year past. Inside pictures of old TV sets are images from historic ads. Along with the fried-egg one is an image from one ad of a father finding his son's drug stash and demanding to know who taught him to use it. The kid answers: 'You, all right! I learned it by watching you!' The print ad concludes, 'Decades of fear-mongering and condescending anti-marijuana ads have not taught us anything about the substance or made anyone safer.' It then directs viewers to consumeresponsibly.org, which is patterned after the alcohol industry's 'Drink Responsibly' campaign. Marijuana activists plan to spend $75,000 by year's end and eventually expand it to Washington state, where pot is also legal.","Activists say anti-pot campaigns have relied on 'fear mongering' and insulting users .

"By . Snejana Farberov for MailOnline . Parking can be the death of you in Los Angeles, especially if you happen to be driving a hearse, as mortician student Samantha Kidner has learned recently. Kidner, 18, from Riverside, California, moved into an upscale apartment complex in South Los Angeles with her family two weeks ago, and almost immediately the complaints started about her vehicle started coming in. Kidner is a mortuary science student at University of Southern California who drives a grey 1996 Cadillac Fleetwood federal hearse, complete with a casket in the back. Scroll down for video . Death-mobile: Samantha Kidner, 18, a mortuary science student at USC, says the management of her building has banned her from parking her hearse on the premises of the housing complex .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . A 62-year-old woman formerly suspected of killing an Aspen socialite over a rent dispute has spoken publicly for the first time about the murder case. Nancy Styler was arrested in February after the body of 57-year-old ski resort heiress Nancy Pfister was discovered, with evidence leading back to Mrs Styler and her husband. But Nancy was cleared of all charges in June, when husband William Styler III admitted to hitting Pfister in the head with a hammer in her sleep. He is currently serving a 20 year sentence for the crime. Innocence: Nancy Styler (left) was arrested in February under suspicion she murdered Aspen socialite Nancy Pfister (right). The charges were later dropped when her husband admitted to the killing . Killer: Mrs Styler's husband William Styler III confessed to the murder in June and has since been sentenced to 20 years in prison . In an interview with ABC News' 20/20, Mrs Styler said she had 'absolutely nothing to do' with her former landlady's death. Pfister, who was once engaged to actor Michael Douglas, had rented her home to Styler and his wife while she vacationed in Australia and was found dead in a closet shortly after she returned home to Aspen. On a Facebook posting before her death, Pfister said that the Stylers were not paying rent. Defense attorneys denied that claim. Pfister's parents co-founded the Buttermilk ski area. Her assistant Katherine Carpenter, Â 56, was also arrested under suspicion of murder but later had the charges dropped as well when wheelchair-bound Mr Styler confessed. Dispute: The Stylers were renting Pfister's house just before her killing. She called them in February to say she was returning from Australia and that they had four days to get out . Helper: Pfister's assistant Katherine Carpenter (left) found her body stuffed in a closet and was once considered an accomplice as well. Those charges have been dropped as well . The Stylers had been living in Pfister's $4,000-a-month Aspen house when they abruptly received a call from her saying she was returning from Australia and they had four days to get out. That allegedly enraged the couple, and they had verbal fights with their landlady before eventually finding a hotel to stay in the meantime. Discovering that her husband committed the brutal murder came as a complete shock to Mrs Styler. 'The jail part was a day at the beach compared to learning that the person that you've been with for 32 years committed such an awful crime,' she said. Taken aback: Mrs Styler says she was completely shocked to learn her husband committed the terrible crime . Mr Styler allegedly went to Pfister's house while she was sleeping and hit her over the head with a hammer. Former flame: Pfister's parents founded the Buttermilk ski area and she was at one time engaged to actor Michael Douglas . 'He said, ""I looked at her peacefully while our life was being torn apart,"" and he said, ""I lost it,""' Nancy Styler said. Her body was discovered by Carpenter, three days later, stuffed in a closet. Mr Styler took several objects from the scene including the murder weapon, and hid them in the back of their shared car. His wife says she drove around in that car for days without knowing it. Investigators are still suspicious of how Mr Styler, who has trouble walking, could have pulled off the murder. 'We're thinking, you know, ""How could he physically do that?""' Agent Lisa Miller told 20/20. 'We took a break, and I asked Mr. Styler if he wanted to stand up. And he informed me he couldn't stand up. He didn't have the strength to.' If no evidence is uncovered, Carpenter can be charged again but Mrs Styler can not be thanks to a plea deal. Though she is no longer a suspect in the case, Mrs Styler says she is still judged for her husband's involvement. 'Why can't people believe this? Why do they have to involve me in this?' Mrs Styler asked. 'I say, ""Go back and look at things in your mind and think about how this could happen, and donât judge people unless you know the story.""'","The body of Nancy Pfister was found stuffed in a closet at her Aspen, Colorado home last February .

"By . Annabel Grossman for MailOnline . A firefighter was left battling to save his leg after an off-duty rescue saw him contract a vicious flesh-eating bacterial infection. Ian Buckley, from Augusta, Georgia, was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis following a dramatic rescue in which he leapt into the Savannah River to save a woman and her four-year-old-son. While hiking with friends at SaÂ­vannah Bluff Heritage PreÂ­serve Mr Buckley saw the mother and young boy stranded in a sunken kayak about 400 yards from the shore. He waded out the free the kayak and bring the woman and her son back to safety, but as he battled the rapids Mr Buckley cut his leg on  rocks below the water. Ian Buckley from Augusta needed six operations to save his life and prevent him from losing leg . 'She was just stuck. She needed help,' he toldÂ WRDW.Â 'Going across the rapids like that, it's slippery. You take a beating. I got knocked over a few times. 'All it did was scrape my shin, but I could feel the bruise. I knew I'd hit it pretty hard,' he added. Mr Buckley woke up the next morning feeling stiff, and when he began suffering flu-like symptoms he recognized the signs of infection. He elevated his leg and eventually went to his doctor, who put him on antibiotics, but the infection continued to worsen. Then, less than a week after the kayak incident, Mr Buckley felt a swelling behind his knee and went to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center at Doctors HosÂ­pital and saw Dr Fred Mullins, the center's medical director. Mr Buckley told The Augusta Chronicle: 'When Dr. Mullins saw it, I think he knew what it was straight away.' 'He said, 'I'll stop cutting when I run out of infection.' The first time I saw them unwrap it, I had an incision from just below my right knee to just above my ankle.' Mr Buckley spent spent eight days in the Intensive Care Unit during which time he was operated on four times. Now much of the tissue in his right shin is gone and walks around with a vacuum pack sealed tightly around his leg to keep the wound clean. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection that spreads quickly and aggressively causing  tissue death at the infection site and beyond. It can be fatal if not treated promptly and often results in amputations. The bacteria can make its way into the body through an insect bite or minor cut or abrasion. Bit although it can start with just a slight scratch, the infection spreads very quickly. The firefighter has to wear a special vacuum pump to help drain the infected wound on his leg . Mr Buckley stands next to the Savannah River in Augusta where he rescued a mother and child from their sunken kayak and at the same time contracted a vicious flesh-eating bacterial infection . 'As it penetrates deeper, it gets in to the fascia, the covering of the muscle,' Dr Mullins explained. 'The fascia doesn't have a good blood supply to kill the bacteria.' It's very uncommon. He said the burn center treats four or five cases per month in patients from across the region, and very few locally. Its most likely to occur in someone whose immune systems are already compromised, such as diabetics, cancer patients and people who have immunosuppresion conditions. 'But it can occur in people with good immune systems,' Dr Mullins added. 'Most people will scratch themselves and won't get it, but there are those certain cases,' He advised not dismissing any cut or a scratch as insignificant. 'If it starts looking funny, it needs to be seen,' he said. Mr Buckley has just had his sixth operation and said he will be out of work for at least six weeks. He said the incident will not keep him out of the river, but he will keep antibacterial wipes handy. 'It's like crossing the road and watching out for the car,' he said. 'I'm not going to stay out of the river, but I don't want to repeat it, either.'","Ian Buckley contracted the bacterial infection necrotizing fasciitis .

Despite their khaki uniforms and the lashings of camouflage face-paint, members of the Mexican Army couldn't help but look rather conspicuous as they hitched a ride on the subway yesterday. The soldiers were travelling across Mexico City to take part celebrations to mark the 204th anniversary of the country's independence movement from Spain yesterday. Some 22,000 members of the Special Forces streamed to the city's historic center to converge at the giant Zocalo square, accompanied by 157 military vehicles, 13 naval vessels, 44 airplanes and 24 helicopters. For Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the parade - which included Air Force jets flying low through the capital's skyline and hundreds of soldiers marching in formation - was a chance to display the military's power. It was also an opportunity for him to honor members of the new law enforcement corps, who since August 22 have operated in crisis zones to try and halt the wave of violence inflicted on the country by powerful drug cartels. As supreme commander of the armed forces, PeÃ±a Nieto passed the troops in review and then ascended to the presidential balcony to watch the parade pass below.

Joey Trevino, 37, credited the creature with keeping him going when he was alone in the rocky waters off the Gulf of Mexico and all hoped seemed lost. The father, from San Antonio, Texas, had been on a fishing trip with his uncle and two friends last Saturday when their 25ft boat began to take on water and sank, ABC News reported. Joey Trevino, 37, was on a fishing trip with his uncle and two friends when their 25-foot boat sank in the rocky waters off the Gulf of Mexico Saturday. the father was adrift at sea for 30 hours before he was rescued . 'We noticed all the water coming on board and ... the whole front of the boat started going up,' Mr Trevino told the news channel. All three men were wearing life vests, but Mr Trevino drifted away from his companions, who were spotted by another vessel on Sunday and pulled to safety after 24 hours at sea. Mr Trevino waited alone for help to arrive and thought about his wife and children to give him the strength to keep going. 'You're looking at the clouds,' he said. 'You're looking at whatever to try to keep you focused.' Alone at sea, Mr Trevino said that as he drifted he encountered a porpoise which gave him the strength to fight on and eventually swim to safety. 'He kind of bumped me, and I kind of rubbed him, and he kind of changed my attitude right there,' Mr Trevino said. 'He kind of ... gives you hope.' Mr Trevino said the porpoise (file picture) changed his attitude and gave him hope of survival . Despite bumps and bruises, along with cuts on his hands and a hoarse voice, Mr Trevino was lucky to escape without major injuries.

The Cincinnati Inquirer reports that the first call that Oxford police received Sunday morning was for a skunk stuck in a beer can near the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house. Animal control officers managed to free the drunk skunk, but not before snapping police snapped a picture. Skunked: Police officer Matt Hatfield snapped a photo of the skunk found with a beer can on its head near the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house close to Miami University campus in Ohio . 'They said the poor thing was banging, couldn't see where he was going. So he was running into shrubs,' Sgt John Varley told the Inquirer. According to him, animal control successfully got the can off the skunk's head without being sprayed. Varley joked the skunk was released on his own recognizance. The Beta Theta Pi residence is located near Miami University, just northwest of Cincinnati. In spite of the Miami University frat being the founding chapter, Beta Theta Pi had its national charter revoked in February due to allegations of hazing. Varley says police have received calls before about skunks and other wild animals before. This one was the first he knew of that had to be rescued from a beer can.","Officers were called to the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house after the skunk was reported .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . The customised Captain America chopper Peter Fonda rode in 1969 classic 'Easy Rider' came to symbolise the counter-culture movement of the 1960s, and riding it has been described as like 'going out with Marilyn Monroe. Now, the iconic stars-and-stripes Harley-Davidson is going up for auction, and is expected to fetch between $1million-$1.2million, because it is the only one which remains from filming, and was used in the famous climactic  scene, in which Fonda is thrown from the bike. The seller is Michael Eisenberg, a California businessman who once co-owned a Los Angeles motorcycle-themed restaurant with Fonda and 'Easy Rider' co-star Dennis Hopper. Scroll down for video . Michael Eisenberg sits on the customized Captain America chopper Peter Fonda rode in 'Easy Rider', which is now expected to make more than $1million when he sells it at auction next month . The bike is the only one remaining from filming and is one of the most recognisable motorcycles of all time . Peter Fonda riding the Harley-Davidson as Wyatt in 1969 counter-culture classic 'Easy Rider' Mr Eisenberg bought it last year from National Motorcycle Museum and Dan Haggerty - perhaps best known for his roles in the 'Grizzly Adams' TV show and movies - who was in charge of keeping the custom-designed bike humming during the 1969 movie's filming. The gleaming panhead chopper with chromed hardtail frame is accompanied by three letters of authenticity. One is signed by the National Motorcycle Museum, where it was displayed for 12 years. Another is from Fonda and a third from Haggerty. The bike features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag. The bike features a forward-angled front wheel, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank . The gas tank was where the protagonists stored their cash in the film, and is signed by Fonda himself . The bike was a central part of the film, which was about two drug-using bikers who went on a cross-country journey from Los Angeles to New Orleans to discover the real America . 'Easy Rider' (1969) is a classic road film about two drug-using, long-haired bikers, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper), who go on a cross-country odyssey from Los Angeles to New Orleans in search of personal freedom and easy money. Four motorcycles were created for the movie, but only one is known to have survived. It was used in the final scene, when Billy is shot by a redneck, and Wyatt is blown from his bike while rushing to get help after the gas tank is shot. The film ends with the flaming bike set in the middle of the deserted road. 'Three of the motorcycles were stolen, even before the movie was released, which was a sign of the overwhelming power that these motorcycles had,' said Haggerty. 'They were never recovered.' The bike is being sold by auction house Profiles in History both online and at its California galleries . The chopper's fishtail exhaust pipes are just one of its distinguishing features which make it so valuable . Wyatt (Fonda, left) and Billy (Hopper, right) tear down a stretch of deserted road in the 1969 film . The Profiles in History auction house in Calabasas, California is filled with Hollywood memorabilia . After the film was finished, Hopper told Haggerty to keep it. Haggerty rode it often, an experience he likened to 'going out with Marilyn Monroe'. Parting with it was like having a 'child finally getting married and moving away and starting a new life on their own', he said. That new life was at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, run by a friend of Haggerty's. When the museum decided to sell it last year, Mr Eisenberg jumped at the chance to buy it. An 'Easy Rider' fan since childhood, Mr Eisenberg ran the Thunder Road House in West Hollywood with Fonda and Hopper in the 1990s, until it burnt down due to an electrical fire. For years he had wanted to buy the bike from Haggerty, and then the museum. 'I always wanted to own it,' he said. 'But once it sunk in that I actually had it, then I realised how important it was.' He added: 'The public needs to see it. It's that iconic. It needs to be on a podium.' Eisenberg said he plans to donate 'a significant amount' of the proceeds to the American Humane Association to honour Fonda's involvement with the organization. The auction is being held by Profiles in History online and at its galleries in Calabasas, California on October 18. The chromed 1,200-cc V-twin engine of the Captain America chopper is still in excellent shape . Mr Eisenberg believes the bike is so special that it needs to be on a podium for the public to see .","The classic stars-and-stripes Harley-Davidson is up for auction next month .

Wenger's side were soundly beaten in Germany, but would have gone ahead had the 23-year-old not fluffed his lines when one-on-one with Roman Weidenfeller. The manager, however, wouldn't criticise his new man. 'Danny will improve - we don't have to make a problem of that,' Wenger said.Â 'He had a very lively first half. He had two or three good chances, but couldn't finish them. There was one obvious one... We have to be patient with him.' Wenger has a point given experience.

Glenn Miller, 65, was found slumped in a corner of his dining room in a pool of dried blood on Sunday morning by a neighbour, it emerged last night. The shocked Frenchman told them his friend was dead and that bloody footsteps were visible on the floor of the room. Another neighbour reported hearing shouting at 11pm on Saturday evening but did not hear the sound of a gunshot. The visiting neighbour called police to the austere granite farmhouse at the hamlet of Traon Bras near the small village of Plounevez- Lochrist, only a few miles from the Channel coast in northwest Brittany close to the port of Brest. The austere granite farmhouse at the hamlet of Traon Bras near the small village of Plounevez- Lochrist, only a few miles from the Channel coast in northwest Brittany where Glenn Miller was killed on Sunday . Gendarmes sealed off the house and organised a search of the surrounding countryside by 25 officers but did not find any trace of the murder weapon or any clues to the identity of the killer. Described as a kind and pleasant man who liked life in France and who used to walk into the village dressed wearing a leather beret, Glenn Miller had no enemies locally and was popular, said local barman Jacques Goguer, 51. 'His sister who was from England introduced him to us four years ago and said he was her brother. 'We got to know him well. He was from England had played in a band as a guitarist in Canada. 'He had lived here in his house for four years. He inherited the house from his uncle when he died. Glenn's mother was a local French woman from the village and his father was English. 'Latterly he had had a problem with his hand due probably to arthritis. He said he couldn't play guitar anymore because he couldn't move his fingers much. 'He didn't drink a lot and he didn't seem to have a girlfriend. He lived alone in the house. Another villager Yvon Legadec, 55 said Mr Miller became known in the village for his leather beret.

Fears of violent clashed between Yes and No supporters have been raised after pubs were granted special licences to keep serving alcohol all through tomorrow night into Friday morning. Bars across Scotland which applied for the late licence will now be open throughout the count, which is not supposed to be finished until 6am on Friday at the earliest. With the mood in Scotland turning increasingly bitter amidst toxic allegations of bullying and intimidation, senior politicians and police officers described the plan for all-night drinking as âabsolute madnessâ. Scroll down for video . Fears of violence on referendum night have been raised after pubs across Scotland were granted special late licences . Clash: Yes and No supporters face off at a large pro-independence rally . It comes after claims Police Scotland have cancelled all leave as fears of trouble grow â which the force today denied. One senior officer said there were real concerns that tempers are running so high street fighting could break out between Yes and No supporters, particularly in built up areas. He told The Times: âIf itâs a No vote there is concern it will get ugly. âThe Yes campaign has been quite vociferous and there is a gut feeling they are already using any excuse to make trouble. âHouses with No signs still up will be particularly vulnerable, especially if people have been drinking for most of the day.â Aggressive intimidation has increasingly been a feature of the Yes campaign. Pro-union voters have endured stone-throwing, been called traitors and faced threats that their houses will be torched.

Intimidation: This No campaigner had an egg thrown at him yesterday by separatists (left) while 'Coward' was etched on a No voter's door in Edinburgh (right) The Yes campaign has been heavily criticised by Better Together for bullying and intimidation . The Golden Rule, in Edinburgh, is one of the pubs that has been granted a late licence. It says it will only allow new customers in after 1am to reduce the risk of trouble breaking out. Pro-union canvassers been called âloyalist scumâ and ordered to hand over details of supporters so their âhouses can be burned downâ. Even farmers have received anonymous phone calls saying their livestock will be set loose unless they take down campaign boards. With so many threats coming from the Yes side, senior politicians also heavily criticised the decision to grant late licences. Scottish Conservatives justice spokeswoman Margaret Mitchell said: âWhichever way this goes there will be some disappointed people and alcohol and high emotions don't really mix . Graeme Pearson, Scottish Labour's justice spokesman, added: âI don't know why there is a need to access alcohol on a night when such a serious decision is being taken.â Graffiti: A Yes supporter wrote this on the pavement in Edinburgh ahead of the referendum .

Meanwhile, a pledge by David Cameron to maintain Scotlandâs controversial public spending formula was yesterday branded by Conservative MPs as a âlast-minute bribeâ. Senior Tories warned the Prime Minister faces a âdeferred bloodbathâ over the inducements offered to the Scots to persuade them to stay in the UK. Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a âvowâ to the people of Scotland, including a guarantee to continue the Barnett allocation â which sees the Scots get more than Â£1,300 per head in public spending above the UK average. But even Lord Barnett, who devised the formula in 1979, said last night that it was âgrossly unfairâ and should be scrapped.","Many pubs have applied for late licences to keep serving alcohol throughout the count .

"By . Matt Chorley, Political Editor for MailOnline . Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Yateley in Hampshire today, has insisted he will not resign if Scotland votes Yes . Parliament could be recalled as early as Saturday, if Scotland votes for independence. David Cameron will come under immediate pressure to address the nation if the Union is torn up by Thursday's historic vote. The final result is expected around 7am on Friday morning, which means MPs could be summoned to Westminster this weekend for the most important speech of Mr Cameron's premiership. There has been growing speculation that if Scotland does vote for independence, Mr Cameron will have to resign, as the Prime Minister who oversaw the break-up of the Union. However, some economists fear a vote for independence could trigger a run on banks and a stock market crash. So Mr Cameron's first job will be to steady the ship and provide leadership to calm the markets. Many Tory MPs now say it is 'inevitable' that Parliament will be recalled this weekend, raising the prospect ofÂ the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands War. Previous Saturday sittings were ordered on the outbreak of World War Two in September 1939, the last summer sitting in July 1949 and the Suez Crisis in November 1956. A weekend debate in the Commons would be a chance for the Westminster government to set out how it will deal with Alex Salmond, and carving up the UK's assets, at a time when stock markets are closed. However, the move risks giving Tory MPs and others the opportunity to publicly call for Mr Cameron to resign. During the final Prime Minister's Questions before the referendum, Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh warned Mr Cameron: 'IfÂ we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions.' Today Mr Cameron signalled that he will resist calls to quit. Speaking to reporters during a visit to a factory in Fleet, Hampshire, he said he was determined to fight on to next year's general election. 'My name is not on the ballot paper. What's on the ballot paper is 'does Scotland want to stay in the United Kingdom, or does Scotland want to separate itself from the United Kingdom?'. 'That's the only question that will be decided on Thursday night. The question about my future will be decided at the British general election coming soon.' With the opinion polls on a knife-edge, there is dismay among Tory MPs at the prospect of a possible Yes vote. Even if the result is in favour of remaining part of the UK, some Conservative are angry at the way the three main party leaders have promised greater devolution of powers to Scotland while continuing higher levels of public spending. It would be the first time the Commons has been recalled on a Saturday since the Falklands War, and would be used to reassure the financial markets about the impact of the break up of the UK . With less than 24 hours to go until the polling stations open, 350,000 voters still don't know who to support . Mr Cameron sought to play down suggestions of backbench unrest, saying that the whole party believed in 'our family of nations'. 'The Conservative Party and all our backbenchers want to see the United Kingdom survive and thrive,' he said. The Prime Minister admitted that he was feeling 'nervous' ahead of the vote, but insisted that he was confident about the case for a No vote. 'Well of course everyone who cares about our United Kingdom - and I care passionately about our United Kingdom - is nervous,' he said. 'But I'm confident that we've set out how Scotland can have the best of both worlds - a successful economy with a growing number of jobs ... combined with the ability of Scots if they vote No to have even more powers and even more say over how to run their own affairs in Scotland.' Bookies Paddy Power today revealed the latest betting odds on the referendum outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh on the bare backsides of kilt wearing Scots . Banks have been transferring millions of banknotes from England into Scotland ahead of tomorrow's referendum amidst fears high demand on cash machines if the country votes for independence. It is still not clear what currency would be used in an independent Scotland, meaning that some Scots could rush to withdraw as many pounds as possible in the event of a Yes vote. In anticipation of the poll, extra supplies of cash have been moved north of the border to reassure Scottish account-holders that they will have access to their money, according to reports. As the polls have tightened over the past few weeks, the value of the pound has fallen while large companies based in Scotland have seen their shares dip due to the market uncertainty.

One said: 'This forms part of our contingency planning. We are, of course, monitoring the situation very closely from hour to hour.' Another insider told the Daily Telegraph: 'It is prudent for banks to stock up on demand. This happens normally in the run-up to Christmas, and in that sense the referendum is no different.' Banknotes are printed by the Bank of England, but their distribution is controlled by a small group of institutions including the Post Office, Barclays, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland. They have been delivering huge quantities of cash to banks in Scotland so they can stock up at branches and cash machines. However, the Bank of England would stand behind the pound in Scotland as well as the rest of the UK at least until March 2016, when the country is set to split in the event of a Yes vote. In another attempt to reassure banking customers, financial institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds have promised to move their headquarters to London if Scotland becomes independent, so they can enjoy the support of the UK Government.","MPs could be summoned to Westminster to hear first reaction to the result .

"By . Matt Chorley, Political Editor for MailOnline . Most politicians have been known to kiss a baby on the campaign trail. But it seems today Alex Salmond has been ready to pucker up for just about anyone. As the First Minister embarked on his final full day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow's referendum, he seemed ready to plant a smacker on almost anyone's cheek, whether they said Yes or No. Scroll down for video . Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond plants a kiss on the cheek of flower seller Katrina Paterson during a walkabout in East Kilbride shopping centre today . During a tour of Â Hyspec Egineering in Stewarton near Glasgow, Mr Salmond also kissed Anne Lorne Gillies - the Scottish Gaelic singer who has used her public profile to back devolution . Both sides in the campaign have stepped up their efforts to win over undecided voters, with as many as 500,000 people still said to have yet to make up their minds . Polls continue to suggest that the referendum contest is going down to the wire, with three separate surveys last night all putting support for No narrowly ahead on 52 per cent, with 48 per cent for Yes. There was new evidence today that the undecided voters, thought to be as many as 500,000 people, could be more inclined to vote No. But Mr Salmond today insisted he was confident voters would back independence when they go to the polls from 7am tomorrow. In an attempt to win over voters he embarked on a fresh charm offensive, posing for selfies and showering wellwishers with kisses during a walkabout in East Kilbride shopping centre today. And on a visit to Hyspec Engineering in Kilmarnock, he took the chance to kiss Scottish Gaelic singer Anne Lorne Gillies. He also travelled to Largs in Ayshire during his final campaign push, hailing Scotland's 'date with destiny'. Kissing the First Minister seemed to be the only thing people in Largs wanted to do on Wednesday afternoon . In the sunshine of Largs, Ayshire, it seemed supporters were queuing up to meet the First Minister, give him a hug and get a kiss . Mr Salmond has joked about the number of selfies he has taken during the campaign, as voters rush to record the historic referendum . Anyone with a camera wanted their own photo with Mr Salmond as he toured Largs during his final campaign push . Throughout the referendum campaign, Mr Salmond has been repeatdly asked to pose for selfies, as he was today with a voter outside the British Heart Foundation charity shop in the East Kilbride shopping centre . Mr Salmond also smiled for the smartphone cameras at Hyspec Egineering as the latest polls suggested the result is too close to call . On his final campaign push, Mr Salmond also visited the headquarters of Braehead Foods in Kilmarnock . Travelling around Scotland in a helicopter, Mr Salmond gave onlookers a thumbs up as he predicted his campaign for independence would win . Speaking on a visit to an engineering firm in Stewarton, Ayrshire, the SNP leader said: 'My confidence is based on what's happening in the streets and communities around Scotland. 'I think there's a very substantial movement towards yes because people understand this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the future of this country into our hands. 'When people go into the polling booths tomorrow they are going to vote for something, for a that vision of more prosperous but also a more just society, that's what's going to motivate people in the polling stations tomorrow.' Mr Salmond added: 'I think the movement is to Yes. I'm certain of that actually.Â I think we're being helped enormously by two things. 'One is the total negativity of the No campaign, it's a dismal, depressing no campaign. 'But also the positive message of Yes. We see in the employment figures today, a 45,000 increase in Scottish jobs, soaring beyond the UK level, Scottish unemployment well down, that's fantastic news for Scotland.' Thousands of Yes supporters tonight gathered in George Square, Glasgow as a show of support for independence . The gathering came as a new poll put Yes on 49 per cent and No on 51 per cent, suggesting the result is simply too close to call . Mr Salmond urged voters to ignore the 'arguments of politicians and the blizzard of statistics' and instead embrace the chance to put 'Scotland's future in Scotland's hands' There have been growing fears about intimidation from the Yes campaign, but today's event appeared to pass off peacefully . But in a barnstorming speech today, Gordon Brown tore into Mr Salmond, insisting Scotland does not belong to him or any other politician, declaring: 'Scotland belongs to all of us.' Speaking without notes, he urged anyone with doubts about the risks of separation to vote No to save the Union, adding: 'What we created together, let no nationalist split asunder.' The speech could become seen as one of the defining moments of the campaign, and reignite questions about whether Mr Brown should have fronted the No campaign from the start.","First Minister tours East Kilbride shopping centre and a firm in Stewarton .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . David Cameron, leaving a meeting of the Cabinet in London, insisted he was 'passionate' about keeping Scotland in the Union . David Cameron has insisted he has no regrets about his handling of the Scottish referendum â as it emerged he will not be heading north of the border again before tomorrowâs crunch referendum. The Prime Minister said he had no choice but to grant Alex Salmond a vote on independence, defended the âNoâ campaignâs negative tactics and insisted it would not have been right to put a third âdevo maxâ option on the ballot paper giving Scots the chance to vote for more powers instead of outright independence. Mr Cameronâs remarks came as polls last night put the pro-Union campaign just ahead of the Yes campaign with just a day of campaigning to go. Despite the race for independence going down to the wire, Mr Cameron will not be visiting Scotland again before the polls open tomorrow. But Mr Cameron, in an interview with the Times newspaper, insisted he was âpassionateâ about keeping the Union together. Asked whether he had sleepless nights over the referendum, he said: âOf course.â The PM also admitted it was his responsibility to convince voters to reject independence â despite only visiting Scotland a handful of times during the referendum debate. He said: âI care passionately. My head, heart and soul will tell me that it would be a tragedy for the UK to break apart. âBut I am a democrat, and I lead a democratic country, and when one of the nations of the UK voted for a government whose policy was to have a referendum, I had a choice.â He said he âalways thought this would be a tightly fought contestâ but added: âIâm not a pollster, so I canât really explain polls. My job is to help move them rather than explain them. The three polls released last night put the No campaign on 52 per cent, with 48 per cent backing Yes, after âdonât knowsâ were excluded. A poll by Survation for the Daily Mail showed a two-point narrowing of the lead since last Thursday. Mr Cameron also admitted he was concerned about the âintimidationâ tactics used by the âYesâ campaign, amid growing concerns over the behaviour of nationalist supporters. âThere has been quite a lot of that going on, and that does worry me,â he said. Scroll down for video . Yes campaigners in George Square, Glasgow, have seen support for independence surge in the past month . Mr Cameron made his last campaign visit to Scotland on Monday - urging supporters in Aberdeen to reject independence . Mr Cameron will be under intense pressure to resign as Prime Minister if Scotland votes to leave the UK tomorrow. Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell became the first to openly call for Mr Cameron to step aside in the event of a âYesâ vote â but his view is privately supported by many of his parliamentary party colleagues. He said: âI hope Scots vote to stay. If it goes wrong, however, the prime minister will have to decide what the honourable thing is to do.â Mr Cameron is also facing increasing anger within his party over the cross-party agreement to hand more powers to Scotland while also protecting the funding agreement which hands more cash to Holyrood than England. Influential Public Accounts Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin has called for Scottish MPs to be banned from voting on âEnglishâ laws. He also wants to see an âEnglish First Minsterâ and âEnglish Chancellorâ separate from a British government ruling on âUnionâ matters such as defence and foreign policy. Mr Cameron admitted yesterday that the question of whether Scottish MPs should continue to vote on English issues would âget more pressingâ in the event of additional devolution for Scotland. But the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown rejected English votes for English laws. He said: âYouâve got to recognise the minorities of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, thatâs why theyâve got parliaments and assemblies, thatâs the key to to the UK constitution â it can evolve and meet the needs of people. England is still 85 per cent of the population and has 85 per cent of the membership of the House of Commons.â","The PM said he had no choice but to grant Alex Salmond a referendum .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Unemployment has fallen by almost half a million over the past year in the biggest drop for more than 25 years, official figures revealed this morning. The number of people out of work now stands at just over 2 million, after 146,000 found jobs in the last three months and some 468,000 over the past year. In a further boost to the Government, employment jumped by 774,000 to 30.61 million while the number of people on the dole dropped below one million after 22 months of consecutive falls. Scroll down for video . Unemployment has been falling rapidly since 2011 and is now just above 6 per cent - the lowest for six years . The proportion of the workforce without a job is highest in the North East and West Midland, while the South East, East, South West, East Midlands and Scotland enjoy below-average rates of unemployment . Todayâs figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, also reveal that unemployment in Scotland â now at 6 per cent â is below the national average after 87,000 people found work over the past year. The unemployment rate across the UK is now 6.2 per cent â a six year low and down from 7.7 per cent just a year earlier. Ministers also trumpeted figures showing public sector employment falling to its lowest level on record - at 5.4million. Today's figures also show a continued growth in private sector employment - up by almost 800,000 in the last year alone. Compared to 2010 there are now over 2.16 million more people in private sector jobs. Young people saw the largest annual fall in unemployment since records began in 1984 â falling by 213,000 on the year â and has been dropping for the last year. There are now fewer young people claiming the main unemployment benefit â job seekersâ allowance - than just before the recession â having dropped by 133,200 in the past year and for 33 months in a row. But Labour said pay - including bonuses - for workers was just 0.6 per cent higher than a year ago. Stephen Timms, Labourâs Shadow Employment Minister, said: âToday's fall in overall unemployment is welcome, but the new figures have shown working people are seeing their pay falling far behind the cost of living. âPay excluding bonuses today is the lowest on record. Under this Government wages after inflation have already fallen by over Â£1,600 a year since 2010 and by next year working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874. âA Labour government will freeze gas and electricity bills, raise the minimum wage and get more homes built to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.â Britain's jobs boom has seen it keep pace with US unemployment falls, while Europe lags behind with 10 per cent of its workforce on the dole . But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: âCreating jobs is central to building a stronger, more resilient and stable economy. âWith millions more people in private sector employment under this Government, it is clear that our long-term economic plan is helping Britain to recover following one of the deepest recessions in living memory. âAll of our reforms are focussed on helping people off benefits and into work â giving people the peace of mind and security that comes with a steady income. âWith the number of people claiming the main unemployment benefit down below 1 million for the first time in 6 years, we are helping people to break free from welfare dependency, look after themselves and their families, and play their part in getting our country back to work.â","The number of people out of work now stands at just over 2m .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Robert Wilson, 28, was savagely attacked by four men outside a Co-op and suffered horrific injuries . A victim of a horrific assault who was stabbed through the face with a glass bottle has said the ordeal has 'ruined his life.' Robert Wilson, 28, was attacked by four men outside a Co-op and suffered a broken cheekbone and scars to his face and head. He woke in a hospital bed with his face covered in blood and his eyes so swollen he could not open them. Mr Wilson may never feel the right side of his face again following surgery to insert a metal plate behind his right eye. Recalling the assault outside a Portsmouth Co-op on August 31 last year, he said: 'They all just steamed into me with bottles and I hit the floor. 'They all jumped on my head, beating me on the head. I felt kicks in my face and then I was knocked out. 'While I was knocked out they stole my trainers and I was stabbed through the face with a glass bottle. 'I woke up about five hours later in hospital and when I woke up my eyes were swelled shut. 'I didn't know what had happened - I thought I was blind. I couldn't feel my face and I didn't know whether it was a dream or not. Mr WilsonÂ may never feel the right side of his face again following surgery to insert a plate behind his right eye . Jack Sharpe, 27, from Portsmouth, was jailed for five years and three months . 'The nurses said I had been horrifically attacked. My cheekbone was broken and my eye socket had fallen into my cheek.' The group who committed the attack, Harry Sharpe, 23, George Claridge, 27, Kenny Deacon, 25, and Jack Sharpe, 27, from Portsmouth, were jailed for a total for 17 years and three months between them after they admitted causing grievous bodily harm. Claridge, Harry Sharpe and Deacon  were each sentenced to four years in jail. Jack Sharpe was jailed for five years and three months.Â He was also convicted of possession with intent to supply a class A drug at Portsmouth Crown Court. Shockingly, Mr Wilson had known the men for most of his life and fears they could strike again. He said: 'If they can do that to me what can they do to someone else? 'I don't really trust people any more. Even the nurse said they didn't know how I survived. There was blood everywhere. 'I've had to move. I don't want to be in Portsmouth any more as I get anxious and the worry has made my mum ill. 'It was horrendous. It's ruined my life and it's going to affect me for ever.'

The severity of the attack meant Mr Wilson had to wait about two-and-a-half months for surgery. He added: 'I've got a metal plate underneath my eye to hold my eye in place. Part of my face fills up with fluid. 'I'm just constantly reminded of it every time I wake up. My face feels terrible and I don't really get a chance to forget it.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . A man claiming to be a British banker says he has quit working in the City in order to join Islamic extremists fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Using the nom de guerre Abu A'ntaar, the man is said to have told Russian media that he hated 'being ruled by laws other than Allah's' and was sick of the 'self-indulgence' of rich people in London. The man, who says he is a former business analyst, reportedly stated that he 'hates democracy' and is happy to be living under sharia law in the Middle East, claiming brutal ISIS militants are 'leading the way' and showing the world how a religious life should be lived. ISIS, which rebranded as Islamic State after declaring the foundation of a caliphate in the vast swaths of the Middle East under its control, was this week revealed to be the wealthiest terror group in history - raking in Â£3 million a dayÂ through oil smuggling, extortion, theft and human trafficking. Scroll down fro video . Militant: Using the nom de guerre Abu A'ntaar, the man said he has quit a lucrative finance job in the City of London in order to join Islamic extremists fighting for ISIS in Syria and IraqÂ (pictured) The alleged former banker turned ISIS militant, whose real name is not known, is said to have revealed aspects of his past life in conversation with Moscow-based news agency Russia Today. The state-owned broadcaster claims to have been exchanging encrypted instant messages withÂ Abu A'ntaar for the past month, but had a request for a video or audio interview rejected after the militant reportedly said ISIS' slick media department has banned him from taking part. Although he was keen for his true identity not to be revealed, the man reportedly said he had turned his back on a lucrative career in finance to fight in Syria and Iraq because it is 'the only place where the shari'a of Allah is applied fully.' 'I hate democracy and the self- indulgence of the richâ¦.I hate inequalityâ¦I hate the corporations who are trying to destroy this world because of tyranny,' he was quoted as adding. Jihadists: Abu A'ntaar says he is happy to be living under sharia law in the Middle East, claiming brutal ISIS militants (pictured) are 'leading the way' and showing the world how a religious life should be lived . Barbaric: ISIS rebranded as the Islamic State after declaring the foundation of a caliphate earlier this year . Abu A'ntaar is also said to have raged about a culture of peaceful protests in the West, saying: 'I hate that Palestine was never freed for 70+ years whilst we 'peacefully' held placards on the street.' Although he refused to reveal his exact role within the militant group, Russia Today said the man suggested he had been trained as a suicide bomber able to 'destroy' enemies 'at will'. The alleged former banker is thought to be among up to 1,000 Britons fighting for ISIS in the Middle East - among them the murderer 'Jihadi John', who is responsible for the sickening filmed beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Stephen Sotloff, and of British aid worker David Haines. The three sickening execution videos all show 'Jihadi John' who speaks with a clear London or southern English accent issuing threats to Western leaders before killing the men with a small knife.

Iraq's new prime minister said foreign ground troops are neither necessary nor wanted in his country's fight against ISIS militants. In his first interview with foreign media since taking office on September 8, Haider AbadiÂ flatly rejected American suggestions that ground may be required to beat the militants. Mr Abadi said U.S. air strikes have been helpful in the country's efforts to roll back the Sunni militant group, but stressed that putting foreign boots on the ground 'is out of the question'. 'Not only is it not necessary,' he said, 'We don't want them. We won't allow them. Full stop.' U.S. general Martin Dempsey yesterday told the Senate armed services committee that Iraq may need American ground troops to fight ISIS. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the move could be required if President Barack Obama's current strategy to fight the group fails to make significant progress. Numerous other British jihadists have appeared in ISIS propaganda and recruitment videos, with dozens more using social media sites such as Twitter and Ask.Fm to convince other Muslims living in Western nations to travel to the Middle East to fight alongside the Sunni militants. The majority of these Britons have joined the militant group after travelling on commercial airlines to popular tourist airport Antayla in southern Turkey, and crossing over the porous border into Syria. Such is the extent of the territory under ISIS control in the Middle East, that the border between Syria and Iraq has effectively been removed - allowing the militants relatively free movement across an area the size of Britain, and brutally oppressing a population of four million. News of Abu A'ntaar had joined ISIS comes as at least nine imams were revealed to be among 15 people arrested in Kosovo today in the second major operation in weeks to try to stem the flow of young ethnic Albanians joining Islamist fighters in Iraq and Syria. A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 15 faced charges including 'terrorism, threatening the constitutional order, incitement and religious hate speech'. Scale: ISIS, which is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), was this week revealed to be the wealthiest terror group in history - raking in Â£3 million a day through oil smuggling, extortion, theft and human trafficking . Spread: Nine imams were among 15 people arrested by masked police (pictured) in Kosovo today. The arrests were allegedly to stop the flow of young Muslims leaving the country to join ISIS . Armed: A Kosovan police officer stands guard outside the apartment of Fuad Ramiqi - the vice-president of the radical Islamic political party LISBA - during a police raid this morning . In the last such operation on August 11, 40 people were arrested on suspicion of fighting in Iraq and Syria or recruiting insurgents. Police said that among the imams arrested was an influential Muslim cleric from the Grand Mosque in the capital Pristina. Another was the the leader of an Islamic-rooted political party. 'The majority of those arrested are imams of different mosques belonging to the Islamic Community of Kosovo,' police spokesperson Baki Kelani said. Most of Kosovo's 1.8 million people are ethnic Albanian Muslims and lead largely secular lives.","Man calling himself Abu A'ntaar claims to have quit job in the City to join ISIS .

"By . Amanda Williams for MailOnline . A four-year-old boy left school and walked half a mile home on his first day - without any of the staff noticing. Reception pupil Jensen Hart was found in the street by a passerby who took him to his house after asking where he lived. His father Gary said he was baffled when he found his son on the doorstep at 1pm with the mystery woman. He claimed staff at Newington Community Primary in Ramsgate, Kent, had no idea the youngster was missing until he called them. Reception pupil Jensen Hart was found in the street by a passerby who took him to his house after asking where he lived. His father has claimed staff at Newington Community Primary in Ramsgate, Kent had no idea the youngster was missing until he called them . But the school insist Jensen had joined a group of parents as they left the playground. Mr Hart , 35, said: 'We had a knock on the door. It was some lady weâd never seen before and she had Jensen with her, which shocked us completely. 'She said he was playing in the street. He told her where he lived and she brought him home.' Head teacher Cliff Stokes said the boy was 'at no stage on his own.' He said: 'There was an unfortunate incident where a child managed to leave the school premises by joining a group of parents leaving the playground. 'All three adults who were walking out with Jensen looked at each other and thought he was with the other. 'When they realised he was on his own they were only about 20 or 30 yards from the school. One of them came back to alert the school and another followed him home. 'We knew within a matter of minutes. He was at no stage on his own. A parent from the school followed him home. 'The fact is a parent ensured the childâs safety until he got home. But we know it shouldnât have happened. 'I phoned the parents immediately and explained the situation and invited them to come up to the school. The mother came up to the school within 20 minutes but the father declined. The first thing I did was apologise.' His parents have complained to Kent County Council (pictured) and are demanding a 'proper apology' from the school . Mr Stokes said parents from the nursery come to drop their kids off at a gate at the school at lunchtimes. He added the school now has two people on the gate and that any child leaving the premises would be challenged by a member of staff. Jensen returned to school on Monday morning with his three siblings. His parents have complained to Kent County Council and are demanding a 'proper apology' from the school. Mr Hart, 35, said he and his partner Michelle Butters were about to go out for lunch when they heard a knock at the door. He said: 'I asked him what he was doing there and he said, ""I wanted to come home."" 'I asked the headmaster ""Why is he sitting at home? Why is he in our living room?"" 'I hung up on him because I was that angry - I didnât want to talk to him.' Mr Hart, who works at Tesco, or Michelle, 29, always walk Jensen to school with his brother and two sisters and Jensen followed the same route on the way home. He added: 'Anything could have happened in those ten minutes he was walking home. He crossed two main roads. Itâs really scary. 'It could have been so terrible. You give the school your children to look after and theyâve failed in that. 'If he wandered out of our house and was found down the shops I would have social services straight round, wouldnât I? 'He had to come out of his playground, into the main playground and then out the main gate. 'Itâs a massive lapse.

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A Premier League footballer who is fighting testicular cancer learned he had the disease from a scan following an on-pitch challenge that left him in pain, it was revealed today. Newcastle United's Argentinian midfielder Jonas Gutierrez underwent surgery and chemotherapy  following the discovery of a tumour last year. Speaking about his battle with the disease for the first time this week, the 31-year-old told how he was given the heart-breaking diagnosis after being tackled by former Arsenal player Bacary Sagna in a match in 2013. Newcastle footballer Jonas Gutierrez  has spoken about his battle with testicular cancer for the first time . Despite being diagnosed in 2013, the player only revealed on Tuesday that he had been diagnosed with cancer . The player had kept news of the illness to his family and close friends - even telling people he had shaved his head for a bet when they questioned where his trademark long black locks and facial hair had gone. But he says he has now decided to speak publicly about his battle to help show other sufferers that the disease can be confronted and beaten. Talking to Argentina's TyC Sports channel, he said: 'I had a very hard collision with Sagna in the area of the pubic bone and the genitals. From then I had a lot of pain that wouldnât go away. 'I spoke with the doctor straight after [the game] and he said: ""If it doesnât hurt then donât worry I donât think it is anything [to worry about]"". Then it was holiday time and I felt the pain more in the testicle. 'We started the pre-season, the season started and in September, October I noticed that the testicle started to become inflamed. 'I felt a pain when I put my underpants on; it was uncomfortable. I went back to the doctor and they told me to have an ultrasound scan and they detected a tumour and told me I needed an operation. Jason Cundy - diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1997. Alan Stubbs - diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1999. John Hartson - diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2009, which later spread to his brain. Stiliyan Petrov - diagonosed with acute leukaemia in 2012. 'I couldnât understand why they were using the word tumour and not cancer so I asked them:""âIs it cancer?"" and they confirmed that it was. I left the clinic crying.' The challenge by Arsenal's Sagna was not malicious and there is no blame attached to the other player over the incident. Gutierrez, who is currently single, flew back to his native Argentina for treatment and doctors in South America removed his left testicle in October 2013. After it was confirmed the disease had not spread to other parts of his body; the player was given the all-clear but told to return for a check-up in five-months. In that first check-up doctors found traces of the cancer and prescribed a course of chemotherapy, which Gutierrez is now on the point of completing. He has since started down the difficult path of telling fellow players and fans about what he went through. He said: 'No one really knew about it at first. Gradually you start telling people. Some people saw me without hair and if they were not close friends or family I would say I had done it for a promise. 'What are you going to tell them without telling them everything.' Gutierrez, pictured in 2010, said he was left 'crying in the clinic' after he discovered he had the disease . The collision between Sagna and Gutierrez came when Newcastle hosted Arsenal in May 2013 . Gutierrez was left writhing around on the floor in agony after the challenge and later had a scan . He added: 'Sometimes you think about things and then when  a problem, like the one I have to go through at the moment, comes along it makes you realise that all the other problems are insignificant. 'Obviously this is the most difficult game I have had to play but like all games it will have an end to it and the end is closer now.' Despite fears over fertility, he is certain he will be able to have children in the future. He said: 'When you have this problem they send you to the sperm bank and you leave various samples of sperm in case the other testicle in case the other one doesnât work. 'But I have every confidence that the other one will work. We have full confidence for the moment.' He said he was speaking about his battle with the disease publicly in order to help others fight it. He added: 'It removes some of the pressure talking about it and I also think it can help a lot of people who are passing through a similar situation to be strong and to fight and to see that these are situations that you can overcome and emerge stronger from.' Gutierrez, pictured in 2012, is the latest player to battle the cancer, following Jason Cundy and John Hartson . The Newcastle winger said doctors uncovered a tumour after a tackle by Bacary Sagna (pictured, right) Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15-44 and around 2,300 are diagnosed in the UK each year. The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in part of one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom. A microscopic image of a human cancer cell . People with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease. It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men. It is, however, one of the most treatable cancers. Ninety-seven per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis and 96 per cent survive for more than ten years. Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured - and can go on to live a normal life. The increase in survival - which was less than 70 per cent in the 1970s - is down to the development of the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. Although chemotherapy is the biggest risk to fertility, about 70 per cent of men are still able to father children. Martin Ledwick, Head of the Cancer Research UK Information Nurse team said: Itâs not inevitable that testicular cancer patients will lose their fertility and even if they do it can come back. 'It is also good to talk to the doctor about the possibility of sperm banking before treatment starts.'

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Karen McCann, 59, claimed just Â£443 in legitimate income between 2008 and April this year, but paid off her mortgage and went on expensive holidays . A school cleaner  has been jailed for three years and four months after running a Â£150,000-a-year cannabis farm from her home. Karen McCann, 59, from Leicester, paid off her mortgage and went on Â£6,000 holidays despite declaring only Â£443 legitimate income between March 2008 and April this year, a court heard. When police raided her home in March they found Â£18,448 in cash, along with 66 cannabis plants growing in a bedroom and loft, and a complex hydration system along with fans and heat lamps. Leicester Crown Court was told the plants could yield more than 7lb of high-potency cannabis per crop, worth around Â£37,600, with four harvests annually. Jonathan Cox, prosecuting, said McCann used the money to pay off the mortgage on the home she bought in 2004. He said: 'There was evidence of a lavish lifestyle and documents at the premises related to a Â£6,000 holiday in Spain.' The road where McCann lives in Leicester has properties worth an average of Â£94,000. Mr Cox added: 'She accepts it was going on since early 2012. The annual yield would have been thirteen kilograms, fetching just over Â£150,000.' 'She wasnât paying for any electricity, and saved thousands, because the meter was by-passed. 'It was done in a particularly dangerous manner, creating a fire risk. Cannabis separated into individual deals was also found in the airing cupboard.' McCann, a former dinner lady, admitted producing cannabis, abstracting electricity, possessing Â£18,448 of criminal property and money laundering. She told the court that she had not been claiming benefits while growing the Class B drug, and said she had been 'emotionally manipulated' into it by her former partner. McCann was convicted in 2007 for permitting her premises to be used for producing cannabis  - involving the same former partner - and was given a conditional discharge on that occasion. However, Judge Simon Hammond said: 'I believe this defendant went into this with her eyes open. 'Cannabis farms and factories are very prevalent and provide huge profits. When police raided McCann's house they found 66 cannabis plants growing in a bedroom and the loft, along with a sophisticated hydration system, fans and heat lamps. They also found more than Â£18,000 in cash . McCann worked as a dinner lady atÂ Merrydale Junior School until 2007 when she was convicted of allowing her home to be used to grow cannabis. She then worked as the school cleaner until she was caught again this year . 'In one year alone 47 cannabis factories were discovered in Leicester and these systems produce cannabis with very high THC, known as skunk. 'Skunk can cause serious mental health problems and is much stronger than cannabis that used to be imported from Morocco and other countries.' Sian Cutter, mitigating, said McCannâs previous partner had used her home and bank accounts to run the operation - although when she was arrested she refused to say who else was involved. McCann worked as a dinner lady at Merrydale Junior School in Leicester for 18 years until she was convicted in 2007, after which she went back to work at the school as a cleaner. Miss Cutter claimed her former partner later reconciled with her and persuaded her to give up work, promising to look after her financially. He put money into her bank account from legitimate profits from a cafe he owned, said Miss Cutter. But later he allegedly persuaded her to let him install another growing operation in her home, the court was told.","Karen McCann caught with 66 cannabis plants and Â£18,000 in cash at home .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Alan Walker, 67, was spared prison after a 13-year-old boy was injured when he fired his shotgun . A terrorised pensioner has been spared prison after he shot a 13-year-old boy to defend his home. Alan Walker, 67, from Thorneywood, Nottingham, pleaded guilty to wounding the boy, who had smashed his window and possessing the gun. Walker, who is fighting bowel cancer, pulled the trigger on his  shotgun, and the boy was caught by pellets from the exploding cartridges. Nottingham Crown Court heard yesterday Walker had only moved to the house two weeks before. Carol, his wife, of 42 years, had died from cancer in 2007 and he moved from their marital home in Boston, Lincolnshire, to be near his grown-up sons who all lived in Nottingham. But the day after moving in to his new home at the end of November, last year, Walker began to be targeted by youths. The bungalow had been empty for a year before it was bought by Walker for Â£125,000. During that, youths in the area had used his garden as a short cut to other streets on the estate. Walker told the youths walking through his garden that they were trespassing - but they responded by pelting the pensioner with apples. In the following days, there were further incidents of trespass with Mr Walker later admitting to police that he and the youths had 'exchanged words'. On December 6 Mr Walker was at home when the front window of his lounge was smashed. He called police and had the window replaced. On December 13, Walker sat in darkness in his living room as the situation escalated and he could take no more. His dining room window was smashed, as was a window on the Volkswagen car on his driveway. The pensioner's car was attacked and his front windows smashed at his home in Thorneywood, Nottingham . Walker was standing back from his window when he fired the shotgun, the velocity of the shots absorbed by the glass window, and the pellets spreading 25 centimetres, hitting the boy across the road. After the incident, Walker called police and then his son, breaking down as he told him 'I shot him with a gun', the court heard. Walker told police he feared for his own safety when he fired the gun. Michael Evans, defending, told the court Mr Walker had been plagued by anti-social behaviour from almost the moment he moved to his new home. Mr Evans added: 'Life in that house turned out to be a nightmare, like something out of a horror movie. He sat in darkened rooms hoping people would think he was out. He was terrified and could not sleep. 'On the night he fired that gun his car had been attacked and his front windows smashed. He genuinely believed people were going to come into his house and attack him with weapons. 'On that night he was terrified for his own safety. His motivation was to protect himself. He couldn't take any more. Then to be placed in custody for the first time at his time of life was a truly terrifying experience.' Dawn Pritchard, for the prosecution, said: 'The pellets of course did have a lethal potential.' Walker had a wide knowledge of firearms and shooting was his hobby. 'If he wanted to kill someone, he no doubt could have,' added Miss Pritchard. Judge Michael Stokes QC gave Walker an 18-month prison sentence, to run currently on both charges, suspended for one year, at Nottingham Crown Court . His victim, who cannot be named, told his mother he had been 'blown up' before he was taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre. His injuries were pellet wounds and not life-threatening. He was kept in hospital for two days with non-life threatening shotgun pellet injuries to his hand and head. He is currently subject to a Youth Rehabilitation Order. After the incident, Walker was arrested and charged with attempted murder  and spent ten nights in custody before he was granted bail. In July, Walker, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court to two lesser offences - possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and unlawful wounding.Â The pleas were accepted by the prosecution. Judge Michael Stokes QC gave Walker, who cried in the dock, an 18-month prison sentence, to run currently on both charges, suspended for one year. He said the pensioner was plainly convinced he was in danger that night, overacted and took hold of the gun. 'Anyone who fires a gun in these circumstances, in a built-up area, is really creating a tremendous risk of serious injury. 'However, I am perfectly satisfied, that when you did what you did you genuinely believed you were in danger. 'You were alone, feeling isolated, emotionally very distressed, believing you were going to be attacked and acted as you did in that frame of mind.' Afterwards Walker, whose gun licence was revoked, said he had given up shooting as a sport and was keen to revive his previous past-time of ballroom room dancing. He said: 'I have spent months convinced I was going to jail. The thought petrified me. At the time I fired that gun my life was all over the place. I had lost my wife, got cancer and moved to a strange town to be near my family. But I accept I should never had fired the gun even though I was in fear for my life.'","Alan Walker, 67, has been spared prison after shooting a teenager .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . He was the legendary British king who, according to prophecy, would return to save Britain in its moment of greatest peril. Now King Arthur Uther Pendragon, who claims to be a reincarnation of the legendary monarch, has issued a plea to Scots with less than 24 hours to go before the vote that could break up Britain gets underway. 'I do not wish to see Scotland leave the . Union,' he emphasises in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'I'd hate to see them go. I hope to see them stay better together.' Saving the Union: King Arthur Uther Pendragon has issued a plea to the Scots to stay part of the Union . Pendragon, 60, from Salisbury, leads the Loyal Arthurian Warband, which he describes as the 'political wing' of the Druid community. As part of his fight for 'truth, justice and honour', he is actively involved in several protest movements and will stand as an independent candidate for the second time during next year's General Election. But right now, it is the fate of Scotland that is on his mind, with Pendragon telling MailOnline that he would 'hate' to see the people north of the border vote to leave Britain. 'I can see that they've had enough of the Coalition government and . lets face it, Westminster isn't all that great,' he adds. 'But, like others who live south of the border, I don't want to see them go and I want to keep them in the Union.' Protest: King Arthur, and the Loyal Arthurian Warband, regularly campaign for change on civil and green issues . Support: King Arthur has thrown his weight behind the No campaign and would 'hate' to see the Scots go . Better together: The Prime Minister and Labour leader Ed Miliband have joined the fight to save the Union . Thought to have lived during the late fifth and early sixth centuries, the original King Arthur is believed to have led the fight against the invading Saxons. Tintagel, the castle in which the king is said to have been born, still exists in ruined form in Cornwall, although others have claimed that he was Welsh. Either way, according to medieval romances and the Historia Brittonum, Arthur was a great king who defended Britain from enemies both earthly and supernatural. In Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae [History of the Kings of Britain], Arthur is depicted as an emperor who established a kingdom that included Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and parts of Italy, Germany and the Netherlands). Modern historians often equate him with King Alfred the Great, the Dark Ages ruler of Wessex who led the fight against the invading Danes, eventually stopping them in their tracks. Whatever the truth of the real King Arthur, one thing is clear. According to prophesy, King Arthur and his knights will return to Earth to defend Britain at its moment of greatest peril, which, says King Arthur Uther Pendragon, is upon us now. Should the Scots heed his plea, Pendragon will return to campaigning on the other causes close to his heart: the environment, Stonehenge and the advent of a party-free political system dominated by independents representing their local communities. 'I'm going to be focusing on speaking to . the people of Salisbury about my belief in free, independent politics for . the people,' he says passionately. ''I don't believe in political parties. At the moment, you get . a guy who was born in Wales, lives in Scotland and represents Surrey. 'I would . like to see independents everywhere. It . doesn't matter which party you vote for - they are all as bad as each other. 'What I'd like to see is someone from Birmingham saying: ""I'm . from Birmingham and I can represent the people of Birmingham better than anyone else"". It's about freeing politics.' Along with his fight for political independence, King Arthur, who was born Timothy John Roth, has another battle on his hands, this time with English Heritage over access to Stonehenge. One of the leading lights of the British druid community, Pendragon has repeatedly clashed with the body over access to the site and over the treatment of the skeletons interred there. 'In 2008, they took 50 bodies from the Aubrey Holes [graves close to Stonehenge],' he explains. 'They said they were going to do scientific testing on them. 'I'm not against science, technology and all of that but when I asked whether they would put them back afterwards, they said no. 'I've taken them to court . over that three times. Because at the end of the day, to have those people dug up . and stored for future research is not OK. That is not the way to respect . the dead.' Divine: Like other druids, King Arthur worships the divine through nature and considers Stonehenge sacred . Warrior: King Arthur, seen here in an 1862 design, is thought to have led the fight against the Saxons . Modern battle: The modern King Arthur Uther Pendragon stands for truth, justice and honour . And that's . not the only battle Pendragon is fighting. Convinced that the world is . in greater peril than ever before thanks to corporate greed and . environmental abuses, he has joined the fight against fracking and also . campaigns on civil liberties. 'This is the endgame,' he adds. 'This is the time that the Arthur figure has . returned and I am it. I believe in truth, honour and justice. 'It's . important for druids to speak out although quite a few don't want to rock the boat. I don't mind rocking the boat - my . order was set up to do exactly that.' His order, the Loyal Arthurian Warband, was set up to give a political voice to the Druids and is regularly found campaigning on everything from green issues to housing benefit. In short, it's Pendragon's modern take on the knights of the round table. 'Was the original Arthur to be here now, he'd be doing what I'm doing,' adds Pendragon. 'The legend of Arthur has been . romanticised, changed, Christianised... What there really was was an Iron Age leader who rode . around knocking heads together and that's exactly what I do, only I use a motorbike instead of a horse.' And his message to those who doubt his claims? 'To people who think that it's nonsense, it probably . is - in your opinion. But not in mine. 'I'd say forget about all the King Arthur stuff because at . the end of the day, I want to be judged on what I do and what I achieve . in this lifetime. 'We fight for truth, honour and justice and anyone who . wants to follow that creed can follow us. Some people view me as their . king but you don't have to. 'But it doesn't really matter anyway because at the end of the day, my name really is Arthur and I really am a Druid king.'

"By . Harriet Arkell for MailOnline . Former West Midlands Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire, 46, appeared before magistrates today charged with money laundering and misconduct in public office . A former Ukip MEP has appeared before magistrates accused of a money laundering offence after a police inquiry into her travel expenses. Nikki Sinclaire, 45, who lost her seat in the European Parliament earlier this year, also faces a charge of committing misconduct in a public office. Sinclaire, of Shirley, Solihull, spoke only to confirm her full name, address and date of birth during a three-minute hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. The former MEP, whose lawyer said she strongly denied the allegations, was not required to enter a formal plea to either of the charges. The money laundering charge, brought under the Proceeds of Crime Act, alleges that she converted criminal property between October 2009 and December 2010. The misconduct in public office charge relates to allegations that Sinclaire submitted false and dishonest claims for travelling expenses in the same period. Dressed in black trousers, a blue scarf and a dark jacket, Sinclaire was given unconditional bail to appear before a judge at Birmingham Crown Court on January 7. The ex-MEP has previously described the allegations as 'ludicrous' and unfounded. In a statement issued in July, Sinclaire said she would be firmly defending herself against the charges, which related to a time when she was 'under the guidance and oversight' of Ukip. Sinclaire lost her seat at May's European elections after leaving UKIP and standing for the We Demand A Referendum Now party. She was charged in July this year after a two-and-a-half-year inquiry by West Midlands Police and the European Anti-Fraud Office. In a statement issued as she left the court, Sinclaire described the proceedings as 'a complete waste of taxpayers' money'. She added: 'The people of the West Midlands who are watching this will know from the work I did over five years that I was hard-working. âI completely refute these charges and I'm confident of being found innocent.'

"By . Harriet Arkell for MailOnline . An estate agent who let himself into a house he was selling and stole the homeowner's iPad has been ordered to do community service . Glenn Tuxford, 19, from Winslow, Buckinghamshire, had a key to Holly Junor's four-bedroom house in Aylesbury because it was on the market with his firm. But he breached her trust by letting himself in when she was out and taking her iPad Mini, worth more than Â£300, magistrates in High Wycombe heard. Scroll down for video . Holly Junor, 24, had her iPad Mini stolen from her house in Winslow, Buckinghamshire, by her estate agent . Miss Junor told the court she she thought she was 'going mad' when she returned to her Â£335,000 house and couldn't find the tablet in July this year. She used her iPhone's Find My IPad app to track her device, and watched as it moved across the town to Tuxford's address. Telling the court that a neighbour spotted the estate agent prowling around her home, Miss Junor said: 'I was able to track it as it was moved across town and to his address.' She added: What really scares me about this was that he was not an opportunist - it was obviously planned. 'Because I had only bought the iPad a couple of days ago and he had not conducted a viewing I don't why he went there in the first place. 'He knew I lived alone and my working hours and that I had no family living nearby. 'I've had to change the locks and I am still trying to sell the house so I had to give the keys to another estate agent after what happened. 'What he did was very unprofessional and I felt totally violated.' Tuxford admitted stealing the iPad mini, and was told to pay his victim Â£310 and do community service (file pic) Tuxford, who admitted theft, was ordered to do 40 hours' community service and also told to pay Â£85 costs, Â£310 compensation to Miss Junor, and a victim surcharge of Â£60. He has also lost his job with Taylors estate agents. PC Nicola Ambrose, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Tuxford committed an extremely invasive crime. 'Cases such as these can affect victims for a very long time - not only is their property stolen but there can be long lasting psychological effects.

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Brian Broughton had the end of his nose bitten off during the attack last March . A violent thug who bit off a man's nose as he walked to work has been jailed for 12 years. Brian Broughton, a father-of-one, was on his way to his factory job in Benton, Newcastle, when he was attacked by David Robson in March. After starting a fight with the 24-year-old, Robson bit off the tip of his nose and spat it out on to grass. The 22-year-old, who was on bail at the time of the attack for a separate violent incident, was jailed for 12 years at Newcastle Crown Court on August 29. Speaking after Judge Simon Hickey's sentencing, Mr Broughty recalled the moment he saw his nose 'flattened' on the ground. 'I ended up having a fight with him, but then I realised it wasn't going to be a fist fight. 'He didn't want to fight me, he wanted to bite me,' he said of Robson, who he is thought to have known for years. 'I was half knocked out and stunned. Then I realised he was biting my nose,' he said. 'I was shouting and screaming. It was some pain. I was just in shock. 'You just donât expect someone to do that. 'Real men donât bite people.' 'When I found my nose it was flattened and covered in mud and littleÂ stones. 'I had it in my hand. I can remember when the ambulanceÂ pulled up I was trying not to look at the window because I didnât want to see my reflection. 'I was scared to look.' Doctors at the Royal Victoria Infirmary were able to reattach the nose but Mr Broughton is still awaiting plastic surgery. 'Iâm back to normal now. 'Iâm back at work and everything is fine. I just want to get on with my life now,' added Mr Broughton. 'My nose has not fully healed but itâs much better. 'You canâtÂ really tell anymore. Itâs kind of grown back by itself so itâs not a bad asÂ it first looked.' At the time of the attack Robson was already on bail for an alleged stabbing in June 2013. The 24-year-old father-of-one was on his way to work when he encountered David Robson (right) in the street. After the pair began fighting, he realised Robson had latched his teeth onto his face and wouldn't let go . The man, pictured before the attack, is now waiting for plastic surgery to correct his face . The court heard how the 22-year-old was involved in an incident in which a man was stabbed under his arm. On August 29 Robson was jailed for eight years for the incident in March with a 34 month concurrent sentence for the prior attack. Judge Hickey however extended the first sentence by four years after considering the danger the man posed to society. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'This man is now facing the consequences of his violent actions. 'Let this serve as warningÂ to others that violence is not acceptable and we will take action.'","Brian Broughton was walking to work when he encountered David Robson .

Mr Skeates, 44, a blue badge holder, was waiting for a space in the disabled parking area as he watched the incident unfold. Onlooker Phillip Skeates spotted the police officer clutching a McDonald's bag as he was parked on a yellow zig zag lane in front of the Swindon town centre Sainsbury's, blocking a disabled parking space . Wiltshire Police haven't identified the officer but have apologised to Mr Skeates over the incident . He said: 'Being a disabled person, I think this is such a terrible thing to do. 'I was so angry because if anyone else had done that they'd certainly have got a ticket. This is an abuse of power. 'When he walked back to the car there were lots of people shaking their heads and tutting at the officer. 'If he'd have parked there to deal with a crime, I obviously wouldn't have complained, but I think this abuse of power needs highlighting. 'I thought perhaps he'd been called to an issue, but I could tell from his body language when he got out of the car that he hadn't. 'It was apparent he had all the time in the world and I was gobsmacked when I saw him walking back to his car with a big bag of McDonald's 10 minutes later.'

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . The owner of a wildlife park where a woman zoo keeper was mauled to death by a tiger has described how he fired a shot at the animal. Sarah McClay, 24, was pounced on in the keeper's corridor of the tiger house at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria before she was dragged by the back of the neck into a den and then to an outside enclosure. David Gill, who designed the tiger house and set up the park in Dalton-in-Furness from scratch, told a inquest jury how he ran to the scene when he heard on the park radio that male Sumatran tiger Padang 'had got Sarah'. Sarah McClay, left died after she was mauled by a tiger at the South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria . The park's owner David Gill said he ran to save Ms Clay's life and shoot the tiger but couldn't get a clear shot . He jumped out of a digger 80 yards away and ran towards a fence on the side of the enclosure where he saw the tiger with Miss McClay. Mr Gill said: 'He was looking at me and he was sort of sat there. I took real good care to look at Sarah. She didn't move at all. She was completely still, no movement in the slightest.' Staff members had retrieved firearms as part of their emergency procedures and he grabbed a shotgun from a colleague, he said. A maintenance worker broke down the entrance door followed by Mr Gill as they went into the corridor where Miss McClay had been working. The inquest in Kendal has previously heard that the corridor door to the tigers' dark den was open as were two internal gates which allowed the animals to roam in and out to the paddock. The area was made secure as efforts were then made to capture Padang and female Sumatran tiger Alisha, who came in of her own accord. Mr Gill said he then swapped weapons and took a rifle as he made his way back to the side of the enclosure. He said: 'I got a visual of the tiger. I could not get a shot because of banking and trees . 'Sarah was below the tiger.' Mr Gill said he ran as fast as possible to the tiger enclosure but the animal was standing over Ms McClay . A staff member then radioed to say she had a view of Miss McClay and the tiger from the top of the penguin walkway. Mr Gill said: 'I then ran like crazy to get round there. I could see the tiger but unfortunately it was stood right over Sarah. 'Again I couldn't get a clean shot without the risk of shooting her. I decided to to take a shot at the top of the tiger's shoulder which was the highest point visible but at the moment the rifle went off the tiger just ran off straight back into the tiger house.' Both tigers were then confined into the house which was fully locked and bolted, he said. The inquest heard that Mr Gill had 18 years experience of working with big cats . He added: 'Obviously everyone was on the way, the emergency services. 'The emergency procedure I will say went to plan. Everybody did what they were supposed to. I was very proud of how they all worked.' The jury of six women and four men has heard that systems were place in to ensure that animals and keepers remained apart at all times through indoor and outdoor compartments connected by lockable self-closing doors. Within the tiger enclosure was a light den and a dark den for the animals which keepers were required to enter in the course of routine duties such as cleaning and feeding. The court heard that a bolt on the top of the dark den door was found to be defective in the hours following her death on May 24 last year but it could not be said when the damage occurred. An environmental health officer told the jury that the bolt could not be held back and it would bang against the frame when it tried to close, which left a gap of between 20mm and 25mm. Mr Gill said he was unable to get a clear shot at the tiger as it was standing directly over Ms McClay, pictured . The jury has heard that the door was slightly open after the alarm was raised and was not locked either by the top bolt and bottom bolt, and was not padlocked across the middle. Mr Gill said he was with police officers as the door was later inspected. He said: 'It was the case I believe that the door did not close when it was held open at a certain angle. 'It did that once. I was holding the door open for quite a long time while they (the police) inspected the area.' He said it happened only once out of 10 to 12 times he went to close it. The inquest has heard that the Sumatran tigers were on their weekly fast on the day of Miss McClay's death but he said that lack of food would not have made them 'more aggressive'. He explained: 'You have to try to recreate what happens in the wild. The idea is to try to empty the system as nature intends. If not they become very fat and lethargic.' The jury was told that Miss McClay had fed the jaguar big cats in the adjoining enclosure shortly before the attack and had food ready in the corridor for an Amur tiger which was locked in a den. Mr Gill agreed he was a 'hands-on owner' and said he had 18 years of experience of working with tigers. He said the park was subject to a major inspection every six years and roughly annual spot checks. In that time he said no-one had ever raised concerns about the design or operation of the tiger house, he said. The hearing continues tomorrow.

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . A group of South West Trains clerks with more than 50 years service between them have been jailed for a ticketing scam which netted them over Â£150,000. The office clerks - three men and three women - sold Oyster cards they had already created and 'charged up' with funds and fake rail tickets to unsuspecting passengers at Richmond station in south west London and then pocketed the money. Their scam was uncovered in October 2012 when South West Trains bosses realised the accounts didn't balance at the Richmond station. A three month investigation was then launched by the British Transport Police and the group were arrested in January 2013. Six South West Trains ticketing clerks used fake Oyster cards and fake train tickets to scam the company . Olufisayo Dada, 35, who was jailed for two years, left, and Linus Okrah, 45, who was jailed for 18 months . The group operated from London's Richmond station and were caught after a three month investigation . The clerks, Linus Okrah, 45, of Wanstead, David Rudland, 67, of Surrey, Julia Caan, 33, of Brentford, Alicia Dunn, 34, of Luton, Grace Oyegoke, 33, of Kent, and Olufisayo Dada, 35, of Brixton, were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud between October 2011 and January 2013. Prosecutors at Kingston Crown Court said the clerks created fake Oyster cards which were preloaded with credit. The cards allowed passengers to complete their journeys, but their money was never given to South West Trains. The group pocketed Â£68,000 in the scam. The group also used ticket machines to create dodgy rail tickets for passengers travelling outside the Oyster card zone which earned them around Â£100,000. Dada . was jailed for 18 months for conspiracy to commit fraud and was given another six . months for possessing false . identity documents with intent. The group sold prepaid Oyster cards to passengers and then pocketed the money, raking in Â£68,000 . Alicia Dunn, 34, was sentenced to nine months jail and David Rudland, 67, was jailed for 13 months . Okrah was jailed for 18 months, Rudland was sentenced to 13 months and Cann and Dunn were both jailed for nine months. Oyegoke was sentenced to nine months jail, suspended for two years, and was ordered to to do 150 hours of community work. Detective Constable Becci Crampton said the group, who had more than 50 years service between them, threw away their careers 'for the sake of greed'. He said throughout their trial the group denied any responsibility for the fraud, instead claiming 'the irregularities had been caused by technical faults with ticket machines'. Tim Shoveller, Chief Executive of the South West Trains-Network Rail Alliance, said: 'This sends a clear sign that there is a severe price to pay for people who behave dishonestly and fraudulently. We would like to thank BTP and our own employees who have worked very hard in bringing this complex and detailed case to justice.'","Commuters unaware they were buying unofficial tickets and Oyster cards .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . They're as classically British as black cabs or fish and chips.Â Now, nostalgic Britons can explore a historic exhibition dedicated to the iconic telephone phone boxes. It's almost 100 years since the first public phone box was opened in London and the Avoncroft museum in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, has assembled a collection of every model of phone box to have graced the British streets over the past 94 years. Despite being on the streets since 1920, phone boxes took some getting used to as there were fears you could catch tuberculosis from a shared handset. It was only in the late 1920s that the Government confirmed they were safe to use. Today, there are still 10,000 modern phone boxes functioning in the UK. The K1 Mk 234 (left) was Britain's first national kiosk in 1920 but it was installed more in rural locations than cities. In 1926 the General Post Office introduced the K2 kiosk (right). At this time, telephone boxes were still a novelty  and the 'Open Always' sign helped educate people that the kiosk could be used any time of the day or night . The K2 kiosk (left) was Britain's first red Telephone Box. It was designed by British architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, in 1926 and over the next nine years some 1,700 examples were installed, mostly in London. Just over 200 examples remain on British streets and these are given Grade II listing status by English Heritage.Â The K3 kiosk (right) was introduced in 1929. It was intended for use nationwide, whereas the K2 kiosk was limited to London due its cost and size . The K4 kiosk (left) was designed by the Engineering Department of the General Post Office and introduced in 1930. It used the successful design of the K2 kiosk, by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, expanded to include a post box and stamp machine.Â The K5 (right) never entered full-scale production. Only a small number of sample K5 kiosks were manufactured, and no trace of these kiosks remains - pictured is a modern mock up . The K7 (left) was a revolutionary design and equally radical in the use of materials, compared to earlier kiosks. The General Post Office wanted a modern kiosk to replace the K6 and considered designs by three of Britain's leading post war designers.Â The K7 was produced in prototype form only and (pictured above) is a surviving example. Pictured right is the KX100 that was introduced BT, that was formed following the break-up of the GPO to form the Post Office and British Telecommunications . The inside of the old boxes are almost unrecognisable from the aluminium modern phoneboxes - with all models featuring a cigarette rest and a shelf to store telephone directories - with some even adorned with carpets and flowers by the local communities . From the early 1910s to the 1950s an estimated 500 examples were installed by the Royal Automobile Club. The club installed a number of different types, with the Hudlass sentry box (left) being one of the earliest RAC designs. Pictured right is the updated design that had a flat roof, rather than pitched one . The 'AA' sentry box (left) would have been a welcome sight for their patrolmen, offering shelter from bad weather while on the lookout for troubled motorists. The Automobile Association, usually referred to as the AA, began the introduction of a network of sentry boxes in 1912 andÂ and by 1968 around 1,000 examples were installed. Pictured right is the Police Box was made famous by the BBC science-fiction series 'Doctor Who', which first appeared on British television in 1963 . The K2, K3 and K6 were designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. He was born on 9 November 1880 and came from a famous family of architects. Sir Giles Gilbert Scott produced iconic designs in Britain including those for Liverpool Cathedral, Waterloo Bridge and Battersea Power Station. His design for Liverpool Cathedral was submitted in 1903, when he was just twenty-two years old. Knighted by King George V on 22 July 1924, he died on 8 February 1960. Red was a highly visible colour. The General Post Office's pillar boxes were already painted red so the choice of colour was an obvious decision. Originally Scott had intended his kiosks to be painted silver, with a 'greeny-blue' interior; but for the internal workings of the Post Office Britain might never have had a Red Telephone Box. Actor Peter Capaldi poses with the Tardis during a world tour to promote the new series of Doctor Who in Sydney this year . The Police Box was made famous by the BBC science-fiction series 'Doctor Who', which first appeared on British television in 1963. The Time Lord - the Doctor - travelled through time and space in a Tardis. In the series, the Tardis was meant to adapt and blend into its surroundings, but a fault left it frozen in the form of a Police Box. Through the fifty years of the television series, the Police Box has become internationally recognised, yet only around 1,000 examples were installed. The blue police boxes were once commonplace on British streets, but now just a handful remain - mostly in Glasgow. For short periods of time, the boxes were even used to lock up criminals.","Avoncroft museum in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, has got a collection of every model of British phone box .

"By . Richard Spillett . Housing inspectors found six hundred asylum seekers crammed into one 98-bedroom London hotel, it emerged today. One room at the Queen's Hotel in Crystal Palace had nine people living in it and there were at least four new arrivals to Britain bedding down in most of the building's other rooms. The local MP has slammed the Home Office after the huge influx of newcomers caused anger in the south London suburb. Council inspectors found 600 asylum seekers living in the Queen's Hotel in Crystal Palace, south London . It found up to nine people were crammed in each of the building's rooms, with some areas well over capacity . Local council inspectors visited the hotel, which is spread over a number of buildings, earlier this month. They were shocked by the sheer number of immigrants who have been housed at the site since it opened its doors to newcomers, who are put up at taxpayers' expense. One building - which is supposed to have a maximum capacity of 68 people - had around 100 people living there, which another building sleeping up to 500. Many were sharing a room with up to eight others in the crammed building and sharing a small en-suite bathroom. Labour MP Steve Reed says local people have reported groups of up to 50 people now hanging around the area's famous parks and fear services could be swamped. He said: 'The hotel is on the edge of our small but thriving shopping centre in a highly residential area. 'It seems highly inappropriate to place so many asylum seekers in an area like this without warning or preparation. 'Local residents aren't against immigrants, but are worried about the impact of having so many people who are new to the country move into the area.' It is believed the hotel recently changed hands and made itself open to take referrals from the Home Office . Pictures show the building was once a traditional Bed and Breakfast, with a snooker room and bar area . But concerns have been raised that it was not built to house so many people and may now be unsafe . Mr Reed added: 'Large groups of people have been seen in local parks and some have women say they feel intimidated when out and about. 'I am also worried about the safety of people living in the hotel, which has recently been converted into a hostel.' Mr Reed believes the hotel  changed hands earlier this year and started welcoming asylum seekers, but was quickly inundated with people sent by the Home Office. He has demanded immigration ministers visit the area and hear residents' concerns. The Home Office  insists it is doing all it can to reduce the number of people housed in the buildings after details of the council's inspection came to light. A spokesman said: 'We are taking urgent steps with our housing providers to reduce the number of people living at the Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace. 'We have ensured that the numbers in accommodation at this location meet appropriate requirements.' Local MP Steve Reed said the area, which overlooks the City of London, cannot take so many newcomers . Nearby residents have expressed concern about the impact on local services and women have reported feeling intimidated when walking through local parks .","Housing inspectors visited hotel recently converted into immigration hostel .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A previously unknown painting by John Constable has been discovered by museum staff working on an exhibition dedicated to the artist. The oil sketch, believed to show a kiln on Hampstead Heath in north London, dates to around 1821 and was concealed beneath the lining on the back of a painting of the nearby Branch Hill Pond. It will go on show in a specially-designed display case showing off both sides of the work in the exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Discovered: The oil sketch, believed to show a kiln (centre) on Hampstead Heath, north London, dates to around 1821, and is on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum . Hidden: Museum staff discovered the new work concealedÂ beneath the lining on the back of this painting of the nearby Branch Hill Pond in London . Masterpiece:Â The exhibition, called Constable: The Making Of A Master, includes The Hay Wain, perhaps his greatest work, pictured, and a sketch version of the painting . The picture was one of more than 300 sketches, drawings and paintings given to the museum by Constable's daughter in the 19th century. Museum director Martin Roth said: 'The V&A has been one of the leading centres for Constable research since the 19th century, following a significant gift of paintings, oil sketches and drawings from Constable's daughter Isabel in 1888. 'This exhibition refreshes our understanding of his work and creative influence. It shows that Constable's art, so well-loved and familiar to many of us, still delivers surprises.' The exhibition, called Constable: The Making Of A Master, includes his masterpiece The Hay Wain and a full-sized sketch version of the work. Constable, who died in 1837, was a farmer's son who started sketching the countryside of his native Suffolk before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The show, which runs from September 20 to January 11, also includes copies Constable made of the Old Masters and pictures from his own vast private art collection. Fresh perspective: One visitor to the Victoria and Albert Museum looks at this Constable work through a glass panel that shows outlines of the painting's key features . Pastroral influence: Constable was a farmer's son who started sketching the countryside of his native Suffolk before studying at the Royal Academy of Arts in London . Prints: Book plates on display in one of the rooms at the exhibition in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which will run from 20 September to 11 January . Despite Constable's work now fetching huge fees, he was not financially successful while alive . Born in Suffolk in 1776, John Constable is considered one of the foremost British artists. Largely self-taught, he was influenced by Dutch painters - and is best known for his landscape paintings in Dedham Vale, the area in which he grew up. Perhaps his most famous painting, The Hay Wain, is now exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum as part of theÂ Constable: The Making Of A Master exhibition. Finished in 1821, The Hay Wain was one of six large canvases depicting the area around Flatford Mill in Suffolk. Another in the series, The Lock, became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold when it fetched Â£22.4million at auction in 2012. Constable was a farmer's son who started sketching the countryside of his native Suffolk before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Earlier this year, a previously unknown sketch by John Constable that is said to be an early inspiration for his famous work The Hay Wain today sold for Â£42,000 - six times its estimated value. The small pencil drawing of a horse and plough was one of seven 'lost' works produced by the 18th century English painter which went under the hammer for a total of Â£222,000 (with fees added on), far exceeding the original expected sum of around Â£60,000. Despite his works now attracting huge fees, Constable was not financially successful in life. The sketches, and an eighth by Constable's son, Lionel, were bought in a London art store in 1952 by the current owner's father for Â£500. He did, however, have considerable success in Paris during his lifetime. He also struggled to gain recognition from his peers and was not elected into the Royal Academy until the age of 52. Between 1833 and 1836 Constable lectured on landscape painting at the Royal Institution, the Hampstead Literary and Scientific Society, and the Worcester Athenaeum . He died in March 1837, aged 60, of apparent heart failure, and was buried with his wife. His children John and Charles are also buried in the tomb.","Oil sketch discovered by museum staff is believed to show a kiln on Hampstead Heath in north London .

Orthopaedic surgeons in Scotland have said they will not be able to deliver the same standard of care in an independent Scotland and have attacked Alex Salmondâs âerroneousâ claims about the NHS. The NHS has been at the centre of the independence debate, as Mr Salmond has repeatedly claimed the only way to stop it being privatised is for Scotland to break away from the UK. But in an open letter sent to MailOnline, Scotlandâs orthopaedic surgeons strongly dispute that claim and have criticised Mr Salmond for his misleading statements. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond has been accused of lying to voters about the threat of the NHS being privatised . 85% of orthopedic surgeons have stated patient care would decline in an independent Scotland . Alarmingly, the vast majority also fear they would not be able to provide patients with the same level of care if Scotland breaks away from the rest of the UK. The orthopaedic surgeons say in the letter: âWe are concerned about the statements about privatisation of the NHS being used as an argument for voting âyesâ. âWe gather that there are still a number of people who may vote âyesâ because they feel they have to do so to save the Scottish NHS. âAs health is a completely devolved issue, this has allowed our health service to develop completely differently without interference from south of the border.â In a poll of orthopedic surgeons from across the whole of Scotland, 95 per cent did not consider there was any risk of an increase in privatisation with a ânoâ vote. Yet, worryingly, 90 per cent considered they would struggle to recruit and retain the same quality of clinical staff if Scotland was independent. A group of Scottish orthopedic surgeons have warned people not to vote Yes because of Salmond's claims about the NHS . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has threatened to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament over Alex Salmond's lies . Even more concerning was that more than 85 per cent felt they would not be able to deliver the same standard of care to their patients. The letter, which is signed by a third of Scotland's 180 orthopedic surgeons, added: âThe overwhelming majority of Scottish orthopedic surgeons therefore are seriously worried that they will not be able to provide their patients with the same standard of care with independence. âPeople must decide how to vote in the next 48 hours, but the reason for voting yes should not be to save the NHS and indeed there is grave concern in our community that this would be to the detriment of patient care.â Hamish Simpson,  a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery in Edinburgh, said: âThe SNP say that you have got to vote âyesâ to save the NHS, but that seems to be entirely erroneous as health is a devolved issue. âWhatâs so frustrating is that anything is being said to try and win the referendum, as if this was a standard election, yet this is far more than the selection of a political party for four or five years.â It was leaked by senior NHS staff furious with claims from Yes campaigners that the NHS is under threat if Scotland votes No. Supporters: Scottish nationalists both old and young gathered in Glasgow ahead of the referendum vote . Opposition: Unionists also turned up at the event and expressed their anger over the issue . Light-hearted: A Yes supporter with an enormous sticker covering her face . Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown threatened to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament over Alex Salmondâs âliesâ about the NHS. The former Prime Minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the SNP head on. Mr Brown said: âThe nationalists want you to believe that if an English Prime Minister sought to privatise the NHS in Scotland or cut its budget, Scots would be powerless to prevent this from happening. Scotland's health service will be at more risk of cuts in spending if Scots vote to leave the union, an independent report found. Figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed Scotland has been cutting health spending while there has been increases in funding in England. Edinburgh plans to cut NHS funding by 1.2 per cent next year compared to five years ago, the report found, while England is due to increase health spending by 4.4 per cent. As health spending is already devolved, the reports suggest the Scottish government has placed 'less priority' on funding the NHS than Westminster. It added: 'The Scottish government has chosen to protect the NHS in Scotland slightly less than it has been protected in England.' Paul Johnson, IFS director, said it was hard to see how an independent Scotland could spend more on the NHS than it could in a union where it will have significant tax raising powers. In the longer term, the fall in oil revenues and an ageing population could make for a tougher fiscal outlook for Scotland than the rest of the UK. âThey want you to believe that the Scottish Parliament is powerless to act to safeguard our NHS. âThey want you to conclude that separation is the only answer if you care about the NHS. This is a nationalist deception â a claim that does not stand up to the evidence and that is not supported by the facts. âWhat the nationalists donât tell you is that the Scottish health service cannot be privatised by Westminster because all decisions about our NHS are made here in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament, created by Labour in 1998, has full control over our health service. Elsewhere last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed that an independent Scotland would have to cut the NHS by the equivalent of 36,000 nurses due to the necessity of swingeing austerity. He urged Scottish voters not to risk the future of the health service by taking a leap into the unknown - saying that thousands depend on English hospitals for 'life-saving treatment'. His pitch came after 200 NHS workers, including respected doctors, wrote an open letter arguing that the service can 'ill afford the cuts' which would result in the event of a Yes vote on Thursday. In the letter, employees of NHS Scotland - including academics, GPs, consultants, porters, dentists, staff nurses, medical secretaries, pharmacists and trainees - spoke out against independence. They wrote: âWe love our NHS and believe that working for it, as we all do or have done, is both a privilege and an act of service to our fellow citizens. 'We are living through tough financial times and can ill afford the additional cuts that would surely come should Scotland choose the risk of independence ahead of the broad shoulders of the UK. 'Patients from Scotland can access the care they need anywhere in the UK. Independence would, at best, put them at the back of the queue and specialties would need to be replicated here in Scotland at huge additional cost.' Preparations: Staff at a polling station in Aberdeen making the final arrangements ahead of the vote count . Thumbs up: But a group of surgeons has denounced Salmond's plans for the NHS . Control over the NHS in Scotland is currently devolved to the Scottish government, led by Mr Salmond, and Westminster politicians are powerless to meddle with the service. But the SNP points out that the UK government retains overall control of the public finances, and could therefore reduce the amount of money available to fund Scotland's public services. They have said the âkey gainâ a âyesâ vote will give them is âcast-iron protectionâ against knock-on effects from âfuture Westminster cutsâ. Alex Neil, the health secretary in the Holyrood parliament, recently told MSPs: âThe consequences of a no vote would be reduced budgets as a result of privatisation, patient charges, fragmented pay arrangements for health staff, with further pay restrictions and austerity as a matter of ideology south of the border.â We are concerned about the statements about privatisation of the NHS being used as an argument for voting âyesâ. I gather that there are still a number of people who may vote âyesâ because they feel they have to do so to save the Scottish NHS. As health is a completely devolved issue, this has allowed our health service to develop completely differently without interference from south of the border. Despite orthopaedic surgery often being the first component of health to be privatised, 95% of a poll of orthopaedic surgeons from across the whole of Scotland did not consider there was any risk of an increase in privatisation with a ânoâ vote. However worryingly 90% considered that we would have difficulty recruiting and retaining the same quality of clinical staff if Scotland was independent and of even greater anxiety was that over 85% were concerned that they would not be able to deliver the same level of care to their patients. The overwhelming majority of Scottish orthopaedic surgeons therefore are seriously worried that they will not be able to provide their patients with the same standard of care with independence. People must decide how to vote in the next 48 hours, but the reason for voting yes should not be to save the NHS and indeed there is grave concern in our community that this would be to the detriment of patient care.","Orthopedic surgeons  release open letter critical of Salmond .

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline . Follow @@riathalsam . Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to leave Cardiff City on Thursday after the clubâs patience with results reached breaking point. The Norwegian was called to London for talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman yesterday after Tuesdayâs home defeat against Middlesbrough left them 17th in the Championship table. Owner Vincent Tan is not believed to have been at the meeting. A senior club source told Sportsmail that the former Manchester United strikerâs exit has been decided, with only the final details of his departure to be agreed. Confirmation from the club is expected this morning. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is on the brink of being sacked as Cardiff City manager . Solskjaer (left) looks dejected after Cardiff's defeat to Middlesbrough on Tuesday night . Dundee manager Paul Hartley has emerged as frontrunner to replace Solskjaer if he is sacked at Cardiff . Relations between Solskjaer and the clubâs hierarchy are said to be âamicableâ, but dire early-season results forced Tan to act. Former Scotland midfielder Paul Hartley, 37, who took over at Dundee in January and led them to the Scottish Championship title, emerged on Wednesday night as the leading candidate to replace Solskjaer, though Tony Pulis, MK Dons manager Karl Robinson and Glenn Roeder, who was pictured in the directorsâ box on Tuesday, are also in the frame. A compensation settlement will need to be agreed for Solskjaer, with the 41-year-old said to have been appointed on a staggering Â£4million a year when he was lured to Wales from Molde in January. The terms of his ârolling contractâ are understood to have been reduced after the club were relegated last season. Despite the clubâs relegation as the Premier Leagueâs bottom club â Cardiff were 17th when his predecessor Malky Mackay was sacked â Tan was determined to stick with Solskjaer, though it was made clear that promotion in this campaign was the only acceptable target. Enrique Kike Garcia celebrates after scoring against Cardiff for Middlesbrough . Solskjaer (right) applauds the fans as Cardiff lose to Newcastle to confirm relegation last season . Instead, Cardiff have plummeted after a promising start and are winless in four Championship games. On Saturday, they gave up a two-goal lead at home against Norwich and lost 4-2, and the final straw appears to have been the limp 1-0 loss against Middlesbrough at the Cardiff City Stadium. In all, Cardiff have won only five of their 25 league matches under Solskjaer. The poor results come in spite of vast investment in the squad, with Tan having spent roughly Â£16m on 17 new players since Solskjaer took over and permitting Dalman to sign off on one of the divisionâs biggest wage bills. But Solskjaer has consistently given off the impression that he does not know his best line-up, having kept an unchanged side only once in league fixtures. More than that, his promise of attacking football, which was so alluring to Tan, has not materialised, with only eight goals scored in the league this season. Of further concern to the club, the 19,711 gate for the Middlesbrough match was their lowest for a league fixture in four years.","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer held talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman on Wednesday over his future as Cardiff boss .

"West Ham assistant boss Neil McDonald has turned down the chance to become Carlisle manager. Sam Allardyce's number two was in the frame to replace the sacked Graham Kavanagh at the club where he previously had a spell in charge eight years ago. But McDonald has decided to stay at Upton Park leaving the Cumbrians, currently bottom of League Two, looking elsewhere for a new boss. West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald had been in talks with Carlisle but has pulled out of the running . Neil McDonald has been Sam Allardyce's number two at Upton Park since he took over in 2011 . 'Obviously there has been a lot of speculation in the local press about Neil McDonald, and I think it's only fair to say that he has formally withdrawn his name from the process and we respect that decision totally,' Carlisle managing director John Nixon told the club website. 'That has made a difference to the shortlist because he was a strong candidate, as far as we were concerned. Neil McDonald has managed Carlisle before, but left in 2007 just one game into the new season . 'He's given it a great deal of thought over the last five to 10 days and he has spoken to us about the situation today. 'He has told us that he has discussed it with his family, having thought about it long and hard, and he has decided that it isn't the right career move for him to make at this point in time.' Former Millwall boss Steve Lomas has also been linked with the role at Brunton Park.

"By . Tales Azzoni, Associated Press . Brazil coach Dunga called up Robinho on Wednesday for the team's friendly matches against Argentina and Japan next month. The striker had been left out of Dunga's team for friendlies earlier this month against Colombia and Ecuador but was later added to the squad after Hulk got injured. Brazil will play Argentina on October 11th at the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Japan three days later in Singapore. Robinho (left) looks happy to be back in the Brazil squad after posting this picture with Neymar (right) online . Robinho was on the bench as Brazil beat Columbia 1-0 in a friendly at Sun-Life stadium . Robinho, pictured celebrating after a goal against Juventus in Serie A, has now been recalled to the side . Dunga took over as coach of the Brazilian national side after a disappointing home World Cup . The match against Argentina is dubbed the Superclassic of the Americas, and is played on a yearly basis. Brazil won the match in both 2011 and 2012. Last year's match was not played after a request from the Brazilian confederation. This is the first time the contest will be played in a single match instead of a two-leg series. Only two players who were not in the squad earlier this month were called up this time - right back Mario Fernandes of CSKA Moscow and left back Dodo of Inter Milan. Defender Thiago Silva, coming off injury, was not called up again. 'We know of his quality, at the right time he will be back,' Dunga said. The matches in Asia will mark Brazil's third and fourth matches since Dunga's return to the helm of the national team after a disappointing World Cup under Luiz Felipe Scolari on home soil. Brazil finished fourth after a 7-1 loss to Germany in the semifinals and a 3-0 defeat against the Netherlands in the third-place match. Brazil beat Colombia 1-0 and Ecuador by the same score earlier this month in friendlies in the United States. Veteran AS Roma defender Maicon, who was released from the squad for reporting late to the team's hotel after the match against Colombia, was not in the list for next month's games. Dunga had said the doors would not be closed for Maicon despite the indiscipline issue. Despite local pressure, Dunga picked players from teams competing in the quarterfinals of the Brazilian Cup, which will be played just a day after the Japan friendly. 'We understand the needs of the Brazilian clubs, but first we have to think about the national team,' Dunga said. Goalkeepers: Jefferson (Botafogo), Rafael (Napoli) Defenders: Mario Fernandes (CSKA Moscow), Dodo (Inter Milan), Danilo (Porto), Filipe Luis (Chelsea), David Luiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain), Gil (Corinthians), Miranda (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Luiz Gustavo (Wolfsburg), Elias (Corinthians), Fernandinho (Manchester City), Ramires (Chelsea), Willian (Chelsea), Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool), Oscar (Chelsea), Ricardo Goulart (Cruzeiro) Forwards: Everton Ribeiro (Cruzeiro), Robinho (Santos), Neymar (Barcelona), Diego Tardelli (Atletico Mineiro) Brazil's passion was not questioned in the summer, as David Luiz (centre) proved during the national anthem .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association Golf Correspondent . European captain Paul McGinley insists he has no concerns over Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell's relationship ahead of next week's Ryder Cup. The Northern Irish pair have played together six times in the last two contests but are currently involved, directly and indirectly, in a court case with McIlroy's former management company. McIlroy's legal battle with Horizon Sports Management also involves the affairs of McDowell and the judge hearing the case said on Tuesday it involved such sensitive matters that the sides should engage in mediation. European captain Paul McGinley has no concerns over Rory McIIroy and Graeme McDowell's relationship . Rory McIIroy reacts to his putt on the 18th green during the BMW Championship golf tournament . 'The case has all sorts of sensitivities involving two players on tour, a manager of one of them and a former manager or agent of the other. It has all sorts of complex issues involving relationship matters,' Mr Justice Brian McGovern told both legal teams. However, McGinley believes the issue has been dragging on for so long that it will have no effect when the pair help Europe defend the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. 'It's not a concern,' McGinley told a press conference ahead of the ISPS Handa Wales Open. 'It has been going for a year and both have had very strong years. 'Rory's had arguably his best year ever (winning two major championships) and Graeme won the French Open. It has not affected their performance and both of them have assured me it's not going to affect anything in the team room. 'I would be very surprised if they don't play together although I'm not going to write it in stone.' Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell hits the second shot on the 9th hole during the BMW Championship . McGinley said he has a 'skeleton plan' in place for his pairings and is happy with the different preparation methods of his team. Jamie Donaldson, Lee Westwood, Stephen Gallacher and Thomas Bjorn are competing at Celtic Manor and McGinley will have dinner with them on Tuesday evening, when he will hand over a booklet with information and pictures of what to expect in terms of infrastructure at Gleneagles. McGinley 'endorsed' Victor Dubuisson's decision to withdraw from the tournament and prepare in France, with the players involved in the latter stages of the FedEx Cup play-offs having a rest. 'I'm delighted the guys who played in America are having a week off,' the Dubliner said. 'We did not have that in Medinah and I think we suffered. Graeme McDowell has gone on record saying he felt unprepared physically and mentally.' The course at Celtic Manor has been set up to replicate the challenge posed by Gleneagles, where McGinley said the three rookies on his team - Dubuisson, Donaldson and Gallacher - will definitely play at least one match before the singles.","The European Ryder Cup captain has no worries over Rory McIIroy and Graeme McDowell'sÂ relationship .

"By . Dominic King for MailOnline . Roberto Martinez has urged Evertonâs squad to make the most of a glorious opportunity as he embraced the clubâs return to Europe. Everton have not played in Europe for five years but they will end their hiatus on Thursday night against Wolfsburg, a team Martinez believes has the quality to play in the Champions League. Martinez, who is set to welcome Samuel Etoâo back into his squad, feels such an occasion shows that Everton are back where they belong and he is relishing the prospect of plotting his way out of Group H, which also includes Lille and the Russian side Kuban Krasnodar. Roberto Martinez cannot wait to get started in this season's Europa League against Wolfsburg on Thursday . Everton got their first win in the Premier League this season against West Brom on Saturday . Kevin Mirallas (right) got a goal  in the 2-0 win against the Baggies and has started the season in good form . This is Martinezâs first chance to manage in Europe and he is confident believes this competition is crucial to his sideâs development â and he is confident they have the quality to enable them to pass the test. The Everton manager said, 'We have been working hard to achieve this opportunity and the only way we will fulfil our potential is with these games. 'It is a phenomenal challenge for us, with clubs like Wolfsburg and Lille, and the unknown quantity of Krasnodar, but it is one that we need to help our development. Everton should be involved in Europe and that is the target to make it a constant.' The Toffees' Spanish coach Martinez said on Wednesday that Wolfsburg could be a Champions League team . 'We are facing phenomenal opposition and we have got competition for places. As a team, we will get real important experience from this competition. Wolfsburg are very well structured team. 'They have a good balance, really good experience. They know how to play in these occasions. They have got a really strong side. They could easily be a Champions League team.' Martinez also paid tribute to Â£28million summer signing Romelu Lukaku, but played down the significance of his transfer fee. Croatian international, and former Bayern Munich winger, Ivica Olic will be a threat for Wolfsburg . Everton manger Martinez says not too much should be made or Romelu Lukaku's hefty Â£28million price tag . He said: 'We always get carried about trying to get values and price tags. 'In Romeluâs case when he arrived he felt at home. He felt understood. 'Our dressing room has been really solid and is an easy place to arrive. It was a phenomenal effort from the board, especially the chairman, to get him here. We have given him the chance to grow and develop. But football is a team effort and it is very important for the continuity.' Everton have made a slow start to the season, and conceded 10 goals in their first three Premier League games, but won their first game of the season 2-0 away at West Brom on Saturday. Arsenal misfit Nicklas Bendtner joined Wolfsburg this summer, and has played twice, scoring no goals . The Spanish coach said: 'We got back to our natural defensive intensity against West Brom and that is what we needed. We are slowly getting to a very good level.' Martinez is also excited about plans for a new stadium in the nearby Walton Hall Park, and added: 'Our fans know that we canât stand still. We have to look to the highest competitive level we can achieve. 'Everyone knows this is a new scheme, a regeneration project for the city, many, many new jobs. It is very, very early stages. 'Goodison Park is unique. It will always be with us, the effect will be there even when we are away from home. That will never go away from our performances.' Everton captain Phil Jagielka (right) believes Everton have a big enough squad to compete in Europe . Club captain Phil Jagielka also welcomed the return of European football to Goodison Park, and the announcement of a new stadium for the club. He said: 'The manager has put a very good squad together. We canât get enough games. Hopefully we can do well in this competition. It will be a very proud moment. My friends and family will be here. We have got to go out and get the right result. We have got some exciting young talent in the squad, they just need pointing in the right direction.

"By . Catherine Hardy . While it's always good to listen to your feelings, women's tendency to follow their hearts over their heads means that men are far more decisive than women â and they donât feel the need to ask for advice either. When it comes to making decisions, men are twice as likely as women to decide 'right away'. And although women take longer to come to decisions, and are twice as likely as men to consult their partner before making them, they are more inclined to regret their choices further down the line. Which to follow - the head or heart? Women and men make decisions very differently . The research, commissioned by swimming pool builders Origin Leisure, asked 2,000 men and women to evaluate their decisions in life and found women are much more likely to consider the opinions of friends and take time on their choices, while men adopt a more immediate process. A quarter of women said their approach was often to spend a long time mulling over the details of a decision before making it - but less than a fifth of men take the same approach. When a choice requires a bit of soul-searching, women are more likely to do something âfrom the heartâ than are blokes results found. Psychologist Cliff Arnall said: âThere are stark differences between how men and women make decisions. Womenâs significant reliance on others plus a reluctance to make a wrong decision points to a measurable lack of confidence compared to men.â âWeighing up different outcomes and scenarios may seem like a good strategy but it appears to be accompanied by increasing levels of stress and uncertainty. Going round in circles soon becomes counterproductive and leads to decision paralysis and feelings of frustration.â The study also found a quarter of Brits find it easier to make really big decisions than smaller ones, trusting their gut for âlife-changingâ choices like whether to buy a house or propose to a partner, but then agonising over things like buying new clothes. Women spend longer on choices such as buying new jeans or shoes, and are more likely to consult a friend for advice . Cliff Arnall adds: âHeart and gut feelings operate at a much faster and more primitive level than regular thought processes. âThe heart is based on emotion, the gut on survival. Gut feelings shouldnât be dismissed as rash - 95% of the human bodyâs feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin is produced by the gut.â Seven in ten of us are prone to making bad decisions and more than half of the participants felt they were indecisive. Women are more likely than men to change their minds, and deliberate more over everything from whether to go on holiday or hand in notice at work, suffering the most back and forth on decisions around changing the look of their house or re-decorating. However, men showed more indecision than the fairer sex when it came to putting an offer in for a house, talking to someone they find attractive or deciding whether or not to ask a partner to move in. When thinking about the big decisions in their lives so far women cited starting a family as the biggest theyâd made, while men chose buying a property. Interestingly, women were more likely than men to feel they get the smaller decisions wrong in life while men are most likely to feel they get big decisions wrong. But there are certain decisions we all make on the spot; one in five people in relationships knew they wanted to be with their partner within minutes of meeting. Men know sooner after meeting someone if they want to be in a relationship with that person, with 41 per cent making up their minds on the same day, compared to less than a third of women. And a third of homeowners knew their current property was for them almost instantly upon viewing it. So as long as we know what we want in our love life and home life, we should be alright.","Men are twice as likely as women to decide 'right away'

"By . Jenny Hope . The number of British adults with diabetes has risen to more than 3.2âmillion â up by a million in justÂ  seven years. New figures show 163,000 people were diagnosed with the condition last year, the biggest total in a year since 2008. This brings the total to 3,208,014 adults with diabetes â or one in 17 of the population. In 2006, the figure was 2.2âmillion. Worrying: The reason behind the alarming spike in cases is Britain's growing obesity crisis. File picture . A further 850,000 are thought to have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, according to charity Diabetes UK, which blames the âunfolding public health disasterâ on the countryâs obesity crisis. Nine out of ten people with diabetes have Type 2, which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, leading to high levels which can damage organs. It is strongly linked to being overweight and unhealthy diets. The NHS spends Â£14âbillion a year â 10 per cent of its budget â treating diabetes and its complications. The NHS spends Â£14bn a year treating diabetes and it complications. Pictured, A blood test to detect diabetes . Every year in England and Wales, 24,000 people with diabetes die earlier than expected, a situation that is expected to get even worse without urgent action. Diabetes UK wants local NHS organisations to fully implement the NHS Health Check, which should be offered to everyone aged 40 to 74, to help identify people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes. Chief executive Barbara Young said: âThe big increase in the number of people with diabetes confirms that we are in the middle of an unfolding public health disaster that demands urgent action. It is frightening to think that one in 17 people has been diagnosed. âFirstly, we need more focus on preventing Type 2 diabetes, as this is the only way we can bring the rapid rise in diabetes cases under control. This means properly implementing the NHS Health Check so we can identify more people at high risk, and then making sure they get the support they need to reduce that risk. âWe also need to address the obesity crisis, which is what is fuelling the increase in Type 2, by making healthy food cheaper and more accessible and by making it easier for people to build physical activity into their daily lives. âBut as well as doing more to prevent Type 2, we need to get much better at treating diabetes because the level of priority the NHS gives the condition does not reflect the size of the shadow it is casting over our nationâs health. âThe result is that while diabetes is hugely expensive, accounting for 10p of every pound the NHS spends, what we are getting in return for that money is healthcare that is patchy and inconsistent. âFrom access to education when people are diagnosed right the way through to the care they receive in hospital, there are too many people getting a raw deal and this is fuelling high rates of diabetes-related complications and early death.â","The number of British adults with diabetes has hit 3.2 million .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . Chris Sutton has urged Celtic to make Europa League progress a higher priority than four domestic league crowns in a row. A key figure in the last Parkhead side to reach a European final in 2003, Sutton claimed the champions can afford to drop points in the Premiership â and still win the title. Rating Europeâs second-tier competition as a chance to re-energise a season which has already witnessed two demoralising exits from the Champions League, however, the Englishman suggested his former club could go all the way and actually win the trophy. Chris Sutton played for Celtic between 2000-2006, and believes the club should prioritise the Europa League . Ronny Deila's side have endured a torrid start, but ended a four-straight run of defeats on Saturday . âCeltic, for me, should prioritise this Europa League campaign,â said Sutton, as he promoted BT Sportâs live coverage of the opening game in Salzburg on Thursday night. âThey can afford to drop points in the league, lose games and still win the league because they are far and away the best team in Scotland. âThey would get a real shot in the arm from performing well in this competition. The Europa League has a totally new dimension now with the winners going straight into the Champions League. Why canât it be Celtic? Deila joined Celtic in June, but has not had an easy start to life in Glasgow . Celtic crashed out of the Champions League after losing at home to Maribor on 26 August . âThings change quickly in football. There is a bit of doom and gloom about the Champions League but thatâs gone now. Celtic could win the treble and could go on a good run in the Europa League and go on and win it. âThey have top players like Kris Commons and Scott Brown coming back and players who can grow. Celtic have good raw attributes â they just need to pull it all together.â Sutton has been sceptical of the systems employed by coach Ronny Deila in a stuttering start to the season delivering just five wins in 11 competitive games. But heartened by the additions of Stefan Scepovic, Wakaso Mubarak and Aleksandar Tonev - with John Guidetti only eligible for the knockout stages â Sutton believes Celtic now have the pace to make an impact. Chris Sutton (right) has experienced European success with Celtic, pictured scoring against Lyon in 2003 . Kris Commons celebrates his goal against Aberdeen on Saturday, which helped Celtic end a win-less spell . âThere are things I havenât understood about the Europa League and the mentality of clubs in England. They play the youth team and get knocked out. It doesnât make any sense to me. âI think Celtic should really go for this campaign because they have everything to gain. âThe first two games in this group stage are absolutely crucial. Salzburg have lost their last three, but thatâs dangerous going into this because they have chucked a lot of money at their side and we all might think Celtic should go there and win, but it doesnât work like that. âThat might work against Celtic. But they can go there with confidence. The main thing is: âDonât lose the game.ââ James McPake (right) gave Celtic a scare when his goal for Dundee sparked a spirited fightback on Saturday . Celtic captain Scott Brown and BT Sport pundit Chris Sutton at Celtic's training ground on Tuesday . Sutton also cautioned against making snap judgements following an accusation by Aberdeenâs Shay Logan that Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev aimed racist comments towards him during last Saturdayâs game at Parkhead. âThere isnât any place for abuse of any level. It is up to the SFA to investigate it,â said Sutton. âWeâve all been abused over the years and I am not saying it is right, but you get on with the game. âIt is unsavoury but the SFA have to get to the bottom of it. You canât hang Tonev yet because if it is proved he didnât say it, then he didnât say it. Itâs jumping the gun a little bit. People jump to conclusions pretty quickly.â Aberdeen confirmed yesterday that they have been asked for their version of events by the SFA as the governing bodyâs enquiries continue. A statement read: âThe club will co-operate fully with this investigation. As an employer we support unconditionally any employee who is the subject of any form of abuse and as such believe it is appropriate to allow the SFA the time necessary to carry out a full investigation.â Celtic have already issued a denial on behalf of Bulgarian international Tonev.

"By . Mark Wilson for the Daily Mail . Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev faces a two-week wait to find out whether the SFA will charge him after being accused of racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan. Sportsmail understands that Sky Sports cameras did not pick up the alleged incident during Saturdayâs 2-1 Premiership win for the Scottish champions at Parkhead. The pair were direct opponents for much of the match and Englishman Logan told referee Bobby Madden, his captain Mark Reynolds and manager Derek McInnes that the Bulgarian international called him a âblack c***â. Shay Logan has accused Aleksandar Tonev of racial abuse during Celtic's 2-1 win over Aberdeen . The SFA are likely to investigate the incident once they receive a report from the referee on Monday . Tonev, who was making a belated debut for Celtic after arriving on a one-year-loan deal from Aston Villa in the summer, vehemently denied the claims when quizzed by his manager Ronny Deila. On Monday, the SFA confirmed it had received a formal complaint from Aberdeen, as well as taking receipt of match reports from referee Madden and SPFL delegate John Connolly. The governing body has now started the process of investigating the issue. That should include speaking to both Tonev and 26-year-old Logan, as well as Celtic boss Deila and Aberdeenâs McInnes. With Tonev denying the allegation, a lack of conclusive evidence from Sky means it is a case of one manâs word against another. It is alleged that Tonev called the Aberdeen defender a 'black c***' during the game at Celtic Park . On Monday night, Tonevâs agent Anthony Ravaud said: âI want to emphasise that Aleksandar is not racist. âAs soon as I found out about the charge, I spoke with Alex and he categorically denied to me making the comments that have been alleged. âI want to add that his English is not so good, so I do not see how he could communicate normally and insult Shay Logan. âAleksandar and I are available to the disciplinary committee of the SFA at any time if they wish to receive more information. Our only request is to resolve the case as quickly as possible to clear Tonevâs name.â Police Scotland are âmaking enquiries into the circumstancesâ after learning about the incident via media reports. Aberdeen privately accept that they Aleksandar Tonev is unlikely to be found guilty without more evidence . Celtic said on Sunday night that Aleksandar Tonev 'has stated that the accusation made is not true' Aleksandar Tonev is still expected to travel to Salzburg for Celtic's Europa League tie on Thursday .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . QPR face growing opposition to their new stadium bid with current landowner Cargiant claiming they 'will not enter into any future talks with the club'. The former QPR sponsors hold a 30-acre plot on the Old Oak site where the west London club hope to build a new 40,000-seater stadium. Rangers have support from all the major bodies required to build the new ground as soon as 2018, but Cargiant is seeking to scupper their plans. Queens Park Rangers face growing opposition to their new stadium bid . The Premier League club want to build a new stadium with a capacity of 40,000 . Cargiant managing director Tony Mendes is a QPR season-ticket holder, but the company has released a statement denying discussing selling the company's land with the club. 'We are very surprised by QPR's PR campaign regarding a proposed new stadium in Old Oak Common and in particular on land owned by Cargiant,' the statement read. 'The company are not in negotiations with QPR and will not enter into any future talks with the club. 'The company will announce in due course details of its own scheme for the regeneration of its land holdings that will incorporate the residential units, jobs and community facilities that the GLA detailed in their vision for the regeneration for the area. 'Cargiant's commercial arm of the business views this opportunity as a long-term investment opportunity.' Cargiant bosses rejected the notion of QPR obtaining a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO), a legal function which allows bodies to claim land without the owner's consent if considered in the public interest. QPR could seek council backing to obtain such an order against Cargiant, but the company remain unfazed by the prospect. 'In regards to the threat of CPO, there is no legal basis on which to serve a CPO on Cargiant. We are a willing developer,' the statement continued. 'This is also not a 'tool' to increase the land value to QPR or anyone else. If the company wanted to pursue this route, it would be talking to other developers, which we are not. 'We are fully committed to regenerate our land. We have the funding and the professionals in place to do it.' Chairman and co-owner Tony Fernandes hand-delivered consultation documents last week . Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes released a statement in December detailing the club's new stadium plans. The New Queens Park project has Greater London Authority, Network Rail and Genesis Housing Group backing. The club aim to regenerate the area along with their proposed move from Loftus Road, pledging to build 24,000 new homes and create 55,000 jobs. A QPR statement read: 'The future regeneration of Old Oak requires everyone to work together for the common good - the boroughs, the Mayor, landowners and the local community. Our current consultation has so far attracted the views of over 1,000 local residents with over 80 per cent in support of our stadium-led regeneration. The future of Old Oak lies in the regeneration of the entire area and not the uncoordinated and piecemeal development of individual land holdings.'","Cargiant say they will not negotiate with QPR over their land .

"By . David Kent for MailOnline . Everton have identified Walton Hall Park as the intended site of a new stadium to replace Goodison Park. Unlike neighbours Liverpool, who plan to redevelop Anfield, Everton want to move to a new site down the road from Goodison.

'For several years now Iâve also thought, if only it was available for our new stadium, it ticks all the boxes. 'It would fill me with great pride, it could be something very special for our city, the residents of North Liverpool and all Evertonians - a new home that goes beyond football and does what Everton does better than anyone else. 'Of course thereâs enormous work to do - that again involves fixing a huge financial jigsaw - but we are certain itâs an opportunity we should pursue with great commitment, endeavour and ambition.' Everton believe Goodison Park, their home since 1892, can no longer generate sufficient revenue . Everton have the support of Liverpool council, while housing association Liverpool Mutual Homes will also be an official partner and will build homes as part of an overall regeneration scheme. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said: 'The park is probably one of the most under-used in the city, we get complaints about anti-social behaviour and that itâs just used for dog fouling... and I think a proposal that enhances a park in that area and provides other facilities, better facilities, is a better opportunity for the city.' Everton have long been looking to move from Goodison to a modern stadium and announced plans for a new ground in Kirkby in 2006, which were rejected by central government three years later. Everton hope to announce a breakthrough over a new 50,000-capacity stadium this week.

Harlequins have been in inquest mode this week after their mauling by Saracens, but Chris Robshawâs reduced role has not been among the items on the agenda. The England captain is back in the ranks at his club, after the decision was made by director of rugby Conor OâShea to relieve him of the leadership job, so he could concentrate on his own game in this pre-World Cup season. Joe Marler has taken over as Quins skipper but it has been a turbulent start to his tenure, with a yellow card in week one of the Aviva Premiership season â a 20-15 win at London Irish â and a 39-0 home defeat against Saracens last Friday.

Robshawâs removal from a post he had held for four years has met with a mixed response. One school of thought is that the England captain should be at the sharp end of the decision-making process week after week, in readiness to take on the responsibility at Test level, yet the 28-year-old flanker is happy for Marler to have the arm-band, with all it entails. However, he does concede that no longer calling the shots has been a culture shock. âI have spoken to Joe and he knows I am right behind him,â Robshaw told Sportsmail yesterday. âBut of course, on the pitch, I have to remember that Iâm not captain now.

Tempers flared between both sides as Chris Robshaw of Harlequins has a word with Alex Goode of Saracens . Captaincy brings with it a significant additional workload. The enhanced status comes with myriad ambassadorial duties attached, and Robshaw is quite glad to pass those on, in order to spend more time on personal priorities, or just unwinding. âI think it has made a difference already,â he said. âIâm not having to do all those extra things that come with being captain, like I was last year, which means you are still busy when everyone else has gone home to relax. It helps when you just want to have a bit of down-time. âI remember after the Wales game last year, when we lost, that was one of the hardest defeats of my career, but I had to come straight back to the club, get the club going and help get the players ready for the next game. That had to happen, whatever the hangover was from the previous game. âThat sort of situation was the reason for this decision.

Last Friday, Robshaw was out-played by his opposite number at Saracens, Will Fraser, who is emerging as a strong challenger for his Test place, along with Gloucesterâs Matt Kvesic, if he can return to fitness. Lancaster has publicly invited these younger opensides to put pressure on his skipper, but the incumbent takes the situation in stride. âThey always say that itâs tough to earn the shirt, but even tougher to keep the shirt,â he said. âThatâs definitely true. There is a lot of competition for that No 7 shirt, but thatâs what you want; you want that competition for places to raise standards in all positions. âIt means you have to strive to get better and try to raise your game weekly.â A dejected Robshaw (middle) looks on with fly-half Nick Easter (right) during a torrid match against Saracens .","Chris Robshaw has been relieved of his Harlequin's captaincy .

Leicester hooker Youngs was given dispensation to spend the summer looking after his ill wife Tiffany instead of touring New Zealand. Youngs revealed head coach Lancaster immediately allayed any fears over future selection chances, telling him to focus on his family. Tom Youngs was relieved when he was reassured of his England future despite not travelling to New Zealand . England head coach Stuart Lancaster told Youngs his World Cup hopes would not be harmed by missing tour . Now the 27-year-old is ready to repay Lancaster's backing, targeting a strong club campaign with Leicester and a return to England action in the autumn Tests. 'He understood the situation I was in, he realised it was best for me to go back and be with my family,' Youngs said. 'So I was extremely appreciative of that. 'To be fair if I had gone on tour, I think he would have known and I would have known that he wouldn't have got the best out of me because I would have been worried about things at home. 'So for him to say 'we're not going to judge you on this, it's important you stay at home and that's the best thing to do', that was fantastic and a relief.' Youngs helped Leicester to an impressive 24-20 Aviva Premiership victory at Exeter Chiefs last weekend, with the Tigers heading back to the west country to take on Bath on Saturday. England boss Lancaster has been given extra time by the Premiership to delay naming his Elite Player Squad until October. Youngs remained in England to care for his sick wife over the summer and did not travel to New Zealand . The England hooker will form a key part of Lancaster's squad during the QBE November internationals . England's top stars are effectively auditioning through club performances then, and Youngs is itching to make his mark. 'It was great of Stuart and that does kind of sum him up: he's a good man, an honest kind of guy who understands families and how they work,' said the Land Rover ambassador. 'He manages those situations really well, and he managed my situation incredibly well. 'So it was a big help. 'All those things that Stuart does, they help get the best out of the squad. 'Obviously you don't want to jeopardise your England chances, but then if you end up going on tour you probably end up not being able to concentrate fully on the rugby and not playing very well anyway. 'So then I was able to pick up at the start of the season with the summer camp at the end of August.

Youngs paid a visit to High Wycombe RFC to help youngsters with their final preparations for the Land Rover Premiership Rugby Cup. The Leicester front-rower vividly remembers World Cup winner Neil Back holding a coaching session at his junior club, and is keen to continue the tradition. Youngs hopes England can capitalise on hosting next year's World Cup to boost the next generation's talent pool. 'I remember when I was about seven or eight Neil Back coming down to our club, and that was immense,' he said. 'It was brilliant to have an England player come down to the club. 'It sticks with me now, the excitement of it all. 'And hopefully England players and club players doing similar things now can have a similar effect.

"By . Pa Reporter . Tiger Woods is 'in no hurry' to hire a new swing coach - as he has yet to swing a club during his latest injury lay-off. The former world number one's last PGA Tour action came on August 3, when he withdrew after eight holes of his final round at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational having aggravated a back problem. Since then his focus has solely been on strength work, meaning the search for Sean Foley's replacement - following their split three weeks ago - can wait. Tigers Woods hasn't featured for more than a month after aggravating a back problem . 'Am I looking for a new coach? As of right now, no, I'm not,' Woods told reporters at a press conference to announce a new sponsor for his tournament, the Hero World Challenge, where he is due to make his comeback in early December. 'I'm in no hurry to look for one. Right now I'm just trying to get physically better, stronger, faster, more explosive. 'I've just been shadow swinging without a club, but I've been busting my butt in the gym pretty hard. Tiger Woods parted company with swing coach Sean Foley three weeks ago . 'I've got my strength back, which is nice. Now the next goal is to get my explosiveness and my fast twitch (muscles) going, and that's the next phase of my training.' Woods admits that with hindsight, he returned too soon at June's Quicken Loans National, where he missed the cut. Four of his seven tour appearances this season resulted in missed cuts or withdrawals, while his best finish was 25th at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. Tiger Woods has been working hard in the gym in a bid to get back in action . 'Would I like to play? There's no doubt, yes,' he said. 'I miss competing, I miss playing, I miss being out here with the guys, I miss all that, but I'm not physically ready for it yet. 'As far as coming back this summer too soon, I felt good enough to do it and the only unfortunate part is I couldn't maintain the conditioning. 'As the tournament would wear on, I would get more and more fatigued and tired and I wasn't as explosive.'","Former world number one split from Sean Foley three weeks ago .

"By . Pa Reporter . Minnesota Vikings have announced that running back Adrian Peterson has been suspended indefinitely from all team activities amid his child abuse case. Peterson was indicted last week in Montgomery County, Texas, on a count of reckless or negligent injury to a child, after he reportedly used a switch, or a tree branch, to discipline his son. The 29-year-old sat out the Vikings' defeat against New England Patriots at the weekend but had been reinstated by the franchise, a decision which led to widespread criticism. Scroll down for videos . Adrian Peterson has been accused of abusing another of his children, it has been reported. A photo of his four-year-old son (right) shows him suffering a head wound covered by bandages . However after discussions with the league, the Vikings have placed Peterson on the Exempt/Commissioner's Permission list to allow Peterson to 'take care of his personal situation until the legal proceedings are resolved'. Owners Zygi Wilf and Mark Wilf said in a statement published on the team's website: 'While we were trying to make a balanced decision yesterday, after further reflection we have concluded that this resolution is best for the Vikings and for Adrian. 'We want to be clear: we have a strong stance regarding the protection and welfare of children, and we want to be sure we get this right. 'At the same time we want to express our support for Adrian and acknowledge his seven-plus years of outstanding commitment to this organisation and this community. 'Adrian emphasised his desire to avoid further distraction to his team-mates and coaches while focusing on his current situation; this resolution accomplishes these objectives as well. 'We will support Adrian during this legal and personal process, but we firmly believe and realise this is the right decision. We hope that all of our fans can respect the process that we have gone through to reach this final decision.' Peterson issued a statement earlier in the week saying he was 'sorry about the hurt I have brought to my child' and denied he was a child abuser. 'I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen,' he said. Brutal: It comes just hours after Peterson spoke out for the first time since his arrest for severely whipping another of his children with a wooden switch. Above, police released these images of the boy's wounds . Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' biggest star, was reinstated by the team after being kicked off the roster on Saturday.

Steven Ray Churchis performed a martial-arts style kick to Linder's head, before beating and stomping on him while he lay defenceless on the ground . Churchis refused to seek medical assistance for Linder, who was left in the lane for eight hours until a member of the public alerted the authorities. Linder suffered brain injuries and died of pneumonia in Auckland Hospital three days after the attack. Churchis claimed he had acted in self defence, but Justice Geoffrey Venning said the force Churchis used on Linder was 'unreasonable' and the attack was 'extreme and excessive'. 'You left him without help to die.' Churchis was 17 and also sleeping on the streets at the time of the attack. He had reportedly had a previous altercation with Linder, as well as  a violent past. He was also sentenced to two years and three months' jail for an attack on another man earlier on the same night as Mr Linder was bashed.

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Clashing colours, mismatched patterns, dodgy paint jobs and cluttered corners are all on the list of cardinal sins when it comes to designing and decorating a lounge room. Poor scaling and positioning of furniture, drawing attention to the wrong parts of the space and misguided attempts to make rooms look bigger are also some of the most common faux pas. Interior stylist and buyer from The Home Emma Bloomfield told Daily Mail Australia the worst living room she had ever come across was one that featured a checkered couch alongside a brown leather one, which both clashed with the Persian rug on the floor. The Home are searching for Australia's Ugliest Living Room and interior stylist Emma Bloomfield said this one in NSW was the worst she had seen so far . The space in Queensland could be a certain contender for the ugliest room with itsÂ yellowed walls, cobwebs on the ceiling and a floor and lounge which don't look safe to sit on . This room in WA desperately needs a paint job matching furniture and a bigger TV unit that isn't dwarfed by the television . These brightly coloured and very old couches in a Victorian home also made it onto the terrible list . 'Mismatched colours equals a confused style,' Ms Bloomfield said. 'Persian rugs and a country check fabric donât go together. Stick to similar styles for the big ticket items to keep from confusing the style.' She added a paint job on the wall wouldn't go astray and the rug - aside from clashing with almost everything else in the room - was much too small for the space. In light of this, homewares and interior design website The Home has launched an effort to find the ugliest living room in the whole of Australia. Shocking clashing patterns and couches without proper cushions seen here in a Victorian living room are a repeat offender . This room, also in Victoria, has an exposed brick wall which 'screams 1980s' according to Ms Bloomfield who said the room needed a paint job quick smart . In this tiled room in Victoria the couches clash with the textured tiles and the glass table is outdated . More messy than ugly this room in NSW would probably look a lot better with a tidy up above all else . In conjunction with Network Ten's Studio 10, they have asked homeowners to dob themselves - or their friends - in and the 'winner' of the competition will get their horrible lounge room replaced with a brand new one. 'Home may be where the heart is, but the living room is the soul of the home. Itâs where you relax, rejuvenate and entertain, so you should have a living room you adore,' said Alexandra Mills, CEO of The Home. 'I know there are many neglected living rooms out there in Australia, so we want to find the ugliest one and transform it from mess to mesmerising. 'We also want to show how anyone can easily transform their own living rooms with a few updates and tweaks â it doesnât have to be expensive!' Ms Mills added. Also in NSW this living room is 'too matchy matchy' and needs another colour besides blue and yellow to break up the space according to Ms Bloomfield . In Queensland this room needed to be broken up with pattern and texture otherwise you get a whitewash effect like this . This space in NSW needed one thing desperately - a paint job . This outdated living room - also in NSW- could do with some upgraded furniture and a little de-cluttering . Some features of some of the disaster rooms so far include strange and outdated patterns and prints, poor or completely forgotten paint jobs, too many items cluttered in to one room or not enough furniture spread around an area with too much space. Queensland presented a strong contestant for the worst room, with yellowed walls, cobwebs and cracks on the ceiling and a floor and lounge which don't look safe to sit on. The television looks as though it could have been one of the first ever made, and the curtains are straight out of the 1970s. In one of the terrible rooms from NSW, Ms Bloomfied said the colour scheme was way off and the owner needed to introduce some more neutral colours to break the room up. This Victoria lounge room was described as 'confused' and a poor example of a multi-functional living space . The small table over a patterned mat covering the floor which matches the couch makes this room a contender for the ugliest room . The cluttered corner behind the TV make the space feel smaller than it is, plus the tissues near the heater present a serious fire risk . This mismatched furniture crowded around a television in Queensland put this space in the running for the ugliest in Australia . 'Too matchy matchy. This room only has two colours, blue and orange. It's fine to try and match up some of your furniture but add in a few other splashes of colour to break it up,' she said. For another sparse looking situation also in NSW, the interior stylist had just one tip: 'Don't forget the most important thing - paint!' Queensland also had some horrors to offer in the form of Â a disparate lounge room with only one colour tone and a whole lot of space. Ms Bloomfield had this to say: 'Throw rugs add colour and texture to a room but not if they are covering your dated recliner chairs. Also, don't forget a rug, especially on tiles - winter without a rug looks like a cold one!' Missing tiles and clashing furnishing make this living space in Western Australia look confused . This room is on report for its couches that match the strange textured floor . Another offender in the bland colour scheme department in Queensland was too much neutral and not enough of anything else. 'Solid blocks of neutral colour like this need to be broken up with pattern and texture: add in some cushions, a floor rug and some artwork to add interest and personality to the space,' Ms Bloomfield suggested. For a room in NSW clutter was the key concern, and possibly an unwanted house fire. 'For easy viewing pleasure you should aim to keep the wall the TV is on free, don't confuse the situation by sticking photos on the wall above. Also, keep fire hazards to a minimum by storing all your junk and consider moving the tissue box away from the heater!' said Ms Bloomfield.","The Home is on the hunt for Australia's Ugliest Living Room .

The devastated father and husband of Jude and Bianka arrived at the church at 10.47 am. He held his head high as he walked up the steps into the church and touched the holy water with his right hand before entering. A friend reassuringly tapped him twice on his back. Suited members of the ambulance service, who helped in the search for Jude and Bianka after the explosion, arrived next along with some mothers and babies in prams. Police superintendent Clive Ainley told Daily Mail Australia that police officers and the Rozelle community are all hurting after the loss of three beautiful people in such awful circumstances. 'It's a traumatic experience. We've provided welfare to cope with the stress.' 'A lot of police here from Leichhardt were on the scene. Some of the officers are relatives of Bianka and Jude.

Superintendent Ainley said the tragic deaths of Bianka and Jude, as well as of Chris Noble, will continue to devastate the community. 'Rozelle is a small community and the whole community bonded together,' he said. 'This is a major incident for Rozelle.. The likes of which we will probably never see again.' The police paid their respects, in the midst of the investigation to discover what started the blaze in the convenience store. 'We formed a guard of honour which we usually do at police funerals because there are police officers who are related to the family . 'I can't comment on the investigation, it's ongoing.' John O'Brien spoke to the ambulance members before going alone to look at the bodies of his loved ones. The service began at 11am to the song 'You Are The Sunshine of my Life.' After the readings a touching video presentation was played to the packed church, showing the young family's tragically short lives together. John enters the church clasping the service booklet, which was filled of happy photographs of Bianka, his boy, Jude, and himself . The funeral service booklet was filled with photos that documented Bianka and John's happy eight years together and their smiley baby Jude. John described Bianka as being 'everything to him.' He told mourners how his 'sweet' son had come along. Music was an important part of the service, with 'You are the Sunshine of my Life', 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' and 'Tears in Heaven' played . Photos from when John met the 'love of his life' Bianka were shown, as well as pictures of their beautiful baby boy. The video played to the sound of Somewhere Over The Rainbow. 'Bianka and Jude may your guardian angels be with you in paradise,' read the order of service. Photographs of Jude and Bianka were placed on their shared coffin inside the church.

A smiling Adelene Leong flashes peace signs into the camera as she enjoys her time at the Royal Adelaide Show, not knowing her day was about to take a fatal turn. On Friday about 12.30pm, the eight-year-old - who was holidaying with family from Malaysia - was thrown from the Air Maxx 360 ride as her mother watched on in horror. Adelene was rushed to hospital with critical injuries but died a short time later. Five days later, South Australia police have released a photo of the girl from the same day of her terrible death, hoping it will trigger new witnesses to come forward with more information as they investigate how the tragedy happened. Scroll down for video . Adelene Leong's mother has publicly paid tribute to her eight-year-old daughter . Police guarded the Air Maxx 360 ride after an eight-year-old girl was killed on Friday at the Royal Adelaide Show . The photo was handpicked by her mother who was believed to be with Adelene at the time of the incident. Along with the photo, Adelene's mother paid tribute to her eight-year-old in a statement, describing her as 'my lovely beautifulâ¦.wonderful little angel of my heart'. Police hope the photograph will prompt showgoers to recognise her. 'In particular we are keen to hear from anyone who may have taken photographs or video footage of the ride involved â the Airmaxx 360 â in action at the Showgrounds on Friday,' Chief Inspector Selena Dinning, from the Sturt Local Service Area, said. 'We are also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of this tragic incident or anyone who experienced anything unusual on the ride. 'Even a small detail may be the crucial information which leads to a clear understanding of what took place.' The child was in a critical condition after the terrifying fall . So far, police have spoken with 30 to 40 people in relation to the show ride. Chief Insp Dinning said the ride had a minimum height requirement of 120cm, which Adelene exceeded. 'The ride has been seized by SafeWork SA and at this time remains in situ,' she added. 'Police are continuing to work with SafeWork SA to fully investigate the cause of this tragic incident and are preparing a report for the coroner.' Following Adelene's death, a second ride, the Traffic Jam, was shut down the following day when a height restriction breach was identified. SafeWork SA officers also increased the number of inspections and compliance checks at the show. The girl was taken by ambulance to the Women's and Children's Hospital . Eyewitness said the eight-year-old landed a long way from the ride . Paramedics treated the girl at the scene before taking her to hospital . Previously, the agency has said an investigation into Adelene's death was expected to take some time, given the nature of the incident, the number of witnesses involved and the technical expertise required. Witnesses reportedly saw the girl being thrown from the seat and 'landing extremely far away'. On the day of the accident, Malinda Dunwoodie, 17, told The Advertiser the girl's safety harness was still down but it looked as if she slipped out of her seat. 'She was hanging by her legs off the ride, trying to block herself. She went flying through the air about 10-15 metres up in the air and I started sprinting towards her,' she said. 'I was shaking so much, she looked like a doll flying through the air. 'It was so shocking. It was like a horror movie.' Police guarded the ride after it was closed after the accident .","Adelene Leong died after being thrown from a ride at Royal Adelaide Show .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Some of Australia's most iconic landmarks and locations could be underwater in less than a century, according to a new report by the Climate Council. By 2100 Sydney Opera House could flood every single day, the Gold Coast's famous beaches could be swallowed by the sea, and more than 250,000 homes across the country could be destroyed. Titled Counting The Costs: Climate Change And Coastal Flooding, the report reveals that more than half the Australian coast could be in jeopardy over the next 100 years. The Sydney Opera house could be flooded every day by 2100 according to a new report by the Climate Council . The report revealed that more than $200 billion worth of damage could be done to infrastructure if the sea rises the worst case scenario of 1.1 metres . 'Australia is largely a coastal country. Much of our population lives on or near the coast, and our six state capital cities âSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart, as well as Darwin in the Northern Territoryâare all port cities,' the report begins. In Victoria at least 80 percent of the coast could be at risk of rising seas, while it's a little lower but still damaging at 62 percent in Queensland. One of the authors of the report, Professor Will Steffen, told news.com.au that it is essential for Australia to cut its greenhouse gases if we want to reduce the potential impact. Queensland's iconic Gold Coast could also be in jeopardy if the sea levels rise by the turn of the century . One of the authors of the report, Professor Will Steffen, said its essential for Australia to cut its greenhouse gases if we want to reduce the potential impact . 'The potential threats to Australia, where the majority of us live on the coast are disproportionately large,' he said in a statement. If the sea rises just over a metre by the turn of the century roads, hospitals, properties, and power stations would all be severly damaged. In the worst case scenario this damage to the coastal regions of the country could cost the economy over $200 billion, according to the report. Almost 250,000 homes could be lost along the Australian coast . The Climate Council warns against ignoring climate change as that could have a detrimental effect on the world's economy . There is also a suggestion that the Gold Coast could be hardest hit, which would mean a huge blow to the tourism profits more than 11 million visitors bring the beachside region each year. As the beaches are lined with high rises so any rise in the sea level could be derimental to the surrounding areas. More than 250,000 homes across Australia could also be at serious risk along with 35,000 kilometres of roads and rails, thousands of commercial buildings and almost 100 hospitals. Soil erosion has already begun to occur on the Gold Coast, seen here at Mermaid Beach . The overall prediction is that sea levels will rise by between 40 centimetres and one metre. The report also revealed that rising sea levels could pose risks to the Great Barrier Reef, and Kakadu National Park. The Climate Council is a not-for-profit organisation which relies on funding from the public. In Victoria at least 80 percent of the coast could be at risk of rising seas, while that figure is 62 percent for Queensland .","Counting The Costs: Climate Change And Coastal Flooding was released on Wednesday .

"By . Heather Mcnab For Dailymail Australia . An Australian photographer has won a prestigious international award in recognition of his beautiful and haunting photographs of the Australian landscape. Christian Fletcher has been marked as an incredible talent worldwide, in the first inaugural International Landscape Photographer of the Year competition. The images that won him the award feature the stunning landscape of Western Australia, a subject which Fletcher is extremely passionate about. 'The images are all about looking at what we do as a race to the country, that's the crux of the images' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We are mining a pristine, unique wilderness which has spawned amazing ecosystems and animals.' 'There is so much apathy in the world, causing problems. I wanted these images to be a call to arms for people to question what's going on get back to looking hard at the world.' 'Getting technically creative in order to tell a story, that's one of my favourite parts.' Despite being so passionate about his work now, Fletcher began his career as a photographer almost by mistake. 'I was really into surfing in my teens,' he said, 'and had an accident.' 'I picked up a camera when I couldn't get back into the water and just started taking photographs of the ocean.' 'I started to enjoy the process as much as surfing.' Milford Sound, New Zealand: 'The images are all about looking at what we do as a race to the country, that's the crux of the images,' said Christian. Bauxite Mine, Collie, Western Australia: This image was shot on the Phase One IQ180 camera. Christian wanted to create images that ""reflected more than what the eye can see"". He ""wanted to show the detail that is there but often muffled and confused by lesser cameras"". Geographe Bay, Dunsborough, Western Australia: Christian said, 'We are mining a pristine, unique wilderness which has spawned amazing ecosystems and animals.' After working various jobs until he was 25, Christian moved to the country to set up a dark room, and focused on perfecting the art of landscape photography. 'I was working all these jobs to support myself. One of them was in a picture framing store, and there was a gallery at the front that I rented to hang my pictures.' 'They started selling, and eventually someone said that I should photograph his sister's wedding.' 'For years I did commercial and wedding photography, because there was just no money in landscape, although that's where my heart was.' This hasn't changed in the intervening years. Christian, who has been a professional photographer for 26 years now, says that he is still in love with taking photos of what he calls 'altered landscapes.' 'Urban landscapes, industrial landscapes, things that have been affected from mining and the building of dams.' 'I would say I'm environmentally conscious. I am drawn to anything affected by humanity, which is just about everything these days,' he said. 'I think anyone who is a landscape photographer should care about the environment, almost more than anyone else.' 'I've created a group called Photographers for the Environment, which focuses on areas under threat.' Queenstown, New Zealand: 'I would say I'm environmentally conscious. I am drawn to anything affected by humanity, which is just about everything these days,' Christian said. Wanaka, New Zealand: 'I think anyone who is a landscape photographer should care about the environment, almost more than anyone else.' Wanaka, New Zealand: Fletcher, who has been a professional photographer for 26 years now, says that he is still in love with taking photos of what he calls 'altered landscapes.' Fletcher said he was surprised when his photographs made it into the final rounds of the international award. 'There were over 2000 photographs, and looking through them, they were amazing,' said Fletcher. 'I thought they were so much better than mine.' 'I had a couple of images in the top 101, but didn't think I had a chance at winning,' 'I was shocked, to be honest. It's quite an honour to win.' Fletcher said that the craft of photography has changed significantly since the advent of digital cameras and equipment. 'When I started out, it was like getting a present every time I got a roll of film developed. You could learn all the techniques but there was always an element of the unknown.' 'It used to take a lot longer to become a good photographer, and to really learn the craft of it. While it's still hard to master, photography is so different because of the digital equipment,' he said. 'There are a lot of photography enthusiasts, which is great, but they're working on the side of their actual jobs, just selling enough to pay for their equipment. This is destroying the professional industry because there is less work, and so many pictures out there.' But, Fletcher adds, the increased quality of images is astounding. 'What people can do now is amazing,' he said. 'Film is great but it's nothing like the images we have now. Some images are almost perfect.' 'It will eventually get to the stage where a camera is developed which will be able to see as well as an eye.' Wanaka, New Zealand: 'It used to take a lot longer to become a good photographer, and to really learn the craft of it. While it's still hard to master, photography is so different because of the digital equipment,' Christian said. Stirling Ranges, Western Australia: 'Film is great but it's nothing like the images we have now. Some images are almost perfect.' Stirling Ranges, Western Australia: 'It will eventually get to the stage where a camera is developed which will be able to see as well as an eye.' 'A camera is just a dumb instrument,' said Fletcher. 'It doesn't adjust like an eye can. But one day it may be able to recreate exactly what we're seeing. Technology is constantly changing, and means we have to adapt.' 'It's not always easy to do, but it certainly keeps me on my toes.' Fletcher explained that while he will always have a passion for affected landscapes, a lot of the images he takes are to capture beauty. 'It's what you would call dÃ©cor photography. The photographs I took in New Zealand are all about showing how grand it is,' he said. 'I love finding the best light, capturing trees and fogs and epic locations. My whole business is about getting people to buy photos, and most people want to feel good bout the world.' 'There are so many terrible things going on, often people want to see something nice and have something beautiful to hang in their houses.' The landscape photographer said that it's this which keeps him passionate and interested in his work, which impacts on every part of his day. 'No matter how many times you've been somewhere, there will always be an angle or image that is new. Being outdoors and on my own in a beautiful place, that's what I love. I'm a people person but it's just brilliant,' Fletcher said. 'I cant quite explain it. I have had a lot of passions in my life but this has always stayed. I'll never stop doing it, everything in my day revolves around it.' More of Christian Fletcher's award-winning photography can be seen on his portfolio website. Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia: 'A camera is just a dumb instrument,' said Fletcher.'It doesn't adjust like an eye can. But one day it may be able to recreate exactly what we're seeing. Technology is constantly changing, and means we have to adapt.' Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia: Fletcher said, 'Sugarloaf Rock never fails to impress and is like a magent drawing me in when I should be shooting other places.' Tailings Dam, Kwinana, Perth, Western Australia: 'I cant quite explain it. I have had a lot of passions in my life but this has always stayed. I'll never stop doing it, everything in my day revolves around it.'","Christian Fletcher's images of Western Australia show the beauty and desolation of the Australian landscape .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . A $67 invention that uses packets of empty chips to purify contaminated water could be Australia's answer to saving millions of lives. Dubbed the Solar Disinfection, four budding university engineers have formulated a design that uses the sun and packets of chips to kill harmful pathogens living inside contaminated water. The sun bounces off the reflective layer inside the chip packets and heats the water inside a glass tube - disinfecting  contaminants such as faecal matter which may be present. The reflective layers from chip packets line inner sides of the timber and reflect the suns rays onto the glass, killing-off the water pathogens inside . The product, which cost just $67, is a fraction of the cost of a top of the line design and just as effective . Although in its early stages, University of Adelaide  engineers Harrison Evans, Anthony Liew, Mark Padovan and Michael WatchmanÂ hope the product will provide a welcome relief to some of the 780 million people living with limited access to fresh water. Adelaide researcher Dr Chris Birzer, who oversaw the design, said contaminated water kills about 2.5 million people a year through dehydration caused by diarrhoea. He said the Solar Disinfection - which is built using half a cylinder of reflective material and a meter-and-a-half length of glass tube - could help counteract illness by better purifying water from the source to people's mouths. The university has teamed up with Non Government Organisations working in Papua New Guinea to implement a trial of the design. Dr Birzer said he hopes it will help to reverse the affects of water-borne illnesses in PNG, which claim the lives of 900 children annually. 'During the wet season in PNG the water comes from the roofs of houses which is littered with faecal matter from birds presenting a real problem,' he said. And during the dry season the same faecal matter is collected in rivers and floats down stream, contaminating fresh water. The four students behind the design the Solar Disinfection with Chip Packets are Harrison Evans, Michael Watchman, Mark Padovan and Anthony Liew . He said western civilisation's bid to reverse water-borne deaths in places such as Africa has been fruitless and more needs to be done. 'Western countries have invested over $1 billion in water treatment in Africa which has failed,' he said. 'So we need to work with NGO's and locals to help countries to rectify these issues.' The revolutionary, yet extremely cheap design, uses the highly reflective layer inside a chip packet and the sun's heat to actively kill contaminants inside the water. The prototype can be attached to a larger water system which connects the water from the source to the home. Chips are a universal product which can easily be recycled in even the poorest of countries . The students trialled the product by hooking it up to a water system and testing the results at the other end . In testing the product the students found that the quality of the reflectivity is only a 'couple percent worse than the best product.' Dr Birzer said the best manufactured prototype in the workshop cost about $4,500 - a fraction of the $67 price tag for the Solar Disinfection invention which was mostly spent on timber. Already the idea is being rolled-out in PNG with the help of NGO, ChildFund. Dr Birzer said the plan is to work with NGO's to create a solution to help communities reverse their poor living conditions on the ground. The purification project is now getting international interest, from places such as Brazil, Philippines and Thailand, Dr Birzer said.","Four Adelaide engineering students have designed a life-saving water treatment product using chip packets, glass tubing and the sun .

The Woolner resident said she was not hooked but wasÂ smacked 'about an inch and a half' above her eye. Helen Bull was dining on the balcony of a Darwin resturant with her brother when she was hit in the head by a fishing lure . 'We made a bit of a passing joke that they better not start throwing them this way,' she told NT News. 'Then the next thing you know I saw this glint coming towards me. 'I felt like someone had shot me in the head. It threw me back. It was a really hard bang. 'I put my hands up to my face and when I pulled my hands down blood was pouring from my head and pouring down my neck and top. 'It is a bit blurry for me and hard to remember because I was a bit dazed and confused. There was a lot of blood there. 'Everyone from my table got up and put napkins around my head.' Ms Bull was treated on the spot by army medics who were sitting on the next table  before she went to hospital. Ms Bull was forced to wait for two hours but left when she was told it would take another five hours in the emergency department of Royal Darwin Hospital. When Ms Bull returned the next day, she was told that her medics had done such a good job that she didn't require stitches. 'I guess it should be noted that the area was a not fishing area and it is for this reason,' she said.","Helen Bull was dining on the balcony of aÂ restaurantÂ with her brother when she wasÂ hit in the head by a fishing lure on Monday night .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . From bizarre fringed angel wings to rainbow striped block frocks, the designs that appear on the world's catwalks can appear odd to say the least. But now a new book argues that these ostensibly unwearable examples of 'subversive fashion' have paved the way for a wardrobe revolution - and have allowed unusual subcultures to flourish. According to fashion expert Marnie Fogg, designers such as Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier and Walter Van Beirendonck have redefined what is acceptable. Success: David Koma's peplum dresses might look unusual but the peplum is now a wardrobe staple . Modern: This shot of a model in automotive-inspired Thierry Mugler was taken in 1989 but looks current . As a result, the catwalk is no stranger to subversive fashion, with plank hats, lollipop coats and transparent gowns all seen in recent years, but, says Fogg, these looks are moving to the High Street too. Peplums, oversized shoulders and, most recently, trainers with everything are all beneficiaries of their work and are proof that challenging catwalk looks can translate to the closet. 'Many original designs elicit the response: ""You canât go out dressed like that!"",' she writes in her latest book. 'But modern fashion is not as outrageous and unwearable as it may seem.' In Why You Can Go Out Dressed Like That, she also looks at some of the more unusual subcultures spawned by quirky fashion, among them Japan's cutesy Kawaii girls. Avant-garde: An Agatha Ruiz de la Prada design (left) and Viktor & Rolf on the catwalk in Paris . Movement: This jersey hostess gown by Adrian was cutting edge in 1947 but is now a wardrobe classic . Different look: Amaya Arzuaga's Pierrot costume (left) and fringed angel wings at Maison Martin Margiela . 'All too often a lack of obvious fit or . purpose has been mistaken for a lack of design sophistication,' she continues. 'Why You . Can Go Out Dressed Like That explores the ways in which designers have . confronted the idea of ""fit"" and its relation to the form of the body.' The result has been cutting-edge garments that seem revolutionary at the time but eventually become part of wardrobes everywhere. Among them are staples such as the simple jumper, the Breton top and the twinset, all of which appeared outrageous when first introduced but soon became modern classics. More recent examples to feature in Fogg's work include the cerebral designs developed by Comme des GarÃ§ons, Thom Browne's broad-shouldered men and the glamorous augmented anatomies of Thierry Mugler.

"By . Lucy Thackray for Daily Mail Australia . Princes William and Harry are both fierce competitors on the polo field, but even when they win Wills heads straight home to his family, while Harry's up for a celebratory drink. That's according to Alec White, one of three Aussie cousins on the international polo circuit, who now counts the princes as mates after saddling up with the royal pair and helping them to victory at a competition at Ascot this year. âHarry makes fun of Will by telling him that he's whipped!' Alec told Daily Mail Australia. âWill had to go home to Kate and George, but Harry was very keen to hang around for drinks at the function afterwards.â Scroll down for video . Alec White (left) with Prince Harry after their polo team won their game at the Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot this June . The Duke of Cambridge (far left) and his brother Prince Harry (far right) are 'down-to-earth, friendly guys' according to Aussie Alec Brown, (second from right) Alec, 24, and his cousins Jasper, 22, and Will, 25, from Scone in the horse-breeding country in New South Wales' Hunter Valley region, are known as 'The Three Whites' on the world professional polo circuit. They now spend around six months a year overseas competing, including a stint with the princes in their Audi Quattro team at the Audi Polo Challenge at Ascott in June. âTheyâre great guys, so down to earth. They remember everyoneâs names and ask questions to get to know you properly,' Alec said. He said both princes are very good players - for the amount they play, which they admitted was not as much as they would like. âI would say Harryâs a bit more fierce. Will played well but Harry was definitely better,' Alec said. 'Harry gets right in there and is pretty fearless when he plays, just like his personality. 'They say they love polo but canât play as much as theyâd like. Theyâre very sporty.' The princesâ team won 5-4 in the last few minutes of their game, with the event attended by a host of England celebrities including Dame Helen Mirren and Clive Owen. Alec couldnât believe  the brothers, who introduced themselves casually as âWill and Harryâ, were so normal. Alec Brown is a professional polo player, living in England and Argentina for six months of the year. He grew up on his family property in NSW's upper Hunter Valley, with his grandparents and parents breeding and training polo horses . âI didnât expect them to be the same as anyone else. 'My mouth was open most of the time. I was really nervous and I didnât know what to ask them at first!'â Alec says that the Duke of Cambridge was particularly interested in Alecâs Australian background. âWill said that he loved his time in Australia but was so flat out. He said he wishes heâd had more time to relax and take it in. 'Will said hopefully he can get back to Australia soon. He also spoke about George about how much heâs loving his Dad role.â Alec (right) says Harry was lots of fun, making fun of his brother, the Duke of Cambridge for 'being whipped' Alec said his  encounter with the princes was âa matter of right place, right time.â âI was playing that day and my friend got injured,' he said. âHeâs an English player who represents England. He asked me to replace him for his afternoon game with Will and Harry so of course I did it!' Despite his incredible experiences overseas, Alec cherishes the time he gets to return to the family property in Scone, in the upper Hunter Valley north of Sydney. Alec spending four months of the year in England and two in Argentina playing polo. âItâs so good to get home after the long English season and to play in the local comp down in Scone,' he said. âItâs great to be back where it all started. Spending six months of the year living out of suitcases might seem like an amazing lifestyle but it is a job and you do miss home and your family and friends.â Alec, Will and Jasper come from a family property, Belltrees, which breeds polo horses, as the boys come from a long line of polo enthusiasts. The âThree Whitesâ say the Scone local junior polo school is where their passion for polo began. They are returning to compete in Scone's 'Polo in the Paddock' competition in a couple of weeks, to be held on their home turf in the Upper Hunter Valley country town, which is expected to be a great weekend attended by players and spectators. Alec and his cousins Jasper and Will grew up on the family property, Belltrees and are now all international professional polo players . It's a rare opportunity for the three cousins to play on the same team. âWe all went our different ways and worked for different people so weâre always playing against each other, which is not so much fun,' Alec said. âWe only get to play with each other when we come back to Scone.â Although Alec has always loved the sport, he only entertained the thought of pursuing polo professionally during his gap year. He spent the year at Belltrees, after finishing boarding school at The Kingâs School in Sydney. âI really got the polo bug when I was about 19 though during my year at home. âI decided to go overseas to England when I was 20 and have been going back and forth for four years.â Alec says itâs a âmassive helpâ to have his cousins playing polo in England alongside him. âIâve lived with Will this year in England and it was amazing to have that support. Someone close you can rely on and who know what youâre going through. 'Weâre under a lot of pressure to perform so itâs great to have someone there who you can ask for opinions.' Alec Brown (far left) hopes to see how far he can go competing professionally, before he returns to breed and train high-level polo horses . âGrandma is literally the driving force of our whole family, sheâs amazing. She lives at the Belltrees homestead herself but brings the whole family together. 'The family breeds polo horses... The plan is to see how far I can get competing, and then come home to breed and train high-level polo horses.' Alec thinks the Australian countryside is incredibly beautiful and the cliche is true - there's no place like home. 'Iâm lucky to have played at most clubs in the world but there arenât many that have such a great atmosphere. 'The Scone Polo Club has the traditional country vibe where people come together who love the sport, love horses and have a good weekend and a good experience.' He's looking forward to seeing the princes again when he returns to England - particularly party boy Harry. 'Iâll definitely see them again. I had a really good time with them and it was an amazing opportunity to play with them. 'Iâd love to have a drink with Harry again!'","Alec White, from country NSW, was on the princes' winning team in June .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A new study into the benefits of Tai Chi for patients suffering cystic fibrosis is being funded by the family of a woman who lost her life to the disease. Tracie Lawlor died in November 2007 of sepsis, after being admitted to hospital for what should have been  routine treatment for her illness. The 24-year-old was diagnosed with the genetic condition, which causes a build up of mucus in the lungs and digestive system, when she was just a year old. In a cruel twist of fate, her younger brother Joe, born three years later when Tracie was four, was also diagnosed with CF. Tracie Lawlor, 24, died in November 2007 after being admitted to hospital for treatment for her cystic fibrosis . Tracie was diagnosed with the hereditary disease, which causes a build-up of mucus in the lungs and digestive system, when she was a year old. Her family are now raising money to fund a new research programme into the effects of Tai Chi on the condition . Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease caused by a faulty gene. The gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells in the body, and so causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus. Sufferers struggle to breathe and digest food and require intensive therapy and treatments. Six months after his sister's death, Mr Lawlor, from Wexford in Ireland, and his family established the Tracie Lawlor Trust for Cystic Fibrosis (TLT4CF). The family's aim was to help CF patients and fund evidence-based complementary medicine for CF sufferers, to help improve their quality of life. The trust has set up a patients' assistance fund, directly paying for or buying equipment for patients, including treadmills, bikes, pulse oximeters, while others get acupuncture and Tai Chi. The 25-year-old, neuroscience student, told MailOnline: 'We set up the trust to help other patients with cystic fibrosis.' He said they have raised nearly Â£200,000 since setting up the trust in 2008. And of that, nearly Â£40,000 has been raised to fund a new study into the effects of Tai Chi on patients suffering CF. The study is being carried out by a team of researchers from London's South Bank University at the Royal Brompton Hospital in the capital. Tracie's brother Joe, pictured, was also diagnosed with CF when he was born. He and his family set up the Tracie Lawlor Trust for Cystic Fibrosis in 2008, to raise money to help other sufferers in her memory . So far the trust has raised nearly Â£200,000 since it was established. To fund the remainder of the study at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London in Tai Chi and its effects on the condition, Mr Lawlor said they need to raise a further Â£11,000 . Tracie pictured with her motherÂ Philomena Lawlor, left, did not let her condition hold her back, studying a music and English degree at university and traveling through China for six months . Mr Lawlor said: 'You can sit down and take it or get up and move, was her (Tracie) outlook. She convinced me to do the same.' Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease affecting the lungs, glands, pancreas and digestive tract. It is caused by a faulty gene. The gene controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your cells, so the lungs and digestive tract become clogged with mucus, making it hard to breathe and digest food. More than 2.5 million people in the UK carry the faulty gene - around one in 25 of the population. There is no cure for the disease. But there are a number of different treatments available to help manage the condition, including physiotherapy, exercise, medication and nutrition. Each week five babies are born with CF and two people in the UK die from the disease. More than half of sufferers will live past the age of 41, and improved care treatments mean a baby born with CF today is expected to live even longer. Symptoms of CF include a troublesome cough, repeated chest infections, prolonged diarrhoea and poor weight gain. Mr Lawlor said: 'It is really exciting as it has never been done before. 'It is something I do to help my CF and it helps Â my mental health and overall feeling of wellbeing. 'It is excellent at maintaining health for CF patients and improving mental health too.' The study is already underway and in total the TLT4CF need to raise around Â£51,000. This weekend a group of friends are taking on the Three Peaks Challenge to try and help Mr Lawlor and his mother Philomena Lawlor,56, from Wexford, raise the final Â£11,000 needed to complete the research. Mr Lawlor said the trust is a 'fitting' tribute to his big sister's memory. He told MailOnline:Â 'The two of us became very close. 'She was my big sister and was always making sure I didn't skip my medication. She proved to me that you could do anything, regardless of being a CF sufferer. 'She showed me it was possible to go to college and travel. Tracie spent six months in China, she did what she wanted and proved it to me too. 'Of course it took a lot of effort and determination but she was always positive. Mr Lawlor said Tai Chi helps him to maintain his health as well as improving his mental health. He hopes the results of the study will help other sufferers . 'As a CF patient you always hear negative stories, horror stories, but Tracie's story was an example of real achievement despite her illness. 'Tracie had so many friends, she never let CF hold her back. If I ever whinged about it, I would get a swift slap around the head.' Mr Lawlor added: 'Tracie had a firm belief that laughing is a massive part of life and we all should live life laughing. 'She managed to draw on this in all situations and it seemed to work. 'I would often ask, ""what's the point if you live so short? What's the point if you're going to die""? 'She would reply, ""it's not about how long but how much you do"". 'And she led by example, sheÂ volunteeredÂ as a helper for a charity in New York, helping disabled children. 'You can sit down and take it or get up and move, was her outlook. She convinced me to do the same.' Visit the Tracie Lawlor Trust website here, or the family's Just Giving pageÂ to donate to their cause.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Scottish scientists claim that speaking two languages (illustrated) does not give people cognitive advantages as previously claimed . The notion that being bilingual makes you smarter has been the focus of numerous scientific studies in recent years. But now researchers claim that there is a growing battery of evidence that this is a myth. In one experiment, they did not detect any cognitive benefit in people who could speak two languages. They say that the widely held belief could be the result of publication bias - where a study only gets published if an effect is found. Language experts from Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland, originally set out to explain why being bilingual makes people smarter. They wanted to see whether there was a similar cognitive advantage to speaking two dialects - something that had not been looked at before. To find out, they examined cognitive control in a group of people who switched between speaking a Dundonian dialect and standard Scottish English, with cognitive control in two other groups: bilinguals and monolinguals. They used a test known as the Simon task, which enables psychologists to examine inhibitory control. They were surprised to find that the bilingual people performed no better in the cognitive task than those who spoke one language, or a dialect. Vera Kempe, Professor of Psychology of Language Learning at the university, said there were no differences in performance at all. âWhen we started our research, we were convinced - like everybody else - that there was an advantage to being bilingual, but when we carried out our analysis, we were astonished by the results. The scientists claim that there is no conclusive evidence that bilingualism makes you smarter. Previous studies have claimed that the ability to speak two languages (such as Bradley Cooper who speaks French pictured left and Mila Kunis, who speaks Russian, right) have better memories and problem-solving abilities . Last year, scientists claimed that people who can switch between two languages seamlessly have a higher level of mental flexibility than monolinguals. They said bilingualism strengthens the brain's executive functions, such as its working memory and ability to multitask and problem solve. The psychologists claimed that as fluent bilinguals seem to use both languages at all times but rarely use words unintentionally, they have control of both languages simultaneously. Judith Kroll, professor of psychology, linguistics and women's studies at Penn State University, said: 'Not only is bilingualism not bad for you, it may be really good. 'When you're switching languages all the time it strengthens your mental muscle and your executive function becomes enhanced.' The study found fluent bilinguals have both languages 'active' at the same time, whether they are consciously using them or not. Pointing to bilingual people's ability to rarely say a word in the unintended language, the researchers said they have the ability to control both languages to select the one they want to use without  thinking about it. âAlthough we had replicated the original study to the letter, we found no benefit in either of our bilingual groups - neither in the Gaelic-English bilinguals, nor the bilinguals speaking a variety of Asian languages. âAt first we were stumped. How could this be? How could we have failed to find an effect, when we knew there was supposed to be one? âWhen we began to dig deeper, we discovered that - far from being an anomaly - our study is actually one in a now growing number of studies that fail to find that bilingualism makes you smarter. âIn other words, there is actually no conclusive evidence that bilingualism makes you smarter.â She believes that publication bias could be to blame and that it is misleading for educational policy recommendations to be based on the belief that learning languages makes you smarter when it is not yet clear whether this is true. Professor Kempe said: âSaying that âsome scientists carried out a study, but didnât find anything,â doesnât make for a very good story - and that is where the problem lies. âThere is so much pressure to demonstrate novelty and real-life impact that it has sometimes been difficult for scientists to get studies published if they havenât found something startling and newsworthy. âOther factors that come with being bilingual - like being an immigrant or coming from a culture which values mentally challenging activities - may be responsible for a benefit in some instances.â She said that while psychologists are keen to understand whether learning more languages leads to mental agility, they do not have conclusive evidence yet. Professor Kempe said: âWhat we can do in the meanwhile, though, is to encourage everybody - especially young people - to learn languages not based on the selfish motive of boosting individual brain power, but because knowing languages affords us the opportunity to connect with different people from different backgrounds and cultures.â âPerhaps being able to see the world from another point of view is the most beneficial and mind-enhancing effect that comes with learning languages.â The new study is one of many that claims that being bilingual doesn't make people smarter. However, a study in June showed that learning a second language (stock image) at any point in life could help keep your brain sharp as you age . Learning to speak a second language at any point in your life could help keep your brain sharp as you age, according to a study published in June. Academics at the University of Edinburgh detected a pattern of slower mental decline among the bilingual in a group of 835 born in 1936. They were given an intelligence test in 1947 at the age of 11, then retested in their early 70s between 2008 and 2010. A total of 262 participants could communicate in at least one language other than English. Of those, 195 learnt the second language before the age of 18. Those who spoke two or more languages had significantly better cognitive abilities in their 70s than their peers. The strongest effect of bilingualism was seen in general intelligence and reading tests. Dr Thomas Bak, who led the research, said: 'Our study shows that bilingualism, even when acquired in adulthood, may benefit the ageing brain.â Experts said the research opened the doors to further investigations which may help doctors find new ways to understand mental decline in older people.","Language experts from Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland, originally set out to explain why being bilingual makes people smarter .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Scientists say they now have firm evidence that our solar system is contained inside a large âbubbleâ. They say that 10 million years ago a nearby cluster of supernovas went off like 'popcorn' and blew an enormous bubble in the interstellar medium that we now inhabit. Called the âLocal Bubbleâ, this peanut-shaped area 300 light-years across reveals why there is very little of the dust and gas seen elsewhere in the universe in our vicinity. Scroll down for video explanation . Researchers at the University of Miami say they have found evidence that our solar system is inside a 'bubble' (diagram shown) where there is no dust and gas seen elsewhere in the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble theory suggests that this material was blasted away be supernovas millions of years ago . The Local Bubble was first postulated in the 1970s and 1980s, but the existence of it had been contested. At the time, when astronomers looked around our solar system, they found an odd lack of gas and dust seen in the interstellar medium elsewhere in the universe . Meanwhile, astronomers had begun detecting an abundance of X-ray radiation around Earth. This suggested that our solar system was mostly empty because radiation from supernovas had blasted away our interstellar medium. While these supernovas were not enough to exterminate life on Earth, they were close enough to wrap our solar system in a bubble of hot gas that persists today. Contesting the theory, however, some scientists said that the X-rays could be accounted for by the sun. They claimed that something known as âcharge exchangeâ could be to blame, which involves solar wind causing X-ray radiation by âstealingâ electrons from neutral gas in space. To see which theory was true, researchers from the University of Miami launched a sounding rocket, one that flies into space on a short trip and back, from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in December 2012. There is a stream of interstellar helium atoms that flows through the solar system. Every year in December, Earth passes through the 'helium focusing cone,' a region where this neutral helium is concentrated by the gravitational influence of the sun. The researchers figured the helium focusing cone was probably the strongest source of charge exchange X-rays in the solar system. Using the sounding rocket, they measured the X-ray glow of the helium and found that it could not account for all of the X-rays astronomers had been seeing. There must be a Local Bubble of hot gas to account for the difference. The rocket reached a peak altitude of 160 miles (260 km) and spent five minutes above the atmosphere, carrying with it an x-ray detector called the Diffuse x-ray emission from the Local Galaxy (DXL). During the flight, DXL found that 40 per cent of soft x-rays detected originated in the solar system. The rest, researchers surmised in their paper in the journal Nature, must come from a Local Bubble of hot gas left over from supernovas explosions. 'This is a significant discovery,' said Professor Massimiliano Galeazzi, who led the research. '[It] affects our understanding of the area of the galaxy close to the sun, and can, therefore, be used as a foundation for future models of the galaxy structure.' Galeazzi and collaborators are already planning the next flight of DXL, which will include additional instruments to better characterise the emission. The launch is currently planned for December 2015. Evidence suggests that many supernovas exploded like 'popcorn' near our solar system millions of years ago, leaving their radiation behind as a signature of their action. In this image a supernova remnant lies in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a small galaxy about 170,000 light-years from Earth .","Researchers at the University of Miami say they have found evidence that our solar system is inside a 'bubble'

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Manchester City and Bayern Munich are no stranger to one another in the Champions League group stage. They meet at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday night for the fifth time in the past three years. And itâs fair to say their encounters invariably throw up headline news. Here, SportsmailÂ takes a look at their previous meetingsâ¦ . Manchester City and Bayern Munich face each other for the fifth time in just three years on Wednesday, with Sergio Aguero (left) key to Manuel Pellegrini's side's chances and Arjen Robben (right) pivotal for Pep Guardiola . Bayern 2-0 City â 27 Sep, 2011, Group stage . With City trailing by two and with more than half an hour left on the clock, Roberto Mancini instructed substitute Carlos Tevez to get warmed up. The Argentine, infamously, refused. And so began a saga which saw Tevez exiled from the first team for six months, Mancini having said after the game that he would never play for the club again. The visitors had earlier been outclassed and were blown away by a Mario Gomez double before the break. Carlos Tevez refused to come off the bench for Man City in the 2-0 loss at Bayern Munich in September 2011 . Mario Gomez bagged a brace for the home side as they ran out 2-0 victors in Champions League group stage . After refusing to come on as a substitute, Tevez was dropped from the side until the following March . First he reacted quickest after Joe Hart had saved Franck Riberyâs free-kick, and again he seized upon a rebound from the goalkeeper to make it two. City found little by way of a response after half-time but it was Tevezâs refusal to aid his team-matesâ cause which made the headlines. He returned to the team in March and played a key role in their title victory, earning forgiveness for his meltdown in Munich. Joe Hart can only watch as Mario Gomez puts Bayern Munich ahead against Manchester City at the Allianz . Roberto Mancini could only watch the match with his head in his hands as City succumbed to a 2-0 loss . City 2-0 Bayern â 7 Dec, 2011, Group stage . The significance of a win over Bayern - albeit a weakened version - was relegated by events elsewhere as Napoli beat Villarreal to claim second place behind the German table toppers. For defeats in Bavaria and Naples meant Roberto Manciniâs side had surrendered their own fate going into the final group game. Nonetheless, they saw home their end of the bargain and, for a while, it looked as though they might just scrape through into the knockout stages. David Silva scored Manchester City's opener during a 2-0 win over Bayern Munich in December 2011 . Manchester City stars Sergio Aguero (left) and Gael Clichy (right) congratulate scorer Silva (centre) But when news filtered through that Gokhan Inler had scored for Napoli in Spain, an eerie silence descended on the Etihad. Earlier, David Silva fired a sublime opener as he defied the odds to locate the bottom corner with a sweet left-footed strike. Edin Dzeko had been the provider for that goal and he again assisted as Yaya Toure added a second after the break with a low poke having been slipped through on goal. But it mattered not and the Europa League beckoned for Manciniâs men. Yaya Toure (fourth right) is congratulated after netting City's second against Bayern at the Etihad . City 1-3 Bayern â 2 Oct, 2013, Group stage . A win for Munich? Or a defeat for City? For the hosts were so poor that Bayern barely had to break sweat. But one man who was left sweating on his place in the City side was Joe Hart after a horror performance which raised questions over his credentials as Englandâs No 1. The game was only seven minutes old when he allowed Franck Riberyâs shot from range to escape his grasp and snake across the line. Joe Hart had a night to forget against Bayern in October 2013 as City succumbed to a 3-1 loss at the Etihad . Thomas Muller puts Bayern 2-0 up as Hart can only watch on during the Champions League group-stage match . Hart's poor performance eventually led to him being dropped from the City side following the Bayern match . Gael Clichy was another enduring a torrid evening and he was at fault as Thomas Muller skipped clear before rounding Hart for Bayernâs second. By the hour mark it was three, Arjen Robben beating the forlorn Clichy with ease before firing beyond Hart who made a feeble attempt to cover his near post. A late rally - in which Alvaro Negredo scored a fine consolation and Jerome Boateng was sent off the visitors - did not mask what was a worrying display, particularly from Hart who was subsequently benched.

Bayern 2-3 City â 12 Dec, 2013, Group stage . This was supposed to be the night when City came of age in Europe, reversing a two-goal deficit to win at the home of the European champions. Instead, it was a different number for which the thrilling contest was remembered - away goals, or rather, Manuel Pellegriniâs failure to grasp the concept of them. A 4-2 victory would have taken City through as group champions, the result bettering Bayernâs 3-1 win at the Etihad with the sides level on points. And Pellegriniâs maths malfunction - which saw him put on Jack Rodwell rather than Sergio Aguero when they should have been chasing a fourth goal - cost his team dear as they were drawn against Barcelona in the next round and were duly eliminated. It had, though, been a devastating display. James Milner holds his finger aloft after completing Manchester City's comeback win in December 2013 . Aleksandr Kolarov equalised from the penalty spot for City before Milner's winner in a 3-2 victory at Allianz . David Silva (right) had scored City's first goal as they came back to win but it was not enough to top the group . They were trailing by two inside 12 minutes. Thomas Muller raced clear before finishing beyond Joe Hart - restored to the side having been dropped in October - and the goalkeeper was picking the ball from his net soon after when Mario Gotze prodded in from close range. City had played a weakened team for what had appeared a dead rubber and it was one of those brought in, James Milner, who was key to their comeback. First, on 28 minutes, he nodded into the path of David Silva who halved the deficit. It was then Milner who won the penalty from which Alexsandar Kolarov drew parity just before the hour mark. And so it was left to Milner himself to produce a stunning winner with a measured curler from the edge of the area. Substitute Alvaro Negredo was denied by Manuel Neuer as City came close to a fourth and top spot, it was just a shame Pellegrini hadnât realised such. Manuel Pellegrini can only look on after miscalculating the number of goals his side needed to top the group .

"By . Ryan Kisiel For Daily Mail . The new England rugby kit was embroiled in more controversy yesterday over claims officials had decided to downplay its Victoria Cross design. The VC â the highest award for gallantry a member of the British or Commonwealth Armed Forces can receive â had been used for âinspirationâ on the new jerseys. A pattern of the medalâs shape is on the âball deadeningâ rubber grips on both the home white and red change strips. Scroll down for video . England players wear the new England rugby home kit, which has caused controversy . However The Times claimed that previous press releases had mentioned the medal design only for it to be omitted altogether at the last minute from Mondayâs launch. It alleged that both the shirt manufacturers Canterbury and the Rugby Football Union had a last minute change of heart over the appropriateness. Some fears that it was crass to associate bravery in the rugby world with the VC that is awarded for âmost conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrificeâ. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has drawn heavily on Englandâs rich rugby history and used previous military examples to inspire players. The former Leeds boss created the Arthur Harrison Award, where England coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance. Harrison is Englandâs only rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the Belgian Zeebrugge raid of April 1918 in the First World War. It is the latest embarrassment for the RFU, which was forced to defend its new kit after admitting it will be changed in 10 months in time for the sportâs world cup.

Arthur Harrison is Englandâs only rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the Belgian Zeebrugge raid of April 1918 in the First World War . Under the tournamentâs rules, all teams must remove sponsorship logos and attach a Rugby World Cup 2015 badge while taking part. Every country taking part will therefore have to change their strips by September. It means the England rugby team will only wear the Test shirt for around 12 matches before switching again. The manufacturers brought out three other Pro and Classic official jerseys at Â£56 each that are also replicas, but not made to the same standards as the Test strips the players wear. The new shirtâs design has not changed much from the previous one launched last September, apart from moving the English Rose badge from the left to the centre. Suppliers Canterbury claim the Test jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres, has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small loop collar. It also has a âball deadeningâ rubber grip chest panels that allegedly help players keep hold of the ball. However, some English and Welsh fans have questioned the all red change strip â colours usually worn by Wales. The row has heightened after both England and Wales will play each other in next yearâs tournament along with Australia in what has been dubbed the Group of Death. The RFU and Canterbury said in a joint statement: âWe are extremely pleased with our new kits and have worked in close collaboration during the design process. We had three key focus areas this season: the rose, which for the first time ever has moved to the centre of the shirt; the red colour for the alternate kit and the fact that the team would wear this against Samoa. âIn addition the grip detail takes inspiration from the Victoria Cross and this is something that England Rugby and Canterbury are proud of.â","The VC had been used for âinspirationâ on the new jerseys .
Some feared it was crass to associate bravery in rugby world with the VC .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Parents of university students whose summer adventures were ruined when a travel firm went bust claim it continued to advertise tours and request payments while it was in financial straits. Furious students, their parents and UK charities that benefited from the excursions all say there was no indication GBCE Ltd, trading as Student Adventures, was in trouble. Hundreds of students continued to raise cash and spend thousands of pounds on travel costs and equipment as the company struggled to stay afloat before it entered receivership Thursday, just days after it asked some students for final payment. Hard work: Student Hannah Robinson held events in the community to raise funds for charity . Now, the students are potentially out of pocket for the costs and the charities have lost an important source of fundraising. Charles Lankesterâs 20-year-old son, Nick, was one of almost 40 Nottingham University students who were blindsided at the very last second and forced to abandon their trek to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The students were checking in at London Gatwick Airport on Thursday when they received emails or text messages alerting them that GBCE was no longer in business. Mr Lankester said: âThey all travelled from all over the UK to be at Gatwick and literally as they were at the check-in desk they were advised that the trip wouldnât be taking place. âItâs better that it happened when it did. However, many students are already on their travel experiences and the fact that we were asked for the final payment days ago when the company must have had an indication of its financial problems leaves a very, very bad feeling. âFinancial problems donât arise within the space of 72 hours. Itâs a month-by-month thing.â Mount Kilimanjaro: Students were forced to abandon their trip after GBCE Ltd went into administration . Parents are demanding to know how long GBCE was quietly in financial straits, and they say the company could have done a better job at handling the situation. Mr Lankester said: âI think the company should have been far more transparent. It should have been honest and communicated earlier.â He said students spent countless hours collecting charitable donations from strangers â sometimes in the rain â while preparing for memorable trips around the world. His son raised money for the Meningitis Research Foundation. âHeâs like all his friends. Heâs angry, heâs disappointed and he is confused as to how this could happen, but mainly angry.â The Civil Aviation Authority says it has taken action to ensure travellers are protected, with around 100 currently abroad with GBCE who have scheduled airline tickets so will be able to travel home as planned. University of Portsmouth students are walking the Inca trail on a trip organised by Student Adventures . The CAA said those who were due to go on future trips with the company who received an Atol certificate when booking are protected for any money they paid directly to the company. An apparent customer named Sophie Bell took to Twitter to share her anger at the situation. She wrote: 'Still no contact from #studentadventures - what an absolutely disgraceful company... Diabolical situation.' Another, named only as Alice, said: 'Absolutely appalling that #studentadventures haven't had the decency to personally contact participants yet.' Students and parents are also questioning how none of the company's partners noticed when GBCE's ATOL licence was not renewed with the Civil Aviation Authority in March. Mr Lankester said that should have been 'a huge red flag'. Parents have expressed concerns for students who are carrying out charity expeditions after GBCE ceased trading and cancelled all of its services. Even though Student Adventures is no longer operating, students who departed on Wednesday are scheduled to go ahead with their six-day climb of Mount Kilimanjaro, starting on Saturday, according to the Meningitis Research Foundation. A group of students was scheduled to trek along the Great Wall of China for two weeks in September . Parent Andy Robinson, from Leicester, said he is concerned about the well-being of his 19-year-old daughter, Hannah, but is hoping she will be able to achieve her goal of climbing Africa's highest mountain. As the situation unfolded in the UK, the Plymouth University student was in transit in Tanzania and was supposed to begin her climb on Saturday. Her father said: âIâm really concerned that sheâs stuck in in Dar es Salaam and she canât get out, but weâll find out. âItâs a major trip and obviously itâs a concern anyway because climbing the highest free-standing mountain in the world is quite difficult.â She managed to raise Â£3,400 for the Meningitis Research Foundation by collecting donations from family, friends and strangers while holding events in the community. Angry students took to Twitter to share their frustrations about the lack of information available . University of Portsmouth students who are currently walking the Inca trail in Peru are safe and will continue their charity challenge with no problems, according to UPSU, the universityâs studentsâ union. UPSU said it believes the monies raised for the charities are already with the charities. Students, parents and charities have tried to get answers from GBCE, but the company is referring everyone to the Nottingham-based business recovery and insolvency team of Smith Cooper. Other companies working with Student Adventures rushed to reassure customers in the wake of the closure . Student Adventures has deleted its Twitter and Facebook accounts. In a statement provided by Smith Cooper, Student Adventures assured parents and guardians that any students who are currently overseas are safe and arrangements are being made to bring them back to the UK. Jock Wright, the St Albans-based tour operator's events director, said in a statement: 'We regret to inform all of those who have booked with us that, unless you are informed to the contrary, all trips going forward are cancelled and all reservations are therefore also cancelled. 'We believe that any trips booked before March of this year are covered by its ATOL protection scheme and should be entitled for a full refund.' Student Adventures takes travellers to places such as the Mount Everest base camp while supporting charities . The statement said the company is being placed into liquidation âdespite the best effortsâ of its directors and stakeholders . Students whose flights have not been cancelled would be travelling at their own risk and cost as no one will meet them at the airport and accommodations and excursions have not been arranged. Charities - which could be left millions of pounds out of pocket - and student unions are urging those students not to travel. Wright added: âThis is a great shock and extremely disappointing for many students who planned to fundraise for numerous charities. âHowever, we will be working with those who had bookings with GBCE to ensure that the necessary support is available to all of those who have been affected.' University of Birmingham student Fay Lepley was scheduled to leave for Mount Kilimanjaro with about 30 others next Thursday after nearly a year of planning, but their trip has been scrapped. The 19-year-old said she has spent up to Â£2,500 on the trip, including about Â£1,500 paid directly to Student Adventures, while fundraising for the Meningitis Research Foundation. One of the trips takes students to see mountain gorillas in theÂ Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda . She said: âItâs just so infuriating. So many people, my family, put so much into it. Even if I get the money back it doesnât solve anything.â Danielle Horner, a recent graduate of the University of Portsmouth who was supposed to depart for Mount Kilimanjaro on Tuesday, said she is feeling frustrated. The 21-year-old said: Iâm absolutely gutted. Iâm devastated because weâve all put in so much hard work, so much time and so much money.â She managed to raise over Â£3,000 for Practical Action. She added: âI can only hope that the charities are going to get the full amount of money.â Students who booked before GBCE's licence was revoked should be entitled to a refund under the ATOL scheme. They are also being told to contact their travel insurance provider, bank and credit card company.

"By . Kit Holden for MailOnline . Pep Guardiola returns to the Champions League on Wednesday night, with a new-look Bayern Munich team, designed to exorcise the ghosts of last season. After the humiliating 5-0 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid in last yearâs semi-final, the initial diagnosis was psychological. Bayern had rested on their laurels after winning the Bundesliga in record time over a month previously, and even Guardiola admitted that he had been too emotional in preparing his players for the clash. But there were also on-field issues to consider. Bayern, not used to conceding goals, had been run ragged on the counter attack. They had failed to use possession like they normally did, and were unable to find even the slightest gap in a less than impenetrable Real defence. Tactics and personnel at Bayern needed a rethink. Sergio Ramos scores the second goal in Real Madrid's semi-final rout of Bayern Munich last season . Cristiano Ronaldo scores Real fourth goal in the 4-0 Champions League win at the Allianz Arena . Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has been forced into a tactical rethink after seeing his side capitulate . Since then, Guardiola has set about revitalising his teamâs make-up and tactical approach. First off, he launched into the transfer market. With Robert Lewandowski already secured, the main issue was bolstering the defence, particularly after the injuries suffered in that area. Left back Juan Bernat was brought in from Valencia, Mehdi Benatia from Roma, and, of course, Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid. Alonso is perhaps the most significant in terms of the fallout from Real. Bayernâs susceptibility on the counter attack is hugely reduced by his presence. It is hard to imagine, meanwhile, that the team would have capitulated so poorly had they had his experience and cool head on their side against Real. Nonetheless, he is a quick fix. The reason Bayern chose to prise Alonso away from Real, rather than Sami Khedira, was that the signing was always to be a short-term solution, designed to allow the space to develop for young midfielders Gianluca Gaudino, Pierre-Emil Hojbjerg and Lucas Scholl. Most important in Guardiolaâs mini-revolution, however, have been the tactical changes. In the past few months, he has put paid to the idea that he is a man without a Plan B. He has laughed in the face of the critics who say he has one formation and one style: tiki-taka. There have been mixed results. Former Real Madrid star Xabi Alonso has been brought in by Bayern to add more stability to their play . Juan Bernat (right) was also brought in from Spain and has slotted in well at left back . Mehdi Benatia (right, with Franck Ribery) is yet another summer defensive recruit at the Allianz Arena . The first innovation was to revert to three at the back. Guardiola first showcased this approach during the German Cup Final against Dortmund in May. This was a 3-4-2-1, with Arjen Robben spearheading the Bayern attack, and it worked a dream. Bayern won 2-0, and exorcised a few of the ghosts of Real. The back-three experiment, designed as much as anything to allow Phillipp Lahm to play in his favoured midfield role, has developed since then. It was ineffective in pre-season, and while the 3-4-2-1 saw them past Preussen Munster in the Cup, Bayern were forced to revert to four at the back for their first three Bundesliga games. Injury to Javi Martinez meant that Lahm was needed once more in defence, with him and Juan Bernat assuming classic full back positions in a 4-2-3-1. That changed dramatically this weekend at Stuttgart, with Guardiola forming what could best be described as a 3-1-3-1-2, though that scarcely explains it. A back three opened out into the midfield diamond of Alonso, Lahm, Alaba and Gotze, while Bernat and Thomas Muller were given free rein on the wings, with Lewandowski up front. It brought a 2-0 victory. Manchester City will hope to exploit any remaining weakness in the Bayern defence on Wednesday night . Bernatâs role has been instrumental to Guardiolaâs change. With Toni Kroos having left, the versatile David Alaba has slotted into his attacking midfield role, leaving Bernat to fill the gap at left back. Despite Kroosâ quality, Bayern almost appear more flexible without him on paper. Alaba and Bernat, when on form, can synchronise on the left, with both as good in defence as in attack. it means that even without Franck Ribery, Bayern remain extremely dangerous on the overlap. The back-three is still a work in progress for Bayern, which, alongside injuries and fatigue, goes a long way to explaining their indifferent start to the season. But Guardiolaâs tinkering is not merely academic. It is the revitalisation of a system, designed to make Bayern much more flexible in attack, and more importantly, much less susceptible to counter attacking in defence. Lahmâs words at Tuesdayâs press conference said a great deal. 'If we press the ball well, and are organised in defence, and attack from that basis, (then we can outplay City)'. Last year at Bayern, they were all talking about possession. This year it is more complex. It is more focused on a defensive stability. The world, and Manchester City tonight, have Real Madrid to thank for that.

"By . Ashley Pearson for MailOnline . My search for the A-List experience brings me to Grace Belgravia, the women-only members club that caters to London's health conscious elite. Rumoured members include the ultra-fashionable Delevingne sisters; it's said that supermodel sister Cara prepped for one of her high profile runway shows through these very hallowed halls. Turning up through the front doors I feel as if I've stepped into a billionaire's private home instead of being in a high-end medi spa. Posh interior: The women-only members club looks like a billionaire's private home instead of a high-end medi spa . 'Prevention is the medicine of the millennium', says Dr Tim Evans, one of the country's most prominent physicians. It's immediately apparent to me, that when you are a member of the A-list, looking after your health means more than attending a Nutri-Bullet or a Kettlebell class once a week. It's a full-body, bespoke, luxury experience. I signed on for their three-day cleanse which is a combination of traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, fitness, spa treatments, and nutritional advice and menus. An MOT of sorts, the cleanse offers those seeking to overhaul their lifestyles a nudge in the right direction. My first initiation is with TCM practitioner Ross Campbell who will help design my personal cleanse. His manner is warm and inviting and we speak about the birth of my baby, where my health can improve and how I can achieve my goals. Model clientele: Cara Delevingne and her sister Poppy are rumoured to be members of Grace Belgravia . The fully equipped gym offers Pilates sessions, dynamic yoga, spin endurance workou . Ashley spent some of the 'loveliest days of her life' at Grace Belgravia . Notes based on my consultation will be put on file and all the other therapists will refer to them for the next three days, ensuring that everyone tailors their approach based on my specific needs. Being A-list is all about personalised services; nothing is ever general. The cleanse kicks off with a blood test consultation with one of the country's most prominent physicians, Dr. Tim Evans. His private patient list is so exclusive I had to sign an NDA not to name names. He gives me an analysis of my blood test, going through virtually every single facet of my health. He assures me that 'prevention is the medicine of the millennium' and encourages me to think proactively about my health, adding that 'good health begins with accepting responsibility for one's own health and wellbeing.' Lofty words, but between this and the atmosphere â I spotted a willowy supermodel in the changing room â I have only been here a few hours and am already kind of sold on this place. My day continues in the gym, set up by Matt Roberts who trains Samantha Cameron, Naomi Campbell and Amanda Holden. I have a Pilates session with handsome trainer Jason, who quickly picks up on the fact that my abdominal wall still hasn't closed since I gave birth. He recommends exercises I can do help the process. The spa is 'beyond gorgeous' and has the only flotation tank in the UK . This is swiftly followed by 'diet' lunch in the very glamorous restaurant which is comparable to any five-star restaurant. Honestly, if I could eat like this at every meal I would be super skinny by now. It's all been set up to be easily digestible; dishes are gluten-, sugar-, dairy- and caffeine-free. As you can probably surmise, the spa is beyond gorgeous. I have 'Face Therapy; which uses lymphatic suction and Chinese acupressure to tighten skin and fight wrinkles. I emerge looking less jowly and a little brighter. Next is a Traditional Chinese Medicine body balancing treatment, followed by a gentle but thorough colonic, and then, probably the best massage of my life, performed by Makiko, a trained osteopath from Japan. Then it's on to Hydrotherapy â water, steam, sea salt and essential oils all combined in a mixture of hot and cold temperatures. I start with a blistering sauna after which I stand under at 15-foot Vichy Shower on the 'cool fog' setting. Note to Grace â it really should be called Arctic Fog. Then it's into the steam room followed by the far more soothing 'Tropical Rain' setting. The three-day cleanse is an MOT of sorts and offers those seeking to overhaul their lifestyles a nudge in the right direction . Grace Belgravia has launched a taster of the new cleanse for those keen to sample the lifestyle . The treatment continues with a sea salt scrub, and a spirulina body wrap. And ends with a shower therapy where jets of water sway up and down from the ceiling on top of me, offering a delightful kind of water massage. I can't leave without stealing a few moments in the flotation tank. It's the only one in the UK, and I make sure to spend several moments gently buoyant on a soft, warm cushion atop waves. After three days I literally feel as if I am floating out of the building when I leave for the evening. At Â£1,900 the treatment doesn't come cheap. But it was, without exaggeration, some of loveliest days of my life and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Hundreds of students set to take on adventures in support of charities have been forced to abandon their plans after a UK travel firm went bust without warning. About 40 people from Nottingham University were grounded at Gatwick airport on Thursday, after they were told the news via text message or email while en route to Tanzania to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. And there are concerns for students currently carrying out charity expeditions around the world after trip organiser GBCE Ltd, operating as Student Adventures, ceased trading and cancelled all of its services. Mount Kilimanjaro: Students were forced to abandon their trip after GBCE Ltd went into administration . Currently there are students in Tanzania, where they were preparing to scale Africa's tallest mountain, as well as Peru, where they are walking the Inca trail to Machu Picchu. To ease parents' concerns, GBCE issued a statement through the Nottingham-based business recovery and insolvency team of Smith Cooper, which is handling calls and queries. The company said: âGBCE assure parents and guardians that any travellers who are currently âin countryâ are safe and that arrangements are being made to ensure they are able to return back to the UK as arranged during the time of booking.â Students set to depart soon have been told their flights may still be valid but they would be travelling at their own risk and cost because no one would meet them at the airport and accommodations and excursions have not been arranged. Charities - which could be left millions of pounds out of pocket - and studentsâ unions are urging those students not to travel. And they have said there was no indication the St Albans-based tour operator was in trouble.

'We believe that any trips booked before March of this year are covered by its ATOL protection scheme and should be entitled for a full refund.' The statement said the company is being placed into liquidation âdespite the best effortsâ of its directors and stakeholders. Wright added: âThis is a great shock and extremely disappointing for many students who planned to fundraise for numerous charities. âHowever, we will be working with those who had bookings with GBCE to ensure that the necessary support is available to all of those who have been affected.' University of Portsmouth students are walking the Inca trail on a trip organised by Student Adventures . Jane Futrell, a spokeswoman for the Meningitis Research Foundation, for which students have been raising cash by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, said 20 students who departed the UK earlier this month have already reached the summit and are off the mountain. She said another ten will begin their climb on Saturday, as their trip has not been affected by Student Adventures' troubles. Concerned parent Andy Robinson was waiting for an update from his 19-year-old daughter Hannah, a Plymouth University student who is in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and was scheduled to begin her six-day climb of the mountain on Saturday. He said: âIâm really concerned that sheâs stuck in in Dar es Salaam and she canât get out, but weâll find out. âItâs a major trip and obviously itâs a concern anyway because climbing the highest free-standing mountain in the world is quite difficult.â A group of students was scheduled to trek along the Great Wall of China for two weeks in September . Despite all of the uncertainty, he is still hoping his daughter, who is pursuing a career as a volcanologist, will be able to scale the dormant volcanic mountain after raising Â£3,400 for the Meningitis Research Foundation. She collected cash from family and friends, and held events in the community to collect donations from strangers. University of Portsmouth students who are currently walking the Inca trail are safe and will continue their charity challenge with no problems, according to UPSU, the universityâs studentsâ union. UPSU said it believes the monies raised for the charities are already with the charities. International development charity Practical Action said it understands the travellers who are currently overseas will continue their trips as scheduled with no changes to their planned itinerary. University of Birmingham student Fay Lepley was scheduled to leave for Mount Kilimanjaro with about 30 others next Thursday after nearly a year of planning, but their trip has been scrapped. The 19-year-old said she has spent up to Â£2,500 on the trip, including about Â£1,500 paid directly to Student Adventures, while fundraising for the Meningitis Research Foundation.

Iâm devastated because weâve all put in so much hard work, so much time and so much money.â She managed to raise over Â£3,000 for Practical Action. She added: âI can only hope that the charities are going to get the full amount of money.â GBCE was ATOL bonded until the end of March but its licence was not renewed with the Civil Aviation Authority, the Independent reported. Students who booked before the licence was revoked should be entitled to a refund under the ATOL scheme. They are also being advised to contact their travel insurance provider, bank and credit card company. People who booked a trip using PayPal should contact that service. Futrell said: âThere is a lot of disappointment. A lot of them have worked extremely hard and we have sympathy for them. âItâs really frustrating for them and a lot of them are upset because they were raising money for charity and they didnât want to let us down.â One of the trips takes students to see mountain gorillas in theÂ Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda . Student Adventuresâ excursions include treks to see gorillas in Africaâs Rwenzori Mountains, an Arctic adventure and a bike ride from London to Paris. For years they have acted as a major fundraiser for charities. Futrell said: âItâs one of our more successful fundraisers. This has been one of the most popular ways for students to raise funds because it challenges them and it is something exciting.â Meanwhile, phone calls to Student Adventures are being directed to an answering service, and receptionists are referring all callers to Smith Cooper. In a statement, Michael Roome, Smith Cooper's director of business recovery, said: 'GBCEâs challenges were perfect for students due to the budget price and the high interest amongst students wanting to travel and try something new.

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . CLICK HERE to find out who US captain Tom Watson will be targetting at Gleneagles . Europe Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley couldnât help but squirm watching Dublinâs Gaelic football team lose a recent match to Donegal the Irish world and his wife thought they would win. For a start, Dublin are his team. He played for their junior sides until a knee injury ended his hopes of progress. But you can also imagine the uncomfortable analogy running through his head since the bookmakers and vast parts of America appear to have given up on the visitors making even a decent fist of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next week. âThe only worry Iâve got regarding the Ryder Cup is that itâs sport at the highest level and we all know anything can happen,â he said. Captain Paul McGinley is worried about Europe's tag as overwhelming favourites for the Ryder Cup . McGinley caught the fear after seeingÂ Dublinâs Gaelic football team lose a recent match to lowly Donegal . âThat Dublin match brought home the point. They were odds of 1/10 to win. I know the Dublin manager, Jim Gavin, very well and he will have prepared his side as well as you could possibly prepare them, and yet they still lost. But thatâs sport at the pinnacle. There are no guarantees.â American pessimism is focused on the absence of star players Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, plus their best two on current form â Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk. McGinley, however, is adamant there will be no complacency. âIf we donât win I can assure you it will not be because of that,â he said. âWe know how strongly motivated they are going to be. We will be absolutely ready for this.â McGinley is at the Wales Open, where he had dinner on Tuesday night with four of his Ryder Cup team â Jamie Donaldson, Stephen Gallacher, Thomas Bjorn and Lee Westwood â who are competing here at Celtic Manor. Westwood and Donaldson have been âdrawnâ together for the first two rounds â donât be surprised if that proves a pairings rehearsal for next week â as have Bjorn and Gallacher. US team are missing several key players including their main man Tiger Woods through injury . As for the other two who were expected to play â Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson â McGinley allayed any fears regarding their absence. âI know Graeme was very keen to play here,â said McGinley. âBut heâs just become a dad and itâs fair to say family reasons came into play and explain his absence. âIâm sure he will enlighten you himself but Iâve no worries. I know how motivated he is to do well next week. Heâs going home to Northern Ireland for the weekend and he will be refreshed and ready to go at Gleneagles.â And the enigmatic Frenchman? âVictor is Victor,â said McGinley, smiling. âHe decided at a very late stage he would be better staying in France. The players themselves obviously know whatâs best for them in terms of preparation. âThe thing that makes me happy about his preparation is that his record shows heâs a guy who disappears and then all of a sudden comes out of nowhere and plays well.â (L-R) Jamie Donaldson, Lee Westwood, Thomas Bjorn and Stephen Gallacher are preparing at Wales Open . Graeme McDowell decided to sit out of the Wales Open after recently becoming a father . Westwood is the only one of the quartet present who was here for the Ryder Cup, and couldnât help but wryly note the differences, with the sun shining and everyone in shirt sleeves. âThe ball is rolling, which makes a change, and I seem to remember there were rather more people on the bank at the 16th and 18th holes,â he said. Westwood hasnât been seen for three weeks and has clearly been using the time well. In all he has lost 23lb since starting a diet at the beginning of August, and has been working out twice daily in the gym. Derek Lawrenson interviewed Raymond Floyd while he was taking a massage at the 1985 Ryder Cup . Donaldson hasnât played since clinching his place with a stirring victory in the Czech Open three tournaments ago and could hardly ask for a better tune-up than competing on home soil. Asked about being a 38-year-old rookie, he gave a thoughtful response. âYou just never know when your time to play well will be, do you?â he said. âI know at 25 or 26 I was miles away from being ready to play. But my time is now. Iâm ready to play, and Iâm ready to keep trying to improve in the future.â England's Lee Westwood has lost 23lbs since starting a new diet in August . Stephen Gallacher is thankful to escape the clamour for Ryder Cup tickets back home in Scotland . Gallacher lives a 30-minute drive from Gleneagles and has played a couple of practice rounds, but heâs one home-based Scot whoâs happy being south of the border . âIâm glad to be back at work because itâs all got a bit manic up the road,â he said, more a reference to the clamour for Ryder Cup tickets and the demands on his time media-wise than other matters presently concerning his nation. As for McGinley, he was only too happy to express an opinion on the other vote going on in Scotland today, at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. âIâm like most people, I think ladies should be members, and hopefully it is pushed through,â he said.","Paul McGinley is worried that Europe could be undone at the Ryder Cup .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A far cry from the relative safety of a modern boxing ring, these stunning photos show the brutal West African sport of Dambe, and look like something out of Fight Club. The gloves are well and truly off here - instead, the contestants' stronger hands are wrapped in hard rope - which in the old days could even be dipped in resin and shards of broken glass. That practice is now illegal, but the sport is dangerous enough without it - the aim is to strike your opponent with kicks and punches, trying to make them fall to the floor. Scroll down for video . Brutal boxing: A fighter aims a high, right-footed kick at his opponent's head, who looks to duck away from the powerful attack . Eyes on the prize: One of the fighters pushes his opponent's lead arm away and goes to swing his rope-clad hand at his side . Clashing: Two older boys grapple, with one managing to land a painful uppercut to his opponent's exposed jaw . Hit where it hurts: A fighter clad in Chelsea FC shorts lands a left-handed punch to his unsuspecting opponent's forehead . Knocking someone down in Dambe is known as 'killing' -  the sport is traditionally practised as training for war, and shares much of the same terminology. Dambe belongs to the Hausa people. It is centuries old, but is still very popular in Nigeria, southern Niger and the south west of Chad. The tradition is entrenched among butcher caste groups and is very heavily focussed on communities.The sport started from clans of butchers travelling to different villages at harvest and fighting those from the area as part of the festival entertainment. Butchers come from a lower caste of Hausa society - they are the only ones who could ritually slaughter animals and handle meat. They would form teams from the village - known as armies - and challenge men from other butchers guilds, as well locals from the audience. Stand off: Two fighters scout each other out, looking for an opening to make the first move and try and achieve a 'killing' - the name for a take-down . Clubbed: Two younger fighters battle it out in the sandy arena, as one is caught on the back by a swinging arm, but avoids a killer shot . Watching on: Dambe is a very popular spectator sport, and those who come to watch bet on the outcome and chant support or taunts at the fighters . Chowing down: A fighter is caught in the mouth by a flailing arm but has his opponent on the ropes and falling to the ground with a strong head-shot . Nowadays, that sense of team is still very strong, and the sport is still dominated by the butchers caste, but competitors will often be very young - teenagers who train in gyms and yards - and will fight all year round. Fighters join a professional community which travel to fight, often now in temporary rings, rather than just inside a circle of spectators as in the past. They fight for prize money - just as they did traditionally - as harvest was a time of wealth. They wear shorts, rather than loincloths, and the pre-fight entertainment is more elaborate, and can even use sound systems. The fights in these pictures, taken in Nigeria, took place inside a sand-filled arena, which can be found in larger towns and are also used for wrestling championships. Team spirit: Dambe is traditionally a sport where fighters travel in teams, challenging people from other villages, and this is still the case today . Poised to strike: Two youngsters, one a left-hander, look to make the first move and get the upper hand in the bout . The gloves are off: The fighters do not wear gloves, but instead wrap their stronger hand with rope - which they once could dip in resin and shards of glass . Dambe used to include an element of wrestling, known as Kokawa, but is now essentially about punching and kicking. Fights last three rounds - though these rounds are not timed - their end is signified either when there is a lull in the action, one of the contestants or an official calls a stop to it, or when someone is knocked down. There are no official weight classes, though fighters are normally matched up with someone of a similar size. The strapped up strong arm is knows as the 'spear', while the front hand is called the 'shield' - and must be held with the palm open and facing the opponent. As well as for protection, the shield can also be used to grab hold of an opponent. Contestants can also kick with both legs - the lead leg can sometimes be wrapped with a chain and is also used for defence. Spectators are a key part of the whole event - they create the atmosphere by chanting to support or taunt the competitors, while betting is also prevalent. Other traditions include the use of amulets for supernatural protection, with some fighters wrapping them to their spear hand, while some of the fighting groups also ritually smoke marijuana before matches. Time to relax: A fighter spits water into the air and lets it fall back over his face to cool down after a brutal battle .","Dambe is a West African form of boxing which originates from the butcher caste of the Hausa people .

"By . Simon Cable for MailOnline . Disney want to introduce military-style drones to create spectacular entertainment shows, state-of-the-art aerial  floating movie screens and magical flying puppets in their US theme parks. Tourists flocking to Disney World in Florida and Disney Land in California could be in for a treat if plans to use theÂ small, unmanned flight systems are accepted by the US government. The company have applied to use the cutting edge technology to create aerial displays such as floating projection screens and marionettes held up by the contraptions. Disney claim that if the new technology is approved it will greatly improve their entertainment shows . Disney claim the drones would be able to carry a blimp-sized character through the sky, while other puppets could even be animated by a flock of drones manipulating different limbs . They say the drones, which would be controlled from the ground and carefully monitored to prevent them colliding with each other, will lead to a huge improvement in the way in which the puppets are orchestrated in their hugely popular parades and shows. The drones would also be resistant to strong winds, the company said. In the case of marionettes, a drone would be capable of carrying a blimp-sized character through the sky to simulate flight. Other puppets could even be animated by a flock of drones manipulating individual limbs. The commercial use of drones is currently banned by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but Disney says the technology can solve a problem with aerial displays which have been 'limited in how easy it has been to alter the choreography and to provide a repeatable show'. Walt Disney  has filed three patents which could allow them to use the small, unmanned machines . The commercial use of drones is currently banned by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but Disney say aerial displays could be improved by the introduction of drones . It has even been suggested that large mail order companies could develop UAVs to deliver their goods to customers in the future . 'This is a significant improvement over prior flying characters, which typically were provided in the form of parade or other blimps/balloons filled with hot air or other gases and that had little and/or awkward articulation of any movable parts,' the company said in its patent application. In filing for the patents, Disney joins a list of companies pressing for the US government to allow commercial use of the flying machines which have so far been restricted to military use and government surveillance. The machines, also called unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, are currently used in war-zones and military operations to provide an effective means of gathering intelligence and venturing into hostile areas without the need of a pilot. Disney  published the applications last week for what it described as aerial display systems with floating pixels, floating projection screens and marionettes held up by the contraptions . Disney joins a list of companies pressing for the US government to allow commercial use of the flying machines which have so far been restricted to military use and government surveillance . The machines were first used in WWII, but there have been significant developments in the technology since then. It has even been suggested that large mail order companies could develop UAVs to deliver their goods to customers in the future. It was last year that the chief executive of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, revealed the company had been testing unmanned drones to deliver goods. The FAA is currently in the process of drafting rules for the commercial use of drones for everything from TV news coverage to package delivery to crop monitoring. Representative for Disney have not yet commented on the proposals.","Company has applied to use unmanned flight systems in their shows .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Daredevil tourists are lining up to visit Icelandâs largest volcano as it begins to display evidence that a small eruption has occurred. A 5.0 magnitude earthquake rocked Bardarbunga today as scientists boarded a reconnaissance flight to get a better view of deep âcauldronsâ that have formed in a glacier that conceals the rumbling volcano. The Icelandic Meteorological Office said the depressions developed as a result of an ice melt that may have been caused by a sub-glacial eruption, but it is not known when it may have occurred. Scroll down for video . Get a look at this: Tourists photograph the Eyjafjallajokull eruption in southern Iceland in March 2010 . Scientists say the cracks are 30 to 50 feet deep, about half a mile wide and up to three miles in length in an area south of the Bardarbunga caldera. There are fears that an eruption could disrupt air travel over Europe, but Icelandâs meteorological office says there is no evidence that a large eruption is underway. The countryâs aviation alert level remains at orange after it was briefly raised to red â its highest level â last weekend when a possible eruption was reported. Bardarbunga is located under Icelandâs largest glacier and it has been rocked by thousands of earthquakes for nearly two weeks. More than 400 earthquakes were detected between midnight and 6am today. The strongest one yet occurred Tuesday morning with a magnitude of 5.7. TheÂ VatnajÃ¶kull glacier, which covers the Bardarbunga volcano, is pictured in this file photo . Grounded: Passengers look at a flight board displaying dozens of cancellations during theÂ Eyjafjallajokull crisis . While airlines remain on alert and travellers nervously book flights, UK-based travel company Discover the World has received plenty of its interest in its âvolcano hotlineâ. The tour operator is planning to fly customers to the eruption site â if there is one â and almost 200 people have signed up over the last week. In 2010, Discover the World took tourists to the Fimmvorduhals eruption in south-western Iceland. That eruption occurred about a month before the Eyjafjallajokull volcano spewed a massive cloud of ash that shut down much of Europeâs airspace for six days, causing widespread travel chaos during the crisis.","A 5.0 magnitude earthquake rocked the Bardarbunga volcano today .

"By . Erin Clements for MailOnline . Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut,Â has announced plans to open a store in Tokyo. This will be the second storefront for the world-renowned pastry chef, who launched his eponymous bakery in New York's Soho neighborhood in 2011. The new outpost will open in Omotesando Hills, a shopping complex in central Tokyo, in summer 2015. Fully baked idea: Pastry chef Dominique Ansel announced plans to open a Tokyo store in an Instagram post Wednesday . Mr Ansel made the announcement on Instagram Wednesday afternoon. 'Dear Tokyo! Yes - it is true. We will be opening our first international store (and second store in the world) here in Japan. This is something that means a lot to me and a city that every pastry chef aspires to.' Mr Ansel said that he was grateful to his partners TSI Holdings and Transit General, known for their work with fashion and food brands. Top chef: Mr Ansel rose to fame last year after creating the Cronut,Â a donut/croissant hybrid . Feeding frenzy: Customers have been known to line up around the block to get their hands on a Cronut . He added: 'There will be something created just for Tokyo, and I will personally see every aspect of development. I can't wait to personally welcome everyone on opening day.' The pastry chef rose to fame last year after inventing the Cronut, a donut/croissant hybrid so popular that customers would wait in line for it hours before the bakery opened. Just last month, he introduced his latest dessert innovation, the Pretzel Lobster Tail - soft pretzels stuffed with peanut butter and butter-crunch brittle in the shape of a crustacean. Hot spot: The Dominique Ansel bakery opened in New York's Soho in 2011 . His creations have also included a chocolate chip cookie shot, a chocolate souffle hidden in a brioche and a sundae in a can. Earlier this year, the James Beard Foundation named him as America's best pastry chef. Mr Ansel recently told FastCoDesign that he doesn't want the Cronut's success to kill his creativity. 'Iâm glad we created it at the bakery, but at the same time, I donât think we should only bet on the Cronut. I have a lot more ideas,' he said. He added: 'If I were only doing Cronuts, I think Iâd be kind of sad. I wouldnât have a chance to keep doing new things. Iâm super excited about creating new products. And my staff is super excited.'",The renowned pastry chef says to expect a new dessert 'created just for Tokyo'

"By . Nelson Groom for Daily Mail Australia . A couple has revealed they were offered baby Gammy, the Down syndrome boy who was caught in the middle of an international surrogacy scandal, by the same agency Gammy's Australian parentsÂ  used. The ABC has revealed the extreme measures that David and Wendy Farnell, from Bunbury, Western Australia, as well as the Thailand Surrogacy agency, considered using to 'get rid' of the unwanted infant. It has been revealed the agency tried to give Gammy to Kim and Brendan Cross, also from Australia, who had been struggling to conceive a child for years and had turned to Thai surrogacy officials for help. Scroll down for video . Kim Cross, pictured with her son Braxton, says Thailand Surrogacy tried to offload Gammy to her and her husband . Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, and eight month old Gammy . Gammy is an eight month old baby who was abandoned in Bangkok by his surrogate parents - the Farnells - when they found out he had Down syndrome. They have always denied abandoning him, insisting they were forced to flee with his healthy twin sister, Pipah, before Thai authorities tightened surrogacy laws. Ms Cross told ABC 'We contacted probably at least a dozen agencies over here (in Thaliand) before we went with this one because this one was - well, it had an American owner, which we thought weâd be safe with, and it said clearly on their website that their doctors had been, some of their doctors had been, trained through Sydney IVF.' The Cross's were clients of Thailand Surrogacy for two years when they received an email from the company asking if they wanted Gammy, according to the ABC's 7.30 program. 'The email asked us if we wanted the baby ourselves. My assumption of why I was asked or why we were asked is because of the fact that we had been through this clinic for two years and without a successful pregnancy and maybe they thought this was an easy option for us to take this child instead of continuing on our path to have our own biological child. 'Thatâs just my opinion' she said, 'but of course we canât accept someone else's child. 'We did see it as a genuine offer to have the baby. We were mortified, could not believe that someone would go through a process like this and give birth to a beautiful baby boy, regardless of if he had Down syndrome or not â he is their flesh and blood.' The Cross couple are now proud parents of four week old Braxton, born via a Thai surrogate and egg donor. Kim Cross says she was 'mortified' by the way the Farnell family had treated  the baby . An employee of Surrogacy Thailand says David Farnell (right) wanted to abandon Gammy 'outside a temple' The Cross couple said the offer was one of several proposals from American Antonio Frattaroli, the boss of Surrogacy Thailand, who has gone to ground since the story went global. The ABC reported that Mr Frattaroli denies any knowledge of Gammy being offered to another Australian couple and he is shocked by the suggestion. The ABC also spoke with a colleague of Mr Frattaroli, who said that the baby's biological father Mr Farnell had asked for the baby to be bleft outside a Thai temple. 'He did not want the baby. He just wanted to do anything so that he would not have that baby,' she said. Mr Farnell has previously denied that he wanted the child aborted. The surrogacy worker alleges he asked: 'There is a normal one, can I take the normal one? 'Can you leave the abnormal one at the temple? Can you leave him in Bangkok? Nobody will know about this' She says the company denied his proposal, and reportedly showed an email to ABC which showed Mr Frattaroli said: . 'They beg me to drop baby Gammy at the temple at night and run away. They told me, 'don't worry, Antonio, the monk will take care of the baby.'

"By . Rob Waugh . Richard Clarke warned of a 'spectacular' Al Qaeda attack in the run-up to 9/11. The security chief claims that every major company in the U.S. has been penetrated by Chinsese hackers . The former U.S government security chief whose warnings of a 'spectacular' Al Qaeda attack were ignored by the White House in the run up to 9/11 has delivered another stark warning. Richard Clarke claims that every major company in the U.S. has already been penetrated by Chinese hackers looking to steal military and financial secrets. 'Iâm about to say something that people think is an exaggeration, but I think the evidence is pretty strong. Every major company in the United States has already been penetrated by China,' Clarke said in an interview in Smithsonian magazine. Clarke claims that Chinese-made computing equipment used by the U.S. could be 'contaminated' with 'logic bombs' and 'trojan horses' which could allow Chinese hackers a 'back door' into the American war machine. Clarke - now head of a cybersecurity company Good Harbor - also claims that Chinese hackers are waging a piecemeal 'economic war' against America by passing secrets to Chinese company. Thereâs a big difference between the kind of cyberespionage the United States government does and China,' says Clarke. 'The U.S. government doesnât hack its way into a Chinese computer company like Huawei and provide the secrets of Huawei technology to their American competitor Cisco. We donât do that.' Clarke believes that Chinese companies used information from Boeing and Microsoft - and that the nation is at risk from an economic war of attrition. 'My greatest fear,' Clarke says, 'is that, rather than having a cyber-Pearl Harbor event, we will instead have this death of a thousand cuts. Where we lose our competitiveness by having all of our research and development stolen by the Chinese. And we never really see the single event that makes us do something about it. 'That itâs always just below our pain threshold. That company after company in the United States spends millions, hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars on R&D and that information goes free to China....After a while you canât compete.' The move comes in the wake of several . high-profile cyber attacks originating in China which targeted U.S and . other government officials. The Chinese government has always denied that it is involved in cyber crime, claiming that it is a victim . Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates: Several high-profile hacks against American companies have been alleged to have state backing . China is widely suspected of being . the origin of many hacking attacks on government and commercial websites . abroad, but officials have repeatedly dismissed reports that the . government or military could be behind such attacks. Last year, hackers based in Jinan, China targeted personal Gmail and Yahoo accounts of government officials. The methods used suggested insider knowledge about the offiicals according to many observers. The Chinese government denied any involvement. 'Blaming these misdeeds on China is unacceptable,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei after the attacks. 'Hacking . is an international problem and China is also a victim.

But they continue to sing as one and pay him no attention.Â The guitar-playing student dogs the preacher's footsteps as the man tries to speak to the growing crowd. Every time the man speaks, the group raise their volume, so that his voice cannot be heard. They keep chanting the refrain 'Oh how he loves us' louder and louder.

A police officer looks on as more students gather to film the scene on their mobile phones. The video currently has more than 30,000 shares on YouTube and the website's users are engaging in an intenseÂ theologicalÂ debate over the actions of the students. Some users hit out at the students' action, saying that although they disagreed with homophobia, they also believed in the freedom of speech. Piers Echols-Jones posted: 'On the one hand, I'm not down with the homophobia. On the other hand, it's the tyranny of the majority to shut up a person by drowning them out.' UserÂ Daniel Yang said: 'The preacher claims to be spreading the Gospel but all he does is spew hate and doctrine that is opposite of Christianity. 'At least the students didn't argue back and start up a messy fuss but instead returned in music and worship.' Another YouTube user, John Howard said: 'A group of people (obviously united in love) are protecting another group of people plagued by judgement and hatred. This is a beautiful scene.' In another video on YouTube, published on the same day, a woman is heard in the background, saying: âI do listen to Jesus Christ. I was going to Catholic school for most of my life.â But the preacher replies with: âYouâre growing up in a screwy religion, you've been raised in a screwy religion.'","Students from John Madison University in Virginia play guitar and sing .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Tammy Devine, 39, received a letter accusing her of being involved in the accident despite the fact that she only stopped to help victim with a broken arm . A good Samaritan who stopped to help a pedestrian who was nearly killed during a car crash has been told she must pay to clean up after the accident. Tammy Devine, 36, was driving through Hathershaw, in Oldham, last month when she saw  the crash and stopped to help. Miss Devine, a mother-of-two, then stayed with the victim, who suffered a broken arm, until emergency services arrived. However last week she received a letter from Oldham Council accusing her of being involved  and ordering her to pay for cleaning up. Miss Devine said: 'It was absolutely horrible when I opened the letter. I thought to myself, I have not been involved in a crash, what's going on? 'When I called the council to see what had happened and they mentioned Ashton Road I was shocked because I stopped to help someone. 'I said to police when I called them that I'm worried about helping anyone ever again if it means I'll get a fine.' CCTV footage taken at the scene of the accident shows the moment the victim narrowly avoids being killed as an out-of-control car jumps the curb before hitting a lamppost just in front of her. In the letter, Oldham Council said Miss Devine'sÂ Vauxhall Corsa had been involved in the collision, when in fact the crash had been between aÂ blue Audi and a black Mercedes. Scroll down for video .

"By . Associated Press . Chinese hackers broke into the computer networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management earlier this year with the intention of accessing the files of tens of thousands of federal employees who had applied for top-secret security clearances, according to The New York Times. Senior U.S. officials say the hackers gained access to some of the agency's databases in March before the threat was detected and blocked, the Times reported in an article posted on its website Wednesday night. How far the hackers penetrated the agency's systems was not yet clear, the newspaper said. Chinese hackers broke into the computer networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management earlier this year with the intention of accessing the files of tens of thousands of federal employees who had applied for top-secret security clearances . Accusations of hacking by China and counterclaims of such activity by the U.S. government have strained U.S.-Chinese relations. Chinese hacking has been a major theme of U.S.-China discussions this week in Beijing, though both sides have publicly steered clear of the controversy. In May, the Justice Department filed a 31-count indictment against five Chinese military officials operating under hacker aliases and accused them of penetrating computer networks of a half-dozen steel companies and makers of solar and nuclear technology to gain a competitive advantage. The Chinese government denied the allegations and suspended a working group on cyber rules that was to be part of the annual 'Strategic and Economic Dialogue' this week. The Office of Personnel Management houses personal information for all federal employees. Obama administration spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the administration had no reason to believe that personally identifiable information for employees had been compromised . Those applying for security clearances would be expected to provide such information as foreign contacts, previous jobs, past drug use and other personal details, the newspaper reported. The Times quoted an unidentified senior U.S. official as saying that the attack had been traced to China but that it wasn't clear whether the hackers were part of the government. A Homeland Security Department official confirmed to the Times that an attack occurred but said no loss of personally identifiable information had been identified. The Office of Personnel Management oversees a system by which federal employees applying for security clearances enter financial data and other personal information, the Times said, and those who maintain such clearances are required to update their information through that system. Chinese hacking has been a major theme of U.S.-China discussions this week in Beijing, though both sides have publicly steered clear of the controversy . Agencies and contractors use the information to investigate employees. The attack in March was not announced even though the Obama administration has urged U.S. companies to share information about breaches in security with the government and with consumers, the newspaper reported. 'The administration has never advocated that all intrusions be made public,' Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the Obama administration, said in a statement to the Times. 'We have advocated that businesses that have suffered an intrusion notify customers if the intruder had access to consumers' personal information. We have also advocated that companies and agencies voluntarily share information about intrusions.' Hayden said the administration had no reason to believe that personally identifiable information for employees had been compromised.","How far the hackers penetrated the system is unknown .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . The most memorable moments of Joanne Choo's life have all featured 11 secret herbs and spices. The 29-year-old doctor from the Hills District in Sydney's north-west, has acquired approximately 20 unique KFC buckets since she began her collection 11 years ago. The mother-to-be is so in love with her prized possessions that they even featured at her wedding in 2012, at her engagement party and photo shoot and at her recent baby shower. Joanne Choo has been collecting KFC buckets for 11 years and even had them feature at her wedding . Mrs Choo told Daily Mail Australia that she began collecting the buckets while still at university, simply because 'it just sounded like a good idea at the time', but the habit soon became the means by which she got to know her husband Jonathon. 'We already attended the same church and lead the same youth group where we took people out for KFC and watched cricket together â which has aligned itself with KFC - so it just became part of our story,' she said. Due to the strong presence of KFC throughout their dating life, including the fast food and her growing bucket collection in their wedding photographs was 'a no brainer', Mrs Choo said. 'On the wedding day, the lunch between the day ceremony and the night reception had to be a quick one, so we thought ""of course, KFC!"" The 29-year-old and her husband Jonathon, also had the buckets feature in their engagement photographs . Mrs Choo, who is currently 36 weeks pregnant, said she chose to cater with KFC at her baby shower . 'I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant and on my first week of maternity leave, so at our baby shower we chose to cater with KFC, but also at my farewell party at work â because my colleagues know about my love for KFC - we had KFC then as well.' All of Mrs Choo's 42 buckets have been acquired by either Mrs Choo or her friends who, after purchasing family feasts, quickly transfer the food to another plate before using the KFC wipes to clean the waxed paper. Her favourite is the limited edition KFC fan bucket, which features the faces of 200 fans, including Mrs Chooo herself. 'There's just something special about them releasing different buckets over the years,' Mrs Choo said. Mrs Choo has a total of 42 buckets in her collection which feature approximately 22 different designs . Her favourite is the limited edition KFC fan bucket, which features the faces of 200 fans, including her own . 'They have got some very unique ones â I've got the more regular 'finger licking' ones, the James Mcgraw one which was pink, the gold and green one from when The Ashes were on, one which has Pictionary games on the bucket and another fan bucket one associated with cricket,' she said. However with the arrival of her baby, Mrs Choo revealed she will unfortunately be forced to cull some of her collection. 'My husband has been very good in letting me have a space in the guest room but that's becoming the baby's nursery so I'll probably have to cull the doubles and only keep a unique set,' she said. 'I have no doubt that it will continue', Mrs Choo said of her collection, 'as long as they keep making new bucket varieties.' 'But we do only eat KFCÂ on special occasions, it's a special treat for us, not part of our regular weekly diet.' The Sydney based doctor ensured she and her husband only eat KFC on special occasions .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A group who violently beat two gay men in Philadelphia's city center last week might have finally been tracked down thanks to internet sleuths determined to bring them to justice. After police officers shared surveillance footage on Monday showing a group of clean-cut men and women believed to be behind the attack, Twitter users got to work tracking them down. The sleuths, including former Real Housewives of New Jersey castmate Greg Bennett and an anonymous New Jersey man, eventually IDed the group using Facebook and Twitter and called the cops, Gawker reported. The attack unfolded after the two victims, aged 26 and 28, were walking in Center City on September 11 and were approached by the group, who asked if they were boyfriends, police said. Scroll down for video . Who are they? Philadelphia cops released this screengrab from surveillance footage showing a group of men and women in their 20s after they allegedly beat two gay men in Center City last week . Night out: The group allegedly approached the men and asked if they were boyfriends before beating them . '""âWhat is this your f'ing boyfriend?""' one of the victims recounted to CBS. 'And I said ""yes this is my f'ing boyfriend""... Three guys just started pummeling me and knocked me to the ground.' The group then allegedly made 'disparaging remarks' about gay people before launching a violent attack on the two men - kicking them in the head, chest and face. One of the victims was only released from hospital on Monday and will need his jaw wired shut for eight weeks. The other suffered bone fractures and cuts to his face. The group also allegedly stole one of their bags. On Monday - with no arrests made - police released surveillance footage of the suspects and offered a $10,000 reward for any information. Crackdown: Greg Bennett, a former Real Housewives of New Jersey star, later tweeted this composite image showing the surveillance footage and an image (bottom right) of the group apparently out earlier that night . Close up: The image, which he got from 'a friend of a friend of a friend', shows some of the group wearing similar clothing to that in the footage. After sharing the image, other Twitter users IDed the restaurant . After seeing the footage, Former Real Housewives of New Jersey castmate Greg Bennett tweeted an image apparently showing the group enjoying a night out at a restaurant before the attack. The image shows the large group grinning for the camera, with some clothes appearing similar to those worn by the suspects in the surveillance footage. Bennett explained that he had been given the photo from 'a friend of a friend of a friend', but did not know where it had been taken. Then 'FanSince09', another Twitter user living in South Jersey, retweeted the photo - and his followers immediately started pointing out that the stone walls and chandeliers looked as if they were from La Voila, a restaurant on 16th Street. Sleuth: Another Twitter user, FanSince09, said he had checked the restaurant's Facebook page (La Voila) and noticed some had 'checked in'. He then matched up the group photo with their profile pictures, he said . Thankful: Police Officer Joe Murray thanked the sleuths and said their work was priceless . Ongoing search: Murray added on his Twitter account that the investigation was still underway . Speaking to Phillymag, the restaurant confirmed that they had had a large group on the night of the attack - but that they had thrown away that night's reservation sheet, so could not identify them. Good work: Gregg Bennett, a Real Housewives of NJ cast member, helped with the online sleuthing . FanSince09 then took over the sleuthing by going to the restaurant's Facebook page and seeing who had 'checked in' on their Facebook profiles while there. He tweeted that he had found people who checked in on the night of the attack and managed to match up people in the photos with their profile pictures. He added that some of their Facebook pages were 'filled with gay slurs'. The unidentified sleuth then called police - who thanked him in a series of their own tweets. 'This is what makes my job easy,' Philly police officer Joe Murray tweeted. 'Sure, it's up to me to make the arrest but we are all in this together. 'This is how Twitter is supposed to work for cops. I will take a couple thousand Twitter detectives over any one real detective any day.' But he pointed out that no arrests have yet been made and that detectives continue to investigate. ABC6 reported that some of the suspects had retained lawyers, who were calling the police to make arrangements, perhaps to surrender. There had been a $10,000 reward for catching the thugs, and if the sleuth, FanSince09, gets it, he will give half of it to LGBT charities, he tweeted.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . The leader of a panel which was investigating brain tumour patient Ashya King's care has resigned - claiming his inquiry was being unfairly blocked. Alistair Thompson said officers at Portsmouth City Council had been barred from taking part in his review, which is examining whether the council acted correctly when it won a High Court order to take the five-year-old away from his parents. Ashya is now receiving the proton beam therapy which his parents wanted in Prague, three weeks after they sparked an international manhunt by fleeing with him on a cross-channel ferry. Care: Ashya King (pictured in Prague) is now receiving proton beam therapy in the Czech capital. Now the leader of an internal probe into how Portsmouth City Council treated the five-year-old has resigned in protest . Pale but alert: Ashya King after the first proton beam treatment on his brain tumor two days ago . Mr Thompson, a Conservative councillor in their home city of Portsmouth, Hampshire, was appointed to head the review after the authority became embroiled in the row last month. The council obtained a legal order from the High Court making it the boyâs legal guardian after his parents took him from Southampton General Hospital to Spain. But the order was subsequently lifted and wardship was returned to Ashyaâs parents, Brett and Naghemeh King. Councillor Thompson told the Portsmouth News: 'The council officers were not allowed in any shape or form to be involved in the review, . 'That, in my mind, makes my position as the head of scrutiny of the panel void. 'We need to check that we obeyed the rules and applied them correctly.' Upset: Brett King and his wife Naghemeh faced a legal battle after the council obtained a High Court order . Optimistic: Ashya King is moved to the Proton Therapy Centre to start his proton treatment earlier this week . Conservative council leader Donna Jones hit back at the claims, saying she was unaware that the investigation had been anything but appropriate. She said a separate review by the independent Portsmouth Local Safeguarding Children Board (PSCB) should be concluded and should take priority over the internal review. Ashyaâs parents sparked an international police hunt when they removed their five-year-old son from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent. They wanted him to receive proton beam therapy which was not available for him on the NHS and which he is now undergoing in Prague. Looking pale but alert, he had his first session of the long-awaited cancer therapy two days ago after he was flown to the Czech capital by private jet. Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe . The Proton Therapy Centre released a schedule for the first day of Ashya's treatment for a brain tumour, which saw him leave the University Hospital Motol to undergo irradiation. His attending doctor, radiation oncologist Dr Barbora Ondrova, said: 'There is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as Ashya has - and there is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery.'","Tory Alistair Thompson was due to lead review into Portsmouth City Council .

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . A Sudanese-born poet who spent ten days living with a man who wants African migrants barred from Australia says the experience was so horrible he started blocking it out almost from the start. Abraham Nouk and Nick Folkes agreed to live together for the new SBS documentaryÂ Living With the Enemy, a six-part series that puts people with opposite views on a controversial topic in close quarters and films the often fiery results. The provocative method is a way of 'exploring the fault lines of social cohesion in Australia,' SBS says on the show's web site. The third episode, which airs Wednesday night, focuses on immigration and is one of the most explosive and moving episodes in the series. Scroll down for video . Sydney father Nick Folkes (right) and Sudanese refugee Abraham Nouk (left) agreed to live together for 10 days and the explosive results were captured on camera . Nouk fled war-torn Sudan 10 years ago with his mother and eight siblings and settled in Melbourne. He knew two English words when he arrived, but became the Slam Poet Champion of Victoria and recently came third in the national titles. A Sydney father-of-two, Mr Folkes strongly believes that letting people from third-world countries migrate to Australia is 'disastrous'. Mr Nouk said he found filming the SBS show confronting and that he was left feeling 'numb'. 'I figured I might give someone who could be classified as racist to explain themselvesâ¦ but he didn't,' Mr Nouk told Daily Mail Australia. 'He said Africans are a threat and we aren't contributing to Australia. 'There were moments where we could have clashed physically. So shortly into filming I went numb and blocked it out.' The experience was filmed for SBS's new six-part series, Living With The Enemy, which puts people with polar opposite views together . Mr Folkes, who runs his own political party, said while he 'learnt a lot' from living with Mr Nouk the experience did little to change his strong views on immigration. He believes Australia should preference migrants from Europe and not third-world countries in Africa and the Middle East. 'Third world immigration has been disastrous. Letting African immigrants inâ¦ has had no benefit to us,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Folkes bristles at being called a racist, but describes himself as a 'racial realist'. 'There's nothing wrong with diversity, but we need to assimilate people,' he said. Mr Nouk, who came to Australia in 2004 only knowing two English words, said he found the filming confronting and was left feeling 'numb' Mr Folkes, who runs his own political party, said while he 'learnt a lot' from living with Mr Nouk the experience did little to change his views on immigration . 'Some migrants are incompatible. A lot of these people coming here are ending up on welfareâ¦ There are no benefits to Australian people.' He said Mr Nouk told him there was compassion involved in letting people migrate to Australia from third-world countries, but the outspoken Sydneysider said 'if we do that we're going to end up bankrupt'. 'My attack is on government policy. Abraham saw it as an attack on him. It was difficult for me and him. We clashed and it was basically one big argument,' he said. 'Abraham didn't change my attitude towards refugees from the third world. My convictions were strengthened and reinforced. These countries have their own problems and it's not up to us to solve them.' Mr Folkes believes Australia should preference migrants from Europe and not third-world countries in Africa like Sudan, where Mr Nouk was born . Mr Nouk said he didn't learn anything from living with Mr Folkes during filming. 'He basically said I don't deserve to be here... and after meeting me he still didnât want to be optimistic about what we as young migrants could do,' he said. 'No one would like to experience the numbness of your own emotions but that's what happened. '(Nick) says that a certain community doesn't belong here but then he says he's not racist. I just can't even begin to debate that.'

"By . Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . A drug addict who killed three people when he sped through a red light has been jailed for 16 years, prompting victims' families to call for harsher sentences for ice-fuelled crimes. Nei Lima Da Costa was travelling at about 120km/h when he struck Anthony Parsons as he crossed a Melbourne intersection, before smashing into a car and killing couple Savvas and Ismini Menelaou. Tests found ice in the 30-year-old's system and witnesses described seeing a 'white blur' as he weaved through traffic and ran red lights moments before the January crash. Ice addictÂ Nei Lima Da CostaÂ has been jailed for 16 years for reckless driver after he killed three people . Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said he struggled to comprehend a more serious example of deadly driving, as he jailed Lima Da Costa for 16 years, with a minimum 11-year term. The Menelaous' son, Jim Menelaou, said the punishment did not fit the crime. 'Sixteen to serve and 11 minimum, to us it doesn't make sense how those numbers are put on people's lives,' he said outside court on Wednesday. 'We've lost our parents, our dearly loved ones. No sentence will ever change anything or bring them back, but what we want from the government is to create change. 'A lot of red tape prohibits the courts from setting examples or setting a serious sentence.' Justice Lasry said Lima Da Costa's crime had not been caused by a momentary lapse of concentration, but was a reckless joy-ride that was bound to end in tragedy. 'This catastrophe occurred after 14 kilometres of horrendously fast and reckless driving on your part,' he said. Nei Lima Da Costa was loaded into a prison van at the Supreme Court in Melbourne on Wednesday after being sentenced to at least 11 years in prison . The three people were killed when Lima Da Costa ran a red light at approximately 120 km/h in Melbourne in January . 'It is difficult to contemplate driving offences more serious than yours.' He condemned Lima Da Costa's use of ice, saying it played a part in his crime. 'The drug known as ice and its effects now represent a significant social problem,' Justice Lasry said. 'It must be confronted by the community with an effective social strategy.' The traffic light at the intersection in Oakleigh in Melbourne south-eastern suburbs had been red for 17 seconds before Lima Da Costa sped through it at 40km/h above the speed limit, the court heard. Savvas Menelaou (left) and his wife Inima Menelaou (right) were killed in the accident, while their son who was also in the vehicle was seriously injured . The Menelaous' son Jim Menelaou said Lima Da Costa's punishment was inadequate . His car threw Mr Parsons 52 metres, and the force of the collision broke every bone in his body and severed his arm. Mr Parsons' wife, Sue Parsons, was metres behind him when he was hit as they walked home after celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary. 'She endured the horrific experience of seeing her husband's life swept away before her very eyes,' Justice Lasry said. Lima Da Costa, a Brazilian national, pleaded guilty to seven charges including culpable driving causing death, negligently causing serious injury and reckless conduct endangering life. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said he struggled to comprehend a more serious example of deadly driving .","Nei Lima Da Costa, 30, was high on ice when he ran a red light at 120km/h .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Fiona Nalty is accused of murdering Michael Hunt after allegedly kicking and punching the man to death when he chatted her up . A woman kicked and punched a man to death after he tried to chat her up, a court has heard. Fiona Nalty and her boyfriend Arry Green beat Michael Hunt within an inch of his life and dumped his naked body in a skip following a row in a cab office, it was alleged. After being discovered barely breathing and lying on top of rubbish in a skip in Norwood, south London, the 37-year-old died in hospital. Nalty, 24, from Coulsdon, Surrey, and her 21-year-old boyfriend from Norwood both deny murder. The Old Bailey heard the victim had been drinking with Nalty and Green in the Portmanor pub on March 13. In the early hours of March 14, the three were in a shop on South Norwood High Street where Hunt, originally from County Waterford in Ireland, appeared to be 'chatting up' the woman. Next they were spotted in Courier Cars - a minicab office - where a row broke out after a driver said they were too drunk to be taken home. 'Mr Hunt was not aggressive, he tried to calm Mr Green and Miss Nalty down,' said David Jeremy, prosecuting. âHe told them they would not get a cab if they behaved like that. The three of them then left the office.' âAfter they had left, the cab controller Mr Bill Peters looked out into the street and saw Miss Nalty punching Mr Hunt to the face more than once and push him around. 'He was not retaliating. The group them left the area. Mr Peters could still hear Miss Nalty shouting and swearing as they went.â Michael Hunt was found in a skip having had his clothes taken from his body after being punched and kicked in the head. The 37-year-old died in hospital after suffering a massive heart attack . When the 37-year-old started grappling with the woman, her boyfriend joined in the attack, it was alleged. A 15-year-old boy who was with the group at the time said Nalty then began kicking Mr Hunt in the head. âThey had ended up in the alleyway where the boy had seen Fiona Nalty kicking Mr Hunt to the head as a he lay on the floor.' âHe thought he saw Mr Green kicking him as well, but he only had a glimpse of that as it was so nasty he looked away. âMr Hunt did not hit anyone. All he had tried to do was protect himself. âBut every time that he had tried to get up he was kicked again,' Mr Jeremy added. âThe boy said he heard Mr Hunt shouting: âStop, please stop.â âHe could not face what he saw and he had walked away. He remembered Nalty laughing as he did so.â Nalty and her boyfriend deny the murder of Michael Hunt. The trial at the Old Bailey in London continues . When she emerged from the alleyway Nalty allegedly bragged: âWe f****d him up badâ and the boy saw blood on her foot and leg. Mr Hunt was still breathing when his body was found in the skip at around 7am on the morning of March 14 this year, but his skull had been fractured. âMr Hunt was lying on the skip on top of the general debris. He was completely naked save for a bandana around his neck,â Mr Jeremy said. âIt follows that as an act of humiliation the defendants must have removed his clothing as or after they had beaten him into unconsciousness.â He died in hospital of a massive heart attack days later. Police recovered clothes stained with Mr Huntâs blood from the garden of a home in Purley when Green was arrested there. Nalty was found in an address in Brighton and told police: âI didnât do it..â Both deny murder at the Old Bailey. The trial continues.

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . A man who died after falling six storeys from a Darwin apartment balcony is believed to have taken a form of ecstasy before the tragedy. The 20-year-old man was in cardiac arrest when St John Ambulance arrived at the Zest Apartments on Gardiner St on Tuesday night, but he was later pronounced dead at Royal Darwin Hospital, the NT News reported. Witnesses told police the man was acting strangely prior to the fall after taking a pill referred to as a 'Quacka' - described as blue in colour with a logo depicting an image similar to rabbit ears or a pair of scissors. More to come . A man died after falling several storeys from an apartment balcony and landing on another unit's balcony below at ZestÂ Apartments on Gardiner St in Darwin (pictured) The man plummeted from a ninth-storey balcony and landed on a third-storey balcony at about 6.30pm. The man's death comes after a 16-year-old girl died at a rural property on Sunday morning who is believed to have ingested illicit drugs at a party. Superintendent Tony Fuller from the Drug and Organised Crime Division said detectives from the Major Crime Squad and the Drug and Organised Crime Squad have formed a task force and are investigating both cases. 'Police strongly suspect that in both cases the drugs taken were a form of synthetic LSD or MDMA (ecstasy). These drugs are usually manufactured overseas and then sold in a variety of forms such as tablets, powder or tabs.' Supt Fuller said the drugs were not clinically tested on humans and are produced purely for the financial gain of the suppliers. 'It is tragic that the need to again warn people about the dangers of these drugs follows on from the death of two teenagers,' he said. 'We are asking the parents of teenagers to talk to your kids and warn them of the dangers they face if experimenting with these drugs.' Department of Health Chief Health Officer, Dr Steven Skov warned that taking these drugs could cause people to completely lose touch with reality. 'The psychotic reaction these drugs might trigger can result in tragic consequences if the person is unable to control their thoughts and actions,' he said. 'On top of psychosis we've seen other life threatening results from taking synthetic drugs including convulsions, dangerously high blood pressure, extreme aggression and panic attacks.' Dr Skov said people had no way of knowing exactly what they are taking or the strength of the dose. 'These substances are changing all the time so we can't know what all of the possible side effects are,' he said. 'If you know someone has taken drugs, watch them closely and try to keep them safe. Once someone has started losing touch with reality, dangerous consequences can happen quickly.' The man fell from a ninth-storey balcony and landed on a third-storey balcony at apartments on Gardiner St in Darwin (pictured) about 6.30pm on Tuesday .","Second death involving suspected synthetic drugs in just two days in the Northern Territory .

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . It may not be what his successor Joe Hockey wants to hear but former Treasurer Peter Costello thinks tough times might not be far away for the lucky country. He believes that Australiaâs 'luck is beginning to run out'. The nation's longest serving treasurer was speaking at a property forum, where he also told delegates anyone thinking the cost of housing in Australia was expensive, was wrong. Scroll down for video . 'Australia's luck is beginning to run out' says former Treasurer Peter Costello . Mr Costello defended his view that the country's luck is beginning to run out because wages are on the decline Â and consumer pessimism grows. He claimed that while Australia is 'far' from recession, the economy was undergoing big changes, leaving people with a sense of uncertainty about the future. 'For the first time since the 1990s, per capita incomes have stabilised in Australia - they are no longer growing,' Mr Costello added. Consumers were 'anxious' and have 'stopped spending'. 'Young people under 50 who have lived through a period of uninterrupted rising incomes are beginning to experience something that's different.' Consumers were 'anxious' and had 'stopped spending'. Real wages were falling and disposable incomes had 'peaked'. The former Liberal treasurer also pointed out that the household savings ratio was now 10 per cent, compared with the booming 1990s when people were spending all of their wealth. 'People have closed the credit card and opened a bank account,' he said. The former Treasurer, Peter Costello, had some good and bad news for the man who succeeded him in the crucial Coalition and Federal Government role, Joe Hockey . Mr Costello then turned his attention to the future of manufacturing in Australia. He insists there is still hope for the industry but it would no longer be a 'mass employer' of local workers. In comments which will have cheered Joe Hockey, Mr Costello seemed to back his optimism for the future of the property market, who on Tuesday rejected as 'lazy analysis' claims it was in a bubble and risked crashing. Mr Costello suggested Australia's strong population growth would likely continue to support the property market. He also insisted that housing was 'not expensive' in Australia, compared with overseas markets despite the report by the Bank for International Settlements suggesting quite the opposite.Â It found that Australia was in fact second only to Norway as the most expensive market in the world. An un-renovated one bedroom apartment in Kirribilli has gone under the hammer for $1,255,000. Needs a touch-up but this one-bedder in Kirribilli with stunning views fetched $1,255,000 . 'Building a house is comparatively cheap,' Mr Costello argued. 'What is expensive in Australia is land. So we have an increasing demand but we have quite a restrictive supply of land. As a result, prices are high.' A top seller on the Australian property market recently was this $4.5 million four-bedroom home at Burwood in Sydney's inner west . He blamed that on state taxes imposed on the release and transfer of land. 83 per cent of homes listed for option in Sydney on the first weekend of Spring were sold, including a $4.5 million sale at Burwood in the inner west and 80 per cent of those under the hammer were sold in Melbourne.Â Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth also had increased clearance rates . Mr Costello said sooner or later world economies would normalise, with the US winding back its money printing stimulatory measures and interest rates rising again. 'It could still be a good time for property if things revert to normal ... (but) there could be a fair bit of hardship that we have to go through and readjustment,' he said.","Peter Costello think Australia's economic luck is running out .

Mr Patel  believes the tragedy could have been avoided had the road been made safer after another woman, Emma Hansen, was killed at the same intersection seven years ago.

Although the six-year-old pageant star is supposed to be the star of TLC's new show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, her outrageous family are stealing the limelight.

She eyes off loads of discounted food, including what looks . to be multiple packets of sugary donuts, in what she describes as a . 'thrifty' way to shop, even though the entire family are supposed to be on a diet. June explains she shops this way to save money because Honey's pageant . dresses are 'so expensive'. Honey Boo Boo then buys a pet pig, . which she names Glitzy and plans to take to pageants with her. Chubbs shows how she gained the nickname in the new show . Appropriate?

It seems that the sweets are certainly an object of desire in this neck of the woods. The mother tells the camera: 'It [auction items] can be like half off of what you'd normally buy'. She adds: 'Pageants are very, very expensive. It is not a cheap sport by any means. Sometimes he has what I'm looking for, sometimes he don't.'

'If you're looking at my child in a sexual manner, there's not something wrong with me a parent' But it seems there is no end to the mischievous ways of the youngster . judging by these new trailers for her reality show. The little girl and her mother even appeared on CNN this morning as part of the series' extensive promotional run ahead of its debut tomorrow night. June addressed the child pageant industry as a whole, claiming that it never aims to sexualise children, which is a common accusation among critics. 'If you're looking at my child in a sexual manner, there's not something wrong with me a parent,' she said. Publicity: The duo appeared on CNN last week.

A previous 30-second clip showed her . attempting to dance after playing in the pit, wobbling around in front . of the camera in the slushy dirt. Alana is almost incoherent as her speaking manner is so bizarre. According to the network, the six-part series will see the family 'doing what [they] do best: four-wheeling through mud pits and picking up road kill for the family cookout.' Big personality: The attention-seeking break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras, is seen getting up to even more mischief in her new reality show. The endearing youngster is seen in a promotional shoot above . Other family members shown include her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', . 12, Jessica, or 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'. The clan are seen in the earlier trailer squishing their flabby bellies around in one particularly charming scene. One of the girls is seen telling the camera: 'We're not red-necks... we all have our teeth, don't we?'

Beauty pageant Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in . right now!' Describing how . the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.

But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She was seen telling the cameras: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.' June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes . to the stage, she was filmed yelling encouragement and instructing . dance moves.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team has been intimidating rivals with the traditional Maori haka for generations, but this kid just makes it look cute. Filmed prior to the side's four nation's ruby union fixture againstÂ Argentina, the young fan stands close to the television as his country's famous rugby side prepares to perform the tribal challenge. In a crouch-like pose, he rises with the crowd   flailing his arms and thumping his legs before striking his forearms in a convincing display of support for the world's most formidable rugby side. Scroll down for video . The young boys crouches in front of the television before springing into action . Knees bent the toddler poses square on in front of his national rugby team's haka . The flailing arms and leg thumping action is as close to the real thing as this young boy gets . His support may well have just been the impetus the All Blacks need to thump Argentina 29-8 . And while his timing might be slightly out of sync, the eager fan displays all the hallmark moves adopted by the All Blacks during the pre-game performance. Predominantly associated with international rugby matches, the haka has also  found its way into New Zealand's basketball sporting landscape. Two videos   showcasing the  island nation's paralympic basketball team and the New Zealand Tall Blacks at the Invictus Games and the World Cup respectivelyÂ went viral. Opponents of both sides were left bewildered when the basketballers suddenly broke-out into the traditional dance, hitting their wheelchairs and striking their limbs while chanting the Maori cry. In the Tall Blacks match against the US, the dream team was in the middle of their warm up for the big game when the Kiwi side got down to business with the pre-match routine. The psyche-out technique didn't work as well as did for their rugby counterparts, however, and the side was thumped 98-71. Standing half-a-metre back from the television the youngster keeps his eyes firmly fixed on the television . The toddler moves into the next phase of the dance by crossing his forearms together . At the completion of the haka the toddler poses in front of the TV, apparently happy with his performance . The Haka - which dates back to the 1880s - is best described as a traditional Maori dance which is performed in the form of ancestral war cries, choreographed movements, face-pulling and dancing. It is also performed to mark special occasions, as a welcome greeting, or to acknowledge remarkable achievements. Perhaps more than any aspect of Maori culture, this complex dance is an expression of the passion, vigour and identity of the race. But the ferocity of the haka has not always been as intimidating as its current-day version. Rather than tribal posturing it came across as just a bunch of white males dancing badly - which is perhaps best expressed in a video circulating from a match between the All Blacks and the Barbarians in 1973. The strangely choreographed version, featuring the all-white All Blacks squad, has been labelled one of the worst performances of all time. But 30 years on and the haka is a much more fierce display as players stand in the face of their opponents and gesture in a throat-slitting motion at the completion of the routine. It is essentially performed to give players an edge over their opponents before taking the field.","Toddler mimics his heroes in the traditional Maori dance as they prepare to play .

"As terror reigned in Boston in the wake of the deadly marathon bombings, one corner of the city was witness to a happier scene. Marathon runners Robert Watling and Kelli Johnston, both 38, married in a city park less than four hours after completing the race, as ambulances continued to speed to and from the scene of the double explosion at the finish line nearby. The bride and groom, who both wore trainers and their marathon medals as they exchanged vows yesterday, refused to let the devastating bombings prevent their wedding from going ahead. Undeterred: Marathon runners Kelli Johnston and Robert Watling went ahead with their wedding ceremony in Boston just hours after twin explosions brought chaos to the city . Vows: Ms Johnston posted this message on her Facebook page after the ceremony . The bride announced on Facebook that the wedding had gone ahead, adding: 'My heart goes out to all of those killed and hurt here today on [sic] Boston.' Her post also said: 'Robert Allan Watling and I successfully completed the marathon before the bombings and just got married in the park!! Champagne for all!' The devoted runners - who ran a 5K together on their first date - had been planning the ceremony since Mr Watling popped the question after they completed the Chicago Marathon. In keeping with the theme, they decided to marry in picturesque Boston Common after finishing the Boston Marathon. Sporting: The bride teamed her traditional white dress with a pair of trainers, and both wore their marathon medals . Ceremony: Runners Kelli Johnston and Robert Watling exchanged vows in Boston just hours after the bomb blasts went off yesterday afternoon . Bride and groom: The devoted runners went ahead with their ceremony despite the chaotic scenes in the city in the wake of the explosions . Ms Johnston and Mr Watling had both crossed the finish line before the bombs went off 12 seconds apart on Boylston Street at around 2.50pm. The blasts claimed the lives of three people, including eight-year-old Martin Richard, and left 144 injured. Of those injured, 17 remain in a critical condition. Despite the scenes of carnage, the couple opted to go ahead with their low-key ceremony at 6.20pm in the park. They were watched by a small gathering of family members, a report on BuzzFeed said. Defiance: Runners Robert Watling and Kelli Johnston wed in a city park less than four hours after completing the race, which was hit by two deadly bomb blasts seconds apart . Tribute: The bride paid tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings as she announced that the wedding had taken place on Facebook . Ms Johnston said before the race that people thought they were 'crazy' to get married straight after running a marathon. She told Necn.com last week: 'Some people are like ""surely you're going to shower are you?"", others are like ""are you getting married right at the finish line?"" 'And then you have others who say ""you people are crazy"".' Mr Watling had the engagement ring with him as he ran the Chicago Marathon, but waited until a few hours after the race to propose on the advice of friends. 'A few of my friends strongly recommended that I wait until later that evening, as females like to look their best in that moment,' he said last week. The U.S. remains on full alert today following the worst terrorist outrage since the World Trade Centre towers were destroyed by hijacked planes on September 11 2001. President Barack Obama has vowed that those responsible for the devastating scenes in Boston would 'feel the full weight of justice'.

"By . Peter Lloyd . Sorry sisters, but the double-standard reaction to âWomen Eating On The Tubeâ shows exactly how hypocritical â and humourless â feminism can be. After 48 hours of brow-beating and trolling, Britainâs feminist community are hoping that a fun, irreverent, tongue-in-cheek blog about ladies masticating in public will be removed from the internet. The Women Who Eat On Tubes group, which was set-up in 2011 and has more than 21,000 members, has sparked controversy in recent days with opponents claiming it encourages people to âobjectify and humiliate womenâ who are unaware their picture is being taken. The Women Who Eat On Tubes group, which was set-up in 2011 and has more than 21,000 members, has sparked controversy . Film-maker Tony Burke, who set up the Facebook page in 2011, has insisted it was created as a 'human observation' that more women ate on the Tube than men and he had not intended to hurt anybody. A British Transport Police spokesman has since admitted that three people have contacted them about the group, including one woman who had her picture posted online. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Burke, 39, said he is now weighing up whether to shut down the page due to the 'constant barrage of toxic hatred' on social media. 'I'm considering taking the group down,' he said. 'I need to think about it carefully. I don't want to be seen to be backing down but I need to think about my family. âThere are more important things to think about.' And heâs right â there are much bigger fish to fry. One example is TubeCrush: a website . which has encouraged women to objectify men on the London Underground . without their knowledge for more than three years. When it became a global sensation in . 2011, it was lauded as a peak-time pastime by everything from Pinterest . to the Evening Standard, who wrote a gushing feature about it, claiming: . âFlirty females are using their smartphones to capture the dishiest of . the Underground's two million daily commuters, and uploading the . unsuspecting men onto hit website TubeCrush.net. âThe cute commuters are then rated . and commented on by admiring women - with surveys taken as to which Tube . lines have the hottest men (so far, overwhelmingly, the Northern line . is winning).â How creepy. Women Who Eat On Tubes founder says he is considering taking down the Facebook group . Film-maker Tony Burke, who set up the Facebook page Women Who Eat on Tubes in 2011, has insisted it was created as a 'human observation' that more women ate on the Tube than men and he had not intended to hurt anybody . Here we had women taking pictures of . men based on their looks, their muscles and the bulge in their trousers â . with the sole intention of humiliating them. Disturbingly, some of the lads in the . photographs didnât always look old enough to be sixteen, while others â . wearing shorts in the summer - were snapped sitting down as the material . rode up their legs. I couldnât help but wonder: how desperate were these sad women? Given that this all started happening at . a time when a record number of female teachers were sleeping with male . minors (and, of course, frequently avoiding jail) this was hardly . something to encourage. Shortly after the advent of TubeCrush, . another blog called âMen Taking Up Too Much Space On The Trainâ was . launched - and hailed as hilarious. One chauvinistic columnist in Grazia even . celebrated it by saying: âI love it. Now when will there be one about . men taking up too much space in the world?â Writer Peter Lloyd strongly advocates boy power . Soon after, when Game Of Thrones actor Richard Madden used the Bakerloo Line and sat with his legs slightly apart for comfort, one woman publicly demanded he be â and I quote â âcastrated.' Hilariously, when the tables are turned â even in a way that is utterly non-sexual and non-violent â itâs considered misogynistic. How hypocritical. OK, had Tony Burkeâs blog been the first-of-a-kind, I would probably agree that it was violating with a little âv.' I would also wonder whether it stemmed from casual, everyday sexism. But, given that these women started it all, theyâve got no right to complain. Sure, they think theyâre redressing an age-old imbalance of being found attractive by heterosexual men, but objectification is nothing new for both genders. In fact, women frequently objectify men via their wallets. If they are sex objects, then men are success objects. Now, thanks to TubeCrush, theyâre also being leered at by peeping toms in pencil skirts. But, as TubeCrush is about to re-launch with a bigger and âbetterâ site, how can men take action? The answer: turn the tables and play them at their own game. I was once travelling on the Northern Line when a young woman was trying to surreptitiously take a photograph of a man in a suit. Hilariously, her flash went off â at which point he started filming her with plans to put the footage on YouTube - which caused her to scurry off at the next stop in shame. Thatâs because what he did is exactly what the Women Eating blog does â it holds a mirror up to double standards and levels the playing field. It takes away the thrill of it all, which â in womenâs case â is objectifying without being objectified. The same thing happened when a bunch of female law students from Australia recreated the Robin Thicke video for Blurred Lines with men in pants. It was the best way to make their point. But, given that countless feminists have been unable to recognise this, what can we all learn from from this weekâs furore? Mainly, that feminism â for all its gains, for all its back-patting â is still marred by sexist double-standards. On the one hand weâre told that women must be treated equally to men, but when they are â for good and bad - they donât like it. Quite frankly, theyâve got off lightly. Imagine if, like millions of British men, women were routinely denied access to their children in a divorce. Or if schools were failing girls more than any other socialÂ  group. Or if 99 per cent of the war dead were female. Or if women died ten years earlier than men because the NHS didnât dole out equal funding. Guys taking pictures of women on the underground is nothing in comparison. It also isnât sexist or sinister, but simply boy power. Normally, Iâd dread travelling by the tube at rush hour: thereâs always some wretch who stands on my Grenson brogues or a tourist with no sense of spacial awareness. Or, worse, a teenage girl who thinks she deserves to be given a seat by an old man simply because sheâs female. But, now, my journey will take on a whole new level of enjoyment, because â just like women across London â Iâll also board the love train with my camera at the ready.

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . Katie Hopkins could never be accused of holding her tongue in an awkward situation. But the former reality TV contestant hit a new low last summer when she told an obese woman on This Morning  that she wouldn't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy. After a backlash from thousands of angry Brits, the 39-year-old has now ballooned from 8st 8lb to 12st to prove to overweight people across the UK that being chubby is their own fault. Scroll down for video . Katie Hopkins has piled on the pounds over the last three months - she now weights 12st . Lifestyle change: She ate a fatty and sugary foods, including pasta, crisps and chocolate biscuits . Katie embarked on the scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size. She said: 'My project is called To Fat And Back.' 'One in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are fifteen or over are overweight or obese. 'People have always said to me, ""You're lucky, you're skinny,"" and I just don't think these excuses are cutting it any more. Her TV project is called To Fat And Back . 'I saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat. I just thought, we have to put an end to this.' Katie took extreme measures to put on 3st 5lb in just three months. She stopped doing any exercise andÂ stuckÂ to aÂ rigorousÂ meal plan of fatty and sugary foods,Â includingÂ pasta,Â crispsÂ and chocolate biscuits. She told This Morning: 'I was 8st 8lb and now I'm 12st, so I put on 3st 7lb in three months. 'People usually put on something like a stone a year after the birth of a baby and so on, so the way I've done that, in order to become every woman, is by compressing people's lives into just a few weeks. She told This Morning she was 8st 8lb and put on 3st 7lb in three months . Katie won't be enlisting the help of a personal trainer or nutritionist to lose the four stone . Katie's weight gain was obvious when she appeared on the This Morning sofa with Holly and Phil today . 'There are obviously people who have much bigger problems than me putting on a bit of weight, but this journey has shown me what it's like.' It has also succeeded in helping famously anti-fat Katie to even empathise with overweight people now. She said: 'It turns out that the reason I like to stay super strong and very slim is that I suffer from epilepsy. 'So I want to be able to show I'm still as strong as the next person, that just because my arm dislocates 36 times a year because I have fits, I am still fit and able. 'So it's actually a similar reason for being thin to other people's reasons for being fat. What a difference a lot of pies make: Katie's weight gain can certainly been seen compared to a photo from 2009 . A high sugar and fat diet that saw Katie consume 6,500 calories a day is responsible for her weight gain . 'It's about me now saying that I realise my skinny self was my armour. 'So for me so far, halfway through this project the conclusion has been that there are reasons for being overweight, but there are still no excuses. 'But also, I want to say let's recognise that I'm not lucky to be skinny, it's eating too much and no exercise that make you like that.' Katie is now planning on losing the weight for a TV documentary on TLC that will air next year, to prove to overweight people that it is possible. She said: 'I'm sick of being like this - I'm sick of the feeling of my stomach sitting on my legs - it's tiring being this fat, carrying all of this around. Katie has always been very fit and healthy, usually tipping the scales at a slim 8 st 8lb . 'My idea is not to lose weight like one of those celeb people - I'm not going to have a nutritionist, a trainer or access to a posh gym - I'm just going to put my old trainers on and get to it. 'We can all come up with excuses. I'm just trying to say, have you actually got excuses? 'What's so great about this whole project is that there's a whole league of men and women who want to come on this journey to lose the weight with me now. Piling on the weight has been a traumatic experience for Katie, who said the project made her cry for the first time in years . 'Kind of like a ""Lose it with Katie.""' However, the Twitter reaction was far from favourable. One Twitter user wrote: 'I'm praying Katie Hopkins can't lose the weight.' Another said: 'Katie Hopkins just put on 4 stone to show how easy it is to gain/lose weight #ihopesheneverlosesit' One person wrote: 'BREAKING: Katie Hopkins is being insufferable and attention-seeking' And one said: 'God I hope she struggles to lose it.' What a gut: Katie pats her belly as she leaves ITV studios . A lot to prove: The acid-tongue media personality certainly has a lot at stake to prove her theory right .","Katie, 39, weighs 12st after eating 6,500 calories a day for three months .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . More than a year after suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed by police in the aftermath of the deadly attack, his widow moved in with his family in New Jersey. Katherine Russell, 25, has left her parents' house in Rhode Island, where she found refuge immediately after the April 2013 bombing, and traveled 100 miles to North Bergen to be with Tsarnaev's two sisters, Bella and Ailina. The women were found by the news station WCVB last week living in a nondescript blue house in the New Jersey township of 58,000 located about 10 miles west of Manhattan, . Scroll down for video . Widow: Katherine Russell, 25, is pictured on the porch of the North Bergen, New Jersey, home she now shares with the two Tsarnaev sisters . New home: The Tsarnaevs, Russell and her young daughter have settled in this blue house in the town of 58,000 located about 10 miles west of Manhattan . Family ties: Ailina Tsarnaev (left), and her sister Bella (right), have visited their brother Dzhokhar in jail . News camera captured the young mother coming home clad in a loose black frock, with a traditional Muslim headscarf tightly wrapped around her head, and a pair of large sunglasses obscuring her face. Tamerlan's widow refused to answer any questions about her late husband or brother-in-law, 20-year-old Dzhokhar, who is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three people and left 260 others wounded. The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line. Tamerlan was killed in a getaway attempt after a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar, who was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat outside a house in a Boston suburb and is hospitalized, was later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Swept off her feet: Katherine (left) grew up Christian in Rhode Island, but in 2010 she met Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) and converted to Islam before marrying him . Daily routine: Bella Tsarnaev (left) and Katherine (right) are seen chatting in a North Bergen Laundromat . Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor. In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom she met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter. The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center. A few weeks after the bombing, Russellâs attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV. A combination of handout pictures released through the FBI website on April 18, 2013 show Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev (L), suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15 . Extended family: Russell, far left, is seen here with her sister-in-law Bella, center, and her mother-in-law, far right . Wearing traditional Muslim attire, Katherine Russell approaches one of the Russell family's cars as she gets ready for an excursion with her two-year-old daughter Zahara (not pictured) July 6, 2013, in North Kingstown, R.I. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, who is set to go on trial next week for his role in the deadly attack, is pictured with his sister Bella . DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide. Katherine Russell has largely avoided the public eye since the bombing. Her attorney told WCVB this week that while Russell's parents and sisters testified before a grand jury, she was never called to give a statement. Katherineâs new roommates, the Tsarnaev sisters, have had legal problems of their own in recent years. Ailina is expected to go on trial next month on charges of misleading police in a counterfeit money probe, while Bella stands accused of marijuana possession with intent to distribute. Both women have visited their younger brother in jail. Dzhokhar is set to face trial in November.","Katherine Russell, 25, has moved in with Ailina and Bella Tsarnaev who now live in North Bergen .

"By . Deni Kirkova . The eldest siblings in a large family face the best chance of scoring something serious when it comes to online dating. Their confidence, leadership skills and high achievements set them up for great chances of relationship success, compared to middle children who face the worst prospects, say researchers. Only children fall somewhere in the middle, with just less than half walking away from online dating with a partner, according to a new study. The eldest siblings in a large family face the best chance of scoring something serious . Sociologists have debated for decades the impact birth order has on lifestyle, relationships and leadership. And now a comprehensive study of online dating singles brings perspective on how it impacts our ability to find love. Data involving 7.6 million PlentyOfFish users was compiled and analysed . by a team of PhD researchers who looked for trends. They discovered middle children are the least likely to find a relationship, in comparison to their eldest and youngest siblings. Eldest children are increasingly more likely to find love online the bigger the family, reaching 10 per cent more likely if there's four siblings. Meanwhile younger children in a family are consistently less likely to end up in a real relationship than older ones. Eldest siblings are consistently luckier in love online compared to younger brothers or sisters . However, these figures switch slightly when the family expands to five siblings on more. The . eldest in the situation is 4.4 times more likely to find love online, . but the youngest beats them with a 5.5 per cent chance. While eldest kids are more likely to 'looking for someone to marry' on the website, youngest children were found to be most likely to be 'looking for a relationship'. Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox says: 'Birth order personality theories are either in or out of favour in psychology, depending on the latest research. 'You're . not fated to live out your life dominated by the random timing of your . birth. The stereotypes are more based on our role in the family which is . something we are free to change. Middle children are the least likely to find a relationship, while eldest are most likely . 'The first result - that younger siblings find it harder to find love online - is surprising and goes against the evidence we have about birth order. The youngest usually has great social skills and is popular, which would make it easier for them to flirt and find love online. 'It's not surprising the firstborn (oldest) is successful since they're the most likely to assume a leadership position and be high achievers. 'This usually makes them good communicators - a big plus when you're connecting to people through a written profile. 'Only children falling bang in the middle also didn't surprise me. Only children often feel like they're living their lives in a goldfish bowl because they tend to be the focus of their parents lives. 'Some people enjoy the attention, so would embrace the let's show off factor which can make you successful at online dating. Others hate it, so would either avoid going online or do it reluctantly because of the public attention factor.' Researchers highlight that just because middle children don't leave the site in a relationship doesn't mean they haven't found what they're looking for. A spokesperson for PlentyOfFish said: 'Our . best educated guess based on the results of the study, is that middle . children have an increased sense of independence and desire to break . from conformity. 'This may lead them to feel less inclination to be in a relationship and follow a traditional life path.' Adding to their unconventional reputation, middle children were found to be 20 per cent more likely to own a bird as a pet.

But the parents of his impressionable admirers will be less than happy about a confession by singer Paolo Nutini â that he has smoked cannabis every day for the past ten years. The star, who was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, told music magazine Q that the drug helps him to cope with fame and is no worse than alcohol. Scroll down for video . Paolo Nutini says that he has smoked cannabis every day for the past ten years . Nutini, 27, called for a more tolerant attitude to cannabis by authorities across the world before admitting it can cause problems for some users. But his comments were condemned by a leading expert who claimed the starâs views could encourage more youngsters to dabble with the drug. Nutini was asked during the interview for Q if he had smoked pot. He replied: âEvery day since I was about 16. Can the world please get to grips with marijuana? How long can this go on? âDonât get me wrong, you can give it to the wrong person, marijuana can spawn all kinds of things, but no more so than alcohol.â Paolo Nutini performs his Glastonbury Festival warm up show on stage at Bristol Harbourside last night in Bristol . He also defended boy band One Direction after two members reportedly smoked cannabis, adding that raunchy singer Miley Cyrus was a worse influence on youngsters. Nutini said: âThey are men now. Letâs flip it and look at the female global pop stars out there. âSexualisation isnât the problem, itâs a case of class. I saw a photo of Miley Cyrus with her leotard pulled up â is that cool? And One Direction canât have a joint? Theyâre the bad role models? Come on.â But Professor Neil McKeganey of the Centre for Drugs Misuse Research: . âHe (Nutini) has clearly failed to understand the terrible impact drug abuse has had throughout Scotland and particularly in the community from which he comes.

'Sexualisation isn't the problem, it's a case of class. I saw a photo of Miley Cyrus with her leotard pulled up- is that cool?' said the singer . âPaolo is a fantastic musician but when it comes to drugs heâs just another pop star on pot. âItâs grossly irresponsible for him to be effectively advocating for young people to use cannabis. âItâs quite likely that comments from someone who has his celebrity status, who is revered by many young people, could have a hugely negative impact on young people.â Paolo Nutini talked in the new August issue of Q magazine out now . Professor McKeganey added: âWe know cannabis substantially reduces intelligence and it also affects areas of the brain associated with judgment and can lead to an increase in serious mental health problems. âIf he has been taking cannabis for as long as he claims, he may wellÂ  be experiencing some of the psychological effects of its extended use.â Tory MSP John Lamont also condemned the pop star for setting a bad example to young fans. He said: âPaolo has to realise heâs a role model for many and this kind of remark can be extremely damaging.â Police Scotland yesterday warned that there was âno safe way to take drugsâ. A spokesman said: âEveryone needs to be aware of the short and longer-terms dangers. You can never be sure of what you are takingÂ  or what effect it could have on you.â A spokesman for Nutini declined to comment last night.

"By . Jack Crone . Suspect:Â Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued that the attack's emotional impact will prevent their client from getting a fair trial . Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has made a second push to move his trial from the city after arguing that residents have already made up their minds he is guilty. The 21-year-old's lawyers say the emotional impact of the deadly attack means people living in Massachusetts haveÂ 'an overwhelming presumption of guilt' towards their client. In a document handed to the court on Thursday they claim aÂ defence expert who analysed poll results and media coverage found there was little chance of Tsarnaev getting a fair trial in Boston. Against the wishes of the prosecution, defence lawyersÂ are now pushing to move the November trial to Washington, D.C. for the second time, where they say poll results show people are less likely to be prejudiced. If that is not granted, they will ask the court to hold a pretrial hearing on their request. Tsarnaev, 21, is awaiting trial for the horrific attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15 2013. Three days after the bombing, the FBI identified Chechen brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev as suspects and released pictures of the pair. Later that evening, a shoot-out with police left older brother Tamerlan dead, whileÂ Dzhokhar escaped, sparking an unprecedented manhunt acrossÂ Massachusetts. Horrific: Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race on April 15 2013 . He was arrested the following day when a resident in Watertown alerted police after discovering Tsarnaev hiding in a boat in his garden . Prosecutors say he and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, placed two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line in the callous attack. In their original change of venue motion, filed in June, Tsarnaev's lawyers said a survey of potential jurors in Boston, Springfield, Massachusetts, New York City and Washington suggested that the nation's capital would be a more suitable location for the trial. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gun-fight with police several days after the bombing - both he and his brother, Dzhokhar, are suspected of the devastating attack . They said Boston residents were the 'most prejudiced' on a number of critical measures, based on the preliminary findings of a survey conducted in May. Their new filing adds more supporting details. The filing counters prosecutors' argument that the court should first attempt to pick a jury in Boston. The defence says it could be difficult to determine bias by questioning potential jurors, who might be affected by community pressure regardless of their own feelings. They added that the large population of Eastern Massachusetts, cited by the prosecution, does not mean bias is less likely, since over half were at the marathon or knew someone who was.

"By . Ap  Reporter . Adrian Peterson has issued a statement after being charged with child abuse and says he is âsorry about the hurt I have brought to my childâ, hours after the Minnesota Vikings reinstated him to the team. Peterson was charged last weekend after he struck his four-year-old son with a tree branch as a form of discipline earlier this summer. In his statement, Peterson says heâs not perfect, but also says âwithout a doubt I am not a child abuser.â Scroll down for videos . Adrian Peterson has been accused of abusing another of his children, it has been reported. A photo of his four-year-old son (right) shows him suffering a head wound covered by bandages . Peterson says he has met with a psychologist and âI have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen.â Vikings owners Zygi and Mark Wilf said the decision to bring back Peterson for practices and Sundayâs game at New Orleans was made âafter significant thought, discussion and considerationâ. Peterson was deactivated for Sundayâs 30-7 loss to the New England Patriots after he was charged with striking his son with a tree branch this summer. The Wilfs say they want to let the legal process play out before making any more definitive decisions on Petersonâs future with the team. âAs evidenced by our decision to deactivate Adrian from yesterdayâs game, this is clearly a very important issue,â the owners said. âOn Friday, we felt it was in the best interests of the organization to step back, evaluate the situation, and not rush to judgment given the seriousness of this matter. At that time, we made the decision that we felt was best for the Vikings and all parties involved. Brutal: It comes just hours after Peterson spoke out for the first time since his arrest for severely whipping another of his children with a wooden switch. Above, police released these images of the boy's wounds . Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' biggest star, was reinstated by the team after being kicked off the roster on Saturday. He will play next week against the New Orleans Saints . âTo be clear, we take very seriously any matter that involves the welfare of a child. At this time, however, we believe this is a matter of due process and we should allow the legal system to proceed so we can come to the most effective conclusions and then determine the appropriate course of action. 'This is a difficult path to navigate, and our focus is on doing the right thing. Currently we believe we are at a juncture where the most appropriate next step is to allow the judicial process to move forward.â Petersonâs attorney issued a statement on Friday saying his client acknowledged striking his son as a form of discipline similar to what Peterson endured as a young boy growing up in Palestine, Texas. He said Peterson was cooperating with the investigation and did not mean to inflict any harm on his son. Hours later, the Vikings decided not to play Peterson against the Patriots, moving swiftly after a week in which the NFL came under heavy scrutiny for its handling of a domestic violence case involving former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. Decision: Head coach Mike Zimmer listens as Vikings general manger Rick Spielman talked with reporters about the decision to allow Adrian Peterson to return to the team . But unlike a previous case involving former cornerback Chris Cook, the Vikings have decided to allow Peterson to return to the field while the legal process unfolds. In 2011, the Vikings suspended Cook with pay after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and barred him from all team activities while his trial played out. Cook went on to miss 10 games and was eventually acquitted. He never faced discipline from the NFL and played two more seasons with the Vikings before signing with the 49ers. The NFL is looking into Petersonâs case, and if convicted he could face a minimum six-game suspension under the leagueâs new tougher domestic abuse policy that was implemented after commissioner Roger Goodell admitted he botched Riceâs initial punishment.","Peterson releases a statement saying he is: 'sorry about the hurt I have brought to my child'

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Michael Schumacher's devoted wife made a rare public appearance today almost eight months after her husband's skiing accident shocked the world. Corinna Schumacher smiled with spectators at the World Equestrian Games in Caen, France, where she watched the second day of the tournament in her role as an official ambassador. The 45-year-old is an avid rider and was named as a key face of the championship last month, a role she has bravely managed to fit in between lengthy vigils at her husband's bedside. Scroll down for video . Raising a smile: Corinna Schumacher, the F1 ace's wife of 19 years, was hailed as a heroine for her devotion to his recovery. She managed a well-deserved break today at theÂ World Equestrian Games in Caen, France . Supporter: Keen rider Mrs Schumacher (centre) was at the championships as an official ambassador, saying: 'Itâs easy to give support to something touching your heart, and animals have always touched mine' Seven-time F1 world champion Michael came out of a medically-induced coma in June and was moved from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a rehab clinic closer to his Swiss home. In July Mrs Schumacher, who is said to have spent millions turning part of the family mansion into a medical suite so her husband can return home, revealed Michael was gradually recovering. She told the German magazine Neue Post: 'Itâs getting better, slowly certainly, but in any case itâs improving.' The comments offered new hope to the 45-year-old racing driver's millions of fans. The world of motorsport was left stunned when Schumacher hit his head on rocks while skiing in the French Alps on December 29, leaving him paralysed and unconscious for several months. Drama: The championships are held every four years and allow riders a chance to qualify for the Olympics . Patient: Last month Mrs Schumacher (centre) revealed her husband was recovering slowly from his accident . Supportive: Mrs Schumacher is understood to be converting part of the Swiss family home for her husband . The recovery is understood to be slow but the driver has shown promising signs of improvement. Croatian doctors Darko Chudy and Vedran Deletis, who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique, were reportedly approached to see if they could help. It is believed such a microchip would be able to help the F1 ace walk and talk again after his extended period in a coma. Mrs Schumacher has been married to the legendary racing driver for 19 years and they have two teenage children. She was hailed a heroine after her first public appearance since her husband's accident last month. It was also at a riding event, this time a 'reining' tournament at her Western-style ranch in Givrins, Switzerland. She laughed, smiled and handed out chocolates in a much-deserved moment of respite from the F1 driver's side. Michael and Corinna Schumacher married in 1995 and have two teenage children together in Switzerland . Success: Schumacher has won the F1 championships seven times and is a hero in the world of motorsport . Held every four years, the World Equestrian Games began yesterday in Normandy and offers the first chance for riders to qualify for the 2016 Olympics. Among the competitors are the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips, who has returned to the sport following a seven-month break after her daughter Mia was born in January. Announcing her support for the championships, Mrs Schumacher said: 'Itâs easy to give support to something touching your heart, and animals have always touched mine. 'Horses have therefore been part of my life, even if initially mainly for amateur-fun reasons. 'Being a team with your horse is something great to watch and even greater to work on, and so I feel very excited to be an official ambassador of the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games 2014 in Normandy. I really look forward to watching some high-class competitions.'","Corinna Schumacher with spectators at World Equestrian Games in France .

"By . Helen Collis . One in five adolescents has been knocked unconscious while playing sport at school - a figure that has shocked researchers. Brain injuries measured in the research included cases where children had been unconscious for at least five minutes and those who had needed to be hospitalised over night. Most previous studies have only recorded hospital cases of children's brain injuries; the addition of self-reported concussion which did not result in hospital treatment has now raised serious concerns in Canada, where the study was carried out. Risk?: Large-scale Canadian study find s that one in five teenagers has been knocked unconscious during sport at school . In Canada, 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable young people involve a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Brain injuries among adolescents are particularly concerning because their brains are still developing. There . is growing evidence that people who have had one or more concussions . are at greater risk of future concussions, and evidence that multiple . brain injuries can result in lasting cognitive impairment, substance . use, mental health and physical health harms. The large-scale Canadian study found that teenagers who drank alcohol and smoked cannabis, and those who scored lower grades were more likely to suffer. Researchers also found that boys were more susceptible than girls to get knocked out. Sports such as ice hockey and football accounted for more than half the injuries, said Dr Gabriela Ilie, lead author of the study and a post-doctoral fellow at St Michael's Hospital, in Toronto, Ontario. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was one of the first to focus only on adolescents and their self-reported traumatic brain injuries (TBIs).Â  Concussion is the most common form of traumatic brain injury. The data used in the study were from the 2011 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), developed by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. It is one of the longest ongoing school surveys in the world and contains responses from almost 9,000 students from grades seven to 12 in publicly funded schools across Ontario. Teenagers most likely to get knocked out during sport were those who drank alcohol, smoked cannabis or achieved lower school grades . The OSDUHS began as a drug use survey, but is now a broader study of adolescent health and well-being. For the first time in 2011, questions about traumatic brain injury were added to the survey. The survey found that 20 per cent of adolescents in Ontario said they had had a traumatic brain injury in their lifetime. It found that 5.6 per cent of them had had such an injury in the past 12 months. Dr Ilie said this suggests the prevalence of TBIs among young people is much higher than previously known, because many head injuries remain uncounted when they are not being reported to parents, teachers, sports coaches or health care workers. In Canada, 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable youth involve a TBI. This new research found that 46.9 per cent of the TBIs reported by adolescent females occurred during sports (e.g., hockey, skateboarding); the figure was 63.5 per cent for males. Students who reported drinking alcohol 'occasionally/frequently' and those who reported using cannabis 10 or more times over the past 12 months had more than five times and more than three times the odds, respectively, of acquiring a traumatic brain injury in the past 12 months than students who reported abstinence. Killer: In Canada, 50 per cent of all injuries that kill and disable young people involve a traumatic brain injury . The survey also showed that students who reported overall poor grades at school (below 60 per cent) had almost four times the odds of a lifetime acquired brain injury than students who reported grades at or above 90 per cent. 'Traumatic brain injury is preventable,' said Dr Ilie. 'If we know who is more vulnerable, when and how these injuries are occurring, we can talk to students, coaches, and parents about it. 'We can take preventive action and find viable solutions to reduce their occurrence and long-term effects.'","First large-scale study to measure the number of students' self-reported concussions at school, rather than just hospital-reported cases .

"By . Ap  Reporter . Nick Foles threw a tying touchdown pass with 3:25 to go, and then set up Cody Parkey for the winning 36-yard field goal as time expired, lifting Philadelphia to a 30-27 win at Indianapolis on Monday night. Darren Sproles had seven receptions for 152 yards to go along with a touchdown run as the Eagles (2-0) won their first game on the road for the sixth consecutive season. Indianapolis (0-2) have lost consecutive regular-season games for the first time since Andrew Luck and coach Chuck Pagano arrived in 2012.

The Colts led most of the night, including 27-20 late in the game. But Luck's late interception led to Foles' tying six-yard touchdown-pass to Jeremy Maclin, and after another three-and-out by the Colts, Foles drove the Eagles into position for the winning field goal. 'We felt we had some plays (in the first half), we just couldn't make them,' Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. 'But we're going to play 60 minutes and we played 60 minutes.' The Eagles' potent offense started slow, managing just two field goals in the first half and failing to score a touchdown before LeSean McCoy's 1-yard run with 4:32 left in the third quarter. They finished strongly, tying it at 20 when Sproles managed to stay on his feet for a 19-yard run late in the third and again at 27 on a six-yard touchdown-pass to Jeremy Maclin. Luck drove the Colts right back down the field and hooked up with Ahmad Bradshaw for a tie-breaking score, but Indy couldn't close it out and the Eagles took advantage. Darren Sproles of the Philadelphia Eagles (left) runs into the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown . Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts looks to throw a pass while under pressure in the second half . Foles was 21 of 37 for 331 yards with the one score. LeSean McCoy ran 20 times for 79 yards and a touchdown. Indy looked as if it would give Luck a respite from his late-game heroics. The Colts led most of the night, thanks to an unusually strong ground game. But it just wasn't enough. Luck tried to seal the game with a short pass to TY Hilton with 5:08 to go and the Colts driving. But Malcolm Jenkins caught the ball on the run while it looked as if Hilton was grabbed on the play. There was no call. Two plays later, McCoy was stopped for a loss but LaRon Landry was called for a horse-collar tackle. Sproles then took a swing pass for a 51-yard gain to the six, and Foles found Maclin for the tying score. TY Hilton (right) of the Indianapolis Colts evades the tackle of Philadelphia Eagles' Brandon Boykin . The Eagles defense held again and Parkey finally won it. 'They made the plays they had to make. We just didn't play a 60-minute ballgame,' Pagano said. 'Turnovers killed us. Big runs, big plays in the pass game, killed us.' Indy controlled most of the first three quarters. Luck wiped out a 3-0 deficit with a one-yard touchdown-pass to Bradshaw with 5:18 left in the first quarter. And after Parkey missed a 38-yard field goal, Luck set up Adam Vinatieri for a 46-yarder to make it 10-3 early in the second quarter. After Parkey made a 23-yard field goal, Luck passed to Jack Doyle for a one-yard touchdown with 1:13 left in the first half to make it 17-6. When it looked as if the Colts might pull away following Vinatieri's 27-yard field goal midway through the third quarter, the Eagles rallied with the tocuhdowns from McCoy and Sproles. Luck broke the tie with the touchdown pass to Bradshaw, and a late interception gave the Eagles one more chance to tie it. 'I just think we did a better job in the second half,' Kelly said.","Nick Foles threw flying touchdown pass with 3:25 to go to set-up win .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The New England Patriots took full advantage of Adrian Peterson's absence, though he might not have made much of a difference. Six sacks, four interceptions from Matt Cassel and a blocked field goal for a touchdown doomed the Minnesota Vikings Sunday, as the Patriots breezed to a 30-7 win, coach Bill Belichick's 200th. 'I certainly never got into coaching expecting that to ever happen,' Belichick said, 'so it is very gratifying to reach that milestone. But what it really says is I had a lot of really good players.' Julian Edelman catches a touchdown pass from Tom Brady as the New England Patriots thrashed Minnesota . Tom Brady and his team recovered from their loss to the Miami Dolphins in week one of the season . Tom Brady went 15 for 22 for 149 yards, one touchdown and no turnovers, and Cassel's first start against his close friend and former mentor was a dud. Devin McCourty, Darrelle Revis, Logan Ryan and Dominique Easley all picked him off, setting up 17 points for the Patriots and prompting chants from the crowd for rookie Teddy Bridgewater. Cassel finished 19 for 36 for 202 yards. New England defensive end Chandler Jones had two sacks and returned a field goal he blocked for a touchdown right before halftime. This was Brady's 149th win as a starter, pushing him past John Elway into third place on the all-time list behind Brett Favre and Peyton Manning.

'I don't think about those things too much, but I'm glad we won and hopefully we can do better next week,' Brady said. Matt Asiata had only 36 yards on 13 carries in place of Peterson, who was deactivated after being charged with child abuse Friday in Texas. The Patriots let Miami rush for 191 yards last week in a season-opening loss, but they held the Vikings to 54 yards on 19 attempts without Peterson. 'I would've liked to have seen it against him, but at the same time we can't control that. I'm very proud of our team and how we responded,' Patriots defensive tackle Vince Wilfork said. The pass-run ratio last week for the Patriots was 60-20 in a shaky loss at Miami, but they established a much better balance here. Stevan Ridley carried 25 times for 101 yards, and Vikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes wasn't able to keep up with Julian Edelman, who finished six catches for 81 yards and a touchdown. Under Belichick, the sixth coach to reach 200 NFL victories, the Patriots have consistently been able to avoid consecutive losses. The last time the Patriots lost the first two games of the season was 2001, when they went on to win their first of three Super Bowl titles. The Vikings started strong with a 25-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to a wide-open Asiata, followed by the defense forcing a three-and-out. But one bad throw by Brady's former backup shifted the momentum. Cassel's heave to Jarius Wright hung in the air long enough for McCourty to snag it and return it 60 yards to the 1 yard line. Philip Rivers (right) and Russell Wilson (left) shake hands after San Diego beat Seattle in extreme heat . The Denver Broncos moved to 2-0 after beating the Kansas City Chiefs at Mile High . Ridley scored two plays later. Revis had Greg Jennings smothered all game, and the five-time Pro Bowl pick grabbed an errant pass by Cassel early in the second quarter to set up Edelman's score. Then, after the Vikings set up a 48-yard kick by Blair Walsh that would've pulled them within seven points, Jones powered through the line, stretched his arms out and batted down the ball. He picked it up in stride and headed for the end zone, effectively quashing hope for a second-half comeback. Coach Mike Zimmer said Cassel would start next week at New Orleans. 'I take full responsibility for not taking care of the football today,' Cassel said. 'I've got to do a better job, and I will.' That will be tougher without Peterson. 'It's just part of life,' Zimmer said, after dismissing several questions from reporters about Peterson's absence and status. 'Would we have liked to have him? Sure.'

"By . Nick Harris for MailOnline . Just when you thought Manchester United had done spending, they sign Radamel Falcao. The Colombia striker's Â£12million loan deal from Monaco adds to an incredible list of buys, including Â£60m Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo. But after a summer of huge transfers, how can the club still splurge even more? NICK HARRIS explains... There's been lots of talk about how Manchester United can possible afford to spend up to Â£200m in the window. How can they? When the dust settles it wonât be quite as big a figure as that. The fees combined for Angel Di Maria, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Vanja Milinkovic, Daley Blind and the loan fee for Radamel Falcao will total around Â£150m. But a few sales, including Alex Buttner, Bebe, Shinji Kagawa and others, will bring net spend closer to Â£120m. Thatâs still huge, but not as huge as at first glance. New boy: Radamel Falcao (with his wife, Lorelei Taron) has joined Manchester United on a season-long loan . Expensive twelve months: Falcao has left Monaco to join the Red Devils for one year for a fee of Â£12m . Fine, but Â£120m or anywhere close is still a gobsmacking sum. How can they afford that? United are, by far, the biggest earners in English football, and they make big âheadlineâ profits. The latest available full accounts, for 2012-13, showed income of Â£363m and gross profit Â£146m, albeit before debt servicing. For 2013-14, Unitedâs income will have been around Â£430m, with big profits. In 2014-15, they are expected to have total income of Â£500m or more, by which time they should have recaptured their title of the richest club in the world (measured by income) from Real Madrid and Barcelona. How is their income growing so quickly? Of three main revenue streams - match-day income, commercial and broadcasting - the first is stable and the other two are soaring. New deals with Chevrolet and adidas alone will boost Unitedâs income by Â£80m a year. Global commercial deals, with everyone from noodle suppliers to paint manufacturers and mobile firms, are booming. If it can be monetised, United are doing it. And TV cash is growing, for them more than most. The shirt fits: Chevrolet agreed a huge deal to sponsor United's kit, which started this season . Product placement: An advert released last year featuring Javier Hernandez, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs . But arenât big profits just wiped out by the massive debt repayments necessary to service the loans taken out in the Glazer familyâs 2005 âleveragedâ buyout? Only to an extent.

They also need to get back into the Champions League, which plugs them back into another revenue stream, worth Â£50m a year, give or take.

"By . Annabel Grossman for MailOnline . A community reeling from the stabbing of two nine-year-old boys in an apparent murder-suicide has paid tribute to the twin brothers. Sheila Cagney, the principal of the school attended by Thomas and Patrick O'Driscoll, described the boys as 'loving, energetic and full of fun'. The brothers were found dead in their small, detached bungalow on the edge of Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, yesterday in what appears to be an appalling family tragedy. Brothers Thomas and Patrick O'Driscoll were described as 'loving, energetic' boys who were 'full of fun' The brothers were found dead in their small, detached bungalow on the edge of Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, yesterday in what appears to be an appalling family tragedy . The bodies of the twin boys were discovered in separate bedrooms by their younger brothers who are aged three and five. It is thought that they both suffered multiple stab wounds to the upper body . It is thought that the twins were stabbed to death by their 22-year-old brother Jonathan, who fled the scene and was found dead around an hour later about 10 miles from the home in a wooded area next to a river just outside Buttevant. It appears that he took his own life. Thomas and Patrick were in third class in Banogue National School just over the county border in Croom, Limerick, and had been attending the school for just over a year. As the whole community struggles to come to terms with the deaths, staff and pupils at the school are said to be deeply shocked and saddened by the twin boys' deaths. Ms Cagney said: 'This is a terrible tragedy for the family, the school and the whole community. We are deeply saddened by this event. 'Our sympathy and thoughts are with the family and friends at this terrible time.' In a statement, she added that the focus of the staff today and in the coming weeks was on the pupils in the school who are trying to come to terms with the loss of young friends. 'We will help the children to the best of our ability,' she said. It is thought that the twins were stabbed to death by their 22-year-old brother Jonathan, who fled the scene and was found dead around an hour later having apparently taken his own life . As the whole community of Charleville, north Cork, struggles to come to terms with the deaths, staff and pupils at the boy's school are said to be deeply shocked and saddened by the tragedy . Experts from the national education psychological service of the Department of Education have been called in to the school to support staff in dealing with the tragedy. Ms Cagney said the focus of the staff should be on the children and she appealed for privacy. Candles burned on a low wall at the front of the property today as emotional scenes greeted the removal of Tom and Paddy's bodies in separate hearses from the house. Father Naughton offered prayers at the roadside while relatives and friends of the family openly cried and comforted each other. Neighbours  came running after hearing the childrenâs cries for help and saw a car being driving away at speed . It is understood the O'Driscolls were settled members of the travelling community with adopted children and had been living in the Charleville area for many years. Parents Thomas and Ellen OâDriscoll, who have six children, had been on a shopping trip - to the town of KilmallockÂ just six miles away -  when the tragedy happened. Jonathan has been tasked with picking up his younger brothers and taking care of them while his parents were away from the house. The bodies of the twin boys were discovered in separate bedrooms by their younger brothers, aged three and five. It is thought that they both suffered multiple stab wounds to the upper body. Neighbours  came running to the house after hearing the childrenâs cries for help and saw a car being driving away at speed. Local reports suggest police removed two knives from the river near to where Jonathan was found, which are now being examined to establish if they were used as the murder weapons. It is understood the O'Driscolls were settled members of the travelling community with adopted children and had been living in the Charleville area for many years . Bishop of Cloyne William Crean extended his sympathy to the O'Driscoll family and urged people to pray for them. 'I speak for our faith community, and for all people of good will, when I say how shocked and greatly saddened I was to hear of the tragedy that has befallen the O'Driscoll family,' he said. 'Such loss of human life is extremely difficult to comprehend. I pray that the Lord will strengthen the family during this terrible time. 'I ask the priests and people of the diocese to pray for Thomas and Helen, for their surviving children, their extended family, and for the community of Charleville.' Post-mortem examinations are to be carried out on the three family members at Cork University Hospital. Garda detectives are not seeking anyone in connection with his death. Sources close to the investigation said: âThis is the most horrific crime weâve ever had to deal with. It is hard to see what would spark something like this.â There was speculation last night that Jonathan had recently learned that he was adopted, and that he killed his brothers in a fit of rage, but details about the tragedy are still emerging. Sources close to the investigation it is the most horrific crime they have ever had to deal with . The family had been living in a pink and white bungalow in Deerpark, Charleville, County Cork . Health chiefs said specially trained counsellors were working in the town to support families and children affected by the tragedy. 'The Health Service Executive (HSE) wishes to extend its deepest sympathy to the family,' a spokesman said. The HSE is working with suicide charity Console, the specialists from the Department of Education and other agencies to provide support, assistance and counselling, it said. Community health workers with the Travellers of North Cork association were also in the town supporting members of the community, relatives and friends. Counselling and support services are being set up in the area by the group alongside the HSE to help the immediate and extended family and they are expected to remain in place for several days into next week. If the murder-suicide suspicions are confirmed, it will be the second incident of its kind in Ireland in just over six weeks. Two brothers died at their home in rural Sligo in late July. Nine-year-old Brandon Skeffington was found with stab wounds in the family home at Banada, Tourlestrane near Tubbercurry, before the body of his elder brother Shane junior, 21, was found in a shed beside the property.

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Britain will send 1,000 troops to lead a new 4,000-strong Nato 'spearhead' force headquartered in eastern Europe, it was confirmed today. David Cameron said the new multinational brigade based in Poland would âreassureâ eastern European allies that the threat from Russia was being taken seriously. The Prime Minister said the âreformed Nato response forceâ would allow more exercises and âif necessary, rapid reinforcementâ if there was an invasion. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, left, and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (right) today outlined plans for a rapid reaction force to be based in Poland . He accused Russia of âripping up the rule bookâ with its military invasion of parts of eastern Ukraine. Mr Cameron said: âOur great alliance must now evolve and refocus on the new capabilities that we need to keep our people safe. âAs Russia tramples illegally over Ukraine, we must reassure our eastern European members that we will always uphold our article five commitments to collective self-defence.â Mr Cameron told other Nato leaders: âWe must be able to act more swiftly. I hope that today we can agree a multinational spearhead force deployable anywhere in the world in just two to five days.â Government sources said the unit would be able to deploy a âspearhead groupâ within 48 hours to reinforce the Baltic states in the event of a Russian invasion, followed by reinforcements. But Nato officials said it could also be used anywhere else in the world. The new force is aimed at meeting criticism that Nato is too slow and unwieldy and increasingly irrelevant in the modern world. Nato hopes the main components of the new force will be in place by the end of the year. Cameron, speaking at the start of the Friday session alongside Barack Obama and other leaders, said Nato âmust increase [its] capacityâ. The 1,000-strong British contribution is to try to speed up the formation of the rapid-reaction force, which will be staffed on a rotational basis with troops from other Nato countries. Mr Cameron also revealed 3,500 troops would be engaged in exercises in the Baltics and elsewhere in eastern Europe in a show of strength. Nato has a 1997 treaty with Russia that forbids permanent bases in the Baltic states. It is getting round this by holding permanent exercises in a bid to reassure the Baltic governments. David Cameron and Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko spoke at today's NATO Summit in Newport, Wales . Air bases in the Baltics are being modernised and heavy equipment being put in place in readiness. Unlike Ukraine, the Baltic states are members of Nato and any action against them would draw in other member states. The Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: âNato remains ready for the defence of all allies against any threat. We have to ensure we have the right forces and the right equipment in place for as long as required â¦. Nato always rises to every challenge, we stand ready to act together.â","The UK will contribute a quarter of the troops for the rapid reaction unit .

"By . Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail . Fiona Woolf will lead the inquiry into historic child abuse . The Lord Mayor of London, Fiona Woolf, will chair the governmentâs inquiry into historic child sex abuse, it was announced yesterday. Mrs Woolf, 66, is a senior tax lawyer and former president of the Law Society. She will be advised by Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote last weekâs report into child abuse in Rotherham. She takes the place of Baroness Butler-Sloss, who stepped down in July after questions over her brotherâs role as attorney general at the time of some of the events. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has campaigned on the issue, questioned whether Mrs Woolf has the âexperience and knowledgeâ to deal with âvulnerable, poor childrenâ who had been victims of abuse. âI would have preferred someone with at least a whiff of outsider to them,â he told the BBCâs World at One. But he said Mrs Woolf was an âintelligent, capable woman, who I have no doubt will do a good jobâ. The inquiry, announced by Home Secretary Theresa May on July 7, will examine allegations senior Establishment figures covered up child sex abuse. And it will look at why the police and other authorities did not properly investigate celebrity sex attackers such as Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith.

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Outrage has erupted at a popular college after it emerged halal meat is regularly being served to students without them knowing because it is 'cheaper'. Since the summer, Chichester College, in West Sussex, has been dishing up halal chicken and lamb to unsuspecting diners at their main refectory. The move came after a sudden rise in the number of Middle Eastern students at the college, which has been rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted and takes pupils aged between 16 and 19. Scroll down for video . Since the summer, Chichester College, in West Sussex, (pictured) has been dishing up halal chicken and lamb to unsuspecting students at the campus' main refectory because it is cheaper to buy in than the alternative . One outraged diner, who didn't want to be named, said: 'I feel very strongly about food labelling and the consumer should know what they are eating. 'Personally, I'm against halal slaughter because it's not only cruel but it spoils the quality of the meat. 'During the animal's struggle toxins are released, spoiling the meat. 'I feel that it's a personal choice of an individual whether or not they choose to eat halal. 'It's disturbing that food establishments are not informing their customers of the meat they are serving.' Halal meat comes from the traditional Muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut then having their blood drained. Diners have been left outraged after not being told about the use of halal meat which is controversial due to the method used in slaughtering the animal. The college said it 'never had any intention to avoid telling customers' Aramark, the contractors which run the canteen, are under no legal obligation to inform the customers whether the meat is halal or not. A statement from the college said: 'The decision to purchase this is because the aim is always to provide good quality food at as reasonable a price as possible. Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered. 'At the moment, halal meat prices have come down but regular meat prices have risen. 'There has never been any intention to avoid telling customers when meat is halal and customers who have asked have been informed of this.' It comes amid an ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers. Supermarkets and restaurant chains face being forced to label food containing the meat after it was revealed how millions of customers are being left in the dark about what they are eating. Leading supermarkets, popular restaurant chains and dozens of academic premises have been switching to halal meat because it is more cost-effective but, it has been revealed, have not been informing customers. At least ten top higher education establishments - including Oxford University and the University of Manchester - have been secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals. In Manchester, 85 per cent of all meat served is unlabelled halal meal, while all the chicken served at Sheffield and Exeter - which is halal - is not marked as so. Cardiff and Lincoln were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat, without telling consumers. Christchurch College, Oxford University, was among the top universities which admitted to serving halal meat . The findings were unearthed through a Freedom of Information request which was sent to 126 establishments. However, just 25 responded - meaning the problem could be more widespread than currently thought. In May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg demanded better labelling using a designated 'halal' logo. He said that while he personally had 'no problem' eating halal meat, produce should be clearly labelled because 'consumers want to know more about how the food arrived on their plate.'","Chichester College has been serving halal to students without telling them .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Many people are too frightened to undergo laser eye surgery because of the risks but a new technique could mean that treatment is almost risk-free . A simple 90-second treatment that eliminates almost all risks associated with laser eye surgery has become available in the UK. Many people are put off undergoing laser eye surgery because of the risks, but a simple procedure combining eye drops and UV light can make the procedure far less risky. The new treatment, called Lasik Xtra, almost entirely negates risk of the . three most common complications linked to this procedure: corneal . ectasia, regression of sight and epithelial ingrowth. The procedure has been pioneered at the London Eye Hospital and consultant ophthalmic surgeon Bobby Qureshi, the first to perform the procedure in the country, believes it will be widely available across the country in a matter of years as it is 'simply the safest . laser eye surgery available today'. He said: [This treatment] is the greatest advance in laser eye surgery in the last 20 years to reduce risk; everybody should be having this instead of standard laser treatment. 'The procedure ensures that the risk of developing serious complications from laser treatment is virtually reduced to zero.' According to the manufacturers, no one who has undergone the procedure has suffered any of the three most serious complications. Laser eye surgery works by removing tissue from the cornea to change its shape. There are different types of laser eye surgery but LASIK - which stands for Laser-Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis - is the most common. The procedure involves applying anaesthetic drops, after which a small flap is made on the surface of the cornea using a hand-held femtosecond laser deviceâ. LasikXtra almost entirely eliminates the risk of infection and the three most common complications linked to laser eye surgery. Opthalmic surgeon Bobby Qureshi said it is 'the biggest thing in laser eye surgery in the last 20 years' After this, a laser is used to remove a minute amount of corneal tissue, thereby reshaping it before the flap is replaced. The procedure takes around 10 minutes per eye. With standard LASIK eye treatment, patients are at risk of infection, corneal ectasia (in which the lasered, weakened cornea gives way to pressure, causing bulging) and epithelial ingrowth (where the cells from the surface layer of the eye begin to grow underneath the corneal flap). Corneal Ectasia . A serious complication that often requires a corneal transplant. Risk before: Between one in 150 to one in 500 . Risk after new technique: Almost none . Regression . When the previous prescription returns several years after laser eye surgery. Risk before: Between one in three and one in 20 . Risk after new technique: Negligible . Epithilial Growth . This occurs when cells from the surface layer of the eye begin to grow underneath the corneal flap. Risk before: One in 50 to one in 100 . Risk after new technique: Virtually eliminated . There is also the possibility of regression, where the short or long-sightedness returns within a few months of several years later. This results in the patient having to resort to wearing glasses or returning for further treatment. But with LASIK Xtra - which can be used with all laser eye treatments, despite its name -Â  the risks are dramatically reduced. The treatment works by cross-linking the fibres within the cornea, making them thicker and substantially more resilient. Eye drops containing a modified version of riboflavin - Vitamin B2 -Â  are applied after laser treatment, which are then âactivatedâ by UV light. Without this treatment, patients are at a higher risk of complications and could need future treatment to cope with corneal weakness. Mr Qureshi said: 'Every person having laser eye surgery treatment should undergo LASIK Xtra.' The procedure is already widely used around the world and has been used on 50,000 patients in Japan alone. It has however only just become available in the UK a it was only recently approved for EU use. The new treatment is being offered as standard for all laser eye surgery at the London Eye Hospital, including LASIK and LASEK, to correct short sight, long-sight and astigmatism.","Many people are reluctant to undergo laser eye surgery because of the associated risks such as sight loss or regression (prescription returning)

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . Thousands of lives could be saved every year if all British smokers switched from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, experts have said. Researchers from University College London (UCL) estimated that for every million smokers who switch from tobacco to electronic cigarettes, more than 6,000 premature deaths would be prevented each year in the UK. There are currently around nine million British smokers. If they all switched to nicotine vapour inhalers, ditching their traditional tobacco products, the scientists predict around 54,000 lives could be saved. Scroll down for videos . Researchers from University College London (UCL) estimated if the nine million British smokers all switched to e-cigarettes instead of traditional tobacco, around 54,000 lives could be saved . The study claims that the reduced risk of death takes into account the possibility that e-cigarettes may carry an increased risk of death. But the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation today made an urgent call for more research into the effects of e-cigarettes in the face of countless conflicting views. Dr Penny Woods, told MailOnline: 'We are constantly hearing conflicting views around e-cigarettes and we can appreciate that the public are confused about whether the use of e-cigarettes is recommended. 'This is why we are urgently calling for more research into the health impact of electronic-cigarettes and whether they effectively help smokers quit their habit.' The latest study comes just days after a piece of research published by a team at the University of South Carolina, warned of higher levels of 'harmful and dangerous toxins' in e-cigarettes compared with traditional products. Their findings concluded that e-cigarette vapour contains the toxic element chromium, as well as four times more nickel than is found in normal cigarettes. The researchers also found the devices contained lead, zinc and other toxic metals, although in lower levels than cigarettes. But in an editorial published in the British Journal of General Practice, Professor Robert West and Dr Jamie Brown from UCLâs Department of Epidemiology and Public Health have argued that even though some toxins are present in the vapour from e-cigarettes the concentrations are âvery lowâ. The editorial said: âThe vapour contains nothing like the concentrations of carcinogens and toxins as cigarette smoke. âIn fact, toxin concentrations are almost all well below 1/20th that of cigarette smoke.â Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, today called for urgent research in the face of countless conflicting studies in to the effects of e-cigarettes. 'We are constantly hearing conflicting views around e-cigarettes and we can appreciate that the public are confused about whether the use of e-cigarettes is recommended,' she said. 'This is why we are urgently calling for more research into the health impact of electronic-cigarettes and whether they effectively help smokers quit their habit. 'Once we have this research we can understand, based on factual evidence, whether e-cigarettes could provide an efficient route to stopping smoking and save thousands of lives. 'Until then, we recommend that people trying to quit smoking first use approved nicotine replacement therapies.' The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a report advising that the use of e-cigarettes should be banned indoors and all advertising stopped until the industry produces âconvincing supporting scientific evidence and obtains regulatory approvalâ. The British Medical Association (BMA) backed this call. Ram Moorth, deputy chair of the British Medical Associationâs board of science, said tight controls are needed so that they aren't aggressively marketed towards young people and so that their sale doesn't normalise the act of smoking. But Professor Ward and Dr Brown moved to dispel the idea. They argued that a rise in the use of e-cigarettes has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of smokers quitting and a continued fall in the numbers of people that smoke. Meanwhile the number of e-cigarette users who took up the habit having never smoked in the past is âextremely smallâ, they added. They wrote: âThere are a number of public health advocates who appear to consider electronic cigarettes primarily as a threat to public health, and bodies such as the British Medical Association and the WHO are warning smokers about their potential dangers. âGiven that smokers smoke primarily for the nicotine but die primarily from the tar, one might imagine that e-cigarettes would be welcomed as a means to prevent much of the death and suffering caused by cigarettes.â A WHO-commisisoned report on e-cigarettes released in 2013, before their recent call for further restrictions on the use, sale and promotion of cigarettes, has also come under attack. The December 2013 report said that e-cigarette use is a major problem among young people and could be acting as a gateway to smoking. It inferred that bystanders can inhale significant levels of toxins and said that the products actually inhibit smoking cessation. Writing in the journal Addiction, experts called the report is âmisleadingâ. Lead author Professor Ann McNeill from the National Addiction Centre at Kingâs College London, said: âWe were surprised by the negativity of the commissioned review, and found it misleading and not an accurate reflection of available evidence. âE-cigarettes are new and we certainly donât yet have all the answers to their long-term health impact, but what we do know is that they are much safer than cigarettes, which kill over six million people a year worldwide.â The researchersÂ argued that rise in use of e-cigarettes has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers of smokers quitting and a continued fall in the numbers of people that smoke . The authors said that the global health body took on the general tone of the recommendations set out in the report - even though concerns had been raised about it by scientists and other public health experts about them. But one of the authors of the latest report, Professor Peter Hajek, from the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London, said: âThe WHO report published last week copies these recommendations almost verbatim. 'I think these type of recommendations are actually detrimental to public health. âThe purpose of these recommendations to restrict the use of e-cigarettes and the reason for doing that is to avoid risk. 'I think any responsible regulator proposing restricting regulation has to balance reducing risks with reducing potential benefits. âIn this case the risks are unlikely, some already proven not to exist, while the benefits are potentially enormous. It really could be a revolutionary intervention in public health if smokers switched from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes. âSo killing benefits, which are huge, for risks which are small is like asking (people) to stop using mobile phones and tablets, or restrict their use and further development, because of a one in ten million chance that the battery might overheat in your device.â","UCL researchers estimated that for every million smokers who switch to e-cigarettes, 6000 premature deaths would be prevented each year in the UK .

"By . Associated Press . Before the defending Super Bowl champions Seahawks took on the Green Bay Packers, another Seattle favorite played. The NFL got veteran grunge band Soundgarden and hit-maker Pharell to join the league's season opener festivities with a free concert at the parking lot of Century Link field. The concert was open to all fans, even if they were not attending Thursday's game. The concert was part a day of festivities in downtown Seattle. Fans started tailgating first thing in the morning and the stadium was full well before kickoff. During the game, Russell Wilson made sure everyone knew Percy Harvin was healthy. Marshawn Lynch bullied his way to another 100-yard rushing performance. And Richard Sherman? He was just bored. Scroll down for video . Are you not entertained? Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette celebrates after his touchdown against the Green Bay Packers in the first half on Thursday . Let's go! Pharrell performed before the big game on Thursday with a free concert . Local favorite: Chris Cornell of Soundgarden also performed at the concert . National anthem: Ariana Grande, wearing a Seahawks jersey, sang The Star-Spangled Banner before the big game . The Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks opened the same way they finished last season, with a blowout victory. 'We'll always find something that we can do better,' Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. 'That's why we're so good.' Lynch ran for 110 yards and two touchdowns, Harvin had 100 combined yards rushing and receiving, and the Seahawks dominated Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers in a 36-16 victory to kick off the regular season Thursday night. The memories of last season were revisited, with the championship banner unveiled celebrating Seattle's first title. But the ceremony was brief, a nod to putting last season behind and beginning the process of trying to become the first team in a decade to repeat. Their effort against the Packers â a popular pick to contend in the NFC â will only reinforce the belief Seattle is still the favorite. Wilson was outstanding in the first half, including a 33-yard touchdown pass to Ricardo Lockette. Harvin got touches as a receiver, running back and returner. He was used all over the field in different formations after never being fully healthy in his first season with Seattle. Struggle: Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett forces Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers to fumble in the second half . Getting ready: Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson drops back to pass against the Green Bay Packers in the first half . In case you forgot: The Seattle Seahawks' Super Bowl banner was unveiled at the Thursday game . Wilson finished 19 of 28 for 191 yards, while Lynch was at his best. Pete Carroll said earlier this week that Lynch appeared in the best shape of his career, and it showed. Lynch averaged 5.5 yards per carry and topped 100 yards for the 20th time in the regular season since joining the Seahawks in 2010. Lynch, who ran for 1,257 yards and 12 touchdowns last season, barreled through a trio of Packers for a TD with 3:41 left before halftime to give the Seahawks a 17-10 lead and added a second scoring run on the first play of the fourth quarter. 'Obviously, we were the more physical team today, offensively and defensively. I saw supposedly some of the best players in the league not want to tackle Marshawn Lynch,' Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett said. 'Of course, nobody is going to say nothing about that, but I seen a lot of guys whiff on tackles that should have been 2-yard gains and they're supposed to be the best.' Seattle had 207 yards rushing as a team and won for the 18th time in its last 20 regular- season home games. Harvin finished with 11 offensive touches, including four rushes for 41 yards. 'If we already peaked this game we're going to be in trouble,' Harvin said. 'I hope we can just take this game and build on it.' Blocked! Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks races past Ha Ha Clinton-Dix . Smooth moves: Marshawn Lynch avoids the grasp of Brad Jones . Throw: Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers passes against the Seattle Seahawks in the first half . Rodgers was 23 of 33 for 189 yards and was isolated to one side of the field. He looked almost exclusively for Jordy Nelson matched up against Byron Maxwell and never threw in Sherman's direction. Nelson finished with nine receptions, but Maxwell came up with a third-quarter interception on a pass that deflected off Nelson's hands. The most action for Sherman came in the first half when he accidently blocked Davon House into Earl Thomas on a punt return causing a fumble recovered by the Packers. But Seattle's defenders did their part. They sacked Rodgers three times, taking advantage of a knee injury suffered by right tackle Bryan Bulaga in the second quarter. His replacement, Derek Sherrod, gave up a fourth-down sack to Cliff Avril to end one drive inside Seattle territory. Following a Seattle punt, Sherrod was beaten by Michael Bennett on Green Bay's next offensive snap. Rodgers was stripped and Sherrod fell on the fumble in the end zone for a safety and a 22-10 lead. 'I think that you get wake up calls and then you get drill sergeant kick you out the bed calls and I think we just got kicked out the bed onto a cement floor, and it hurt,' Green Bay defensive lineman Mike Daniels said. Eddie Lacy was mostly a non-factor with 34 yards rushing on 12 carries and left in the fourth quarter with a concussion. And despite holding the Packers to 255 total yards â the third fewest by Green Bay since the start of 2012 â Sherman felt the job wasn't up to standard. 'It wasn't dominant at all. We have a lot of things to clean up,' Sherman said. 'We missed some opportunities on some turnovers. We missed some tackles on key drives we could have stopped we had some key penalties. These are all things we need to clean up because we have a really high standard.' Lynch's second TD put Seattle up 29-10. Rodgers threw a 3-yard scoring pass to Randall Cobb in the fourth quarter, but Wilson closed out the victory with a 13-play drive that ate up 7 minutes and was capped by a 15-yard TD pass to Derrick Coleman on fourth down with 2:31 left.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Support for animal experiments is at its lowest for more than a decade. Government-commissioned surveys show that just 64 per cent of Britons agree with animals being used in medical research â a fall of 12 points since 2010 and the lowest figure since 2002. Almost a quarter want a total ban on animal experiments. Anger: A quarter of Britons now want to ban animal testing - the highest number since 2002 . Dr Maggy Jennings, the RSPCAâs chief scientific officer, said: âThese figures reveal the publicâs deep-seated and persistent concerns for animals who suffer in the name of science.â George Freeman, the minister for life sciences, said: âAnimal research is currently essential to help deliver life-changing and life-saving new medicines for conditions such as dementia, cancer and heart disease. âThe results of this survey show that the majority of people accept this but that there is room for improvement on openness and transparency within the field.â Confusion? Many do not know Britain's stance on animal testing, which was banned for make-up in 1998 . The polls also revealed that many people believe their cosmetics have been tested on animals. In fact animal testing of beauty products has been banned in Britain since 1998. And since last year, it has been illegal to sell make-up and personal care products such as shampoo and shower gel tested on animals anywhere in the world.","Just 64% of Britons agree with procedure, down 12 points since 2010 .
