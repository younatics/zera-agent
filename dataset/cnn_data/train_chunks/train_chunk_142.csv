"(CNN) -- In recent days, Michoacan, the home state of President Felipe Calderon, has become a flashpoint of violence in Mexico's deadly war against drug cartels. Since Calderon went after the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in 2006, more than 10,000 people have died across Mexico, about 1,000 of them police. In the latest incident, 12 bodies of federal police officers were found on the side of a remote highway, said Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, technical secretary for Mexico's national security council, at a news conference Tuesday. The bodies showed evidence of torture. The officers were ""ambushed while they were off duty by an armed group,"" Rubido said. One of the 12 officers was a woman. The bodies were found in a pile near the town of La Huacana, he added. Rubido said the slain officers had been doing ""investigative work"" in the city of Arteaga in Michoacan, one of the states most affected by the government's offensive against drug cartels. Rubido announced the arrest of Francisco Javier Frias Lara, known as ""El Chivo,"" in connection with the killings of the officers. Frias is a member of La Familia Michoacana, one of the region's most powerful drug cartels, Rubido said. Federal police around the country will redouble security measures for its agents, Rubido said. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, who authorities described as a high-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana. Cartel members first attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda, authorities said. When that failed, the drug gangs attacked police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. Coordinated attacks in eight cities over the weekend left three federal police officers and two soldiers dead. It was the federal police who arrested Rueda, and the current spate of attacks appear aimed at them in revenge. On Tuesday, two federal police officers were killed and four wounded in an ambush in Michoacan, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Also Tuesday, a federal police station in the Michoacan city of Maravatio was attacked, news reports said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. A local Michoacan newspaper put the body count in recent days at 32. La Familia Michoacana emerged in the 1990s as a conservative paramilitary group designed to insulate the state from the large drug cartels, said Bruce Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami and expert on drug trafficking. But over the years, the group evolved into a drug trafficking operation itself, forging strategic alliances with warring cartels to raise its own profile. This week's violence solidifies the cartel as a major and violent player in Mexico's drug wars, Bagley said. ""This represents the third evolution of the Familia Michoacana,"" he said. Reprisals from drug cartels following major arrests have been reported before, but the intensity of these attacks in Michoacan are unprecedented. La Familia Michoacana wants ""to demonstrate that they have power and will not go away quietly into the night,"" Bagley said. Video from the scene of the slain officers showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, left by the killers that stated the same thing: ""So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here."" But the state of Michoacan, on Mexico's southwest Pacific coast, is not alone in the wave of violence sweeping the country. The border city of Ciudad Juarez set a record this weekend when its toll of drug-related deaths for the year topped 1,000, a distinction the Mexican city did not reach last year until September. At this point last year, the violence-plagued city across the border from El Paso, Texas, had tallied 596 killings, El Universal newspaper said Tuesday, citing figures from the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Also in Chihuahua state, a mayor was shot and killed Tuesday morning while on his way to work. Ariel Meixequeiro had twice before temporarily left his post because he had been threatened by crime gangs, El Universal said. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Michoacan, home state of President Calderon, has become a flashpoint .

"Denver (CNN) -- To win in November, Mitt Romney must emerge from his first debate with President Barack Obama as the leader on this campaign's defining question: Which candidate do voters trust more to handle the economy? ""He has to paint a compelling picture of a better economic future and why he can lead us there and President Obama can't,"" GOP pollster Whit Ayres told CNN when asked to define Romney's paramount debate challenge. Democratic pollster Peter Hart made the same point but in more colorful language: ""If Romney loses this issue, then he is toast."" How to watch, clip and share the debate . Yes, there are other important challenges for both the Republican challenger and the Democratic incumbent as they share the debate stage for the first of three encounters. Romney, for example, must pass a test all challengers face when appearing side by side with an incumbent: look and sound like a credible alternative, like a president. The GOP standard-bearer also needs to quiet the jitters among Republicans who see the presidential campaign trending in a direction they worry could hurt down-ballot. Candidate 'tells' a cue to debate performance . For the president, some aides and advisers worry most about coming across as smug, or too dismissive, of criticism of his economic stewardship. His burden also includes the challenge of showing how the next four years would be different without helping his challenger's case that the approach of the last four years was misguided. But given the state of the race, very competitive but with an Obama advantage in several of the most important battleground states, veteran strategists in both parties agree the heavier burden in the first debate is on Romney. Five things to watch for tonight . And they agree his overriding challenge is to seize the upper hand in the economy argument. The candidates enter the Denver debate tied on that key question. Our new CNN/ORC International poll asked likely voters which candidate would better handle the economy. Obama was the choice of 49%, Romney of 48%. Pollster Ayres said the key in winning over undecided and persuadable voters is for Romney to make the case the president's economic proposals are ""government-driven"" and that Romney's rely on small business and the broader private sector as engines of growth. Romney: Debates aren't about a win . The president's response, according to aides familiar with his debate preparations, will be twofold: cast Romney's proposals as little or nothing new, a throwback to favor-the-rich GOP policies that the president argues contributed to the economic ditch, and raise questions about Romney's understanding of, and empathy for, the struggles of working- and middle-class families. The format should offer voters a clear contrast: . • Three segments on the economy . • One on health care . • One on the role of government . • And one on governing leadership and style. As always, there is the debate season sideshow known as the expectations game. It can be fun to watch, especially when high-profile surrogates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ignore the Romney campaign talking points and instead promise a campaign-changing debate performance. Fun, but in the end meaningless. The surrogates and spinners aren't on the debate stage. Or on the ballot. This is about Obama and Romney, their first of three debates a test of whether the challenger can make a persuasive case that he has a better economic plan or the incumbent can sell voters on staying the course. 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The driver responsible for a head-on collision that killed eight people -- including herself and four children -- on the Taconic State Parkway north of New York City last week was drunk and impaired by marijuana, authorities said. One of the vehicles in the three-vehicle wreck was heading the wrong direction, police said. Diane Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.19 percent and high levels of marijuana in her system, Maj. William Carey of the New York State Police said at a news conference Tuesday. Schuler also had ""6 grams of alcohol in her stomach that had yet to be metabolized,"" Carey said. Schuler's blood alcohol level indicated that she had consumed approximately 10 alcoholic beverages, said Betsy Spratt, chief toxicologist with the Westchester County district attorney's office. ""She would have had difficulty with perception, with her judgment [and] with her memory,"" Spratt said of Schuler. ""Around that level of alcohol, you also start to get what's called tunnel vision, where your perception is changed and you can't see peripherally all the time."" Investigators recovered a broken bottle of vodka in Schuler's minivan, said Carey, who added police didn't know whether she was drinking while driving. Spratt said she can't determine what kind of alcohol Schuler drank. The head-on crash happened July 26 when a minivan driven by Schuler and carrying five children was heading the wrong way on a northbound lane of the Taconic State Parkway about 30 miles north of New York City, police said. The minivan crashed into an SUV carrying three adults. Schuler and four of the children in the minivan died, as did the three people in the SUV. One child in the minivan survived and was hospitalized. One of the killed children was Schuler's daughter, and the other three were her nieces, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The child who survived is Schuler's son, according to WABC. A third vehicle carrying two adults was also involved in the crash, state police said. They suffered minor injuries. Witnesses told authorities they believed they saw the minivan straddling lanes and tailgating before the crash, according to WABC. The district attorney's office and the police ""will continue to investigate the facts and circumstances that led up to the collision causing the deaths, so that the public and the families of the victims can understand what led to this horrific crash,"" said Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore in a written statement. Carey echoed that sentiment, saying a criminal investigation continues but that no criminal charges will be filed at this point.","Minivan driver, four children, three other adults killed in July 26 crash .

"(CNN) -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor of Arkansas is expected to turn herself in after authorities issued a bench warrant for her arrest for allegedly smuggling contraband into a state prison, her attorney told CNN Wednesday. Betsey Wright served Clinton as chief of staff for 7 years in Arkansas and ran 3 successful campaigns for governor. Betsey Wright allegedly smuggled a red Doritos bag containing 48 tattoo needles, a pen with tweezers and a needle inside, a Swiss Army knife and a box cutter into the Varner Unit, a high-security state prison in Grady, Arkansas, according to the bench warrant. She will turn herself in next week, Jeff Rosenzweig, Wright's attorney, said. Wright is an advocate for prisoners and has befriended a number of inmates at Varner, Rosenzweig said. ""We are very disappointed the prosecutor has chosen to issue charges,"" he said. ""We have no choice but to seek vindication in court.""

"(CNN) -- For some families, like the Kennedys, the Bushes and the Roosevelts, politics runs in the blood. But as history shows, coming from a powerful political family doesn't mean a free ride to the top. George and Jeb Bush are the only sons of a president to make it to the governor's mansion. ""It does help, and it hurts. It's a two-edged sword,"" said Doug Wead, a presidential historian and former adviser to President George H.W. Bush. ""It initially helps the candidate with name recognition and more importantly with fundraising ... but many vote against the child as well."" The children of political families inherit a treasure chest of contacts, campaign workers and often endorsements, but the benefits have their limits. Only two presidential sons have followed their fathers to the White House (John Quincy Adams and George W. Bush), and just one presidential family -- the Bushes -- has sent sons to the governor's mansion (Jeb Bush in Florida and George Bush in Texas). ""I conclude that a brand name -- a famous family name -- is typically worth one step up on the political ladder,"" said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, who has researched and written about political dynasties dating back to colonial times. ""They get one step up -- and they are on their own."" Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, had two sons make it to Congress, but both failed in their gubernatorial bids. ""In both cases, then they were on their own. As they tried to step up to one higher level, both of them were defeated,"" noted Hess, who served as a staffer of the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations and as an adviser to Presidents Ford and Carter. Among some other high-profile names whose political aspirations came up short, William Taft's son Charles, who was the mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio, lost his bid to be the governor of the state; his other son -- Sen. Robert Taft -- tried three times without success to win the Republican nomination for president. (Robert Taft's son served in Congress, and his grandson served as the governor of Ohio for two terms). President Reagan's daughter Maureen failed in her run for a California Senate seat, and the son of Hubert Humphrey -- a former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee -- was defeated in Minnesota's 1998 gubernatorial election, losing to third party candidate and ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura. Sometimes, the public wants a candidate to lose an election or two, ""just to let them know that they cannot be taken for granted,"" said Wead, author of the 2004 book ""All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."" In 1997, then-Rep. Joe Kennedy II, son of New York Sen. Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, bailed out of the Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Kennedy had never formally announced his candidacy, but he had been considered the front-runner before a string of bad headlines caught up with him. ""Joe Kennedy backed down when he saw the polls and saw that the media wasn't going to give him a free ride on his personal life,"" Wead said. Kennedy's older sister, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, failed in her attempt to move from lieutenant governor of Maryland to governor, even though registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans 2-1, Wead said. Outside of the White House, familial ties are often beneficial to candidates who stay close to home -- in the same state, if not in the same congressional district. In New Jersey, four members of the Frelinghuysen family have served in Congress, dating back to the late 1700s, and in Wisconsin, the La Follette family has produced generations of congressmen and governors. In the case of Rand Paul, who is seeking one of Kentucky's Senate seats, being the son of Texas Rep. Ron Paul probably won't have much impact on his chances, based on Hess's observations. ""This thing is off the board in that regard,"" said Hess, noting that Rand Paul is not even in the same state, much less district, as his father. ""I can't imagine that Ron Paul, a sort of maverick congressman from Texas, should make a lot of difference in his son's race."" For those who do make it into office, winning an election can turn into more of a burden than a boon, because with a recognizable name comes a legacy -- and the pressure to defend it. John Van Buren was widely considered a better speaker, debater, fundraiser and politician than his father, Martin Van Buren, who served as the eighth president of the United States. John Van Buren won a seat in the House of Representatives the same year his father lost his re-election bid. But, Wead noted, once he got to the floor of the House, he resurrected old battles in an attempt to restore his father's legacy and failed to develop his own political identity. More recently, when George W. Bush took office, ""he fought his father's old battles literally,"" Wead said. Faced with complaints that his father, George H.W. Bush, reneged on his tax pledge and failed to bring an end to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, ""the son tied all the loose ends and cleaned the slate, but at a great cost,"" Wead said. Some observers argue that George W. Bush has so damaged the family brand that if Jeb Bush -- who was wildly popular as a two-term governor -- were to consider a presidential run, he'd have to change his last name. But Wead doesn't see it that way. ""It doesn't matter how much in disgrace the Bush family name may be for the moment -- they are a huge money-making machine."" ""I think the family really knows that the thing the people hate, tomorrow they can love,"" he added. That was the case with the Adamses, the only other family to yield a father-son presidential duo, Wead said. ""People would suddenly look with nostalgia at an administration that they hated. That can happen. It happened with the Adams,"" Wead said. ""Exactly that.""","Coming from a big political name ""does help, and it hurts,"" Doug Wead says .
Family name is ""worth one step up on the political ladder,"" Stephen Hess says .
The pressure to defend a legacy can stifle a political career, Wead says .
Even if a name is disgraced today, its image can be restored tomorrow, Wead says ."
"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The body of a woman who authorities say was impaired by marijuana and alcohol when she caused a deadly head-on collision shows no signs of long-term alcohol use, according to an investigator hired by her family. Diane Schuler's minivan was heading the wrong direction as the wreck happened, police said. ""I have looked at the autopsy, and the pancreas, liver and esophagus were clear,"" Tom Ruskin, lead investigator and president of CMP Protective and Investigative Group, told CNN. ""I've never seen a case like this. No one has seen this woman drunk and we have interviewed over 50 people -- relatives, friends, colleagues and former employees from her company."" The Westchester County medical examiner's office found that Diane Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol level of .19 percent -- more than twice the legal limit -- and had marijuana in her system when she drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway and ran head-on into an SUV. Three adults in the SUV were killed in the July 26 crash, along with Schuler and four children in her minivan -- her daughter and three nieces. A fifth child, Schuler's son, survived and is in stable condition. Ruskin, a former officer in New York Police's narcotics division, said he is hesitant to fully accept the autopsy report. ""I'm not saying the autopsy is wrong or right. I don't know if she smoked pot weeks prior. Marijuana stays in your system for up to 30 days,"" he said. The medical examiner's office released a statement on August 6, saying it stands by its autopsy results, and reiterated that Sunday. Schuler's family expressed shock when the details were revealed, saying she had no history of substance use. ""There's no way she'd do this,"" Jay Schuler, Schuler's sister-in-law, said earlier this month. ""She was responsible."" Tests revealed that Schuler had an additional six grams of alcohol in her stomach that had yet to be metabolized, according to Maj. William Carey of the New York State Police. A vodka bottle was also found in the vehicle after the crash. Ruskin is adamant that it is necessary to go back through the day of the crash. ""We are analyzing all of the data that we have to date. We have a staff that has consumed themselves with this case,"" he said. ""We are trying to determine what happened here."" Schuler's husband, Daniel, ""would like to remind people that no matter what happened here he lost his wife, his daughter, his nieces and he also grieves for the Bastardi and Luongo families,"" Ruskin said, referring to the other crash victims.

"ELBERTON, Georgia (CNN) -- In a parking lot in suburban Atlanta, customers mill in the summer heat, waiting for freezer bags full of beef, pork, chicken and other meats. Tim Young raises cattle, pigs, chicken, turkeys and more on his ""beyond organic"" farm. The draw that pulled them away from their grocery store and to the tailgate of a packed freezer truck? The meat is from animals raised naturally on a small family farm just two hours away. ""By supporting local farmers, we are essentially voting to support the local economy,"" said Anthony Chan, a member of a group that gets its meat monthly from Nature's Harmony Farm in Elberton, Georgia. Nature's Harmony is a member of a growing local-food movement, often referred to as Community-Supported Agriculture.  Watch video of Nature's Harmony » . The CSAs, as they're called, are a model in which consumers pay for their food in advance and receive it directly from the farmer. Working much like a magazine subscription, customers pay for a period of usually at least six months and receive packages either at the farm or at established delivery locations like the one in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Although thousands of farms have sprung up over the past two decades selling fruits and vegetables using the system, experts say there are probably only a few dozen that, like the Georgia farm, offer meat. Farmers Tim and Liz Young raise cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys and lambs on their 76-acre farm in northeast Georgia, near the South Carolina state line. The couple describes their farming technique as ""beyond organic,"" saying they use no artificial fertilizers, growth hormones or antibiotics and don't keep their animals penned up. Life on their property -- where cattle and sheep graze in open fields and chickens follow along to clean up after them -- looks much like the classic image of a family farm. But the couple say they consider themselves healers to both their customers and, according to their Web site, a food system that ""had become a machine with little regard for food safety, food taste and animal welfare."" ""People are becoming very disconnected from the food system,"" Liz Young said. ""Buying from a local CSA or just shopping at a local farm, you can see where it's coming from. You can talk to the farmers and figure out how the animals or the produce is raised."" The couple has 50 subscribers, plus a waiting list, and say 2,000 people receive a newsletter on the farm's activities. Members of the nation's handful of meat CSAs, and the thousands of others, offer a list of reasons. The food is healthier and tastes better, they say. They like supporting their local economy. Eliminating cross-country delivery is better for the environment, as are the sustainable farming techniques the farmers tend to use. ""Being part of a CSA means that I know the first names of the people who are raising the meat I eat,"" said Andrew Johnson of Kansas City, Missouri, a member of the Parker Farms meat CSA in Richmond, Missouri. ""Whereas, with the meat I buy from the grocery store, I don't know where it came from or who raised it."" Others say they appreciate that animals from the usually small family farms don't spend their lives in processing plants, conditions that advocates call inhumane. Because CSA members deal with the farmers directly, they are able to visit the farms and see exactly how their food is produced. The transparency, they say, creates an incentive for farmers to raise their animals as naturally as possible. ""If we have any questions about how it is being grown, we can simply visit the farm ourselves,"" said Kristen Johnson, Andrew's wife. Robert P. King, a professor of applied economics at the University of Minnesota, said that although community-supported agriculture ""provides a good opportunity for farms that want to use sustainable practices to actually do well in the marketplace,"" it's nowhere close to challenging conventional agriculture's domination of the food market. King said geographic availability can be limiting to CSAs. Generally, they require a rural area suitable for farming near an urban area that provide enough customers to make it work. And then, King said, there's the cost. Operating on a smaller scale and avoiding mega-farm practices designed to cut costs and improve yields almost always mean higher prices. A six-month Nature's Harmony membership ranges from $360, or $40 a month, for a poultry-only delivery to $840, or $140 a month, for 20 pounds of a variety of meats. ""Is it as cheap as the lowest-price chicken in the grocery store? Absolutely not,"" Tim Young said. ""But with our prices and the prices of any sustainable farmer, you've got everything baked in: the cost to the environment, the cost to the health care system, the cost of producing that animal [in a humane way]."" Johnson said that any difference in prices at the Missouri farm, which charges a $1,150 annual fee, are worth it. ""I don't think it is significant, but if it does end up costing a bit more, it is still important to us to make this a priority,"" he said. ""There are other expenses I am willing to give up rather than give up a safe, trusted food source."" The Youngs hope more people will get the chance to choose. ""There's a big, burgeoning demand out there for local meat, for local food, for organic foods and we'd like to see more famers step up to fill that demand,"" Tim Young said. ""We're trying to do that but we can never meet the demand that's out there. ""We'd love to see more farmers try to do what we're doing."" CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Community-supported farms allow members to buy locally .

"Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on CNN on Sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. ET. Fareed Zakaria says we still have a problem with Iran, and we have to have a strategy in dealing with the country. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Three leading Iranian reformists who have rejected the results of last month's election questioned the legitimacy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government Wednesday. This comes as Ahmadinejad is set to take office at the end of the month. Presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi wrote a letter in his party's newspaper, saying he would not recognize the government and vowing to ""stand by the people and the revolution, until the end of my life."" His statement prompted Iran's government to block publication of the newspaper. Ahmadinejad's main political rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, also released a statement Wednesday criticizing the government and its crackdown on the media, which he said has created a ""bitter, coup d'etat atmosphere"" in Iran. Iran's former reformist President Mohammad Khatami called on Iranians to keep up the struggle, noting that ""all doors are not yet closed."" Author and foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria spoke to CNN about this week's events in Iran. CNN: What is the likely outcome of events in Iran? Fareed Zakaria: The situation is fluid. The challenger, Mir Hossein Moussavi, and the former president, Khatami, are still criticizing the government for stealing the election. That is an extraordinary level of dissent at the highest levels of the establishment. But the most likely outcome remains that for now, the regime will be able to reassert order. But it has become a naked dictatorship, losing the facade of the Islamic and democratic political ideals that are important to it. CNN: But the nuclear program continues? Zakaria: Exactly. We still have a problem with Iran, and we have to have a strategy in dealing with it. The nuclear program continues to grow, and refusing to negotiate will not do anything to stop it. On the other hand, it seems wrong to pretend that nothing has happened in Iran. And it also disregards the reality of a divided leadership. CNN: So, what to do? Zakaria: I would say do nothing. Inaction can be a strategy. The five major powers on the U.N. Security Council (plus Germany) have given Iran a very generous offer to restart the nuclear negotiations. It has not responded. So, the ball is in its court. Until it does, the West should build support for tougher sanctions and more isolation. Until we hear from Tehran, there is no reason for the United States or the others to get engaged. CNN: Is this from a position of weakness, because the West has so few options? Zakaria: Not really, because while it might seem like the West has few options, in reality, Iran has fewer. Its economy is doing badly, the regime is facing its greatest challenge since its founding, and its proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere are all faring worse than it had expected. Let the supreme leader and President Ahmadinejad figure out what they should do first. Time might not be on their side. CNN: What about a military strike? Zakaria: It would be bizarre to bomb Iran-- which means bombing Iranians -- now that we have seen the inside of that country. Moussavi and his supporters want a less confrontational approach to the world. So do many members of the establishment. Moussavi attacked Ahmadinejad repeatedly for his aggressive foreign policy. So we now know the answer to the question, ""Are there moderates in Iran?"" Yes, millions of them.","Zakaria says most likely that Iran regime will reassert order, for now .
But, he says, Iran has lost facade of Islamic and democratic political ideals .
Best strategy on Iran's nuclear program could be to do nothing, he says .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea continued their unbeaten start to the English Premier League season with a 2-1 win against north London rivals Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. Goals from Spanish duo Fernando Torres and Juan Mata earned the Blues a fifth win in six league matches while handing Arsene Wenger's men their first League defeat this term. Torres put Chelsea ahead in the 20th minute hooking the ball past Mannone in the Arsenal goal after some sloppy defending by the home side. But the Gunners were back on level terms three minutes before the break when Gervinho guided the ball past Petr Cech after latching on to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. Mata's decisive goal came eight minutes into the second half -- his free-kick deflecting off Laurent Koscielny before finding the bottom corner of the net. Chelsea now have 16 points and remain top of the league while Arsenal slip to seventh on nine points. The win was a satisfying end to another turbulent week for John Terry. The Chelsea captain announced his retirement from international football on Sunday, before being handed a four-match ban and a Â£220,000 ($356,000) by the English Football Association (FA) on Thursday for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a match in October 2011. A court cleared Terry of the same offense in July, but the FA requires a lower burden of proof. Terry is currently considering whether to appeal the ban. Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur recorded their first win at Old Trafford in 23 years as Andre Villas Boas's side beat Manchester United 3-2. Defender Jan Vertonghen put Spurs ahead in the second minute before Garath Bale doubled the lead half an-hour later. Nani halved the deficit six minutes after the break only for Clint Dempsey to restore the two-goal cushion two minutes later. But United responded immediately as Shinji Kagawa made it 3-2, which, despite the home side's effort was how the score stayed. Alex Ferguson's men are now third with 12 points, level with Manchester City who had Edin Dzeko to thank for their 2-1 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Mladen Petric blasted home a penalty to put the Cottagers ahead in the 10th minute after Pablo Zabaleta had brought down John Arne Riise. Sergio Aguero equalized for City two minutes before halftime with Dzeko scoring the winner in the 87th minute, moments after coming on for Francisco Javi Garcia. Everton continued their promising start to the season with a 3-1 over Southampton at Goodison Park. A goal from Leon Osman (25th minute) and a quickfire brace from Nikica Jelavic (32nd and 38th minute) earned three points for David Moyes' team after Gaston Ramirez had given Southampton the lead in the sixth minute. Everton remain three points behind leaders Chelsea. Merseyside rivals, Liverpool posted their first league win under new manager Brendan Rodgers with a 5-2 thrashing of Norwich City. Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick as the Reds ran riot at Carrow Road with Nuri Sahin and Steven Gerrard also getting on the scoresheet. Steve Morison and Grant Holt made the scoreline look a bit more respectable with two second-half goals. Liverpool rise to 14th, Norwich slip to 18th in the table. Two goals from Peter Crouch saw Stoke City beat Swansea City 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium -- a win which lifts Tony Pulis's side to 12th. Demba Ba also scored twice to rescue a point for Newcastle in a 2-2 draw at Reading, while Steven Fletcher scored the only goal as Sunderland beat Wigan 1-0 at the Stadium of Light.","Spanish duo earn Chelsea a valuable 2-1 win over London rivals Arsenal .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The former Halliburton subsidiary KBR has been charged with bribing Nigerian government officials with ""tens of millions of dollars"" to obtain ""billions of dollars in contracts,"" according to court documents filed late Friday in Houston, Texas. KBR was spun off from its former parent corporation Halliburton in 2007. Justice Department lawyers filed an ""information,"" which is generally associated with an expected plea agreement. The Justice Department had no comment on the filing, but officials familiar with the case said they expected KBR representatives to appear Wednesday in federal court in Houston. The 22-page court document outlines a complex joint venture involving KBR and the Nigeria government-owned National Petroleum Corporation charged with developing the country's oil and gas industry. The contracts involved the design and construction of a natural gas plant. The government documents say the joint venture included payments to international consultants to bribe Nigerian officials. The alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act come after the conviction of Albert Stanley, KBR's former chief executive officer, who pleaded guilty to bribery last fall. ""We are not providing comment at this time,"" said company spokeswoman Heather Browne in an e-mail. She referred CNN to a filing in October that cited a consortium that included KBR called TSKJ. It said, ""information has been uncovered suggesting that, commencing at least 10 years ago, members of TSKJ planned payments to Nigerian officials. We have reason to believe, based on the ongoing investigations, that payments may have been made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials. ""The government has recently confirmed that it has evidence of such payments. The government has also recently advised Halliburton and KBR that it has evidence of payments to Nigerian officials by another agent in connection with a separate KBR-managed offshore project in Nigeria and possibly evidence of payments in connection with other projects in Nigeria."" The company said that in June 2004 it terminated its relationship with Stanley, and noted his guilty plea. ""By the plea, Mr. Stanley admitted that he participated in a scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials and that payments were made by agents of TSKJ to Nigerian officials in connection with the construction and expansion by TSKJ of the complex at Bonny Island,"" it said. KBR, which was spun off from its former parent corporation Halliburton in 2007, has been under fire for its business practices in providing logistical support to the U.S. war effort in Iraq. The Nigerian charges are separate from KBR's contracts in Iraq and Kuwait.

"(CNN) -- It may be one of the greatest victory laps of our time: Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's political heroine, is touring the United States, offering proof everywhere she goes -- from the White House to the Capitol rotunda, from Columbia University to Hollywood, from the U.N. to CNN -- that she is indeed ""the Lady."" In Oslo in June, she was able to give her acceptance speech, overdue by 21 years, for the Nobel Peace Prize she had been awarded when she was under house arrest in Burma. In the U.S., she's been able to receive the Congressional Gold Medal -- our highest honor -- she'd been awarded years ago; she was able to meet with the president, to sit with the U.N.'s secretary general and to meet many of the people who fought so hard to tell the world what the former military dictatorship was doing to her and to the Burmese people. This week, she will visit Los Angeles, meeting with local Burmese and sitting down to dinner with members of the Hollywood community. And if one message rings through in all of her appearances, it is the strength of nonviolent reconciliation, the power of democratic ideals to triumph and what it really means to be willing to stand up for what one believes, whatever the cost. World: Suu Kyi is 'global symbol' of progress, says U.N. secretary . It was Suu Kyi's nonviolent campaign against one of the most oppressive, dictatorial regimes of our times that gave hope to the oppressed Burmese people and to thousands of Buddhist monks, as she inspired politicians and leaders around the globe. It was the strength of her spirit, the patience of her approach and the profound beauty of her soul. It was the message that one democratically elected ruler could withstand nearly 20 years of house arrest, could live with the memory of her father's assassination, could overcome the separation from her cancer-stricken husband whom she was not allowed to visit on his deathbed and could galvanize a movement of monks and a nation of people to rise up and take back their country. Now, Suu Kyi is using her international visibility to address ethnic divisions in Burma and to challenge the rest of the globe to behave more responsibly, even as she forgives the very military leaders who kept her under house arrest for the better part of two decades. The nation is also called Myanmar, but Suu Kyi refuses to use that name because it was changed by the military junta. So what does it mean for us, in America, during a polarizing election that seems to be bringing out the worst in all of us? Rhetoric, sound bites, culture wars and catchphrases are replacing substance, thoughtfulness and informed debate. And in the middle of it all, Hollywood, as usual, is manipulated by each side to demonize the other. It wasn't so long ago, though, when our cultural leaders helped stand up and stand in for the most important voices of their day, raising issues all of us need to take more seriously. And, in fact, that's precisely what happened with Burma. Just a few years ago, before most of us ever heard of Burma, before we could pronounce Aung San Suu Kyi's name and before we watched in horror as Cyclone Nargis ravaged its shores in 2008, a group of us from the creative and human rights communities banded together to raise our voices around what was happening to Suu Kyi and the Burmese. We were able to pull together, left and right, young and old, Democrats and Republicans, Americans and foreigners, straights and gays, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and atheists. All in a common cause of celebrating the voice of the people, the power of democracy and one remarkable woman. Called ""Burma: It Can't Wait,"" it was an online video campaign featuring 38 spots to publicize what was happening in Myanmar and happening to Suu Kyi. The campaign has received about 25 million views. What compelled nearly 100 of the industry's most creative and committed people -- in front of and behind the camera -- to rally together to produce an award-winning online video campaign? What led Shepard Fairey to create another of his iconic images, inspired the likes of Jim Carrey and Anjelica Huston to speak out and celebrities to travel to the Burmese border to show their support for the refugees? And, in another example of what people united by a common cause can do, what inspired 27 of the world's most popular musical artists to contribute tracks in 2004 to an album called ""For the Lady""? One remarkable person. If you want to see why, read some of Suu Kyi's remarkable writings. ""Freedom from Fear,"" published by Penguin, provides a great collection of them. World: Myanmar democratic activist accepts tog congressional honor . In these hyperpartisan times, as approval ratings for Congress reach record lows, as our public discourse focuses on name-calling and our media oversimplify the most complex issues, it's refreshing to remember that many people were able to come together, from across a broad spectrum, to support a woman who had inspired Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair to rally to her defense. In a nation seemingly torn apart by divisiveness and conflict, on the eve of our presidential election, all of us should join together to champion the democratic traditions we cherish and to celebrate that much more that brings us together than divides us. As we enjoy Suu Kyi's tour of the United States, may we be reminded of the strength of her spirit and the power of unity of purpose in service of our ideals. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Burma's heroine and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi touring U.S.

"Editor's note: James Alan Fox is Lipman Family Professor of Criminal Justice and professor of law, policy and society at Northeastern University in Boston. Fox has written 17 books, including a forthcoming volume, ""Violence and Security on Campus: From Preschool to College."" James Alan Fox says a ""person of interest"" hasn't been implicated in a crime -- at least not yet. (CNN) -- The intense public interest surrounding the September 8th disappearance of 24-year-old Yale graduate student Annie Le has, since the discovery of her body last Sunday inside a wall of the laboratory building where she had been working, shifted over to a male lab technician who was described by New Haven Police as a ""person of interest."" In a formal court of law, the distinction between suspect and ""person of interest"" is as fundamental as the assumption of innocence prior to evidence of guilt. In the informal court of public opinion, however, the distinction is so badly blurred that the good name and reputation of truly innocent people have often been ruined. Many Americans will recall the name of Richard Jewell, who police and many news organizations called a person of interest following the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing. He was completely innocent and settled out-of-court with several news outlets for defamation of character. [Editor's note: CNN settled with Jewell for an undisclosed amount but maintained its coverage was fair and accurate.] . As a security guard stationed near the explosion site, Jewell was in the right place to uncover evidence but in the wrong place for appearing above suspicion. Similarly, a Seattle, Washington man, once described in the local media as a ""person of interest"" in an ongoing investigation of the Green River serial killing spree, was later awarded $30,000 as settlement for his lawsuit against three area news organizations. The historical timeline related to the scarlet ""I"" (for interest) does not extend very far. It is hard to imagine Sgt. Joe Friday of the old but classic Dragnet TV drama saying to his partner, ""this fella seems like a person of interest."" But, of course, just-the-facts- ma'am Joe wouldn't have speculated about possible investigative leads, at least not to the media. Curiosity about the now often-used designation involves more than just the fact that ""person of interest"" was not part of law enforcement vernacular a few decades ago. It is more that the thick blue line that distanced the cops and their investigations from the press as agents for an insatiable public has eroded in an age of instantaneous information, satellite-broadcasted -- and YouTube replayed -- press briefings, and crime-oriented cable news programs. Police investigators have long differentiated suspects from subjects. Suspects may include those arrested for a crime or a person still at large for whom an arrest warrant has been issued. In either case, there is probable cause to pursue criminal prosecution. In contrast, a subject is someone who warrants investigation by virtue of his/her relationship to a victim or proximity/access to a crime scene but who has not, at least so far, been implicated in the crime. That is, the subject designation leads to a police investigation, while the suspect designation results from one. Often times, the list of subjects in a continuing investigation can be extensive, but rarely is that true of the list of suspects. The subject-suspect distinction may have worked fine in the days before the press was all over police investigators like flies at a picnic. To avoid confusion from the sound-alike terms suspect and subject, the alternative phrase ""person of interest"" has become increasingly commonplace -- a creation for the media, if not by the media. Unfortunately, even without the linguistic similarity, the important distinction between person of interest and suspect is too often lost on most Americans. The arrest of Raymond Clark in connection with the murder of Ms. Le may officially signal a move from interest to suspicion. However, the recklessness of publicly naming persons of interest, even if it eventually leads to an arrest, does not serve the interests of justice. While it is hardly necessary to return to the ""just the facts"" days of close-lipped cops, a moratorium on releasing and publicizing the identities of persons of interest before and until they become persons of suspicion may be the wisest and fairest approach. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Alan Fox.","James Alan Fox: ""Person of interest"" is a relatively new term .

"Rome (CNN) -- Vatican police who searched the apartments of the pope's former butler, Paolo Gabriele, as they investigated a suspected leak told a court Wednesday how they found more than 1,000 important documents among a stash of hundreds of thousands. Among them were original papers signed by Pope Benedict XVI, some of them stamped with an order for destruction, according to a briefing from the small pool of journalists allowed to attend the trial in a Vatican courthouse. The former butler declared himself innocent Tuesday of a charge of aggravated theft in connection with leaked documents -- but said he had abused the pope's trust. Testifying Wednesday, Officer Silvano Carli said that among the huge quantity of documents found in Gabriele's possession, ""more than 1,000, both original and photocopies, were of interest."" Police also found many newspaper clippings and printouts from Internet searches, the court heard. Much of the material had a religious or spiritual theme, touching on Buddhism, Christianity, Catholicism and yoga. Other articles concerned Freemasonry. The four officers said that it had taken them almost eight hours to search through the papers accumulated by Gabriele and that they had found ""important"" documents mixed in with irrelevant material as if it ""had been hidden."" As well as the documents, a gold nugget belonging to the pope and a check made out to the pontiff were found in a shoebox. Pope's butler leaked papers to shock 'corrupt' Church, prosecutor says . The officers said they had searched the apartment mainly for documents and did not give ""much weight"" to the discovery of the gold nugget and signed check because they ""knew that it was Gabriele's job to handle the gifts the pope received during his trips."" They also seized a couple of computers, an iPad, a hard drive and USB drives. In total, 82 boxes of evidence were collected from Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a small town near Rome. Gabriele has previously admitted taking hundreds of secret papers from the pope's personal apartment and passing them to an Italian journalist. The evidence heard Wednesday is expected to be the last before the trial wraps up Saturday, when the prosecutor and defense lawyer are due to give their closing statements and rebuttals. Gabriele also has the right to speak again before the three lay judges retire to consider their verdict, which could come Saturday. He asserted his innocence during his own testimony Tuesday, but added: ""I feel guilty of having betrayed the trust that the Holy Father gave me."" Gabriele insists that he made no personal gain from collecting the documents and that he had no accomplices. He said he wanted to expose the ""disconcerting atmosphere"" within the Vatican. Vatican scandals lift lid on secret power struggle . Corruption claims resulting from the publication of a book based on the leaked materials rocked the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church and could even affect who becomes the next pope. If convicted of aggravated theft, Gabriele could face up to eight years in an Italian prison, although it is possible the pontiff could pardon him. Computer technician Claudio Sciarpelletti, who worked in the Vatican's secretariat of state, is accused of complicity in the crime. The court will try him separately, once the former butler's trial is finished. Sciarpelletti would face a shorter prison term of only a few months if found guilty. Prison terms handed down by the court are served in the Italian prison system, under an agreement between the Vatican city-state and Italy. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a top-level Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the best-selling book ""Sua Santita"" (""His Holiness""), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. The Vatican called the publication of his book ""criminal"" when it was released in Italian.","Police found more than 1,000 important documents in Paolo Gabriele's possession .

"(CNN) -- A Florida circuit judge Tuesday struck down a 31-year-old state law that prevents gays and lesbians from adopting children, allowing a North Miami man to adopt two half-brothers he and his partner have raised as foster children since 2004. Martin Gill looks on as a judge overturns a ban preventing gays and lesbians from adopting children. ""There is no question, the blanket exclusion of gay applicants defeats Florida's goal of providing dependent children a permanent family through adoption,"" Judge Cindy S. Lederman wrote in her 53-page ruling. ""The best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption."" The state attorney general's office has appealed the decision. Lederman said there is no moral or scientific reason for banning gays and lesbians from adopting, despite the state's arguments otherwise. The state argued that gays and lesbians have higher odds of suffering from depression, affective and anxiety disorders and substance abuse, and that their households are more unstable. Lederman said the ban violated children's right to permanency provided under the Florida statute and under the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. Whether the ban violated the state's equal protection clause by singling out gays and lesbians should be considered, she said. Lederman's ruling paves the way for Martin Gill to legally adopt the two half-brothers, ages 4 and 8, whom he has cared for since December 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union said. The two boys, who are referred to as John and James Doe in court documents, were removed from their homes on allegations of abandonment and neglect. ""On that December evening, John and James left a world of chronic neglect, emotional impoverishment and deprivation to enter a new world, foreign to them, that was nurturing, safe, structured and stimulating,"" Lederman wrote. In 2006, the children's respective fathers' rights were terminated, court documents said, and they remained in the care of Gill and his partner. ""Our family just got a lot more to be thankful for this Thanksgiving,"" Gill said Tuesday, according to the ACLU, which represented him. Florida is the only state that specifically bans all ""homosexual"" people from adopting children, although it does allow them to be foster parents. This month, Arkansas voters approved a ballot measure to prohibit unmarried partners -- same-sex or opposite-sex couples -- from adopting children or from serving as foster parents. The measure is similar to one in Utah, which excludes same-sex couples indirectly through a statute barring all unmarried couples from adopting or taking in foster children. Mississippi allows single gays and lesbians to adopt, but prohibits same-sex couples from adopting. Neal Skene, spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said the appeal was filed so a statewide resolution on the law could be determined by an appellate court. He noted that another Florida circuit judge declared the law unconstitutional this year but that ruling had not been appealed. ""We need a statewide determination by the appellate courts,"" he said. Gill's adoption petition cannot be approved until the appeal process is finished, Skene said, but the children will remain in Gill's home. ""These are wonderful foster parents,"" Skene said. ""It's just that we have a statute, [and] the statute is very clear on the issue of adoption."" Several organizations -- including the National Adoption Center, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics -- have said that having gay and lesbian parents does not negatively affect children. The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a nonprofit organization that studies adoption and foster care, hailed the decision. ""This ban, which was the only one of its kind in the country, has done nothing but undermine the prospects of boys and girls in the foster care system to get permanent, loving homes,"" said Adam Pertman, the Adoption Institute's executive director, in a written statement. ""So this decision by Judge Lederman is a very important, hopeful ruling for children who need families.""","NEW: Ruling clears way for North Miami man to adopt two half-brothers .

"(CNN) -- John Evander Couey was sentenced Friday to death for abducting, raping and killing a 9-year-old Florida girl by burying her alive in 2005. John Evander Couey, in court Friday, was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing a 9-year-old girl. Couey did not speak during the almost hourlong hearing and showed no emotion when the sentence was pronounced in an Inverness, Florida, courtroom. Members of Jessica Lunsford's family embraced and cried. ""[Couey] said one time that when he gets to heaven that he was gonna tell Jessie he is sorry. I got bad news, I don't think you're gonna make it there,"" the girl's father, Mark Lunsford, said afterward, wiping tears from his eyes. He also urged his daughter's killer not to appeal the sentence. ""Take your punishment. Be done with it. You want to do something for her, give your life for the life you took,"" Lunsford said.  See what Jessica's father had to say after the sentencing » . Citrus County Sheriff Jeffrey Dawsy told reporters after the hearing that he asked Couey to drop his appeals after the automatic appeals required by law. Couey did not reply, he said. Judge Ric Howard pronounced the sentence as Couey, 48, sat in shackles and an orange jail jumpsuit. ""[Couey] caused a slow, suffering, conscious death,"" the judge said as he described Jessica's murder in chilling detail. Couey told Jessica he was planning to take her home, but did not want her to be seen, Howard said, and so persuaded her to get into a trash bag. Couey then knotted another trash bag over her head, placed her in a hole and shoveled dirt on top of her. The judge described how the girl poked two fingers through the bags to try to escape before she died. ""Simply stated, civilized society recoils in horror at the image of the abject fear and terror that Jessica experienced in her final, conscious minutes of life,"" Howard said. Watch Couey being sentenced to death . Howard brought many in the courtroom to tears Friday as he elaborated on how Jessica died -- by asphyxiation as her oxygen slowly ran out. A medical examiner testified she could have been alive as much as five minutes, or even longer, before she lost consciousness, Howard said. The judge also noted that Couey made ""crude, vulgar and repulsive"" comments to police after his arrest regarding his sexual assault of the girl, and said the media was blowing the case out of proportion -- ""this kind of thing happens every day."" After the hearing, Mark Lunsford, wearing a tie with his daughter's face emblazoned on it, spoke of the need for state and federal lawmakers to do more to protect children by pursuing more aggressive prosecution and stricter sentencing for sex offenders. ""The problem is still growing. Children are still being molested. Sex offenders and predators are still being released,"" Lunsford said. ""Justice was served for this little girl, but what about the rest of them? What about the ones that survive?"" ""You can't do anything to bring my daughter back, but you can do everything to save these other kids."" Jessica was discovered missing from her home, where she lived with her father and grandparents, on February 24, 2005. Couey later confessed to abducting her from her bedroom the previous night. A judge threw out Couey's confession, however, saying it was inadmissible in court because he asked for a lawyer and was not provided one. His trial was moved to Miami after a judge ruled it would be impossible to find an impartial jury in Citrus County. Jessica's body was found buried at the home of Couey's half-sister, within sight of Jessica's home -- three weeks after she went missing. She was wrapped in plastic garbage bags and her hands were bound with speaker wire. She was clutching a stuffed dolphin -- a toy won for her at a state fair by her father, which Couey allowed her to bring with her when she was abducted. The girl apparently was kept for several days before being killed. Authorities found her blood on a mattress in the home where Couey was living, and also discovered her fingerprints. During the search for the girl, as authorities and hundreds of volunteers combed Citrus County, north of Tampa, police twice visited that home. Couey was convicted in March of first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual battery on a child under 12. Later that month, a jury deliberated for about an hour before recommending 10-2 that Couey, a previously convicted sex offender with a 30-year criminal history, receive the death penalty. In a recorded jailhouse phone call this month with a woman who Florida corrections officials said is his aunt, Couey said he expected to be sentenced to death for killing Jessica in 2005. ""We all know what he's going to do,"" Couey said of the judge during the call, an excerpt of which CNN obtained. He told the woman, ""I kick myself in the butt a hundred times a day. Stupidity. ... Just trying to figure out, I'm just asking myself, why was you so stupid?"" ""Well, none of us are perfect, and the drugs didn't help any,"" the woman said. ""No, that was a big problem,"" Couey said. ""Drugs, alcohol."" The St. Petersburg Times reported that during the hourlong conversation, Couey also told the woman he wanted to be cremated after his execution. But he said, ""There's a lot of good that came out of this, too. A lot of laws changed."" Jessica's slaying sparked national outrage and led to stricter Florida laws regarding registration and supervision of released sexual predators, following a push led largely by Mark Lunsford.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- The United States on Sunday accused Russia of trying to overthrow the government of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where Russian troops have been battling Georgian forces over the breakaway territory of South Ossetia. Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., alleges a Russian official said Georgia's president ""must go."" At an emergency session of the United Nations' Security Council, the U.S. alleged Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ""must go."" ""This is completely unacceptable and crosses a line,"" said the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Zalmay Khalilzad, who made the allegation. In a crackling exchange of a type rarely seen since the end of the Cold War, Khalilzad asked Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin whether the Russians were seeking ""regime change"" in Georgia with the military operation they launched Friday. In response, Churkin objected to the disclosure of a confidential phone call between top diplomats and said ""regime change"" was ""an American expression."" The term was one the Bush administration used to describe its goals in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Russia opposed. But Churkin said some leaders ""become an obstacle"" to their own people, and ""some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future."" ""Sometimes there are democratically elected or semi-democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries,"" Churkin told reporters after the meeting. ""So sometimes, those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people."" The pro-Western Saakashvili came to power in Georgia's ""Rose Revolution"" in 2003 and was elected president in 2004 and 2008. His government has strong U.S. backing, has contributed troops to the American-led war in Iraq and applied for membership in NATO. Georgia's ambassador, Irakli Alasania, said Churkin's meaning was clear enough. ""For me, it confirms that what the Russian Federation is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected Georgian government,"" Alasania said. Khalilzad said the United States plans to offer a draft resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Georgia, accusing Russian forces of impeding the withdrawal of Georgian troops from the territory. Though Russia could veto the measure in the Security Council, he said Moscow ""is on the wrong side here"" and risked damaging its ties with Washington and the West. ""The days of overthrowing leaders by military means in Europe -- those days are gone,"" Khalilzad said. The situation in South Ossetia escalated rapidly from Thursday night, when Georgia said it launched an operation into the region after artillery fire from separatists killed 10 people. It accused Russia of backing the separatists. Russia sent tanks to South Ossetia on Friday, saying it wanted to protect its peacekeepers posted there following cease-fires in years past. By Sunday the conflict was raging in other parts of Georgia as well, including another breakaway area, Abkhazia, located in northwestern Georgia. Each side accused the other of killing large numbers of civilians. Russia said at least 2,000 people have been killed in South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali. Churkin repeated Russia's position that it is responding to Thursday's Georgian attack on South Ossetia, which, although inside Georgia, has an autonomous government that is backed by Moscow. Churkin said Russia's military action is a humanitarian campaign aimed at blocking the ""ethnic cleansing"" of Ossetians by ethnic Georgians. He also challenged Khalilzad's argument that Russian forces were waging a ""campaign of terror"" there, essentially telling council members to consider the source. ""This statement, ambassador, is absolutely unacceptable -- particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of, including with regard to civilian populations in Iraq and Afghanistan and Serbia,"" Churkin said. But Churkin drew a rebuke from other Security Council members, including its current president, after he questioned the objectivity of a top U.N. official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in Georgia. The Security Council's president, Belgium's Jan Grauls, said he was ""surprised and dismayed"" by Churkin's swipe at Lynn Pascoe, the U.N. undersecretary for political affairs. Churkin said Pascoe's briefing, which included a statement from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, ""shows that the Secretariat of the United Nations and its leadership was not able to adopt that objective position that is required by the substance of this conflict.""

"RAMALLAH, West Bank (CNN) -- The harsh reality of life and death in Gaza is a common theme for Palestinian filmmakers. A still from ""Fatenah,"" the first commerical animation to come out of the Palestinian Territories. But it was the 2004 death of a young Palestinian woman -- not at the hands of a militant attack or an Israeli incursion -- that struck a note with two filmmakers. Their animated film, ""Fatenah,"" is inspired by her struggle with breast cancer, which is still a sensitive subject in the Palestinian territories. ""The amount of trouble she has to go to just to survive, you feel somehow committed to be part of that project, it is so strong and so emotional,"" director Ahmad Habash told CNN. Fatenah, which tells the fictional story of a young seamstress from a Gaza refugee camp, is the first commercial Palestinian animation film ever made. The heart-wrenching tale follows Fatenah's pain and humiliation as she struggles to leave Gaza for treatment after finding few Palestinian doctors willing to help. At first, one doctor suggests she loosen her bra, while another says her condition will probably go away once she marries. It takes six months for Palestinian doctors to treat her concerns seriously and diagnose her with breast cancer. Fatenah becomes tied up in Israeli and Palestinian bureaucracy, denied treatment until it is too late. It is a devastating tale that Habash said is not unique. ""The Shata refugee camp, which exists in Gaza ... represents any refugee camp and [Fatenah] could be any woman,"" he said. ""The story could happen again."" The film's executive producer Saed Andoni said it was a gamble telling such a tragic story using animation. But he believes that bet has paid off. ""I think the animation has softened the harshness of the topic,"" he said. ""Breast cancer and illness and death and Gaza and the siege, it's all heavy stuff, it's all harsh stuff. Put it in an animation style, give it a new dimension, give it a new perspective."" At a screening in the West Bank city of Ramallah, audience members wept after hearing Fatenah's story, saying they related to her plight. One scene shows Fatenah checking her breast for lumps. The filmmakers hope this will help to break down barriers around a subject that is still very hidden in the region. ""It's very taboo to speak about the woman's body in Palestinian society, but in the film it happens and nobody criticizes and nobody says anything about it,"" Andoni said. ""They accept it."" The film breaks new ground by dealing with matters often swept under the carpet in Palestinian society. Andoni said the film's greatest endorsement came from the father of the woman whose real-life story inspired the film. The woman's father said he cried when he watched it. ""It's a very human story and if it can touch the real family, it is a great moment,"" Andoni said.","Young Palestinian's death from breast cancer inspires first commercial animation .

"(CNN) -- A retired prosecutor whose comments in a 2008 HBO documentary threatened to derail a 31-year-old sex case against film director Roman Polanski now says he lied. David Wells, a former prosecutor, now says he lied about his role in the Roman Polanski case. David Wells told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he ""buttered up"" his role in the Polanski case for the documentary crew. He said he lied about trying to goad a judge to sentence Polanski to prison in 1978 for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. Wells' comments in ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired"" raised questions of judicial misconduct and spawned Polanski's most recent effort to get the case dismissed. But the legal challenge stalled when Polanski refused to return to the United States, where he faced certain arrest. ""I made these imprudent comments, just to liven it up a little,"" Wells said. ""In retrospect, it was a bad thing to do, and I never knew this thing was going to be shown in the United States.""  Watch Wells' rueful admission » . Wells now says he never spoke with the judge about the Polanski case, as he had claimed in the documentary. ""I never discussed this case with [the judge] at any time,"" Wells told Blitzer. Asked why he should be believed now, Wells said, ""I'm destroying my character in public and everybody in the world knows about it. ... I don't like admitting this."" He agreed to take a polygraph test to set the record straight. Polanski was arrested last weekend in Switzerland on a 1978 fugitive warrant and will fight extradition, his lawyers said. They had no immediate comment on Wells' recantation. ""I am astonished that he has now changed his story,"" Marina Zenovich, the documentary's director, said in an e-mailed statement. ""It is a sad day for documentary filmmakers when something like this happens."" She said Wells signed a release form, never raised any doubts or concerns, and vouched for the documentary when he spoke to The New York Times in July 2008. Wells also acknowledged that he lied to The New York Times. ""I figured Polanski never was going to come back,"" he said. ""I didn't want to put myself out as a liar."" Polanski's arrest in Switzerland made Wells' public exposure inevitable, he said. ""I'm going to tell it the way it is and if I take a beating over it, I deserve it,"" he said. Blitzer challenged Wells to a polygraph test, and he agreed to take one if his former employers at the Los Angeles County, California, District Attorney's office allow it. ""I'm not going to do anything more to hamper the District Attorney's case,"" he said. District Attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the office had no position on the polygraph challenge. ""Mr. Wells is retired,"" she said. ""We have no control over him."" Wells was a bit player in a high profile case that has haunted the courts of Los Angeles for three decades. He was a calendar prosecutor, handling routine matters in the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Laurence Rittenband, who oversaw the Polanski case. Rittenband, who died in 1993, had a fascination with celebrity cases, and was so publicity conscious that he directed his courtroom staff to keep a scrapbook of news clippings, according to court records. Polanski was charged with six felonies, including sodomy and rape, but pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under a plea bargain. The director, his lawyer and the prosecutor handling the case believed they'd reached a deal that would spare the young victim a public trial and Polanski jail time, according to court records. Polanski fled the United States before sentencing. He was spooked when Rittenband indicated he would not honor the deal and instead intended to send the famed director to prison.  Watch how the plea bargain went south » . The charges stemmed from Polanski's March 1977 encounter with the 13-year-old girl during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house on Mulholland Drive. Polanski told the girl's mother he was on assignment for French Vogue, according to court records. Wells said he was critical about the manner in which the case was handled. He believed Polanski should go to prison. He told the documentary makers that he suggested to Rittenband that Polanski be sent for 90 days of ""diagnostic testing"" at a state prison facility in Chino, California, to determine whether he was a sex offender. He admitted to CNN that he was lying about suggesting the 90-day evaluation, adding that Rittenband routinely sent defendants for evaluation.The evaluation was completed in 42 days, and Polanski was freed early after it determined he was not a sex offender.  Watch CNN's Jeff Toobin call it a sideshow » . Polanski was given permission to travel to Europe to complete a film before he was formally sentenced. It was understood by everyone that Polanski would receive credit for time served and probation, according to filings in his legal challenge. While Polanski was in Europe, Wells said in the documentary, a photograph appeared of the director smoking a cigar, sipping a beer and accompanied by two young women. A script from the documentary in the court file lays out what Wells said happened next: . ""And so I took the picture into Judge Rittenband. I said, 'Judge,' I said, 'look here, he's flipping you off,' "" he said. ""I took it to Rittenband because I figured it was something he ought to see. And what I told him was, I said, 'You know, judge, you've made so many mistakes, I think, in this case. Look. He's giving you the finger. He's flipping you off. And here's the way he's doing it.' And I said, 'Haven't you had enough of this?' And then, of course, he exploded and what happened, happened."" Wells now says he lied about that, too. He said a newspaper reporter handed him the photo, which he passed on to the judge's court staff. ""I could call it building a bigger story, putting my part in the case bigger than it actually was,"" he said. ""But when you peel away all the feathers, it's just a lie. I shouldn't have done it. I wish I didn't.""","David Wells admits to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he ""buttered up"" his story .

"(CNN) -- Singer Stephen Gately, a member of the Irish band Boyzone, died of natural causes, a court spokeswoman on the Spanish island of Majorca said Tuesday. Stephen Gately died Saturday while he and his partner were visiting the Spanish island of Majorca. The court spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified, said Gately, 33, died Saturday of acute pulmonary edema, according to preliminary autopsy reports. There was no sign of violence in his death, the spokeswoman said. The judge has authorized Gately's family to transfer the body out of Spain, the spokeswoman added. According to the Mayo Clinic, pulmonary edema is caused by excess fluid in the lungs. The fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs, making it difficult to breathe. Gately's partner, Andrew Cowles, testified before an investigating magistrate for about 15 minutes Tuesday, while the autopsy was conducted nearby at the island's forensic institute, the court spokeswoman said. Authorities will send samples from the body to a laboratory in Barcelona. Meanwhile, the court will hear testimony from other witnesses, the court spokeswoman said. The case will be shelved judicially only after the definitive laboratory results have been received, confirming the presumed natural death, the spokeswoman said. Health Library: What is pulmonary edema? In a statement on the Boyzone Web site, Gately's fellow bandmates, Ronan Keating, Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham and Shane Lynch said: ""We are completely devastated by the loss of our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. ""Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo.' "" Boyzone made history in the United Kingdom with 16 consecutive Top Five hits, according to Ticketmaster's Web site. It's one of Ireland's best-selling bands, with six No. 1 singles in the United Kingdom, and four No. 1 albums, Ticketmaster said. The group, which separated in 2000 to pursue solo projects, reunited in 2008. Its greatest hits album -- ""Back Again ... No Matter What"" -- was released last year. Gately joined the band in 1993 after answering an audition ad. ""A lot of people didn't think we would make it out of Ireland back then,"" he said previously on the group's Web site. ""We were overwhelmed when Boyzone began to take off, it was incredible."" CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this story.","Boyzone singer Stephen Gately, 33, died Saturday in Majorca .

"SANTA BARBARA, California (CNN) -- Berkeley Breathed answers the door to his Santa Barbara home, a tall, slender figure in suede cowboy boots. Berkeley Breathed has left comic strips behind to focus on his writing -- particularly children's books. But before he can extend a hand in greeting, he's nudged aside by a canine companion eager to introduce herself. ""Pickles"" offers a hearty welcome, vigorously shaking a tail that seems powerful enough to whack a lamp from an end table. The pit bull is one of a number of dogs that Breathed and his wife, Jody, have rescued over the years. His affection and concern for dogs form the heart of ""Flawed Dogs: The Shocking Raid on Westminster"" (Philomel Books), Breathed's new illustrated novel, whose hero is a resilient dachshund with a soup ladle for a leg.  Gallery: The art of Berkeley Breathed » . It's the latest children's work from Breathed, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist behind ""Bloom County"" and ""Opus,"" who's had great success with the genre. The earlier ""Mars Needs Moms!"" is set to be made into a movie produced by Robert Zemeckis. Breathed invited CNN to his mountainside home for a rare interview, which touched on topics ranging from his book to Michael Vick, Charles Schulz and his famous pen pal, Harper Lee.  Watch Breathed read from ""Flawed Dogs"" » . The following is an edited version of the conversation: . CNN: The hero of your book is quite an unusual dog. Berkeley Breathed: Sam the Lion he's called, by Heidi [the girl] who finds him. ... The central part of the story is the fall of Sam from Heidi's life and into the depths of horrors that dogs can sometimes experience in our world -- everything from being shot at, to research labs, to the worst dog shelters amongst the world of otherwise nice dog shelters, and he comes for revenge upon Cassius [a rival]. And Cassius is going to appear at the Westminster Dog Show coming up, so Sam has got to find a team of commandos to help him infiltrate and destroy the Westminster Dog Show. CNN: What was the inspiration for the story? Breathed: The book happened because I came across both a picture and a quote at about the same time -- a picture of one of Michael Vick's fight dogs. It was set to be put down, but a shelter in Utah decided to take the dog and a few others at the same time and try to rehabilitate them. ... This was the first time the dog had ever received any affection in its life. ... It's the most moving picture of a dog I've ever seen, having gone through an impossible transition and fallen back to where dogs naturally go, which is just loving people. CNN: ""Flawed Dogs"" is put out by the ""young readers"" division of the publisher. Breathed: I notice it's getting a little bit of controversy in that people are coming to it assuming that it's for the same audience that my picture books are for. And ""Flawed Dogs"" the novel is definitely not. It's perfect for an 8-year-old, 9, 10, 11, 12, but I wouldn't read this in the evening to my 5-year-old. And there is a difference. ... It's revealed an issue that I'm surprised about, which is the new preciousness that's been brought to literature for children now. There is an abject fear of instilling any sort of dramatic trauma, of sadness, on the children who are receiving a story. ... And of course that was never a great concern in the past. The great children's stories that we all grew up with, there are always moments of great tragedy and moving moments of loss in the book that we weren't afraid of -- as long as you bring them [young readers] back by the end and bring them to where a reader should be, a child should be. CNN: You don't do a daily or a weekly comic strip anymore. How has that transition been? Breathed: If this was still 1985 and everything that means ... it would still be deeply appealing to be a cartoonist. But not now. I'm happy to leave that behind. The level of political rancor -- powered and driven by Web comment and cable news to a degree -- affects me like everybody else, and I get angry and I get annoyed and I get frustrated and that always translates into mediocre cartoons historically. ... I was getting too angry the last couple of years of cartooning, and it doesn't do the art any good. I'm very happy to let that go. CNN: When did you first discover, ""Wow, I can actually draw""? Breathed: I could never really draw something. It was, ""Wow, I can actually draw or write something that amuses somebody."" And that was a dawning that didn't happen until college. ... The greatest cartoonists ever have really been very mediocre artists. Charles Schulz was always quick to admit that his skills in artistry were limited at best. And in his case it served the strip perfectly. If ""Peanuts"" had been drawn with the artistry of ""Pogo"" and a Disney animator, it wouldn't have worked. CNN: Animals were an integral part of your comic strips. Breathed: I knew that I wanted a strip with people but the focus on an animal, and an incongruous animal. ... So I looked around largely at an animal that hadn't been done before in comic strips, an animal that is generally attractive to people and people feel immediately warm to and that just would be funny. You end up with a penguin pretty fast. Plus, he's already standing, and he's kind of got clothes on. CNN: Who are your heroes? Breathed: ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a huge influence on my work. Harper Lee and I have over the years exchanged letters, which has been a massive delight. I can tell you that when I announced the end of my comic-stripping career and that Opus [the penguin] was not only going to fade away but fade away permanently, I got a letter from Harper urging me to reconsider letting Opus go away forever. I should have written back and said, ""The moment you bring Scout back, I'll bring Opus back. Is that a deal, Harper?"" Of all the people who should not be chastising me about stopping my career early, it would be Harper Lee. Opus really is a bit like Scout in that he's circulating around in his world, and he's surrounded by a lot of insanity, a lot of hatred, a lot of intolerance and ... he's the ultimate innocent at the center of it. And that's how Scout worked in that story. I suppose I needed an Atticus Finch for Opus, but I never had time to develop one. ... I'm not an artist who is trying to be a novelist. I've always been a writer and the art was the way to sell the writing and it's been convenient in that way. ... I'd be happy to leave that all and just be a writer if I could get away with it. I don't think I can at this point. They [readers] expect the pictures. I'm happy to oblige.","Berkeley Breathed's new book, ""Flawed Dogs,"" inspired by photo of abused dog .

"(CNN) -- It's arguably one of the largest pieces of Elvis Presley memorabilia ever: a 154.5-acre ranch in Horn Lake, Mississippi, once owned by the king of rock 'n' roll. Elvis Presley bought the property in February 1967, three months before marrying Priscilla Beaulieu. And it's on the market, with an asking price of $6.5 million. ""It had a large cross there that Elvis really liked, and a concrete bridge over a 14-acre lake,"" real estate agent Rodger Motz told CNN. The property, called the ""Elvis Ranch"" by locals, is just east of Highway 301 in Horn Lake, about 17 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee. Presley purchased it in February 1967, three months before he married Priscilla Beaulieu, according to a Graceland spokeswoman. The deed on record was signed by Presley's longtime manager, Col. Tom Parker, said Parker Pickle, Desoto County tax assessor. There is a small house known as the ""Honeymoon Cottage"" on the property. Graceland confirmed the newly married Presleys did spend time there following their honeymoon in Palm Springs, California. The property has been on the market since last month. Its current owners are Dennis McLemore and his brothers. McLemore said his parents bought the property in 1979 and turned it into a cattle ranch after previous owner-developers had failed to turn it into a resort. McLemore said he met Priscilla Presley on a winter day in 1985. ""I got a call one day that Priscilla was coming up for a visit,"" he said. ""I'd been working on a cow's ear and was covered in blood when she came up. She told me Elvis would have been proud this was a working cattle ranch."" Tours occasionally have driven down from Memphis with passengers who took pictures of the pastures, he said. At one time, there was a 12-foot wooden fence around the compound with a half-dozen trailers on the grounds, where members of Presley's entourage, the ""Memphis Mafia"" were housed. ""There's still a trailer pad behind the Honeymoon Cottage,"" McLemore said. ""I remember as a child when Elvis owned it,"" said Anita Rainey, planning director for the city of Horn Lake. ""I had a friend he gave a horse to. She lived across the street to the ranch and woke up one day and they had a pony."" She said she remembers seeing Presley riding a horse along the highway. He was a quiet owner, she said, and the ranch is prime real estate. ""I've been getting a lot of calls from media,"" Motz said, ""and the Europeans are really interested."" However, he said, he doesn't have a serious buyer on the hook and has yet to receive an offer.","154.5-acre ranch in Horn Lake, Mississippi, once lived in by Elvis Presley .

"(CNN) -- A package of measures designed to improve the safety of the UK's Grand National steeplechase have been announced by British horse racing authorities. Details of changes to the start and modification to fences were published Thursday by Aintree Racecourse and the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) following the deaths of two horses during this year's race last April. ""Following this year's race, our priorities were to establish the facts surrounding the incidents that occurred during the running of the race and, secondly, to review the events which led to what was an unsatisfactory start to the race,"" Jamie Stier, Director of Raceday Operations and Regulation for the BHA, said in a statement. ""We have worked closely with Aintree and consulted widely with jockeys, trainers and legitimate welfare organizations - the RSPCA (a UK-based animal welfare charity) and World Horse Welfare - on a range of elements related to the race,"" Stier added. These include moving the start 90 yards (82 meters) away from the crowds and the grandstands. The objective of these changes is to create ""a calmer and more controlled environment for both horse and rider,"" Stier says. ""We recognize that there is pressure and tension before the race and we want to alleviate that where possible,"" he added. Along with ongoing research into safer fence design, the BHA and Aintree have announced alterations to Becher's Brook -- the fence where both Synchronized and According to Pete were fatally injured in 2012. The fence which is jumped twice (6th and 22nd in a total of 30) during the race is having its landing area leveled further, while landing areas at fences four, five and 13 will also see work carried out to smooth out natural undulations. The number of horses allowed to enter the race will remain at 40. World Horse Welfare welcomed the new commitments to course alterations. ""We are especially encouraged by their program of work on the fences, replacing the hard cores with softer materials to make them more forgiving to the horses. This has the potential to make a big difference to safety,"" Roly Owers, chief executive of World Horse Welfare said in a statement. But Owers was disappointed at the lack of action on the size of the field. ""We believe that the number of fallers, unseated riders and horses being brought down by other horses in the National is too high (50% in 2012), Owers said. ""While there is clearly no magic formula here, changes need to be made to significantly reduce the faller rate which will reduce the number of injuries, fatalities and loose horses which pose risks to themselves and others on the course. We believe the single most effective way of doing this is to trial a reduction in the field size -- say for three years.""","Organizers of UK's Grand National announce changes to start position and fences following two fatalities in 2012 .

"(CNN)  -- The events of a single afternoon when she was 13 years old have haunted Samantha Geimer her entire life. A famous movie director allegedly gave her champagne and had sex with her. Samantha Geimer appears in the HBO documentary ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired."" She is 45 now, and wishes the whole matter would just go away. The arrest of Roman Polanski in Switzerland over the weekend makes that highly unlikely. Geimer is back in the news in connection with the infamous 1977 California sex case, whether she likes it or not. It should have ended three decades ago, when Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. He would have been given credit for time served while undergoing an evaluation and placed on probation. But Polanski fled the country before sentencing, fearing the judge would back out of the plea bargain and sentence him to prison. Polanski has filed an appeal against his extradition, Swiss authorities said. They said they would act on the case within weeks. Geimer, who lives in Hawaii with her husband and three children, will not be commenting until Polanski's legal situation in Switzerland is clarified, her lawyer told CNN. But in past interviews she made it clear that a plea bargain intended to spare her pain as a teenager continues to cause her grief as an adult. Once an aspiring actress, Geimer has said she long ago got over what Polanski did to her. She sued him, and a settlement was reached out of court. But the media, prosecutors and the courts in Los Angeles, California, continue to torment her, she has said.  Watch what Geimer said in a HBO documentary » . Every time the case resurfaces her wounds reopen. She most recently spoke in January, as attempts to resolve the case once again failed. She filed court papers asking a Los Angeles judge to dismiss the charges against the Oscar-winning director. Negotiations ended when the judge insisted that Polanski come to court for a hearing. Prosecutors said he would be subject to arrest on the fugitive warrant the minute he stepped off the plane. He stayed away.  Watch how Polanski might face extradition » . ""Every time this case is brought to the attention of the court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others,"" Geimer wrote in her affidavit to the court. ""That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case."" Geimer was particularly upset when prosecutors filed a fresh version of the entire 1977 grand jury transcript, replete with all the lurid details. ""True as they may be, the continued publication of those details cause harm to me,"" she wrote in January. ""I have become a victim of the actions of the district attorney."" ""This is an issue between Mr. Polanski and the court,"" said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. ""All I can say is that the warrant for Mr. Polanski's arrest was issued by the Superior Court of Los Angeles in 1978 because Polanski fled the jurisdiction. The court issued a warrant for his arrest that is valid to this day.""  Watch what's next for Polanski . The case began March 10, 1977, when the girl, then known as Samantha Gailey, agreed to be photographed by Polanski, according to court records. He told her mother he was on assignment for French Vogue. They spent the afternoon shooting and, as the light began to fade, made their way to the hot tub at actor Jack Nicholson's house on Mulholland Drive. There, she told investigators, Polanski gave her champagne and part of a Quaalude and had sex with her. She said she felt disoriented and disgusted by his overtures and repeatedly told him ""no."" She faked an asthma attack and begged him to take her home. She said she cried in his car afterward. She spoke with People magazine in 1997. After her mother went to police, ""all hell broke loose,"" Geimer said. The European media compared her to Lolita, the young seductress in fiction. ""The fallout was worse than what had happened that night,"" she told People. ""It was on the evening news every night. Reporters and photographers came to my school and put my picture in a European tabloid with the caption Little Lolita. They were all saying, 'Poor Roman Polanski, entrapped by a 13-year-old temptress.' I had a good friend who came from a good Catholic family, and her father wouldn't let her come to my house anymore."" Against that backdrop, the plea deal was struck. Afterward, Geimer shut down emotionally and rebelled, she told People on the 20th anniversary of the crime. ""I was this sweet 13-year-old girl, and then all of a sudden I turned into this pissed-off 14-year-old,' Geimer said. I was mad at my attorney; I was mad at my mom. I never blamed her for what happened, but I was mad that she had called the police and that we had to go through this ordeal. Now I realize she went through hell trying to handle things as best she could."" Geimer dropped out of school, got pregnant at 18 and married at 19. She divorced and moved with her family to Hawaii. She later married a carpenter, with whom she had two more children. In 2003, when Polanski was up for an Oscar for the Holocaust drama ""The Pianist,"" Geimer broke her silence again, saying he should be able to attend the Academy Awards ceremony. She spoke to CNN's Larry King and wrote an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times urging people to ""judge the movie, not the man."" She told King she feels nothing for Polanski. ""He's just a stranger to me. I met him twice, three times. ... His life really has nothing to do with my life."" She said she was happy when he left the country because his departure eased the intense public scrutiny. ""Looking back, there can be no question that he did something awful. It was a terrible thing to do to a young girl,"" she wrote in her Los Angeles Times piece. ""And honestly, the publicity surrounding it was so traumatic that what he did to me seemed to pale in comparison."" She continued,""People don't understand that the judge went back on his word. They don't know how unfairly we were all treated by the press. Talk about feeling violated! The media made that year a living hell and I've been trying to put it behind me ever since."" She concluded: ""The one thing that bothers me is that what happened to me in 1977 happens to girls every day, yet people are interested in me because Mr. Polanski is a celebrity."" She added that other young victims need that attention more than she does.","1977 sex case involving Roman Polanski reopens old wounds for victim .

"(CNN) -- This week, we hosted a renowned expert in HIV/AIDS care currently practicing at a hospital known for serving the poor and vulnerable in New York. It was her impression that there has been a dramatic decline in the number of hospitalized patients living with HIV. Presently, in fact, the hospital is considering closing the service that cares exclusively for these individuals because of the small number of admissions. Those of us involved in the care of individuals with HIV in Atlanta were amazed. At Grady Hospital and the Ponce de Leon Center, which is our outpatient HIV/AIDS clinic, we remain busy seeing newly diagnosed individuals with AIDS, particularly presenting with late-stage disease and afflicted by the classic infections and cancers so common 30 years ago, when HIV was first described. This month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a moving address at the National Institute of Health calling for an AIDS-free generation, and the theme of World AIDS Day on December 1 was ""Getting to Zero."" Recently released data have shown a dramatic 96% reduction in transmission of the HIV virus between individuals when the infected partner is on antiretroviral therapy, leading to the concept of ""treatment as prevention."" Treatment regimens are simpler: Active medication regimens once exceeded 20 pills daily, yet now a single pill once a day can control the virus. Nearly three dozen medications have been developed and are effective at decreasing mortality and improving quality of life. Mathematical estimates suggest that an individual diagnosed with HIV infection today, while still healthy, can live as long as an uninfected individual. However, the fight is far from over. Although enthusiasm remains high, an effective vaccine is still out of reach. In the absence of a cure, lifelong treatment is required. But perhaps an even more disturbing question remains: Why do our patients in Atlanta resemble those who we saw on the medical wards in the early 1990s or see now in resource-limited settings, moreso than outpatients treated in New York today? Despite tremendous progress, HIV/AIDS infections in the Southeast continue to rise. Nearly 50% of all AIDS cases annually are reported from Southern states. Among adults aged 20-24 (the fastest-growing age group to become infected), Georgia has 81.3 individuals with HIV infection per 100,000 population, compared with 58.6 per 100,000 in New York. Several important studies have documented the key risk factors associated with transmission of HIV, and all of them highlight social disparities. In the South, these disparities appear to be the most severe. According to the United Health Foundation's health rankings, the region ranks lowest in the nation in ""overall health."" Structural and socioeconomic factors play a significant role. Poverty, education and literacy, access to health care, unemployment, homelessness and food insecurity all contribute to poorer health outcomes. A recent study that examined outcomes in patients identified with early HIV infection found that a risk factor for development of AIDS was residence in the South. Furthermore, resources are scarcer for patients in the South. For example, federal support is based on the number of cumulative cases of patients with HIV or AIDS rather than the development of new cases, penalizing states with later epidemics (like the South) and those whose policies did not support early reporting of cases of HIV. Medicaid income eligibility is based on individual state policy. In the South, the income cutoff for eligibility is lower on average than elsewhere and is a fraction of the federal poverty level, leaving many without the ability to access this medical help. State health departments are often poorly funded or organized and do not have the same strong infrastructure and reporting capabilities that have been highly successful in Washington, New York and San Francisco. AIDS drug assistance programs in the South are underfunded, limiting access to life-saving medications for patients. In Georgia, which has the second-longest wait list in the country, patients may be less able to access medications for life-threatening AIDS complications than those in the developing world. Americans often turn a blind eye to the problem of AIDS in the United States. The message has been that the epidemic is nearly over. Even middle-class residents in Atlanta are unaware of the scope of the problem in their own city. There is denial that such striking health disparities can exist in one of the richest nations in the world. This disenfranchised population does not have the same political voice that the organized gay community had in the early days of the epidemic, when FDA drug approval policies were adjusted to help more patients get access to medications faster. Our patients feel stigmatized and are afraid to be seen entering the building where our clinic is located. Yet globally, the devastation from the disease receives attention not bestowed on the epidemic located a few blocks away. We are 30 years into this epidemic. How will we reflect upon the next 30 years? Will we say that we halted this disease from eliminating an entire generation in Africa? Will we remind ourselves of how the subcontinent of India was brought to the brink of disaster, only to be diverted by a worldwide effort to prevent and treat infections? Or will the already-devastated inner-city neighborhoods and poor rural communities across the United States sink into greater despair? Will we bear the guilt for so many lost lives that could have been saved? In our opinion, both missions must be addressed, not one at the expense of the other. If an AIDS-free generation is to be realized, then we must not forget the disease within our own borders. Can we watch our neighbors suffer when the medical knowledge exists to change their future? Facing this challenge is no small feat. There are signs of hope. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has initiated the Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Planning Project for 12 municipalities, including Atlanta and Miami, for efforts to reduce HIV infections, link patients to care and reduce disparities. Yet this is only a beginning. Basic issues such as poverty, education, housing and safety need to be addressed. State and federal lawmakers must understand that basic health care is a requirement and will require money. One of our patients is a 33-year-old mother infected with HIV. She has taken her medications faithfully since her diagnosis and has been back at work for several years. She wants to raise her children to be happy, healthy and productive members of society. Her work insurance policy recently changed. Now her insurance will cover only one prescription per month (maximum $200). Her regimen requires three medications, which exceed $1,500 a month. State support and prescription assistance programs are restricted to those without insurance. She makes $1,800 a month, which she must use to pay rent and utilities, and feed and clothe her children. She can no longer afford the medications that keep her alive and give her children a mother. This is a tragedy that we should not be willing to tolerate in a society that values social justice and human rights. Take action now by encouraging your congressional representatives and political leaders to keep their promise on AIDS, increasing awareness in your own community, volunteering and/or giving to charities that support such efforts and sharing words of solidarity and compassion with those people most affected by this disease.

"(CNN) -- Authorities arrested the governor of the Central Bank of Kosovo on Friday after searching his house and office as part of a corruption investigation, the European Union Rule of Law Mission said in statement. A prosecutor authorized the arrest of Hashim Rexhepi after the search, which the statement said was connected with an investigation into allegations of abusing official position or authority, accepting bribes, tax evasion, trading in influence and money laundering. In addition to Rexhepi's home and the bank, police also searched a private company and the homes of three other suspects, the statement said. It did not provide further details about the allegations. Pieter Feith, the European Union's special representative in Kosovo, has said corruption is a significant problem there. ""The major obstacles to desperately needed foreign investment are the interlinked issues of weak governance, widespread corruption and the breaches in rule-of-law,"" Feith said during prepared remarks before a European Parliament committee in June. On Thursday, the International Court of Justice ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in February 2008 was legal. The Central Bank of Kosovo was established in June 2008. Serbia maintains Kosovo's move for independence was illegal and that it remains a part of the Serbian republic.","Officials say Hashim Rexhepi was arrested after investigators searched his home .

"(CNN) -- A teenager who only picked up sailing to keep out of mischief while her mother worked at a yacht club has become a sporting success story in Mozambique. Maria Mabjaia, 14, won the bronze medal in the women's laser radial sailing event at the All-Africa Games last year, and was subsequently named Sports Person of the Year at her country's sports awards. Her rapid success has seen her travel as far away as Australia and New Zealand to sail in tournaments -- a far cry from the humble village of Maracuene Bolaza, from which Maria regularly makes the 40km trip to train at the Maputo Marine Club. Despite being blessed with thousands of kilometers of coastline, sailing is not a common pastime in Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony is south east Africa. Although she loves the sea, it is likely Maria would never have learned to sail were it not for the fact her mother, also named Maria, worked at the yacht club.

""I did not expect anything -- what I intended to do was keep her away from mischief. Thank God she got to where she is."" Maria's specialty is sailing Optimists -- small yachts typically used by young people to learn to sail. She picked up the skill so quickly due to her dedication to training, she said -- a disciplined approach enforced by her mother. ""She does not let me miss practice,"" said Maria. ""If you do not miss practice, those who are experienced miss practice and get weaker."" Decio Muianga, one of the club's directors, said Maria had become a national cause celebre following her unexpected success at September's All-Africa Games, held in Mozambique. ""Everyone reacted -- everyone was surprised. She was just 13 years old. No one was expecting a girl coming from a poor background to get a medal,"" he said. ""Some of the sailors had been competing for five years, and Maria only had a year and half of training, and she managed to get to the medals. This was the surprise of the All-Africa Games."" Watch also: Maputo's changing skyline . Her composure under pressure had played a large part in her success, he said. ""Maria doesn't feel the pressure when she has to do something,"" he said. ""The other kids felt the pressure because there were another 13 countries racing for the medal."" Muianga said the club's membership used to be mostly made up of foreigners -- diplomats and development workers -- but it had been actively pursuing an outreach program to engage more young people in sailing. While many of the new recruits came from disadvantaged backgrounds, the club would cover the fees of the most promising, in the hope they would act as ambassadors for sailing. Maria's rapid success would go a long way to attracting other young Mozambicans to the sport, he said. ""For the normal citizens of Maputo, when they look to this club, they always think this is a fancy club,"" he said. ""Normally sailing clubs are like golf clubs, they're for rich people. But we're slowly changing this perception.""","Maria Mabjaia's bronze sailing medal was one of the surprises of the All-Africa Games .

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide bomber killed at least 23 people and injured more than 58 others after detonating an explosive outside a court in Lahore on Thursday, police said. A rescuer helps an injured man following a suicide bomb attack in Lahore. The exact number of casualties varied, but state-run news agency the Associated Press of Pakistan said 22 police officers and one passerby were killed. Reports of another explosion triggered a dash toward a supposed second blast site, but those reports proved unfounded, said Aftab Cheema, senior superintendent of Lahore police. The suicide blast occurred in the city's commercial district, moments before lawyers were set to begin a rally outside the high court in the eastern Pakistani city to protest the rule of President Pervez Musharraf. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Caretaker Prime Minister Mohammadmian Soomro said in a statement that those who committed this ""cowardly act"" were ""neither believer of any religion nor of any human ethics."" Police said about 100 uniformed and plainclothes officers were at the scene ahead of the rally when the bomb went off about 11:45 a.m. Pakistan time (6:45 a.m. GMT). The bomber was approaching a police barrier when officers stopped him, said Cheema, and the man then blew himself up. Ahsan Bhoon, president of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, said lawyers had just completed a meeting and were headed out of the courthouse to participate in the rally when he heard the blast. Bhoon said he saw bodies scattered everywhere. At least 15 of them were lifeless. A second lawyer, Khurram Khosa, said he began picking up bodies of the dead and noticed all but one of them clad in the green uniform of police officers. Many of the wounded were taken to Mayo Hospital in Lahore, said medical superintendent Fayyaz Ahmad Ranjha. Two remained in critical condition but the rest were likely to survive, Ranjha said. Footage from the scene painted a chaotic picture, with baton-wielding police working to beat back a crowd that was trying to get a closer look at a burned-out white vehicle. Officers cordoned off the area, while rescue workers carrying stretchers with wounded victims sidestepped shards of glass that littered the street from broken car windows. ""Lahore is typically a calm city,"" local journalist Todd Baer said. ""This is one of the few places in Pakistan that did not have rioting (after the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto). So people here are very tense right now."" In recent months, Pakistan has been besieged by a wave of suicide attacks that has claimed several hundred lives. The blast comes a day before the start of the month of Muharram, a holy period of mourning, when religious tension are high. It also follows the death of Bhutto, who was killed at a rally in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, on December. 27. While the cause of her death is still unclear, a bomber blew himself up near her limousine and videotape showed a gunman present. Lawyers in Lahore have been holding rallies every Thursday to protest the government's crackdown on the judiciary and imprisonment of lawyers and judges across the country. Meanwhile, Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party said it had written to the Pakistan government urging it to request an independent United Nations inquiry, The Associated Press reported on Thursday. The PPP warned that if the government failed to do so within 48 hours, the party would approach the U.N. directly.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- As a reward for information rose to $85,000 Wednesday, the president of the police union in Seattle, Washington, said no one in the city is safe while the killer of an officer is on the loose. ""The citizens are outraged,"" Police Guild President Richard O'Neill said in an interview with CNN affiliate KIRO. ""This does not happen in Seattle."" Law enforcement officials are vowing to catch whoever is responsible for fatally shooting Officer Timothy Brenton and injuring a student officer as they sat in a parked patrol car. Brenton, 39, a field training officer, was reviewing details of a traffic stop with student officer Brit Sweeney Saturday night when a vehicle rolled up next to the squad car shortly after 10 p.m., authorities said . People inside the vehicle fired several shots into the squad car, killing Brenton and wounding Sweeney, according to police. According to transcripts released Tuesday, Sweeney called in reporting ""shots fired."" She sobbed, then a few seconds later said, ""My partner is dead."" A shot grazed Sweeney, tearing through her uniform and protective vest, Police Chief John Diaz said at a news conference Sunday. She fired at the attackers' vehicle, but police didn't know whether any of her bullets struck it, Assistant Chief Jim Pugel said. Pugel called the attack an ""assassination,"" but said there had not been a threat made against Brenton. The attackers' car was a white, light blue or silver subcompact or compact vehicle, Pugel said. Department spokesman Mark Jamieson said police are reviewing dashboard camera video from patrol cars that were nearby. ""We don't have a suspect's car [identified]. We have a general description of a car that was in the vicinity when this crime occurred,"" Jamieson said. The shooting was the first intentional homicide of a city police officer since 1994, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said. Nickels described the shooting as ""cold-blooded."" ""We will not rest until the assailant is brought to justice,"" Nickels said at Sunday's news conference. Crime Stoppers boosted its reward to $85,000 for tips leading to an arrest and conviction in the case, Deputy Chief Nick Metz said. Assistant Chief Pugel read a handwritten letter from Brenton's Family to CNN affiliate KING: ""We know that Tim would be honored and humbled by the limitless support that has been provided at this difficult time. We sincerely thank you for the generous emotional support, thoughts, and prayers."" Brenton was married with two children, 11 and 8, Metz said. ""The family is obviously extremely devastated,"" Metz said. ""The family, obviously at the beginning, when he left for work, certainly didn't anticipate that we were going to come knocking on their door."" Metz told KING, ""For a lot of our officers, this is the first time they've had to deal with one of their own being killed in the line of duty like this.""

"PRISTINA, Kosovo (CNN)   -- Fireworks lit the skies and crowds filled the streets of Kosovo's capital Sunday after the territory's parliament declared independence from Serbia, a move backed by many Western governments, but which Serbia and Russia bitterly oppose. Fireworks light up the night sky in Pristina, Kosovo, as thousands celebrate independence. ""The day has come,"" Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, a former separatist guerrilla leader, told his parliament. ""From this day onwards, Kosovo is proud, independent and free."" The province has been under U.N. administration and patrolled by NATO troops since a 1999 bombing campaign that halted a Serb-led campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. Thousands of people swarmed Pristina's streets ahead of Sunday's parliamentary declaration, singing, dancing and holding signs in freezing wind after the vote was announced. But Serbs consider the territory the cradle of their civilization, and protesters clashed with police outside the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade as the declaration was issued. Serbia said it will not oppose independence with violence, but Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said his country will never accept the establishment of a ""false country"" on its territory. ""Anything and everything that we couldn't achieve today will be obtained by new generations of Serbian people in the future,"" Kostunica said Sunday in a televised address. ""Citizens of Serbia, we have to come together and show the whole world that we do not acknowledge the creation of a false state in our territory. The violence that has been perpetrated upon Serbia is very obvious."" About 100,000 Serbs still live in Kosovo, making up about 5 percent of the population, and Kostunica said Serbs have been killed or lost their land in the eight-plus years the country has been under international rule. But Fatmir Sejdiu, the nascent republic's president, pledged to create a nation ""where all citizens of all ethnicities feel appreciated."" ""Today is probably a day of trepidation for some of you, but your property and your rights will be respected in the future,"" he said. Former U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who led the NATO alliance during the 1999 conflict, said ""There was no way beyond moving to this step."" But he urged the international community to work with Serbia to keep the country moving toward integration with Europe and ""to help them understand their situation."" ""I'm very sad that the Serbs are unable to understand what's happened,"" Clark told CNN. ""But the magnitude of Serb repression of the Albanian majority there and the violence that accompanied the ethnic cleansing in 1998 and 1999 was just so overwhelming that I think the Serb people have to understand that the Albanians themselves have to have this separation."" Thaci said Kosovo's declaration of independence ""marks the end of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia,"" which triggered years of bloodshed across the Balkans. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown against ethnic Albanian insurgents led by Thaci in 1998 and refused to yield to Western pressure to halt the campaign. When NATO responded by launching airstrikes against Serbia and Montenegro, the last remaining Yugoslav republics, Yugoslav troops drove hundreds of thousands of Kosovars out of the region and killed thousands more. Milosevic died in 2005 while awaiting trial for war crimes before a U.N. tribunal in The Hague. The United States and leading European nations, including France, Britain and Germany, have supported Kosovo's move toward independence. But Russia, the Serbs' historical ally, has opposed independence, fearing it would incite other separatist movements in its backyard. The U.N. Security Council held emergency talks on the issue Sunday afternoon at Russia's request. Moscow's U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, told reporters that the declaration violates the U.N. resolution that placed Kosovo under international administration at the end of the conflict. ""Our position is that this declaration should be disregarded by the international community,"" as well as by the head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, Churkin said. He said the council would meet again Monday, with Serbian President Boris Tadic expected to address the session. But no country supported the Russian call for the U.N. to declare Sunday's declaration ""null and void,"" said Sir John Sawers, the British ambassador to the world body. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged all parties ""to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, incite violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region."" The European Union decided Saturday to launch a mission of about 2,000 police and judicial officers to replace the U.N. mission that has controlled the province since 1999. And U.S. State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States had ""noted"" that Kosovo had declared its independence and was reviewing the issue. Earlier Sunday, President Bush said Kosovo's status must be resolved before the Balkans can become stable. ""We are heartened by the fact that the Kosovo government has clearly proclaimed its willingness and its desire to support Serbian rights in Kosovo,"" Bush told reporters in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. The United States and many of its European allies support a plan negotiated by former Finnish President Maarti Ahtisaari that would give Kosovo limited statehood under international supervision. But Russia, which has fought two wars against separatist rebels in its southwestern republic of Chechnya, said U.S. and European support for Kosovo's independence could lead to an ""uncontrollable crisis"" in the Balkans. In a statement, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged ""everybody to act calmly and in a responsible way. I am convinced that the Kosovar leaders will be up to their responsibilities in this crucial moment."" Solana said EU foreign ministers would meet Monday to consider the issue.

"(CNN) -- Former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic was Thursday found not guilty of war crimes  and crimes against humanity in Kosovo by a U.N. tribunal. Milan Milutinovic had was cleared of war crimes in Kosovo. Five other former high-ranking Serb officials -- Nikola Sainovic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, Nebojsa Pavkovic, Vladimir Lazarevic and Sreten Lukic -- were found guilty on all or some of the same charges. The judgment was the first by The Hague, Netherlands-based tribunal for crimes by the former Yugoslav and Serbian forces during a military campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians in 1999. Their crimes took place during a Serb-led military campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population during the first six months of 1999 before a NATO bombing campaign forced a halt to the operation. Sainovic, former Yugoslav deputy prime minister and Pavkovic, a former Yugoslav army general were each sentenced to 22 years in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Watch Milutinovic receive not guilty verdict » . Lazarevic, another ex-general and Ojdanic, who was chief of general staff, were each sentenced to 15 years on charges of forced deportation of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had heard during the two year tribunal how military forces of the former Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia waged a campaign of terror against Kosovo Albanians. The court said Milutinovic didn't have ""direct individual control"" over the army and that ""in practice"" then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ""exercised actual command authority"" over the army during the NATO campaign. Milosevic eventually surrendered to Serbian authorities in 2001 and had been extradited to The Hague, where he was on trial between 2002 and 2006 for the alleged offences in Kosovo and for alleged crimes in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He died from natural causes in March 2006 before the trial ended and before a judgment was made. He was the first sitting head of state to be charged for war crimes when he was indicted in 1999. Kosovo's government declared its independence from Serbia in February 2008 after being administered by the United Nations since 1999. The U.S., Britain and France have recognized Kosovo's independence, but China and Russia joined Serbia in opposing the move.","U.N. tribunal clears ex-Serb President Milan Milutinovic of war crimes .

"(CNN)  -- A goalkeeper for the German national soccer team apparently killed himself by stepping in front of a train, just months after he and his wife adopted a daughter, police said Wednesday. Robert Enke, 32, was captain of the German top-division soccer club Hannover 96 and had played in eight games for his national team. He was widely expected to be the German team's keeper in the 2010 World Cup. ""Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,"" Hannover 96 spokesman Stefan Wittke said. Enke died about 6:25 p.m. Tuesday. His wife Teresa said he left a suicide note. She said her husband had been battling depression for six years but had kept his condition from the public. ""I tried to be there for him, said that football is not everything. There are many beautiful things in life. It is not hopeless,"" she said. The Enkes' daughter Lara died in 2006 from a heart condition at age 2. The couple adopted a daughter, Leila, earlier this year. She is 18 months old. Enke feared that if his depression was made public, he might lose Leila, his widow said. ""We had Lara; we have Leila. I always wanted to help him to get through it. He didn't want it to come out because of fear. He was scared of losing Leila,"" she told reporters. The German national team had an exhibition game scheduled Saturday against Chile, but the team announced it was canceling the match. Theo Zwanziger, president of the German soccer federation, said players ""needed time to come to terms with the death of Enke."" Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup, the federation said. ""The leadership of the German national team never had any doubt that he was important for the team both as a goalkeeper and as a human being,"" a statement said. Those who knew him were stunned by news of his death. ""We are in a state of shock,"" team manager Oliver Bierhoff  said in a statement. ""It is beyond words."" Martin Kind, chairman of Hannover 96, said, ""It is a total catastrophe. I am finding it hard to understand. All I can say for sure is that it had nothing to do with football."" Fellow players said they believed Enke had been suffering depression, Kind said. Have you lost a loved one to suicide? Share your memories with CNN iReport . ""He was unstable,"" he said, ""but he kept it under wraps."" Hundreds of fans and former teammates gathered to lay flowers, light candles and sign a book of condolences outside Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion. The team's official Web site has been converted into a single-page memorial. Enke missed Germany's last four matches because of a bacterial infection, but he had recently returned to action with Hannover. Soccer commentator and journalist Rafael Honigstein said Enke was on course to be picked as the No. 1 choice for the team. ""It's been well documented that he had a tough time,"" Honigstein said.

"(CNN) -- Two disgruntled Louisiana newlyweds have called for the dismissal of a justice of the peace who refused to marry the interracial couple, and have even been joined in their fight by the governor, who said the official's license should be revoked. The removal of embattled Justice of the Peace Keith Bardwell lies with the Louisiana Supreme Court. But unseating a Louisiana justice of the peace isn't easy. Beth and Terence McKay -- who are now married -- stepped into the national spotlight when Keith Bardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused them a license. Bardwell told Hammond's Daily Star last week that he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" Bardwell told the newspaper. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Despite a national uproar and a call by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for him to lose his license, Bardwell, 56, said he has no regrets. ""It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,"" he told CNN affiliate WAFB on Saturday. A state statute says justices of the peace may perform marriage ceremonies, but it does not require such officials to do so, Tammi Arender, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana attorney general, told CNN on Monday. To push for Bardwell's removal, the McKays must look to the Louisiana Supreme Court. Justices of the peace in Louisiana are elected, but the state's high court has jurisdiction over whether they can keep their jobs, Louisiana Supreme Court spokeswoman Valerie Willard said. The Judiciary Commission, a judicial body independent of the Supreme Court, has the power to review a case and make recommendations to the high court. After receiving a complaint, the Judiciary Commission would determine whether the grievance was frivolous. Anyone can file a complaint; no attorney is needed, Willard said, though Beth McKay said she has retained one. The commission would proceed with an investigation if there were allegations of ethical misconduct, or arguments that the justice of the peace was in violation of professional responsibility, Willard said. An investigation could take months or even a year, Willard said. And with closed-door hearings and records of investigations kept confidential, it's hard to tell how long the average investigation lasts. A lawyer from the Office of the Special Counsel, a branch of the commission, would prosecute the elected official, who would have an opportunity to defend himself. During the investigation, if the prosecutor could show the official was hindering the fair and due implementation of his job, the commission could suggest that the Louisiana Supreme Court enact a temporary suspension with pay. Barring such an incident, the justice of the peace could continue to oversee cases throughout the commission's confidential investigation. If the nine-member commission, by majority decision, decided the official acted unethically, it would recommend sanctions to the court. Those recommendations and the commission's findings would be public. Willard could not say whether Bardwell would be brought to the commission or what its decision would be. ""It's up to the judges to interpret the law,"" she said. If Bardwell were brought before the commission and it decided against him, recommended sanctions could include a public censure, suspension with or without pay, or removal. The court, after reviewing the commission's findings, could follow the commission's suggestions or opt for stronger or weaker sanctions. Or the seven-member court could decide the justice of the peace did not behave unethically, which would allow him to keep his job, Willard said.","State statute doesn't require justices of peace to perform marriage ceremonies .

"(CNN) -- Hours after getting laid off, a 36-year-old Minneapolis man returned to his former workplace and opened fire, killing five, including a business owner recently honored at the White House, before turning his gun on himself. Minneapolis police and city officials described Friday what happened over the span of 10 or 15 minutes the previous afternoon, when the man walked through the loading dock of Accent Signage Systems and started shooting. ""It was a hellish time,"" police Chief Timothy Dolan said. The dead include Reuven Rahamim, the company's founder and president of a fast-growing company that specializes in interior signs that help the visually impaired. The Israeli-born Rahamim ""came to this country to live the American dream, and he did,"" said Mayor R.T. Rybak. But beyond growing his business, the 61-year-old also had ""an enormously important part of this community,"" active on several task forces and groups. ""He's an example of somebody who climbed the ladder of success and didn't pull (the ladder) up but tried every way possible to get other people up on that rung, too,"" Rybak said. ""We owe a tremendous debt to Reuven."" According to the mayor, civic leaders volunteered Rahamim's name when the White House asked for examples of ""good, small, local businesses doing exporting."" The Minnesota resident went to the White House in March, and the White House called Friday to offer its condolences over Rahamim's death, Rybak said. A 29-year UPS employee, Keith Basinski, was shot dead on the loading dock, according to Jill Schubert, the president of the delivery company's Northern Plains district. Dolan said Basinski, 50, was simply in the ""wrong place, wrong time."" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner identified all of the victims, including Rahamim and Basinski, on Friday night. They include Jacob Beneke, 34; Ronald Edberg, 58; and Rami Cooks, 62. Cooks is the only one of the victims who succumbed to his injuries at a local hospital -- the others died at the scene -- according to the medical examiner. The police chief said the shooter is believed to be Andrew Engeldinger. Dolan said the 36-year-old was fired Thursday morning and then came to Accent in the city's Bryn Mawr neighborhood about 4:25 p.m. and ""immediately started shooting"" but spared some, especially as he moved through the office building. Officers arrived within minutes and went into the complex, quickly finding casualties, the police chief said. No more shots were fired after they arrived. They found Engeldinger in the basement, where he had committed suicide, according to the medical examiner. ""He was in a location where there was one casing on the floor, and he was dead,"" Dolan said Friday afternoon. Engeldinger's mother and father read a brief statement Friday outside their home in nearby Richfield. ""Our son struggled for years with mental illness,"" the parents said after offering their condolences to the shooting victims. ""In the last few years, he no longer had contact with us. This is not an excuse for his actions but, sadly, may be a partial explanation."" A 9 mm semiautomatic Glock pistol was used in the shooting, according to Dolan. Police also searched Engeldinger's Minneapolis apartment and found another handgun ""and packaging for 10,000 rounds of ammunition,"" the chief added. Two men remained hospitalized Friday, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, according Minneapolis police spokesman Sgt. Steven McCarty. The officers who responded have been put on leave, which the chief said can happen ""if they experience something traumatic."" Rybak said officials will work to make sure that Accent Signage Systems remains in business after its founder's violent death. Since being founded in Rahamim's basement in 1984, Accent has steadily grown -- including developing a patent for technology that imprints Braille on things like hotel room numbers and restroom signs -- and now employs 30 people and earns $5 million to $10 million each year, CNN affiliate KARE reported. ""(Accent employees) had a horrible day that is beyond what anybody should have to have, but we owe it to them to make sure that they have many more productive days at work,"" Rybak said. ""And we will be focused on that as we move forward.""","Police say a 36-year-old man was laid off and returned to former workplace hours later .

Chin is poised to win election next month as the first Chinese-American on the New York City Council to represent New York's Chinatown, one of the largest concentrations of Chinese outside of mainland China. She ousted a two-term incumbent in September's Democratic primary and will be on the ballot November 3 in a district that overwhelmingly favors Democrats. If elected, she also will be the first Asian-American woman to join the 51-member body responsible for governing the country's largest and most diverse urban area. Her likely win is another milestone in the political rise of a rapidly growing Asian-American community. For Chin, a 56-year-old Hong Kong immigrant, the long road to political victory has not been easy. As she closes in on a probable November victory, though, she's confident the lessons learned along the way will serve her -- and her constituents -- well. Chin's American story began almost a half century ago, during the Kennedy administration. Her father, seeking new opportunities, left China for Colombia. A few months later, he became an undocumented U.S. worker, scratching out a living as a waiter in the Bronx section of New York. When the family's immigration papers came through in 1963, he borrowed money to bring them to America. Margaret, the third of five children, remembers her dad's exhaustion and pain after spending long days on his feet. She also remembers the skills he perfected preparing the restaurant's dim sum, a traditional Chinese morning meal. ""He made the best shrimp dumplings,"" she recalled in a recent CNN interview. ""He had the technique down pat on how to make the skin so thin. They were wonderful."" Chin's father died a long time ago, but his decision to pursue the American dream -- starting as an undocumented immigrant -- left a lasting impression on his only daughter. Today, immigration reform is one of her passions. ""People are here because of the opportunities America has to offer,"" she said. ""They work hard. They struggle. We need to fix our immigration system so more people can help build the country."" Chin is campaigning on a range of traditional lunch-bucket issues -- affordable housing, job creation, and better care for senior citizens. Repairing the city's aging infrastructure is also a priority in a sprawling Manhattan district that encompasses Chinatown as well as Wall Street, Soho, the Lower East Side, Tribeca, and Battery Park City. More than four in 10 people in the district are Chinese-American, according to campaign spokesman Jake Itzkowitz. The bulk of those residents -- including Chin's mother, a retired garment worker -- live in rapidly gentrifying Chinatown. They and other Asian-Americans make up the fastest-growing minority group in New York City. ""This City Council district was drawn in the early 1990s in part to enable Chinatown residents to elect a candidate of choice,"" noted Margaret Fung, head of New York's Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. ""Eighteen years later, an Asian-American has finally been chosen. It's a significant step forward for Asian-American political representation."" Chin is one of three Asian-Americans now positioned to win seats on the City Council, Fung noted. John Liu, the Democratic nominee for comptroller, is poised to become the first Asian-American to win a citywide office. In the past decade, the total nationwide population of Asians and Pacific Islanders jumped to almost 13 million, a nearly 50 percent increase since 1990, according to the Asian American Action Fund. While Asian-Americans make up roughly 4 percent of the nation's population, they have been slow to win office on the national or state level. They currently hold only 1 percent of the seats in Congress, the Action Fund notes. In politically powerful California, according to the Action Fund, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders account for well over 10 percent of the population, but hold less than 8 percent of the seats in the state legislature. Chin draws a parallel between the transformation of New York's Chinatown, home to a growing number of young professionals and a vibrant commercial hub, and the gradual political maturation of the Chinese-American community. One of the reasons Chinatown has not yet had a Chinese-American representative in City Hall, she believes, is because the community did not know how to mobilize effectively. ""A lot of Chinese-Americans simply did not understand how the political process works,"" she said. ""New York is a largely Democratic city, but they didn't know that many elections are basically decided in the Democratic primary. So they didn't register as a member of either political party."" Chin helped lead the fight for local election ballots printed in Chinese in the early 1990s. ""There's often not an accurate Chinese translation for English names, and vice-versa,"" she noted. ""Too many people couldn't understand the ballots. Other people who got the registration process right were still turned away at the polls because election workers couldn't understand their names."" Chin has run three losing Democratic primary campaigns for the City Council -- in 1991, 1993, and 2001. The current campaign is different, she said, partly because of greater mobilization among Chinese-Americans and partly because of her own political education. This time, Chin launched her campaign two years before the primary. She left her job with the advocacy group Asian Americans for Equality so she could run full time. ""I have to credit my husband, Alan, for that,"" she said with a laugh. ""He told me, 'If you want to do it, focus. Quit your job and do it.' It's great to have family support."" Her son Kevin, studying photography in Santa Barbara, California, provides moral support from afar. Chin also stepped up fundraising operations, raising and spending the legal limit of $161,000 in the primary. Her campaign headquarters, located in the ground floor of a Chinatown apartment high rise, is humming most days with five to 10 volunteers. The campaign has one paid staffer. More than 400 people have volunteered to answer phones, stuff envelopes, and knock on doors -- the unglamorous nuts-and-blots work of many campaigns. One factor working in Chin's favor is voter backlash against a recent decision to repeal a two-term limit for City Council members and the mayor. The City Council member Chin defeated in the primary, Alan Gerson, was one of several incumbents ousted largely as a result of that issue. Mayor Michael Bloomberg also backed the repeal, and is now seeking a third term. Chin disapproves. ""Eight years is enough,"" she argued. ""You can do a lot of good in that time. I won't serve more than two terms."" Bloomberg may be popular, but the billionaire businessman's agenda doesn't always sit well with Chin, who remains in many ways a New Deal-style Democrat. ""He needs to be a mayor for everyone. I think he's favoring the more well-to-do,"" she said. ""New York City's working families have lots of needs, and he hasn't always been there for them."" Chin's likely election as the first Chinese-American to represent Chinatown comes amid other historic political developments. Gov. David Paterson is New York's first African-American governor as well as the first legally blind governor in the United States. And President Barack Obama, of course, is the nation's first African-American president. So could there be an Asian-American president one day? ""Sure,"" Chin said, ""but I'd really like to see a woman president. We are long overdue."" Could she be that woman? Absolutely not, she replied with a chuckle. ""The City Council is enough,"" she said. ""It took me a long time to get to this point. And soon it will be time to give someone else a chance.""","Margaret Chin's likely win is a milestone for growing Asian-American community .
Chinatown's community has taken awhile to understand the political process, Chin says .
This is Chin's fourth attempt to win election; this time she quit her job to campaign full time ."

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's government made an emotional plea Wednesday to hundreds of hunger-striking Kurdish prisoners -- some who haven't eaten in more than a month -- to end their protest. Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin made the televised appeal Wednesday during a visit to Sincan prison in the Turkish capital. ""I am telling the prisoners and detainees who are on this action: On the eve of this holiday, for the sake of your own body, your own health, the people who love you and whom you love, stop this action,"" the minister said. The holiday Ergin is referring to is the Islamic ""Feast of the Sacrifice"" or Kurban Bayrami, which will be observed in Turkey starting Thursday. It's the celebration that marks the end of Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. The justice minister said at least 680 prisoners are currently on a hunger strike in prisons across the country, but Turkey's Human Rights Association, which closely follows the country's long-simmering Kurdish conflict, said 715 inmates are striking in 48 prisons. Some of the protesters have been without food for 43 days, and there are fears about their deteriorating condition. ""Their health is in bad condition,"" said Gonul Sonbahar, a member of the Human Rights Association's Prison Commission, in a phone interview with CNN. ""Some of their symptoms include vertigo, trouble walking, violent headaches, bruising on fingers and eyes, nausea, nose bleeds, trouble swallowing water, blood in stool,"" she added. Sonbahar said the protesters had three main demands: the release of imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, the right to Kurdish language education and the use of Kurdish in Turkish courts. Ocalan is one of the founders of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a 30-year guerrilla war against the Turkish state. Though he has been in a Turkish prison on an island in the Marmara Sea since his capture in 1999, PKK fighters have continued their war against the Turkish government. Throughout the long conflict, which has claimed more than 30,000 lives, the PKK has modified its goals from demanding a separate Kurdish state to fighting for the expansion of Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, as well as the release of Ocalan. For decades, the Turkish state discriminated against the Kurds, Turkey's largest ethnic minority, which now makes up roughly 20% of the population. The Kurdish language was banned, and Kurds were long referred to as ""mountain Turks."" During Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10 years in power, the government has made historic outreaches to the long-oppressed population, an effort that included secret talks with PKK leaders in 2005. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, or AKP, also made a number of overtures toward the Kurds, relaxing bans on Kurdish language education, appearing to apologize for past discriminatory policies and launching a state Kurdish-language TV station. But PKK-related violence has spiked recently, reaching death tolls unseen in more than 13 years, according to a report published by the International Crisis Group, a non-profit conflict mediation organization. The ICG argues Turkey's arrest and detention of more than 7,000 Kurdish activists over the past several years has contributed to the radicalization of some. Erdogan ""actually did more for the Kurds than anyone up until now,"" said Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the ICG, in a CNN interview last month. ""(But) when a wave of massive arrests of legitimate Kurdish politicians began, that's when I think young people especially lost hope and the PKK's arguments for the legitimacy of armed struggle became persuasive to them."" In his appearance before journalists at Sincan prison, Ergin tried to draw attention to previous reform efforts. ""There has been progress in Turkey for a long time on expanding democratic rights,"" the justice minister said, adding that the government had made a pledge to try to allow the use of Kurdish language in Turkish courts. Ergin did not address the demand for Ocalan's release. Sonbahar of the Human Rights Association told CNN the hunger-striking prisoners were determined to continue their protest, even if it results in illness or worse. ""This is a perpetual and irrevocable hunger strike,"" she said.","A Turkish human rights group says some of the prisoners haven't eaten in 43 days .

"(CNN) -- A Kentucky census worker who was found dead in September committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide, authorities said Tuesday. The body of William E. Sparkman Jr., 51, was found September 12 near a cemetery in southeastern Kentucky's Clay County. He was wearing only socks. ""A thorough examination of evidence from the scene, to include DNA testing, as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence, resulted in the determination that Mr. Sparkman, alone, handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved,"" Kentucky State Police said. Sparkman's wrists were bound with duct tape, and a rope around his neck was tied to a tree, but his body was touching the ground, authorities said. He had ""Fed"" written on his chest in black ink. However, Sparkman's wrists were loosely bound in front of his body at shoulder width apart, allowing for ""considerable mobility,"" said Kentucky State Police Capt. Lisa Rudzinski. He was also in contact with the ground, ""almost on his knees,"" she said. ""To survive, all Mr. Sparkman had to do was stand up."" Lividity on the body -- marks made as blood stops pumping and settles in areas of the body -- showed that Sparkman died in the same position, Rudzinski said. His glasses were taped to his head, and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth, she said. ""Mr. Sparkman had extremely poor eyesight"" and so would have needed his glasses secured, Rudzinski said. But the most compelling evidence came from the fact that Sparkman had obtained $600,000 in accidental-death insurance, which would not have paid in the event of a suicide, as late as May, she said. In addition, he told a ""credible witness"" of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government. The details were consistent with how Sparkman died and was found, Rudzinski said. The witness did not take action after Sparkman shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through, authorities said. ""It was learned that Mr. Sparkman had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of Clay County,"" Kentucky state police said in a statement. Police believe that Sparkman's primary motive in staging the scene was to ensure that the insurance would be paid, Rudzinski said. His motive for committing suicide or any secondary motives might never be known, she said, as Sparkman left no note. ""We don't know what Mr. Sparkman was thinking or why he ultimately committed this act,"" she said. Autopsy results showed no evidence of any cancer or terminal illness, officials said, although it was reported that Sparkman had previously had lymphoma. Police would not say who the beneficiary of the insurance was. Forensic analysis of the writing on Sparkman's chest showed that he had written it himself, Rudzinski said. Analysts found ink dots, made by writers on completing a letter, at the top of the letters, rather than at the bottom -- as would be expected if someone had made the writing on Sparkman. Despite a search by authorities, the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found. Police do not believe that anyone assisted Sparkman, she said. Sparkman had told the witness, whom police declined to name, that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects, including his laptop computer and other items. Police have not found those items, Rudzinski said. Toxicology tests showed that Sparkman was not drugged or under the influence of any substance, she said. The red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene. DNA testing of the rags and the rope used in creating a ligature on Sparkman's neck, as well as 7 feet of discarded rope discarded near his body, found only Sparkman's DNA, she said. The police investigation is still open, and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks, authorities said. Authorities met with Sparkman's son and told him of their findings before publicly releasing them. ""Our hearts go out to him,"" Rudzinski said. ""He still lost his father at the end of the day."" She would not say whether his son accepted the findings, saying she did not want to speak for the family.","Census worker staged scene to ensure insurance policy would be paid, police say .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- With his visit already bogged down in historical disputes, the pope's message of peace in Gaza was interrupted Monday by an impromptu speaker who fueled the longtime resentment between Palestinians and Israelis. Pope Benedict XVI, left, with Israeli President Shimon Peres at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv Monday. After Pope Benedict XVI, speaking to religious leaders during an interfaith discussion in Jerusalem, called for mutual understanding and cooperation in the tumultuous region, Taysir Tamimi, chief of Muslim Sharia courts in the West Bank and Gaza, commandeered the microphone and began to criticize Israel in Arabic. He was not scheduled to speak at the event at the Notre Dame of Jerusalem Center. The Israeli government condemned Tamimi's remarks, in which he called on Muslims and Christians to work together against Israel. ""It is regrettable that [Tamimi] has abused an interreligious meeting aimed at promoting dialogue and understanding between Christians, Jews and Muslims, in order to incite against Israel,"" a statement from the Foreign Ministry said. In his unscheduled remarks, Tamimi said, ""We struggle together and we suffer together from the injustice of the Israeli occupation and its oppressive practices, and we look forward to freedom and independence."" He also criticized Israel's West Bank separation barrier as the ""racist wall,"" saying it turned the Palestinian territory into ""a giant prison and keeps Muslims and Christians from praying in their churches and mosques."" ""His holiness the pope, I call on you in the name of the one God to condemn these crimes and pressure the Israeli government to stop its aggression against the Palestinian people,"" Tamimi said. It was not clear whether the pope understood Tamimi's comments, and he did not react. Some in the audience clapped but many appeared uncomfortable. The Latin patriarch, Fouad Twal, walked across the stage and tapped Tamimi on the hand as he implored him to stop. Tamimi finished the speech after 10 minutes and sat down. Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov, who oversaw the pontiff's visit to Israel, said Tamimi's words planted ""seeds of division"" between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as between Jews, Muslims and Christians. ""The sheikh's provocation hurt, first and foremost, Pope Benedict XVI, who came to the Holy Land to promote peace and unity between the peoples of the region and all persons of faith,"" Misezhnikov said in a statement. The Rev. Gianni Caputa of Jerusalem's Ratisbonne Monastery, who is involved in the church's interfaith efforts, said ""It was shameful and disgraceful. Sheikh Tamimi betrayed the trust of the people who invited him to this gathering."" The Vatican offered a statement, saying Tamimi's remarks were ""a direct negation"" of the peaceful purpose of the dialogue. ""We hope that such an incident will not damage the mission of the pope aiming at promoting peace and also interreligious dialogue, as he has clearly affirmed in many occasions during this pilgrimage,"" the Vatican said. During the discussion at the Jerusalem Center, the pope encouraged religious leaders to proclaim what their faiths have in common, ""since many are quick to point out the readily apparent differences between religions."" Earlier in the day, Pope Benedict gave a speech at the residence of Israeli President Shimon Peres, urging Israelis and Palestinians to find a ""just resolution"" to their long-running conflict Monday as he arrived in Israel. ""I plead with all those responsible to explore every possible avenue,"" the pope said, ""So that both peoples may live in peace in a homeland of their own, within secure and internationally recognized borders."" He cited the biblical prophet Isaiah on the meaning of ""security"" -- a justification Israel often uses for its actions against Palestinians. ""Security -- 'batah' [in Hebrew] -- arises from trust and refers not just to the absence of threat but also to the sentiment of calmness and confidence,"" the pope said. And while Tamimi's remarks immediately drew outrage in the region, problems plagued the pope's visit even before the pontiff arrived in Jerusalem -- including an Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the location of the press center for the trip. Palestinian officials set up an alternative press center, arguing that the Jerusalem Municipal Building, the site of the official one, was linked to Israel's policy of demolishing Palestinian homes built without permission in East Jerusalem. Both sides claim the neighborhood. Israeli police shut down the alternative press center, according to police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld, on the grounds that the Palestinian Authority was not allowed to host events in Jerusalem. Once in Israel, the pope managed to address another controversy from months before. He made a reference Monday to the Holocaust, an issue that made trouble for the Roman Catholic Church earlier this year when Benedict rehabilitated an excommunicated bishop who had disputed the number of Jews killed in concentration camps during World War II. His excommunication was unrelated to his Holocaust denial. ""It is right and fitting that during my stay in Israel that I will have the opportunity to honor the memory of the 6 million Jewish victims of the Shoah,"" the pope said Monday, using the Hebrew word for the Holocaust. ""And to pray that humanity will never again witness a crime of such magnitude."" The pope said anti-Semitism is ""totally unacceptable"" and pointedly rejected Holocaust denial as he visited Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. He clutched a small cross and bowed his head in front of the eternal flame at the memorial, where he was accompanied by Peres and other dignitaries. Benedict arrived at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport as part of an eight-day trip that takes in places of unequaled religious resonance for the world's 1.1 billion Catholics. It is the first papal visit to some of Christianity's most holy places since Pope John Paul II made the pilgrimage in 2000. His first stop in the region was Jordan, where he called for greater respect for women at a historic Mass in Amman on Sunday. CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","Pope Benedict XVI, on his first visit to the Middle East, visits Israel .

"(CNN) -- The storm that swept last week across the Northeast left indelible memories for many, but also erased some. Limor Garfinkle, whose Staten Island apartment is littered with scraps of paper that represent some of the most important memories of a woman she barely knows, is trying to salvage at least a few of them. The 35-year-old art director for a Midtown ad agency drove Sunday from her home, which is on high ground and did not flood, to the hard-hit South Beach section of the borough to take pictures of Sandy's aftermath. There, she came across Victoria Beckman, a Russian immigrant: Her family's photographs and documents were arrayed on the stone railing leading from the street to her front door. iReport: Drying A Lifetime's Memories . ""I saw she had thousands of pictures,"" Garfinkle said. Many were smeared with mud, others were stained by rust. The woman's house was gutted, she had no heat and she was bereft. ""I said to her, 'Would you like me to take these?'"" Garfinkle recalled. ""She said, 'Yes, please, I have nothing left.' So I just took it."" Sandy survivors face voting -- and another storm . Garfinkle took five plastic garbage bags stuffed full of memorabilia, loaded them into the trunk of her car and drove them back to her home. ""The whole thing was a mess,"" she said. Garfinkle consulted the Internet and set about trying to preserve the treasure that had been entrusted to her. ""It said to wash the pictures with water and just dry them,"" she said. So she emptied the bags and set to work. Many of the pictures predate the introduction of digital photographs. They chronicle weddings and bar mitzvahs and include images of people presumably long dead. Among the pictures were citizenship papers, tax returns and a Russian Army medal. ""It's all over my house and my floor,"" she said. Garfinkle, who grew up in Israel and plans to vote for the first time Tuesday in a U.S. election (""I think Obama, probably. We'll see.""), said she was just trying to help. But Alan Radom, who has restored photographs for about 25 years, said that washing wet photographs may not always achieve that end. ""It's the kind of thing that sometimes can help, but sometimes many old photos have dye in them -- water-soluble dye,"" he said in a telephone interview. Radom, who runs Artisan Photo Restoration in Manhattan, said he is guided by the same maxim doctors follow: First, do no harm. Washing photographs is too risky for him. ""That might work, but I wouldn't take a chance doing that because you might take the whole image off it."" He advises separating any pictures that may adhere to one another and letting them dry. ""Once they're stuck together, then it becomes near impossible to deal with anything,"" he said. ""I've seen 500 pictures dry together. It's basically just a congealed block of paper and glue."" New Jersey lets Sandy victims vote via e-mail . Radom recommends leaving any picture stuck to glass since trying to pull it away can tear it apart. ""Leave it be,"" he said. And any wet pictures should be removed from albums, he said. ""The worst thing you can do is leave them in plastic sleeves and albums."" His personal trove of family pictures survived Sandy in the basement of his home north of the city in Westchester County -- ""raised about 6 feet off the ground."" Tom Sobolik, a professional photographer for more than 35 years in Westchester County, advised putting wet photographs in a print dryer, but said the devices have largely disappeared since the advent of digital photography. ""I don't even know if there is such a thing any more,"" he said. ""My recommendation would be to do as little as possible,"" he said. ""But, if they're ruined without washing them, then you try washing them."" Sobolik, who is launching an online print laboratory called riveredgestudio.com, said some companies, including Kodak, used resin-coated paper -- covered with a thin layer of plastic. Those photographs ""are more likely to wash easier and resist washing better,"" he said. Remembering the victims . Seth Bogdanove, owner of Digital Archiving and Photo Restoration in Manhattan, said washing wet pictures is dangerous. ""I would put them up on a piece of paper or towel or something absorbent and let the water leach out from the bottom and let the air dry the top, because the surface of the photograph is an emulsion -- you get it wet, it gets sticky and it can smear. You can get fingerprints on it. You put anything on top of it, it will stick. So the best thing to do is just put them face up and let them air dry."" Only if they were stuck together, he said, would he ""very gently"" soak them to separate them. He recommends those who want to safeguard their pictures have them digitalized and stored that way. In general, the approach worked, said Garfinkel. ""Some of them, the ink in them didn't hold up very well,"" she said. ""But very few, actually. Most of them are perfect. You know what held up best? Kodak. The ones that were printed the old-fashioned way."" Beckman, who has moved from her home to a relative's, said she was planning to pick up the photographs as soon as they are ready.

"(EW.com) -- For the first time in nine years, NBC has outright won the first week of the broadcast season among adults 18-49. CBS, for the fourth year in a row, was first among total viewers. Both networks are claiming victory, which is normal (though most in the industry believe the network that wins the adult demo has earned the greater glory since advertisers pay more to target younger adults). No matter how you look at it, this is a good week for NBC. The network is up 12 percent from last fall, while others are down. As we pointed out a few weeks ago, NBC seemed like it might have a better story to tell this fall. So far it's true, mainly due to the strength of adding ""The Voice"" to its fall lineup, as well as the strong performance of new drama ""Revolution."" New comedies ""Go On"" and ""New Normal"" have been delivering survivable numbers so far, but ""Animal Practice"" and ""Guys With Kids"" are struggling (not the mention the network's returning Thursday lineup). NBC's biggest show â€” as rivals point out â€” is not an entertainment program, but ""Sunday Night Football,"" with last week's game up 23 percent, so that doesn't hurt either. This is the first week of the season. There's 30-some more to go. And we all know Fox tends to come from behind and end up on top in the demo, with CBS leading in viewers. But here's how the networks stacked up during premiere week (and for those who missed it, here's the role DVR played): . Adults 18-49 . NBC...2.9...+12% . Fox...2.6...-24% . CBS...2.4...-27% .

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick named Paul G. Kirk as the interim U.S. senator from Massachusetts on Thursday. Paul Kirk will fill the Senate seat left empty by the death of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Kirk will fill the U.S. Senate seat left empty by the death of former Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. Patrick said Kirk will begin serving immediately. ""[Kirk] shares the sense of service that so distinguished Sen. Ted Kennedy,"" Patrick said. Kirk will not seek the open seat in January's special election, Patrick said, ""but for the next few months, he will carry on the work and the focus of Sen. Kennedy, mindful of his mission and his values and his love of Massachusetts."" Primaries to fill the seat for the remaining three years of Kennedy's six-year term are set for December 8, while the general election will take place on January 19. Kirk said the appointment to the Senate seat is a ""profound honor"" that he accepts with ""sincere humility."" ""During our years together, I was personally privileged to have had Sen. Kennedy's friendship, his trust and his confidence,"" Kirk said. ""He often said that representing the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the Senate of the United States was the highest honor that he could possibly imagine. And it's certainly nothing I imagined, but it will be my highest honor as well."" Kirk said he expected to be sworn in on Friday. The appointment gives Democrats a crucial 60th vote in the Senate as the chamber weighs President Obama's health care proposal. Patrick said Kirk was chosen among 6 finalists for the post. Kirk was a longtime senior aide to Kennedy and served as chairman of the national Democratic Party in the late 1980s. Two Kennedy family associates told CNN on Wednesday that Kirk was the family's favorite to fill his vacant Senate seat. One source said Kennedy's widow, Vicki Kennedy, was among the family members supporting a Kirk appointment. In a statement released Thursday, Obama called Kirk a ""distinguished leader, whose long collaboration with Senator Kennedy makes him an excellent, interim choice to carry on his work until the voters make their choice in January.""

""Senator Kennedy always said that serving the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate was the greatest honor of his life.

But Rob Jesmer, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the appointment ""has nothing to do with principle, and everything to do with politics."" He accused Democrats of naming an interim senator in order to get another vote for the health care legislation. Massachusetts lawmakers voted Wednesday to approve a measure giving Patrick, a Democrat, the power to appoint an interim replacement for Kennedy until a new election can be held. Republican State Sen. Scott Brown has announced that he will run for the seat on the Republican side, while state Attorney General Martha Coakley, Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca and Rep.

"New York (CNN) -- Kenya's Geoffrey Mutai set a course record in the ING New York Marathon on Sunday, cutting nearly three minutes from a previous best time that had stood for a decade. Mutai finished in 2 hours, 5 minutes and 6 seconds, according to the official website for the race, breaking the old record of 2:07:43 set by Ethiopia's Tesfaye Jifar in 2001, the website said. All three top finishers beat the previous course record. Another Kenyan, Emmanuel Mutai (no relation to the winner) finished second in 2:06:28, and Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia was in third at 2:07:14. The highest finishing American man, Meb Keflezighi, took sixth place, with a time of 2:09:13. Ethiopia's Firehiwot Dado, 27, won the women's division in her first running of this event, with a time of 2:23:15, the website said. Mutai, 30, also won the Boston Marathon in April with a world-best time of 2:03:02. However, that record is not recognized internationally, however, as the day's strong tailwinds and the course's incline drops fall outside of the International Association of Athletics Federations' record-setting regulations. Dado's victory was her first in a major marathon, and her fifth overall. She surged past pre-race favorite Mary Keitany in the final mile. Buzunesh Deba, originally from Ethiopia but now living in New York, finished second in the women's division at 2:23:19. Keitany finished third with a time of 2:23:38. Molly Pritz, the highest-finishing American woman, came in 12th place with a time of 2:31:52. Masazumi Soejima from Japan won the wheelchair division with a time of 1:31:41, while Italy's Alessandro Zanardi's time of 1:13:58 propelled him to first place in the hand cycle division. More than 200 wheelchair and hand cycle athletes participated in this year's marathon. See results on the marathon's official website . CNN has learned that a 30-year-old male runner collapsed of cardiac arrest and was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital. The annual event has come a long way since the first race in 1970, when only 127 runners participated and 55 finished a route that coursed within Central Park. This year's race had 47,107 entrants. The race expanded to the city's five boroughs in 1976. The wheelchair and hand cycle divisions were added in 2000.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Rap star Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson visited Kenya and famine-hit Somalia this week to raise awareness on hunger and poverty issues. Jackson flew to the southern Somali border town of Dolo, which has provided refuge to the thousands of women and children fleeing drought and conflict in the nation. ""What I am seeing is devastating -- these women and children have risked everything to come to this Somalia camp, just to get food,"" Jackson said. ""They need our help."" Somalia has battled famine conditions in some regions and an Islamist insurgency that has disrupted aid to people in danger of starvation. The United Nations declared an end to Somalia's six-month famine recently, but said the situation is still fragile. The singer teamed up with the World Food Programme for the Wednesday and Thursday visits that included a stop in a slum in neighboring Kenya. In Nairobi, he visited with children at the sprawling Kibera slum, most of whom are orphans. ""To meet those kids was so inspiring, they have nothing, yet they are so positive and optimistic,"" he said in a statement posted on the U.N. agency's website. ""I want to do my part so they get food and an education. I hope more people will join me to help end this devastating situation."" Jackson has pledged to provide one billion meals for the hungry, and is donating a meal from every sale of a new energy drink, Street King, according to the World Food Programme.

"(CNN)  -- Serbian President Boris Tadic has dissolved parliament and called early elections for May 11, following disagreements over Kosovo and the European Union. Serbia president Boris Tadic dissolved parliament following conflict in the government. The Serbian government proposed the move this week, becoming frustrated after clashing with pro-Western Tadic and his party over the issues in cabinet. ""This is a new chance for us to reinforce the capacities for the defense of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to improve our economy perspective through the European integration process, to confirm the democratic capacity of our society, and to change things for the better,"" Tadic said in a statement posted on national news agency Tanjug's Web site. Kosovo infuriated Serbia by declaring its independence last month. That sparked divisions in Serbia about whether to keep pursuing membership in the European Union given that several EU nations have recognized Kosovo's independence. ""The Serbian government no longer has a united and common policy, which ... prevents the government from performing its basic constitutional function and conducting the policies of the Republic of Serbia,"" the government proposal said. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had said he might resign if Tadic did not call early elections. Kosovo, which is mainly populated by ethnic Albanians, declared independence from Serbia on February 17. However, Serbia -- which regards the region as integral to its history and culture -- has refused to accept the move as being legal, and conservatives do not want to join the EU unless its member states retract any recognition of Kosovo. Tadic, who was narrowly elected to a second term last month, set out his policies in an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais. ""We are not going to relinquish Kosovo. We are going to utilize all of our diplomatic and political recourses in defense of this, but without violence,"" he said. ""The people understand that we should be EU members, that this is in our national interest. We're not going to relinquish Kosovo or becoming EU members. ""What's important is to find a compromise. If the Albanians are going to get everything and the Serbians are going to lose everything, there will be a problem. ""This is also in Europe's interest. Some of the countries that have illegally recognized Kosovo have committed a historic error.""

"(CNN) -- England have qualified for the Euro 2012 finals, but they had troubled striker Wayne Rooney sent off, and squandered a two-goal lead, to draw 2-2 in Montenegro on Friday. Fabio Capello's side only needed a point to seal their place from Group G and looked in complete control when Ashley Young headed home Theo Walcott's cross, before Young turned provider to set up Darren Bent with an easy finish. However, Montenegro pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time with a deflected Elsad Zverotic effort, before Rooney was shown a straight red card in the second half for kicking out at defender Miodrag Dzudovic. And the home side took advantage of their man advantage to snatch a last-gasp draw when Andrija Delibasic headed home Stefan Savic's far post cross. The result secured England's qualification with 18 points from their completed eight matches, but it has come at a cost with Rooney -- who had to contend with his father and uncle being arrested earlier in the week over a betting fraud allegation -- now being suspended for at least the first match of the finals tournament. It proved to be an important equalizer for Montenegro, who have secured second spot and a place in the play-offs on 12 points. Switzerland lost 2-0 in Wales in the other group match to end their hopes of reaching the finals via the play-offs. Russia moved a step closer to sealing qualification with a vital 1-0 Group B success in Slovakia. CSKA Moscow midfielder Alan Dzagoev scored the only goal with 20 minutes remaining, as Russia moved top of the group with 20 points. They will ensure qualification if they draw with group minnows Andorra in their final match, while Slovakia's defeat means they cannot now qualify via the play-offs. Republic of Ireland won 2-0 in Andorra, thanks to goals from Kevin Doyle and Aidan McGeady, and lie second on 18 points, one ahead of Armenia who thrashed Macedonia 4-1 in Yerevan. Ireland and Armenia will meet in the final group game in Dublin, with Ireland just needing a draw to secure a play-off place. In Group E, Sweden secured their place in the play-offs with a 2-1 victory at rivals Finland in Helsinki. Two players who ply their trade in England, Sunderland's Sebatian Larsson and Martin Olsson of Blackburn put the visitors in the ascendancy and their held on for victory despite Joona Toivio pulling a goal back for the home side. In the other group match, a goal five minutes before half-time from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar gave the already-qualified Netherlands a 1-0 home win over Moldova in Rotterdam. That means the Dutch maintain their 100% record in the group with nine wins out of nine. They lie on 27 points, six ahead of Sweden who must travel to the Netherlands in their final group game. Hungary are a further three points behind in third and can draw level on points with Sweden, but the Swedes are certain of a play-off place courtesy of a greater head-to-head record. Germany also maintained their perfect nine from nine record with a superb 3-1 Group A victory over Turkey in Istanbul. In-form Bayern Munich striker Mario Gomez opened the scoring with his 13th goal of the season and club team-mate Thomas Mueller added a second after being set-up by Mario Goetze. Hakan Balta pulled a goal back for Turkey with 10 minutes remaining but Bastian Schweinsteiger converted a late penalty, after Gokhan Gonul had fouled Mueller, to seal the win. The win puts Germany on 27 points, a massive 12 points ahead of Belgium, who have leapfrogged Turkey into second place after defeating Kazakhstan 4-1 in Brussels. However, Turkey are just a point behind Belgium and are still favorites to claim the play-off place as they entertain Azerbaijan in their final match, while Belgium have to win in Germany to clinch second spot. Austria will finish fourth in the group after they won 4-1 in Azerbaijan on Friday. Holders Spain are the other team to remain 100% after beating the Czech Republic 2-0 in Prague for a seventh consecutive Group I success. First-half goals from Juan Mata and Xabi Alonso proved enough for the European and world champions, who now have 21 points with one match remaining. Second place is still up for grabs with the Czechs two points ahead of Scotland, who play in Liechtenstein on Saturday. A Scottish win will put them a point ahead with one match remaining, but that match is in Spain, while the Czechs have to travel to Lithuania needing to better the Scottish result. Northern Ireland's faint hopes of reaching the play-offs from Group C are over after they slumped to a 2-1 home defeat against Estonia. Steve Davis put the Irish ahead in the first half, but two late second half goals from Konstantin Vassiljev gave the visitors victory. The other group match saw Serbia draw 1-1 with already-qualified Italy in Belgrade. Claudio Marchisio took advantage of a long kick from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to put the Italians ahead but defender Branislav Ivanovic restored parity before half-time. Italy have won the group and lie on 23 points with one match remaining. Estonia are second on 16 points, one point ahead of Serbia, but the Estonians have now played all their matches and Serbia will snatch that spot with a final match victory in Slovenia. Group D all hinges on the final group game between France and Bosnia in Paris, after both nations won on Friday. Bosnia thumped Luxembourg 5-0 in Zenica, while Florent Malouda, Loic Remy and Anthony Reveillere scored the goals that saw France defeat Albania 3-0 at home. It leaves France on 20 points, one ahead of Bosnia, with a final match draw enough to send France through and put Bosnia into the play-offs. Romania and Belarus drew 2-2 in the other group match and the pair are joint third on 13 points, but Belarus have finished their matches now and Romania will end up third if they draw their final match against Albania. There was a significant result in Group F, where 2004 champions Greece beat Croatia 2-0 in Athens. Late goals from Georgios Samaras and Theofanis Gekas gave the home side a victory that makes them favorites to qualify for the finals. Greece are two points clear of Croatia and will qualify with a final match draw in Georgia, while Croatia need a victory at home to Latvia to have any hope of avoiding the play-offs. Friday's other match saw Latvia defeat Malta 2-0. Meanwhile, Group H is now a straight fight between Portugal and Denmark, to see which nation qualifies automatically with the other going into the play-offs. Manchester United winger Nani scored twice in Portugal's 5-3 win over Iceland on Friday, while a double from Dennis Rommedahl helped the Danes thrash Cyprus 4-1. Both teams are level on 16 points at the top of the table, but Portugal lead on the head-to-head. The pair face each other in Denmark on Tuesday, with the winners qualifying for the finals.","England qualify for the Euro 2012 finals after a 2-2 Group G draw in Montenegro .

"(CNN) -- Airlines were scrambling to accommodate passengers affected by the cancellation of hundreds of flights after a monster weekend winter storm that blanketed a swath of the East Coast. In addition to refunds, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines said the company is providing a weather waiver that allows passengers to reschedule without a penalty if they were scheduled to travel before Christmas. ""We're doing everything we can to accommodate customers to get them to their holiday destinations,"" said Paul Skrbec, Delta spokesman. American Airlines said it would add extra flights, use bigger planes where possible and reflow passengers to other flights. Passengers who were affected can switch flights with no change fees through Thursday, said Charley Wilson, airline spokesman. Continental Airlines said though flights are extremely full because of the holidays, it is working on a ""case-by-case basis"" to ensure passengers get home for the holidays. Passengers can also either get a refund or change their flights for free at Continental's Web site or through the 800 number, said spokeswoman Mary Clark. Record snow blanketed some areas Sunday, including 23 inches in Bethesda, Maryland, and 24 inches in Medford, New Jersey. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received 23.2 inches -- its second-highest snowfall ever in a single event. East Coast travelers faced treacherous roads, and flight delays and cancellations Sunday. Dulles and Reagan National airports in Washington saw snowfall of 18 inches and 16.4 inches respectively -- the highest one-day totals ever for December. At New York's LaGuardia Airport, some passengers were resigned to their fate. ""You sort of crumble once, get it over with and then put on a smile and just understand that's the weather and there's nothing you can do about it, really,"" said Mira Chopra, who was stranded at the airport. Two people were killed in weather-related crashes, the Virginia State Police said Sunday, and ""there are two additional deaths that are likely related to the winter storm."" The storm, known as a nor'easter, blanketed the mid-Atlantic region and the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor. Meanwhile, western North Carolina residents were digging out from the powerful storm. About 28,000 households had no power into Sunday night, said Drew Elliot, spokesman for Progress Energy. In Washington, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is ""perhaps the biggest we've seen in several years."" ""We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the District open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend,"" Fenty said when he announced the snow emergency. But, he also urged residents to stay put in their homes. ""We urge everyone if you don't have to go anywhere, wait. We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday. And, hopefully, all of it done between Monday and Wednesday."" Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and a city snow plow collided, a D.C. fire official said. The injuries were not considered serious.","Monster weekend winter storm blankets a swath of the East Coast .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The first man on the moon marked the 40th anniversary of his historic achievement with characteristic understatement Monday, calling the program that put him on the lunar surface ""a good thing to do."" President Obama welcomes, from left, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and Neil Armstrong. Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong joined crewmates Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin at the National Air and Space Museum, capping a day of commemorations that included a stop at the White House. During brief remarks at the museum, he said the mission was the climax of a ""staggeringly complex"" endeavor that ""required the very best in creativity, determination and perseverance that could be assembled in the American workplace."" ""Those successes were very impressive 40 years ago, but they were not miraculous,"" Armstrong said. ""They were the result of the imagination and inventive minds of the people in the Apollo project since its inception eight years earlier."" The July 20, 1969, moon landing followed four test missions and came just two years after a fire that killed the first Apollo crew. Six lunar landings followed. A seventh flight, Apollo 13, was forced to abort its landing after an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft; the crew used its lunar lander as a ""lifeboat"" for much of their harrowing return to Earth. Armstrong called the Apollo program ""a superb national enterprise"" that ""left a lasting imprint on society and history."" ""Our knowledge of the moon increased a thousandfold and more,"" he said. ""Technologies were developed for interplanetary navigation and travel. Our home planet has been seen from afar, and that perspective has caused us to think about its and our significance. Children inspired by the excitement of space flight have come to appreciate the wonder of science, the beauty of mathematics and the precision of engineering."" He concluded, ""Apollo was a good thing to do."" While fellow moonwalker Aldrin appeared on an episode of ""The Simpsons,"" wrote a memoir that frankly discussed his bouts with alcoholism and depression and once punched out a conspiracy theorist who argued the landing was faked, Armstrong retreated to quiet obscurity after leaving NASA. He taught engineering at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio in the 1970s, was chairman of an aviation computer company until 1992 and served on the commission that investigated the loss of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. He has given only occasional interviews in the intervening decades and stopped signing autographs because he discovered his signature was being sold for profit. Collins, who flew the Apollo 11 command module Columbia while Aldrin and Armstrong took the lander Eagle to the lunar surface, went on to serve as director of the Air and Space Museum. Columbia is now a prize exhibit at the facility. Earlier, the crew met with President Obama, who hailed them as ""genuine American heroes"" and ""the touchstone for excellence in exploration and discovery."" Obama said the landing continued to inspire young people to study math and science in hopes of becoming astronauts. As a boy in Hawaii, Obama recalled, he would go out with his grandfather to welcome back astronauts from missions that concluded with Pacific Ocean landings. ""I remember waving American flags and my grandfather telling me that the Apollo mission was an example of how Americans can do anything they put their minds to,"" he said. Later, at the museum commemoration, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said Apollo ""fundamentally changed how humankind views its place in the universe."" ""What you achieved will never be forgotten,"" Bolden said. ""Centuries from now, future generations will remember it was you -- you -- who took humankind's first steps beyond our planet.""","Apollo 11 crew celebrates 40th anniversary of moon walk in Washington .

"(CNN) -- On Saturday, a company called SpaceX was scheduled to launch the first private mission to the International Space Station, demonstrating a freight-carrying capability NASA gave up when it retired its fleet of space shuttles in July. (The flight was aborted at the last second after a faulty valve was discovered; SpaceX officials said the launch was postponed till Tuesday or Wednesday.) Some NASA supporters are mourning what they see as the decline of U.S. leadership in space. But they should really be celebrating the dawn of a new era. After all, we've been stuck in low Earth orbit for several decades now, at considerable cost. Visionary plans for genuine space exploration have gathered dust at NASA, the National Research Council and other space-savvy places. They advocate relearning how to land on the moon or figuring out how to travel to Mars, an asteroid or the special orbital location where the James Webb Space Telescope will eventually operate. But after more than two decades of talking that talk, the U.S. has yet to walk that walk. Turning over routine space trucking to private industry has important benefits. It frees NASA to innovate and to develop a new heavy-lift capability commensurate with real space exploration. At the same time, it empowers private industry to play a significant role in the nation's space future. Liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket, its Dragon capsule filled with food, supplies and science experiments, had been scheduled for 4:55 a.m. ET from the SpaceX launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. When it launches, three days later, astronauts will use a robotic arm to attach the Dragon capsule to the station. Cargo will be unloaded, return cargo loaded in, and the capsule will return to splash down in the Pacific. Light Years: SpaceX Dragon to launch Saturday . It will be the third launch of the Falcon 9 rocket; the second launch of the Dragon capsule, the first with components needed for space station docking; and one of 12 planned SpaceX flights to the International Space Station. SpaceX admits the riskiness of its endeavor. The current flight has already been delayed several times because of problems with the flight software. Space-flight veterans in the company are well aware of the trial-and-error nature of technology development, but they also know risk is an essential part of innovation. NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program is funding a handful of private companies -- including SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corporation); Orbital Sciences Corporation, which built the Pegasus rocket launch system 20 years ago; Blue Origin; Boeing; and Sierra Nevada -- to carry cargo to the International Space Station. ATK (Alliant Techsystems Inc.) plans to use its Liberty rocket to launch humans into orbit by 2015. CNN Explains: Commercial space flight . Many of these private companies have goals far beyond servicing the space station. Taking over space trucking from NASA allows them to pay the bills as they develop increasingly capable space vehicle systems. Then, providing they can reduce space launch costs by a large factor, they may be able to exploit new business opportunities, including passenger traffic to outer space. Still, they are not motivated by purely commercial concerns. The financial backers of these companies -- Elon Musk of SpaceX or Blue Origin's (and Amazon's) Jeff Bezos -- have invested hundreds of millions of dollars of their own fortunes. They doubtless would like their space adventures to turn a profit, but at heart they are modern-day pioneers who want to do something profoundly important for the future of humankind. Take the example of Planetary Resources, a company that recently announced plans to investigate and eventually mine rare metals from asteroids. The news stories emphasized PR's business plan, but their goals are far broader. They will first build small space telescopes to observe asteroids, so they can understand these building blocks from which Earth formed. Asteroids larger than about 100 meters (328 feet) in diameter are a potential hazard for the Earth, and understanding their composition will allow better prediction of their impact on the planet. Should we ever need to deflect an asteroid, we'll need to travel to it. So, while Planetary Resources might have a plan to make money down the road, they will first contribute critical knowledge to humankind, perhaps helping save the planet from destruction. Furthermore, with an asteroid visit and perhaps even a sample return, Planetary Resources will discover whether materials essential for human sustenance (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, water) can be recovered from these deep space objects. If so, they could set up interplanetary supply depots to enable human colonization of space. So there is a lot more to space commerce than mining asteroids for rare metals. Private space companies describe a vision that sounds like the original NASA: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. People who have visited SpaceX say its employees are among the best and brightest and that they mean to change the world. This is just what NASA did in the 1960s when humans moved out of low Earth orbit and ventured to the moon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Meg Urry: SpaceX to launch first private freight-carrying mission to the space station .

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI's former butler declared himself innocent Tuesday of a charge of aggravated theft in connection with leaked documents -- but said he had abused the pope's trust. Paolo Gabriele has previously admitted taking hundreds of secret papers from the pope's personal apartment and passing them to an Italian journalist. Opinion: Scandals block Vatican's message . Gabriele asserted his innocence Tuesday when he was asked by his lawyer about the theft charge, according to a pool of selected journalists allowed into the courtroom. The Vatican penal system does not require a formal plea. But, he said: ""I feel guilty of having betrayed the trust that the Holy Father gave me."" The former butler added that he felt he was ""the closest layman to the pope."" Corruption claims resulting from the publication of a book based on the leaked materials rocked the Catholic Church hierarchy and could even affect who becomes the next pope. Testifying Tuesday, Gabriele told the presiding judge, Giuseppe Dalla Torre, that he had received no money in exchange for the papers, according to the journalist pool. The accused said he did not believe he was the only person to give ""news"" to the press over the years, but also said that he had ""no accomplices."" Read more: Vatican newspaper calls fragment referring to Jesus' wife 'a fake' Computer technician Claudio Sciarpelletti, who worked in the Vatican's secretariat of state, is accused of complicity in the crime. The court will try him separately, once the former butler's trial is finished. If convicted of aggravated theft, Gabriele could face up to eight years in an Italian prison, although it is possible the pontiff could choose to pardon him. Sciarpelletti would face a shorter prison term of only a few months if found guilty. Questioned by Dalla Torre about how and why he had collected the documents, Gabriele said he had started photocopying them in 2010. He said his ""intention was to find a person he could fully trust to whom to vent .... about the disconcerting atmosphere in the Vatican, felt not only by me. This feeling of bewilderment was widely felt in the Vatican."" Gabriele said he had made the photocopies during regular working hours and in front of other people who worked in the same office. He told the court that he used his ""instincts"" in choosing what to photocopy. He said he had received no money or any other benefit from the person to whom he gave the documents, adding that this ""was the essential condition of our agreement."" Gabriele also said that ""the book was certainly not something he wanted."" A prosecutor in the case said in a report last month that Gabriele had acted out of a desire to combat ""evil and corruption everywhere in the Church."" ""I was certain that a shock ... would have been healthy to bring the church back onto the right track,"" Gabriele is quoted as saying by the prosecutor, Nicola Piccardi. Asked Tuesday about a gold nugget belonging to the pope that was found by police who searched his apartment, Gabriele told the court he hadn't known it was there. The officers who carried out the search said the nugget was 3-4 centimeters (just over an inch) long and had been discovered in a shoebox, along with a signed check made out to the pontiff. The court heard Saturday that 82 boxes of evidence were removed from Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a small town near Rome. Also Tuesday, the pope's personal secretary, Monsignor George Gaenswein, testified that he never ""had any reason to doubt"" Gabriele. More witnesses will be heard in the case Wednesday. Recalling his initial detention in May, Gabriele told the court that when he was first arrested he was put in a cell so small he couldn't open his arms out to their full extent. He was later moved to another, larger cell, Gabriele said. However, in this cell, where he was held for 15 to 20 days, the light was kept on 24 hours a day with no means for him to turn it off, he said. Gabriele said his eyesight had been damaged as a result. The Vatican prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into his claims of poor treatment in detention. But Jesuit Father Federico Lombardi, head of the Holy See media office, told reporters in a briefing after the court session that the cells used by the Vatican meet international standards. Lombardi also suggested that the allegations by Gabriele's defense lawyer that his client had been inhumanely treated seem questionable, since they were only coming out now. A statement from the Vatican Police said the force had been in the process of upgrading its long-term cells when Gabriele was arrested. The work was accelerated and he was moved to a more comfortable cell after 20 days, the statement said. The Vatican cells meet the standards present in other countries for similar situations, the statement said. It added that Gabriele had asked for the light to be left on to keep him company at night, and that he had been provided with eye masks. Gabriele was given access to medical staff and a spiritual adviser, as well as being allowed to attend mass with his family, the statement added. Read more: CNN Belief Blog . Gabriele, wearing the same gray suit he had on for Saturday's initial hearing, appeared more relaxed Tuesday, smiling, closing his eyes briefly and intermittently chewing either gum or candy, according to the journalist pool. In the previous hearing Gabriele had appeared pale as he sat largely expressionless in the courtroom. Both sessions were held under closely controlled conditions, with only a handful of approved reporters allowed to attend. They were required to brief other journalists. On Saturday, the admitted journalists were made to hand over their own pens in exchange for Vatican-issue ones in case any contained concealed recording devices. Gabriele's family did not attend either session. The former butler's lawyer, Christiana Arru, filed objections concerning the admissibility of evidence Saturday, including the results of a psychological exam conducted without the presence of his lawyer and footage gathered via a hidden camera, some of which the court accepted. CNN Belief Blog: Pope's butler leaked papers to shock 'corrupt' Church, prosecutor says . Gabriele's case is thought to be the most significant ever heard in the Vatican City courthouse, which has handled mostly petty theft cases in the past. A Vatican legal expert, Cardinal Velasio De Paolis, said in an interview published Sunday in Italian newspaper La Repubblica that popes in the past have typically granted pardons in the face of sincere confessions and repentance. The Vatican City State penal code for proceedings involving its citizens is based on the Italian penal code of the second half of the 19th century. Dalla Torre will lead the debate in the courthouse, located behind St. Peter's Basilica, and question the defendant directly. Prison terms handed down by the court are served in the Italian prison system, under an agreement between the Vatican City State and Italy. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a top-level Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the best-selling book ""Sua Santita"" (""His Holiness""), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. The Vatican called the publication of his book ""criminal"" when it was released in Italian.","NEW: Vatican Police rejects Gabriele's claim that he was poorly treated in detention .

Randeep Mann, a Russellville, Arkansas, doctor, is charged with one count of using a ""weapon of mass destruction"" against a person and property and a second count of ""maliciously"" using an explosive to damage or destroy a vehicle, according to prosecutors. Both charges accuse Mann of undertaking the crimes with the help of others, though the identities of others potentially involved have not been released. The doctor who was the target of the attack survived but suffered injuries that included losing an eye. A third charge filed Wednesday accuses Mann of possessing chloroform in his jail cell, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Arkansas. Mann, arrested initially on firearms charges, has been jailed since March 4. U.S. Attorney Jane Duke, speaking at a news conference, declined to comment on the suspected purpose of the chloroform. Attorneys for Mann had no comment when contacted by CNN on Wednesday. Mann, whose specialty was internal medicine and pain management, allegedly set off an explosion that injured family practitioner Trent Pierce on February 4, outside Pierce's West Memphis, Arkansas, home. On his way to his clinic that morning, the chair of the Arkansas State Medical Board went out to start his Lexus hybrid SUV. Before he ever got into the car, a bomb went off, Duke said. The blast, heard a mile away, threw Pierce six feet into a flower bed, police said. Pierce lost his left eye in the explosion, and suffered burns to his face. Pierce was due at a subcommittee meeting of the state medical board later on the day of the attack, Duke said. Early in the investigation, cases before the medical board were examined for potential leads. The board oversees licensing of medical professionals, and, in some cases, disciplines those professionals by suspending or revoking their licenses. Mann had ""multiple disciplinary matters"" before the board, Duke said. A call by CNN to the board's counselor for information on cases against Mann was not immediately returned. But Duke said the board had taken several disciplinary actions against Mann's license. Mann was interviewed by federal agents the day of the bombing and showed them ""at least one grenade launcher he legally owned,"" the U.S. attorney's office said in the release. But he wasn't arrested until a month later, after city employees uncovered partially buried ""high explosive rounds designed to be fired from a grenade launcher"" in a wooded area of London, Arkansas, the release said. An August indictment against Mann charged him with four counts involving the possession of unregistered firearms and explosives, including a machine gun and 98 grenades, according to court documents.","Dr. Randeep Mann charged with using ""weapon of mass destruction"" against a person .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day, reused syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS. I thought this was totally unacceptable and decided to do something about it. Sadly, it's come true. The toll from the reuse of syringes now exceeds that of malaria, with deaths due to this practice estimated at about 1.3 million each year. Every 24 seconds a child dies as a result of receiving an unsafe injection. The transmission method is crude -- blood-borne viruses are transmitted from patient to patient as body fluid is transferred by reusing a needle and syringe multiple times. In 1984 I was living in the Caribbean, sailing on yachts, almost waiting for inspiration. Then on a visit home, I read the article predicting the problem and my life changed instantly. For about 30 months, I studied all the areas related to the subject, and then it was clear what the ideal solution needed to be. My invention, the K1 Auto-Disable (AD) syringe, can only be used once and thereby helps stop the spread of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis. I set up Star Syringe to globally license K1. Fourteen licensees now distribute syringes to more than 70 countries, and from our sales figures, we can estimate that 9 million lives have been saved. This syringe is as cheap as all other standard syringes -- about 5 cents, a tenth of the cost of a Coca-Cola, to give you an idea -- but can only be used once and will lock and break if a doctor or nurse tries to reuse it. Outside of our 14 licensees, there are another 10 factories producing single-use syringes in different designs around the world. But an invention is only a starting point for change, and so in 2006 I set up the SafePoint Trust to generate awareness, petition for consistent regulation, and ensure compliance. (SafePoint takes care never to promote K1, which would benefit Star Syringe and its licensees. SafePoint does create awareness -- and so demand -- for AD syringes on a generic basis, and our mission is aligned with others who wish to bring about global adoption of safe injection practices.) We are a small but expanding team, and are incredibly proud to have single-handedly rolled out one of the largest global health campaigns ever, reaching an audience of over 500 million people in India in November 2008. This unprecedented awareness campaign included 14 press conferences attended by 250 newspapers; nationwide radio broadcasts (more than 10,000); and short film screenings on television (more than 5,000) and in 350 cinemas. It featured the moving story of Sachin, a little boy who contracted HIV through a reused syringe. As a result of this campaign, the Indian Health Ministry made it mandatory for all government health facilities to use AD syringes starting April 30, 2009. To ensure continuing momentum and build on the awareness from the previous activity, another campaign will run in India in April 2010, using shocking footage of syringes still being reused in some hospitals. We have a dedicated team in place that will launch a new campaign focused on Africa next year. Taking the lessons learned from the experience in India, and then adapting the framework to suit the different audience and their preferred media, we will initially focus on Swaziland, Tanzania, Nigeria and Ghana. If an injection is given safely, there is no risk of further infection and therefore there are no additional costs linked to further treatment for secondary, treatment-caused infection. Staff are happier and valuable bed space is kept free. Hospital staff have reported to my team that for every $1 they spend on 20 AD syringes, they can expect, typically, to save $280. Finally, I'm working to launch a new and distinctive LifeSaver logo. I'm asking other AD manufacturers to unite behind it and use it on their packaging, so that a safe injection can be immediately recognized, asked for and administered. Needle reuse is, for all practical purposes, effectively murder on a global scale. Medical practitioners are blindly giving unsafe injections because they don't have the resources to do otherwise, or they simply don't understand the consequences it can have. We need to push for change at the highest levels in society, government and right through to staff at the grassroots level. Bring it on! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc Koska.","Reuse of syringes costs an estimated 1.3 million lives a year, Marc Koska says .

"(CNN) -- The distraught mother of a missing five-year-old girl broke down in sobs Wednesday as she pleaded for help to find her daughter, April Jones, who was snatched from a street in Wales as she played. Coral Jones' televised appeal for information was brief but heart-rending in its desperation. ""It has been 36 hours since our April was taken from us,"" she said, her voice shaky with emotion. ""There must be someone out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her. ""We are desperate for any news -- April is only five years old. Please, please help us find her."" Coral Jones was led away from the news conference in tears. Police urged the public to share any piece of information that could lead them to the little girl, who was last seen playing with a friend near her home in a small mid-Wales town Monday. No trace of April has been found since she apparently got into a vehicle that stopped on the street and then drove off. Wednesday, police identified a man arrested the day before on suspicion of abduction as 46-year-old Mark Bridger. The force also released images of Bridger and a vehicle and appealed for help to trace his movements between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon. Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said officers ""are pursuing a number of lines of inquiry, and Mark Bridger is one of them."" He also called on anyone who has any information about the case to contact authorities and end the family's nightmare. ""Please call us,"" he said. ""Don't assume someone else has contacted us -- even the smallest piece of information could be crucial to the investigation."" Meanwhile, police, mountain rescue teams and dozens of volunteers continue to scour the town of Machynlleth, the surrounding countryside and the nearby River Dyfi -- fast-flowing after recent rain -- for any trace of the girl. One photograph released by the police shows a pretty, brown-haired child smiling as she shows off a pink summer dress, another has her peering up at the camera shyly, her arm colored with paint. Her abduction from the street as she played on her bike with a friend has stunned what police say is a close-knit local community. The only witnesses were other children, who police had to question sensitively. And the usually quiet market town of just over 2,000 people, set in a remote corner of rural Wales, is now at the heart of a manhunt that has gripped the nation since the first reports that the little girl had gone missing. The owner of one local garage, Nerys Zjalic, told CNN by telephone Tuesday that she had opened her garage to supply fuel to motorists who were searching for the girl, and had not closed it since. ""Last night people were coming all the way from Caernarfon, which is 80 miles away in North Wales, after hearing about the abduction on Facebook,"" she said. Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Powell said Tuesday that police were following several lines of inquiry. ""April was last seen playing on a bicycle near her home address at around 7.30 p.m. and was seen getting into what we believe was a light-colored van which then drove off,"" Powell said. Police are expected to give another news conference later Wednesday. Coral Jones' latest plea for help comes only a day after she and April's father made a direct appeal to whoever had taken their daughter to bring her back. ""Last night our lives were shattered when our beautiful little girl April... was taken from us. We are devastated and our lives have stopped,"" a statement from them said Tuesday. ""Please, please, if you have our little girl let her come home to us.""","""There must be someone out there who knows where she is,"" says April's mother .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Inspired by the deadly Columbine school shooting, a Spanish man purchased more than 300 pounds of explosive materials as part of an alleged plan to massacre university students, authorities said Thursday. Instead, Spanish police, who had been tracking him for five months, descended on his home Wednesday morning and arrested the 21-year-old just as he received the potentially deadly materials he had ordered off the Internet, according to authorities. They seized 140 kilograms of the materials. Police arrested the man in Palma de Mallorca, not too far from the University of the Balearic Islands, where they say he planned his attack. Mallorca is one of Spain's Balearic Islands, off its southeastern coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Police have not released the suspect's name, but they say he was a student at another educational center where he studied business administration. Although they believe he planned his attack at the University of the Balearic Islands, he had sent a threatening letter to his school, a police statement said. Documents taken from his home, including his personal diary, indicated he wanted to imitate the 1999 U.S. massacre that left 15 dead at a high school in Columbine, Colorado, according to police. ""He showed a hatred for society, especially for university students, and his decision to strategically place pipe bombs filled with shrapnel on the university campus,"" according to the police statement, referring to the documents seized from the suspect's home. ""He also admitted the hypothesis of suicide while carrying out the massacre,"" the statement added. Police began investigating the suspect five months ago after detecting Internet messages alluding to the Columbine massacre. ""The suspect showed a sympathy"" for the two men who carried out the Columbine attack, the statement said. His blog included sections showing that he knew how to make bombs, displaying the same musical tastes as the Columbine killers, describing his interest in weapons and mentioning ""social isolation that led to situations of feeling left on the sidelines at school,"" the statement said. Read more: Nothing the same after Columbine, say students, teachers . The suspect sought to acquire weapons illegally and later applied for a license to legally possess weapons, a document that is hard to get in Spain. The application was rejected. Police tracked his subsequent efforts to acquire the explosive materials through the Internet before arresting him Wednesday. The suspect ""is not part of any political party or association,"" according to Teresa Palmer, a central government representative in the Balearic Islands. She called it ""a completely isolated event"" and encouraged citizens to remain calm. Complete coverage: Theater shooting in Aurora .

"(CNN) -- Groups of graduate students who hang out at The Partisan, an indie band bar near the University of California-Merced campus, like their liquor and their politics straight up. Many of them felt they only got one of those things after watching the debate between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney on Wednesday night. ""I don't know what universe Romney is living in,"" said Beth Hernandez-Jason, a doctoral student in American Latino literature. ""I was kicked off my parents' health insurance by age 25 as was my little sister and she was reinstated because of the changes in the health care system."" And Hernandez-Jason, like several people in the bar, felt Obama's performance fell flat. CNN Poll: Romney wins debate by big margin . ""I am disappointed in Obama. I felt like he was holding back. He's too nice,"" she said. ""I understand that he has to come across nice but come on. After you hear Bill Clinton talk at the convention, he was willing to say it straight and not pull punches and it's unfortunate that (Obama) doesn't feel comfortable doing that."" Obama and Romney sparred over differences on the economy. In their points and counterpoints, both men drew regularly on examples of people who they met on the campaign trail who've been hit hard by the economic downturn. Some of those people were from towns like Merced, a community at the crossroads of the nation's foreclosure and unemployment crises. Connecting with the viewer: 'Romney was able to out Obama' The city has the nation's second highest foreclosure rate and an unemployment rate that at 17.5% is twice the national average. It is also a city that is nearly 50% Latino, a voting block both candidates are trying to woo. ""We're on just about every list it seems like,"" said Mike Murphy, a Republican and Merced city councilman who helped lead a community discussion on the University of California-Merced campus after the debate. ""People's priorities here (are) jobs, jobs, jobs."" For generations, many people in Merced have depended on the land, growing things like almonds, strawberries and grapes. But times are hard and farm work is harder to come by these days as growers are forced to tighten their belts in a down economy. In an area that some residents call California's ""fruit basket,"" the housing crisis has further compounded the area's woes. Obama, Romney clash over economy, health care . At that debate watching party, people gathered at the university library's ""Bobcat Lair"" were glued to the television as the two candidates faced off. When the debate ended, the room full of students wanted to talk about education funding and student loans -- a topic the candidates spent little time discussing -- and jobs, Murphy said. People in Merced want ""to see what either administration is going to do with unemployment and foreclosures,"" said Josh Pedrozo, a Democrat and Merced city councilman who also helped lead the post debate discussion. Speculators flooded the area at the height of the housing market in a frenzy to build and sell homes. Just a few short years later, many of those homes were often left half finished when builders ran out of money or empty when their owners faced foreclosure after losing jobs and being unable to make mortgage payments. ""Merced is ground zero for all of those concerns,"" said Dorie Perez, a Merced native who is pursuing her doctorate in political science at the local University of California campus. ""I want a plan and articulation of policies that I haven't seen. I want the bread and butter."" What we learned from the first debate . Perez has watched her community struggle to recover from the recession. She moved back to her hometown in the San Francisco Bay area after working for the state of California and the city of Oakland. She returned to a city vastly changed. ""The Central Valley is struggling as a whole. Merced and Merced County is not the most affluent place,"" Perez said. ""People need governmental services and the threat to those programs is scary for this area. ... We need government help for the average person. It's pretty tough here."" In a place struggling to recover, the new college campus is seen as a symbol that things are turning around. The school, which opened in 2005, is one of the nation's first research universities built in the 21st century. Analysis: Romney seizes the story . On Wednesday night, Perez, too, felt the president gave a lackluster debate performance. ""It was surprisingly dry. I was unimpressed to be honest. I know the expectations weren't that high for the president but I wanted him to be more aggressive,"" Perez said adding that classmates talked about the topic at The Partisan. Most evenings, Perez spends her time poring over her studies in the hopes of one day getting a doctorate and a highly coveted tenure track teaching position. In the process she's taken out thousands of dollars worth of student loans, so she listened with keen interest to the any mentions by the candidates' of addressing student loan rates and soaring tuition costs. ""I'm under 30. I'm trying to start a career and a life,"" she said. ""Academic departments are shrinking their budget and the idea that I'm going to put next five years of my life into it is terrifying."" Candidates hit campaign trail after debating .","Merced, California, has one of the nation's highest foreclosure and unemployment rates .

"(CNN) -- A weekend killing in Australia has prompted the Indian government to issue an advisory for its college students studying in that country. ""While the majority of Indian students studying in Australia, especially those enrolled in universities and reputable institutions, have a positive experience of living and studying in Australia, the number of such incidents of assault as well as of robbery has been on the rise in recent months, which has affected not only Indian students but also members of the larger Indian community in Australia,"" said a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs. Nitin Garg, 21, was stabbed to death Saturday night in Melbourne as he walked to work from a train station through a public park. Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard dismissed the notion that Australia is a unsafe for international students. ""Australia is a very safe country. By world standards, we have a very low homicide rate,"" Gillard said Wednesday. ""In big cities around the world, we do see acts of violence from time to time; that happens in Melbourne, it happens in Mumbai, it happens in New York, it happens in London."" Despite the assurances from the Australian government, India has issued a list of basic precautions its students should take while studying on the continent: . • Do not travel alone late; . • When traveling alone, make sure that you have checked out your route carefully and that you keep to well-lighted, populated areas; . • Make sure that someone knows where you are going and when you are expected to return; . • Don't carry too much cash. Do not make it obvious that you're carrying expensive items, such as iPods or laptops. Australia has seemed increasingly less safe for Indian students over the past year. During a one-month period over the summer, at least 10 Indian students were attacked. The most severe case left an Indian student in a coma; another student was stabbed in the stomach. More than a dozen arrests were made. Australian authorities said at the time that they didn't think the attacks and robberies were racially motivated but were instead crimes of opportunity against soft targets: students who typically travel alone at night on public transportation. But hundreds of Indian students saw it differently. During the summer, they reacted with protests in at least three Australian cities. Police said at one point that Indian students had decided to take the law in their own hands and retaliate, which was condemned in India and Australia. Australia has a lot riding on its reputation as a destination for international students. It has an estimated $12.6 billion-a-year education export industry. More than 90,000 students from India study in Australia. CNN's Ed Payne and Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Weekend killing in Australia prompts Indian government to issue an advisory .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Most of the weapons that Mexican drug cartels use are smuggled from the United States, but the U.S. government lacks a cohesive strategy to combat the arms trafficking, according to a Government Accountability Office report to be released Thursday. Assault rifle magazines are among weapons seized in April in northern Mexico near the U.S. border. In Mexico last year, drug violence was blamed for the deaths of 78 soldiers and more than 6,000 others. This year, the drug violence has claimed more than 2,900 lives, according to the newspaper El Universal. Much of the violence has affected the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the last five years, about 87 percent of firearms seized and traced by Mexican authorities were purchased in the United States, a draft of the report says. Most of the weapons were acquired at gun shops and shows in border states, according to the report. Many of these are high-caliber and high-power weapons, including AK-47s and AR-15 semiautomatic rifles. The two agencies tasked with curbing arms smuggling to Mexico, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Department of Homeland Security, ""do not effectively coordinate their efforts, in part because the agencies lack clear roles and responsibilities,"" according to the draft. In a statement Thursday, W. Larry Ford, ATF assistant director, said the bureau and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""are working to finalize a memorandum of understanding to maximize our joint effectiveness to combat violent crime along the Southwest border."" U.S. agencies also face other obstacles. Officials told the GAO that some federal firearms laws restrict the collection of information of arms purchases and limit reporting requirements for multiple sales, hindering anti-smuggling efforts. Of the guns traced back to the United States, about 68 percent were manufactured there and about 19 percent were made in other countries and imported to the U.S. before being smuggled to Mexico. ""The U.S. government lacks a strategy to address arms trafficking to Mexico,"" the draft of the report says. The GAO noted that U.S. anti-drug efforts in Mexico do not focus on weapons smuggling, and most of the efforts are aimed at keeping the flow of drugs from coming north, not stopping arms from flowing south. The report will say that the $1.4 billion Merida Initiative, the biggest drug enforcement aid package the United States has given Mexico, does not provide dedicated funding to stop weapons smuggling. Most of the weapons cross into Mexico in vehicles crossing international bridges along the border, where southbound inspections by customs officials are rare. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the international crossings, reported that in the 2008 fiscal year, a total of 70 weapons were seized in southbound inspections. In the same time period, Mexican authorities captured 30,000 weapons, 7,200 of which were submitted to the ATF for tracing, the report says. The gap between seizures and traces is a statistic that gun-rights groups say puts in question whether the majority of illegal guns in Mexico really come from the United States. The report will be released Thursday afternoon at a hearing on arms trafficking held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.","Drug violence reportedly has killed more than 2,900 people this year in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- The celebratory champagne should be well-chilled by now. After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its North American debut Sunday morning, toting more than 200 eager United Airlines passengers from Houston to Chicago. It promises to be a morning full of festivities, starting with a ribbon-cutting before the plane departs Bush Intercontinental Airport at 7:20 a.m. The aircraft touches down two and a half hours later at O'Hare International Airport, greeted by a water cannon salute. United says the 787 -- the airline has ordered 50 -- will ""revolutionize the flying experience for our customers and crew while delivering unprecedented operating efficiency, comfort and lower emissions."" The Dreamliner saves airlines money on fuel because its body is made from lightweight composite materials. It features passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation. U.S. routes announced for 'sports car in the sky' Sunday's flight crew won't need to kick the nose gear tires, size 40x16.0 R16/26PR to be exact, before taking off. United received the Dreamliner flying Sunday on September 28. It was put through the paces in October before earning Federal Aviation Administration certification. ""Everyone's very excited, even people who aren't in the industry,"" Phil Derner, founder of the aviation news site NYCAviation.com, told CNN in August. ""There's a ton of new technology on the 787. It's efficient and performs well, and it's also a very good-looking aircraft. It's kind of like a sports car in the sky."" In September 2011, Japan's All Nippon Airways became the first carrier to receive the plane, which was three years overdue at that time. Because of unexpected delivery delays, during November and December some domestic flights originally scheduled to use the 787 will operate with a different aircraft type, United said. United says its Dreamliners will include 36 first-class seats, 70 premium-economy seats and 113 economy seats. It recently received its second 787. CNN's Thom Patterson and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","United will be the first airline to fly the 787 in the United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- With Superstorm Sandy leaving communities under water, stranding millions without power and consuming public resources in several states, could next Tuesday's vote for president be moved to a later date? Sandy leaves election officials scrambling . No, it can't. Without passage of a new federal law, voting for president is required to take place on Tuesday, November 6, as planned. But, partial postponements of voting in some affected areas are possible, consistent with the laws governing the election of the president and vice president. Here's why: . When people go to the polls on Election Day, they aren't voting directly for their choice for president or vice president. Instead, they are voting to select representatives -- or ""electors"" -- to the Electoral College, the body that actually determines who will be president and vice president. Candidates, voters forced to navigate Sandy . The Constitution gives Congress the authority to determine ""time"" of choosing those electors. In 1845, Congress passed a law that set the Tuesday immediately following the first Monday in November of every election year as Election Day across the country. The same law also gives states some leeway in picking electors to the Electoral College. But to exercise that leeway, a state must have ""held an election for the purpose of choosing electors,"" and ""failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law."" When that happens, the law says ""the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such manner as the legislature of such state may direct."" Sandy's impact: State by state . Based on this, the Congressional Research Service, a federal agency that provides legislative research support to Congress, concluded in a 2004 report that a state could probably hold presidential voting on Election Day in places unaffected by a natural disaster but postpone it until a later date in affected areas without violating federal law so long as the state met other legal requirements relating to electing the president and vice president. But the law passed by Congress setting Election Day only allows a state to pick its electors on a later date if it has already held an election on Election Day and ""failed to make a choice"" on that day. So a complete statewide postponement would arguably violate the 1845 law, the 2004 report suggested. But the report also pointed out that the Supreme Court has emphasized the role states play in selecting the presidential electors, so a state might be allowed to postpone an entire statewide vote for president in emergency circumstances like a hurricane or other natural disaster. CNN Senior Correspondent Joe Johns contributed to this report.","Presidential Election Day is set by Congress under its authority in the Constitution .
Election Day can only be changed if a new federal law is passed .
But a state will probably be allowed to postpone voting only in disaster-affected areas .
Statewide postponement of the presidential vote is an open legal question ."
"(CNN) -- Wanted. $10 million reward. Someone with that bounty on his head would normally have to be in hiding. Not Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, the leader of Pakistan's Jamaat-ud-Dawa (Party of Truth), considered a terrorist organization by the United States. Saeed made headlines in the wake of Superstorm Sandy after he offered to send aid to its victims in the United States, which Washington quickly rejected. ""This particular offer strikes us as very hollow,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner has said. India and Washington accuse Saeed of being directly responsible for the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people, and the U.S. government offered the handsome bounty for information leading to his capture. U.S. declines Pakistani radical's offer to help Sandy victims . Despite his high profile, he says he does not live in seclusion, and he runs 150 madrassas and schools across the country. The U.N. Security Council even published a street address for him in Lahore in 2008. CNN sat down to record an interview with him in a building across from his home. But Saeed takes security seriously and required that the crew first meet with one of his men on the outskirts of Lahore then follow him into town. Checkpoints lined the block around his house. He agreed to the interview with a Western news organization, only because he wanted to talk about his offer to Sandy's victims. ""We have differences with the American government's policies, but the American people are only human; we are all human. It's not their fault,"" Saeed told CNN. In a sermon, which can be found on the Internet, he has blasted the West as being the real terrorists. Saeed has repeatedly denied any involvement with the Mumbai killings or support for terrorism despite accusations he has masterminded numerous attacks. ""I condemn this attack and the innocent lives that have been lost,"" he said. ""I don't support this attack or any violence of this kind, but you don't even seem to believe me; I've said it so many times."" He highlighted charitable activities by Jamaat-ud-Dawa. The U.S. State Department describes JuD's mission as the establishment of Islamist rule in India and Pakistan. Saeed softened his stance on Sharia law when speaking to CNN, saying he did not want to impose the strict laws by force but encourage it by raising awareness instead. It was a departure from past radical positions. To the U.N. Security Council, Saeed's party is synonymous with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and he is its leader, who also actively supports al Qaeda and the Taliban. Even Lashkar-e-Tayyiba as denied responsibility for the Mumbai attacks, which saw the Taj Mahal Hotel set alight, according to the Council on Foreign Affairs. The outlawed group, whose name translates to ""army of the pure,""has a reputation for being particularly active in the conflict region of Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan place varying claims on it. China lays claim to a small part of it as well. India's National Investigation Agency is to carry out inquiries in Pakistan into possible connections with the Mumbai attacks. Saeed told CNN he would speak with them. He said he has written letters to the U.N. and the European Union in attempts to clear his name, even offering to cooperate with investigations -- to no avail. Until then, Hafiz Saeed - surrounded by armed guards - says he will continue to provide moral support, but no more, in the cause of liberating Kashmir. And he will deliver relief aid to the people of Pakistan, as the United States will not accept his offers.

Abbas leads the Palestinian Fatah movement based in the West Bank, which has battled Hamas for power. Over the weekend, in an interview with Israel's Channel 2, Abbas spoke about being originally from the town of Safed in northern Israel. He said he would want to go back to visit, but not to live. ""I want to see Safed. It's my right to see it, but not to live there,"" he said. ""Palestine now for me is '67 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital,"" he added, referring to the borders that existed before the 1967 war. ""I believe that West Bank and Gaza is Palestine, and the other parts is Israel."" Many Palestinian officials have generally argued that Palestinians should have a right to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Hamas leader Salah al-Bardawil, speaking at one of two Hamas rallies Saturday in Gaza, said Abbas ""must apologize to the Palestinian people"" for his remarks. Protesters trampled on posters of Abbas, saying he had abandoned the demand for a right of return. But Abbas insisted that he was only speaking for himself. Palestinian state-run news agency WAFA carried a quote from an Abbas spokesman saying that whoever ""accepts a temporary state is the one who gives up the right to return."" That idea has long been suggested: that Palestinians who would choose to live in an independent Palestinian state would give up demanding a right of return. Saeb Erakat, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told CNN,""Hamas taking to the streets and doing all of this is an attempt to undermine the PLO and our attempt to go to the U.N.,"" where the Palestinian government plans to push for Palestine to become a nonmember state based on 1967 borders. Erakat said Hamas was ""sabotaging"" those efforts. The Palestinian Authority is made up of PLO committees. ""We are not going there to confront the Americans or to isolate Israel,"" Erakat said of his government's U.N. plans. ""We are going there to support and facilitate the two state solutions and to sustain the two state solution."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he had seen the televised interview with Abbas, and heard that he ""has already gone back on what he said. But this only proves how important it is to get into direct negotiations without any preconditions. Only direct negotiations will allow us to clarify what the true positions are."" Netanyahu added that if Abbas ""is indeed serious and intends to push the peace process forward, as far as I am concerned, we can sit together immediately. Jerusalem and Ramallah are seven minutes apart. I am prepared to start the talks today."" He called on Abbas ""to return immediately to the negotiating table without conditions."" CNN's Kareen Khadder, Talal Abu Rahma, and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: A PLO official accuses Hamas of sabotaging efforts for U.N. status as a non-member state .

"New York (CNN) -- Two years ago, Beatriz Craven helped her mother shave her head after chemotherapy treatments made Maria del Carmen Castillo's hair fall out. Craven then tied a blue-and-white cotton scarf they had purchased together in Houston around her mother's bald head. ""My hope was that these little things would help,"" said Craven, who lost her mother, 58, to ovarian cancer in March. To channel her grief, the daughter began training for her first-ever 26.2-mile race. ""I didn't realize how much anger I had and I wanted to turn it into something positive."" She traveled this week in New York, planning to wear the scarf in Sunday's New York City Marathon, which normally draws 47,000 runners. ""I thought it was only right to wear it, and try to be fearless like she was."" Millions try to get back to 'normalcy' When Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Friday announced the cancellation of the race because boroughs were still reeling from Superstorm Sandy, Craven hardly hesitated. ""I had a two-second reaction,"" she said. ""I'm going to run anyway."" The race was set to begin on Staten Island, where the majority of the city's storm-related deaths were recorded. But controversy surfaced this week over concerns that the event would drain resources needed for the massive recovery. ""It's tough,"" said Craven's brother, Juan Castillo, 30, who lives in New York. ""But you understand the reasons why they had to cancel."" While Craven agreed, her decision to endure the brutal strain of running the distance is more than a simple desire to run. ""Throughout my mother's illness I noticed I started to get more goal-oriented,"" she said. Craven participated in a half-marathon just prior to her mother's death. ""I was trying to do all things that once seemed unimaginable. I felt that if I could do all these extraordinary things, that my mom could beat cancer."" Deputy mayor: Marathon 'was going to be divisive' Both Craven and Maricel Laxa Pangilinan, who traveled from the Philippines with her husband and daughter to run in the marathon, plan instead Sunday to run in Central Park. Some participants will do a full marathon, looping around the iconic green, while others will run shorter distances. The impromptu gathering of runners was scheduled through social media, with the aim ""to acknowledge all your training and efforts to prepare and come to the NYC Marathon."" Runners should assemble at 10 a.m. at Manhattan's Columbus Circle, according to an unofficial Facebook site dedicated to this year's marathoners. Pangilinan arrived in New York a day before Sandy barreled across the Eastern Seaboard, demolishing homes, flooding subways and leaving millions without power. ""I turned 42 years old this year,"" she said. ""I wanted to do 42 kilometers at age 42."" Others debated Saturday whether they would run at all. ""I think a lot of people are just going to join in when people start running,"" said Ashley McAleavy, a 27-year-old fashion designer at Remedy Designs in Manhattan. ""That may be my best tactic."" The recovery effort continued Saturday across wide sections of Staten Island, Queens and Long Island, while gasoline shortages plagued New Jersey, where some of the worst storm damage occurred. On battered Staten Island, local residents had planned to mix relief efforts and the inclination to run. Superstorm Sandy's victims . Ryan and Pamela Murphy organized a series of ""street-run 5k"" runs to raise money and other donations for storm-affected neighbors. And by 5 p.m. Saturday, they had raised $13,500. But with a plethora of donations, the organizers called off the races and had a suggestion to supporters. ""The best thing we can do right now is offer our physical help along the Staten Island shoreline,"" the Murphys wrote. ""We encourage you to join us, or to find a location that has been affected and offer your time -- it's the best donation you can make right now."" Relief organizations such as World Vision reported that many runners had exchanged their sneakers for work boots, working with the organization to deliver food kits. ""I could have sat in the hotel room. I could have gone sight-seeing, and probably would have still felt pretty empty,"" said Tim Fearn-Wannan, who traveled from Melbourne, Australia, for the race. ""But this is a good feeling that there are people out there in a pretty bad situation at the moment and we're doing our small part to help out with that.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Americans back Barack Obama's plan to move U.S. troops from Iraq to Afghanistan, a new national poll indicates. U.S. soldiers gather at the ""Cross Swords"" in Baghdad's secure Green Zone earlier this year. Fifty-five percent of people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Thursday back the president-elect when it comes to reducing the number of American combat troops in Iraq and increasing the number in Afghanistan. ""The reason is simple,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""The war in Iraq is very unpopular, while a majority support the war in Afghanistan."" Sixty-three percent of those polled oppose the war in Iraq, with 36 percent ""favor"" it. Fifty-two percent ""favor"" the war in Afghanistan, with 46 percent in opposition. ""In addition, roughly half the public thinks that the U.S. is winning in Iraq, but six in 10 say that America's losing in Afghanistan,"" adds Holland. That forty-nine percent who now say the U.S. is winning the war in Iraq (with an equal amount saying the U.S. is not winning) is up from 32 percent last year. ""To the American public, Afghanistan is the good war, and it's going badly. Iraq is the bad war, and it's going fairly well,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. The poll suggests that Americans believe that the president-elect will remove all combat troops from Iraq. Obama told reporters Monday in Chicago that he still thinks 16 months is the ""right time frame"" for removing U.S. combat troops from the country. Sixty-three percent of those questioned in the survey are confident that Obama will do just that, with 36 percent not confident. A vast majority of Americans, 79 percent, also appear to be confident that Obama will improve foreign relations, with 74 percent confident he'll improve economic conditions and 68 percent optimistic about Obama keeping the country safe from terrorism. ""In the wake of the recent attacks in Mumbai, India, concerns about terrorism here in the U.S. have grown a bit, but most Americans don't think a terrorist attack is likely in the next few weeks,"" said Holland. In fact, the 36 percent who say acts of terrorism are likely in the U.S. over the next several weeks is up only slightly from the 30 percent who felt the same way in September, the last time the question was asked. ""The dispute between India and Pakistan may be the next big flash point in world affairs, but Americans want this country to stay out of it,"" Holland added. Eight in 10 think the U.S. should side with neither country, with 15 percent saying side with India and one percent wanting to side with Pakistan. And in a sign that Obama is enjoying a honeymoon with Americans right now, 64 percent of those polled approve of how he handled the terrorist attack in India. That's 15 points higher than President Bush scored in the survey, even though Obama made clear during the crisis that there can be only one American president at a time and that he was deferring to Bush when it came to any American response. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted Monday and Tuesday, with 1,096 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.","New CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll released Thursday .

"Hogansville, Georgia (CNN)  -- A Georgia couple arrived at the White House on the wrong day for a tour recently and got much more than they bargained for. After being screened by the Secret Service, Harvey and Paula Darden of Hogansville, Georgia, were led into a lavish invitation-only breakfast where they met the president and the first lady. How the couple was able to get into the White House event without being on the guest list was called ""dumb luck"" by the Dardens. The White House is calling it a ""nice gesture"" and has been explaining how this incident is nothing like the breach of security that took place when Tareq and Michaele Salahi infamously crashed the Obamas' state dinner. The Dardens got into the White House on Veterans Day, weeks before the Salahis' infamous party crashing. The couple mistakenly arrived a day early for a tour that was booked by their congressman. The White House says it put the Dardens through the appropriate screenings and criminal background checks before allowing them to go to the Veterans Day breakfast because there were no tours scheduled that day. Harvey Darden, 67, says the whole thing was a surprise to him because at the time he did not realize that he was at the White House on the wrong day. Darden says he was standing outside the White House security booth with his 62-year-old wife when he heard: ""Mr. and Mrs. Darden, you are cleared to come in."" They were led directly to the grand East Room where there was a buffet and a crowd of people, some in military uniforms, some in suits. Darden says he began to get the sinking feeling that this was not the usual tour of the White House. He went to talk to a White House aide telling the staffer that he may be in the wrong place. The staffer, who Darden did not know by name, asked him if he was a veteran. When Darden said he told the staffer he was a Navy veteran, the staffer told him to stay for the breakfast. ""He said, 'Go with the flow,'"" Darden said. A White House spokesman said it was a ""nice gesture"" that has been done before for those have passed security screenings. White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said it is not uncommon for staff to take people who are cleared for tours to other events if there is space available. Shapiro said the White House Office of Public Engagement, which Obama created to engage citizens in White House activities, was responsible for clearing in the Dardens, as well as the other breakfast guests. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said agents performed the same screening procedures on the Dardens that were used for other breakfast guests. They checked the Dardens' names and did a criminal background check, steps that were not taken for the Salahis at the November 24 state dinner. The Dardens ate breakfast and then were startled when Obama entered the room. They got a chance to meet the president, the first lady and the vice president, Darden said. Darden said he was even more startled he returned to his Georgia home and read his e-mails with U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland and realized he had been at the White House on the wrong day. ""It was dumb luck that a veteran of four years was able to meet the President of the U.S, who I have lots of support and respect for,"" Darden said. CNN's Jason Morris and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","Georgia couple shows up on wrong day for White House tour, end up meeting president .

"Editor's Note: Actor and writer Joseph C. Phillips has appeared widely on television, including on ""The Cosby Show,"" ""General Hospital"" and ""Without a Trace,"" and in films and theater. He writes a syndicated column and is the author of the book, ""He Talk Like A White Boy."" Joseph C. Phillips  with his wife, Nicole, of 14 years, and their children, Connor, 10, Ellis, 8, and Samuel, 6. (CNN) -- I was truly honored to participate in the CNN documentary ""Black in America."" As often happens in projects of such ambition, it is difficult for everyone to have sufficient time to flesh out ideas. Though I went on tape with the program's producers for several hours, it just wasn't possible to explore all of my ideas at length. Working in Hollywood, I am used to ending up on the cutting room floor. That's life in the big city. Soledad O'Brien and I had a long conversation about sentencing disparities among black and white criminals -- specifically, the disparity between sentencing for crack cocaine and powder cocaine. The context of our conversation concerned whether the sentencing disparity was evidence of the racism inherent in the criminal justice system. Despite efforts by the Supreme Court and the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase flexibility in sentencing, the punishment for possession by a first-time offender of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine is a minimum 5-year prison sentence -- while possession of any amount of powder cocaine is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in prison. In the mid-1980s, when these mandatory minimum sentences came into effect, America was experiencing a surge in violent crime, much of it fueled by the introduction of a new and extremely profitable (to say nothing of addictive) form of cocaine -- crack. There was tremendous violence associated with the crack cocaine trade as drug gangs fought over territory. The media told us that our neighborhoods were filling with crack babies -- children born addicted to cocaine because their mothers smoked the deadly toxin while pregnant. Our representatives in Congress, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, decided to take a tough stance and supported harsh sentencing guidelines for selling crack cocaine. I have little sympathy for men and women who prey on the innocent hardworking members of the community. I am particularly critical of men who are guilty of criminal behavior, as this runs counter to what I see as one of the primary duties of men: to be guardians of the home and of the community, not parasites on that community. I am, however, uncertain that society gains very much by sentencing thousands of young black men to prison for nonviolent drug offenses. The sentences introduce them to a system from which it is difficult to extricate themselves and begins the downward path to joblessness, absentee fatherhood and more criminal behavior -- in short, creating more of the very behavior we are trying to discourage. The disparity in the guidelines' impact does not in my mind prove systemic racism. I would, however, argue that it does not represent the best the American justice system has to offer and in fact undermines faith in that very system, especially among black folk. Studies show that more than 50 percent of inmates have drug and alcohol problems. When we are discussing nonviolent offenders, I think it may be prudent to spend a bit more time with rehabilitation as opposed to tossing folk in jail. We have tried for many years to attack the supply side of this equation; it is in my humble opinion time to begin addressing the demand side and approach the drug war as a health issue. We also need to get a handle on single parenthood and absentee fathers. Responsible members of our community cannot stress enough the effects of single parenthood on the development of children and how that development translates into criminal behavior in the community. Studies indicate that nearly 90 percent of the change in violent crime rates in a neighborhood can be accounted for by the change in percentages of out-of-wedlock births. Children from fatherless homes are: • 9 times more likely to drop out of high school. • 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances. • 20 times more likely to end up in prison. These are sobering statistics. A change in the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine will have very little effect if we do not begin to commit this community to raising our children in two-parent homes. Finally, there must be a corresponding responsibility on the part of citizens to avoid drugs and alcohol and obey the law. There must also be a continued demand by the rest of us that our fellow citizens engage in moral and ethical behavior. We must insist that concepts like nobility, duty and honor are not sacrificed on the altar of relativism. Nothing distresses me more than the e-mails I receive attempting to explain away the antisocial and criminal behavior of some of our neighbors as the result of poverty and or racism. (Left unanswered, of course, is why they who have also been targets of racism and economic hardship are not engaged in criminal behavior.) To suggest that people attempt to live lives of virtue is not simplistic. It is in fact wisdom that is preached in our houses of worship each and every Sabbath day. Whether it concerns sexual behavior, decisions concerning our education or how we conceive of civil behavior, when it comes to creating lives of purpose and fulfillment nothing will replace the individual accessing the wisdom that has been passed down from antiquity. In the words of the poet William Ernest Henley: . It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.

"LIMA, Peru (CNN)  -- A Venezuelan mayor who says President Hugo Chavez is persecuting him on trumped-up corruption charges is seeking political asylum in Peru, his lawyer said Tuesday. Manuel Rosales, mayor of Maracaibo in Venezuela's Zulia state, is seeking asylum in Peru. Manuel Rosales, a leading political opponent who lost the 2006 presidential race to Hugo Chavez, faces corruption charges in Venezuela. He was supposed to have turned himself in to authorities on Monday but failed to appear. ""According to the jurisprudential traditions of Peru and the historic traditions of asylum, Peru has to accept this petition for asylum, because it concerns a political leader, a man of great responsibility, and because Hugo Chavez has made impassioned public declarations against him in plazas and stadiums,"" attorney Javier Valle Riestra told CNN en Español. ""That makes one doubt that there could be an impartial process."" He told reporters he expected Peru's government would make a decision within two months. A spokesman for Rosales' party, A New Time, predicted the mayor would not lose his impact as an opposition party leader, despite efforts by the ruling party to trim his powers. ""All the powers have been activated to castrate, to lynch politically a leader who has guided the country along the democratic path, through the electoral road,"" Timoteo Zambrano told reporters. In Venezuela, government authorities criticized Rosales' attitude. ""Not presenting himself before a competent tribunal would be make him a fugitive from justice and, in consequence, mechanisms determined by that tribunal will be activated for his capture,"" said Tareq El Aissami, minister of interior and justice in Venezuela. ""Here, an investigation by Interpol has to be asked for,"" said Congresswoman Iris Varela, a member of Chavez's party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Zambrano promised that Rosales will respond in the next few days. Belaunde told CNN en Español that Rosales entered Peru on a tourist visa. Venezuelan officials say Rosales illegally enriched himself as governor of Zulia state from 2002 to 2004. Rosales denies the allegation and says Chavez is out to get him for political reasons, and is persecuting him on trumped-up corruption charges. ""Since they haven't been able to take me off the political map by the electoral route, now they're using the power they have in all the movements of the public prosecutor,"" Rosales told CNN en Español last month. One of Rosales' lawyers noted that Chavez said publicly in October 2008, before Rosales was charged, that he wanted the mayor in prison. Another prominent Chavez opponent was arrested this month on corruption charges. Former Venezuelan Defense Minister Raul Baduel played a key role in turning back a coup attempt against Chavez in 2002 but broke with him in November 2007 over constitutional changes Chavez was proposing. Baduel has been a strong Chavez critic since then. Baduel, who also was the president's military general-in-chief, was arrested at gunpoint in front of his wife on April 2, the general's attorney said at the time. It was Baduel's second arrest on charges that he stole $14 million from the armed forces. He denied the allegation and last year said the charges were politically motivated. In last month's interview, Rosales called the charges that he had illegally accepted money ""totally false,"" and said he not only declared all of his income, but paid taxes on it. Katiuska Plaza, district attorney for Zulia state, said in a 26-count complaint last month that Rosales illegally enriched himself in 2002 and 2004. Rosales called the district attorney's actions ""a manipulation,"" and said the prosecutor ""is acting on Chavez's orders."" Journalist Andreina Flores in Caracas and Maria Elena Belaunde in Lima contributed to this story.","Venezuelan mayor Manuel Rosales seeking asylum in Peru, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- On July 20, many of us woke to the horrific images of the events that had unfolded in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater where 12 people were killed and 58 wounded. In the wake of the tragedy, we don't simply wonder who or why, but also how? Soon after, President Obama gave a fiery speech, stating, ""AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals. They belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities."" While you might think such a statement indicated that the president was going to show some real leadership and fulfill his promises to reinstate the assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, the White House later released a statement saying that gun control was not something the administration was going to push at this time. The president seems more concerned with making sure the American people know of his commitment to protect their Second Amendment rights than he does with protecting them from the danger posed by assault rifles in the hands of criminals. Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence? No politician, including the most powerful man in the free world, wants to pull the trigger on solving the complex issue of gun control. The odds of political survival after such a move are worse than those in a game of Russian roulette. When he was governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney strongly backed gun control, dubbing assault rifles ""instruments of destruction,"" and he signed the first comprehensive state ban on assault weapons like the AR-15, which James Holmes is accused of using in Aurora. However, now Romney does not ""believe in new laws restricting gun ownership and gun use."" Don't get me wrong, the Second Amendment is one of my favorites. In the military, I was an expert marksman who trained foreign militaries in counter-guerilla warfare, and I am an avid gun enthusiast. As a gun owner, I absolutely believe in the right to protect my family from anyone who threatens our safety. But I also know that when the Second Amendment was passed in 1791, the most lethal weapon was a single-shot musket. Arguing that you need an assault rifle to protect your family is like saying you need a blowtorch to light a cigarette. Within months of 9/11, new security measures were put in place at airports to ensure the safety of airline travel. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, new laws were enacted to detect suspected criminals and new security measures were put in place at federal buildings. However, since 1982 we've had 56 incidents of mass killings involving firearms, many of which were semi-automatic handguns and assault rifles. Yet here we stand, 30 years later, no closer to resolution on even the simplest forms of stricter gun control. Such resolution is blocked at almost every step of the way by the juggernaut that is the National Rifle Association. There are no two cozier bedfellows than the NRA and politicians; if laws controlled guns the way the NRA controls politicians, America would be the safest country in the world. Frum: Fear drives opposition to gun control . The NRA makes more than $200 million a year. These earnings, coupled with its 4-million strong membership, has paralyzed any thoughtful discussion of the issue from politicians who are scared to even have an honest debate of where the proper lines should be drawn. One only has to look at U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, the two-time chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who after a 36-year career lost his primary race in the face of heavy campaigning against him by conservative groups, including the NRA, which criticized his support for a ban on assault rifles. It's political suicide to even propose safety measures like background checks at gun shows. President Obama and Mitt Romney are focused laser-like on the key swing states, which all have significant gun ownership. It's clear that both candidates are afraid of turning off these gun owners and the NRA. With 4 million members on its rolls and as many as 47% of all Americans reporting gun ownership, appearing sympathetic to the ideals of the NRA is a significant consideration for anyone running for public office. The NRA wields a carrot-and-stick approach to politics, doling out generous political backing to those who agree with it or to those who are simply running against someone who disagrees with it. The group also employs a rating system under which candidates are graded according to their votes on key issues. The NRA is always transparent about certain votes being graded, and as such candidates are always on notice before they vote. Until we face the power of the NRA and truly measure the length of its reach, the issue of gun control is doomed to stay exactly where it is -- stuck. Challenging such a powerful lobby, daunting as it appears, is paramount, because we can't allow special interests to run roughshod over the public interest. The issue of guns and how we as a country regulate their ownership and use must be addressed -- and soon. I am like many gun owners who, polls have shown, stand by both our right to bear arms and the responsibility to create safety measures that protect the public. Yes, we want to have our cake and eat it, too, and I firmly believe such a middle ground -- not a ""flip-flop"" a la Romney, nor an empty promise, a la Obama -- exists. But we need to jump-start the conversation -- and stay well clear of the fiery rhetoric. As it stands, a little more than a week after James Holmes gunned down 12 people, including 6-year-old Veronica Moser, who were enjoying a night out at the movies, we are left with some politicians' righteous indignation and a few photo ops. A dozen grieving families and a nation deserve more -- we deserve real leadership. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles P. Garcia.","Charles Garcia: Neither major party candidate seems willing to take on gun control issue .

"(CNN) -- Since the start of the financial crisis, the world's wealthiest man, investor Warren Buffett, has been front and center. Alice Schroeder says investor Warren Buffett has become a symbol of stability in American business. He's advised Sen. Barack Obama on economic policy. He urged Congress to pass the $700 billion bailout bill. He bought stakes in Goldman Sachs and General Electric. He wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times saying he's buying stock in American companies now because he believes they will do well in the long run, citing as his rule: ""Be greedy when others are fearful."" Buffett's name came up in the second presidential debate when the candidates agreed he'd be a good choice for treasury secretary. His fortune was estimated at $62 billion by Forbes in March. Alice Schroeder got Buffett's cooperation in writing her new book, ""The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life"" (Bantam Books). Schroeder, who worked on Wall Street as an insurance industry analyst, met Buffett 10 years ago when his company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought a big insurance company. Schroeder says she suggested he write a book about his life, and the 78-year-old Buffett turned the tables, urging her to do it instead. Schroeder estimates she spent about 2,000 hours with Buffett and interviewed 250 people for the book. Now on a tour to promote her book, Schroeder is in a unique position to speak about Buffett at a time when many media outlets are seeking his views. ""I have about 300 hours of recorded interviews and the rest of the time I observed him, I watched him make decisions and talk on the phone, went through files. I got to sit in his office for weeks, I ate steaks with him,"" says Schroeder, who's 51. ""If it ever said moo, he'll pretty much eat it. He likes his steaks bloody rare and hanging off the plate, they're so big."" CNN: Why are people so interested in Warren Buffett? Schroeder: I think he's transcended business to become a national figure because of people's trust in him as a symbol of stability and a symbol of someone who knows how to manage risk and avoid catastrophe and of how to run a business on principles. CNN: Is there any realistic possibility of him taking a government position? Schroeder: No, none. What he really likes to do is run Berkshire Hathaway, and he's not going to let anything take him away from that. He's also not going to let anyone spend his day filled up with meetings or schedule his time, he's too independent. CNN: You make clear that in the 1990s tech boom, Wall Street turned away from Buffett and there was some criticism of him. Do you think that now, because of the market downturn, people will look to him more to set a standard of how the market operates? Schroeder: I think it's fair to say that throughout his career, every time there's been a bubble and it's burst, his reputation has grown. That happened in the 1960s, when the bubble burst in the 1970s, it happened again after 1987. It happened again after the savings and loan crisis. ... It happened again after the Internet bubble and it's happening now. CNN: It doesn't seem to have had a lasting effect, since we keep going back into another boom period or bubble. Schroeder: He would say that human nature doesn't change, and that fear and greed are always the two drivers of the market. And there are people who listen when he gives learnings, but that the market will always be ruled by cycles driven by fear and greed. CNN: Have you talked to him about the current market turmoil? Schroeder: Last spring, when Bear Stearns was being taken over by J.P. Morgan ... he talked about the dominoes falling, and how, if that happened, the government could face some very unpleasant choices and have to take drastic measures. With hindsight it looks really prescient. In 2002, he talked about derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction. More recently, his observation was that there was a lot of anger and denial at first about what was going on, and that people were not quite grasping the gravity of the situation and how quickly and dramatically they needed to move. He always says, don't sell into a panic, don't let the fear and the emotions of the market change how you feel. If you own good stocks in good companies or you own an index of the markets, and you see it getting cheaper, that's a reason to be happy, not to panic and sell. ... The idea is buy low, sell high -- not buy high, sell low. He understands the factors that are burdening the country, the federal deficit, the consumer debt, the infrastructure spending that we're going to have to do, but he has a belief in American ingenuity which over the long term has enabled our country to solve problems that seemed insurmountable in the past. For example, in the 1970s, it looked like the country could not ever dig its way out of the mess. So he does have a faith in the long-term prospects of the country. CNN: Is he a gambler? Schroeder: No, he's a handicapper -- big difference. A handicapper is somebody who understands odds-making. A gambler is somebody who bets but may not even understand the odds. Warren believes in a margin of safety, he doesn't bet unless the odds are overwhelmingly in his favor. When he goes to Vegas he does not gamble, he goes to see the shows. CNN: What are his flaws? Schroeder: He is somebody who can be very tough in business and very impersonal, including with people he likes. And in personal relationships, he negotiates as if it were a business relationship . When he was putting Berkshire Hathaway together, as [his business partner] Charlie Munger puts it, he was an implacable acquirer. The book refers to him, in my words, as a great white shark, and the book describes the battle between his avarice and his higher principles. At times, his avarice won. And over his lifetime, it's been essentially a progress during which his higher principles have increasingly had the upper hand. But when he was in junior high, he was a shoplifter. He was a juvenile delinquent. He sold his sister's bicycle. It's been pretty much uphill from there, but it hasn't been a straight line. CNN: In his adult life, was there a time when his avarice won out over higher principles? Schroeder: Absolutely, he's made investments that he shouldn't have made, for example, when he invested in Salomon. He was criticizing Wall Street and saying if you want to make a lot of money, hold your nose and go to Wall Street, and at the same time he was already there. Berkshire owned $700 million of convertible preferred [stock] in a major Wall Street bank. And he was sort of mentally distancing himself from a business that he was invested in. That kind of separation is something that's very hard to maintain. And in the end, he had to become interim chairman of Salomon to rescue the firm. Psychologically, he was trying to distance himself from it because the two sides of him were at war. CNN: Is he still critical of Wall Street? Schroeder: You've got an economy in which financial intermediaries who don't add anything to the economy ... have in the past two decades stripped off huge amounts of fees, particularly buyout funds, and hedge funds and funds of funds, and he's very, very critical of the amount of fees that have been taken out. He has no problem with executive pay when it's related to performance. He thinks in most cases executives are being paid to sit in a chair whether they perform or not.  And he's pointed out that these people are not like major league baseball players, who get recruited away by other teams. When CEOs get fired and they get these golden parachutes, you don't normally see them winding up somewhere else, right? So they're getting paid these huge amounts of money as an incentive to stay and then they get paid the consolation prize when they get fired. The pay is always getting ratcheted upward, they're getting paid to incent them to stay and they're getting paid to console them when they leave, no matter what the shareholders are getting. It's not aligned with anything the shareholders get, that really bothers him. CNN: What would he say about coping with an economic downturn? Schroeder: That people should think for the long run and make their personal decisions for the long run and build a margin of safety into their lives as best they can. Think about what could go wrong. Don't assume the best-case scenario. If you've got debts, your first thought should be how to pay them off, and negotiate with creditors if you're struggling, because they'll usually be flexible. And be realistic about what you can afford, because having a financial cushion means you can sleep at night, and that's worth more than a big-screen TV.","Alice Schroeder: Buffett is viewed as a symbol of stability and safety .

"(CNN) -- Sumo grand champion Asashoryu held a tear-filled press conference to announce his retirement on Thursday in the wake of allegations about his drunken assault on a man outside a Tokyo nightclub last month. The 29-year-old, who became the first Mongolian to earn the highest ranking in Japan's most revered sport in 2003 and only the third non-Japanese, apologized in a statement broadcast on television. ""I am taking responsibility for having caused so much trouble,"" he said. ""I have caused a lot of trouble for so many people. I decided to step down to bring this to a closure. ""I have no regrets about sumo. There was a big difference about what was reported in the media about the incident and what actually happened."" Asashoryu, real name Dagvadorj Dolgorsuren, is the third most successful wrestler in sumo's 2,000-year history but also one of the most controversial. He won his 25th Emperor's Cup title last month but during that tournament he allegedly attacked a man in the early hours of January 16 after a night of drinking, leaving him with a broken nose and other facial injuries according to Japanese media reports. In 2007 he became the first grand champion, or Yokozuna, to be suspended after pulling out of a tournament due to a cited injury and then being filmed playing in a charity soccer match. Asashoryu, who divorced from his wife last year, was also the first Yokozuna to be disqualified from a bout after he pulled the top knot of an opponent in 2003. Police have yet to indicate whether they will take action over the latest incident, which initially saw one of Asashoryu's managers say he had been the victim before an unnamed nightclub worker came forward. Japan Today's Web site reported that the two parties had reached a settlement and made a report to the police on Tuesday. The Japan Sumo Association met on Monday to investigate the incident. ''He felt compelled to resign for misconduct which was inexcusable, and the board accepted it,"" its chairman Musashigawa said in a statement. ""I want to apologize to all of the fans and to the person injured in the incident. We will work together to make sure there is no recurrence of this.'' Sumo wrestlers are seen as almost God-like figures in Japan, but the sport's image has been hit recently. In 2008, Russian wrestler Wakanoho was arrested for possessing the illegal drug marijuana and three others were taken away by police over allegations they beat a 17-year-old trainee to death.","Sumo grand champion Asashoryu announces his retirement at tear-filled news conference .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. Senate confirmed Eric Holder as attorney general Monday, voting 75-21 to place him in charge of the Department of Justice. Eric Holder is a former federal prosecutor and served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration. Holder, 58, is a former federal prosecutor and served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration. His confirmation makes him the first African-American confirmed to the post, though he held the job on an acting basis in early 2001. Monday's vote leaves him set to take over a Justice Department battered by a series of controversies during the Bush administration, from questions about how it laid legal groundwork for harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists to the sackings of top federal prosecutors in several cities. ""There's a big job to do, and it's going to be Mr. Holder's duty to turn this department around and restore its credibility,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. During confirmation hearings, Republicans questioned his role in former President Bill Clinton's widely criticized last-minute pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich and questioned whether he would be independent of the White House. Holder had a testy exchange with the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Republican, Arlen Specter, who questioned Holder's ""fitness"" for the office. Holder shot back that Specter was ""getting close to the line in questioning my integrity,"" and Specter ultimately supported the nomination. But Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, cited the pardons and what he called Holder's insufficient support for gun rights in opposing the nomination. ""Mr. Holder is supportive of old ideas for gun control that have never made people safer at the expense of taking away their rights,"" Bunning said. Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy pointed out that the chamber's Republican membership backed Bush administration Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who was forced out in late 2007. The GOP also did not condemn the former president's commutation of the prison term facing ex-White House aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, who was convicted of obstructing justice and lying to federal agents probing the 2003 disclosure of a CIA agent's identity. ""I don't recall any Republicans objecting to that,"" said Leahy, D-Vermont. ""Instead, they're objecting to something President Clinton did. I don't want to suggest in any way that the objections are partisan, but they certainly aren't consistent."" All 21 of the ""no"" votes were Republicans, but more than a dozen GOP senators joined Democrats in confirming Holder. Sen. Christopher ""Kit"" Bond, R-Missouri, said Holder convinced him he would be ""looking forward to keeping the nation safe."" Bond, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, raised concerns that the administration would seek to prosecute U.S. officials involved in using what the Bush administration called ""alternative"" interrogation techniques, measures critics said involved the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody. Holder unambiguously called the use of waterboarding against suspected terrorists a form of torture that violated the Geneva Conventions, but he has said that prosecuting intelligence officials who followed Justice Department guidance would be ""difficult."" Bond said that while Holder's answer focused on U.S. officials who were following the administration's legal advice, ""I told him, and I believe he understood, that trying to prosecute these lawyers or political leaders would generate a political firestorm.""","Eric Holder is a former federal prosecutor, deputy attorney general .

"Washington (CNN) -- Civil rights songs were the soundtrack of the movement that helped bring President Obama to the White House. On Tuesday, Obama welcomed an array of artists to celebrate those songs. An all-star lineup including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Natalie Cole, Smokey Robinson, the Blind Boys of Alabama, John Mellencamp, gospel singer Yolanda Adams and others performed some of the best-known numbers from what Obama called the ""soundtrack"" of the civil rights movement. The concert, ""In Performance at the White House: A Celebration of Music from the Civil Rights Movement,"" was originally scheduled for Wednesday night but was moved to Tuesday as another snow storm moved into the Washington area. According to the White House Web site, the concert marked the beginning of the 2010 White House music series and celebrated Black History month. Black leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. decided on communities to organize when they saw the people were ""disciplined and serious enough to be singing freedom songs,"" Obama said. ""It's hard to sing when times are rough,"" the president said. The hymns of the civil rights movement ""helped carry the cause of the people,"" Obama said. Actor Morgan Freeman served as master of ceremonies for the program at the White House, which will be broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service. Highlight performances included Mellencamp on a rocking version of ""Keep Your Eyes on the Prize,"" and Joan Baez with a spiritual ""We Shall Overcome."" Robinson sang an emotional version of ""Abraham, Martin and John,"" and Dylan played an acoustic guitar on a raspy voiced ""Times They Are a-Changin'."" The Blind Boys of Alabama led the room of dignitaries including first lady Michelle Obama and presidential daughters Malia and Sasha, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and others in a rousing version of ""Free at Last,"" eventually joined on stage by the other performers and Obama.","All-star lineup includes Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Natalie Cole, Smokey Robinson .

"(CNN) -- Thomas the Tank Engine, whose television adventures on the fictional island of Sodor have delighted children around the world for years, is now on a real-life mission to help kids with autism. Thomas the Tank Engine is part of a new online game to help  autistic children recognize different emotions. The steam locomotive and his friends are the stars of a new game in Australia, designed to help autistic children recognize emotions. Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect), a nonprofit that provides services to people diagnosed with the developmental disorder, unveiled the game on its Web site Tuesday. The game asks players to recognize which engine has a sad face, or which is happy or angry. Children with autism often have a difficult time distinguishing different facial expressions. Each time a child plays the game, he/she is presented with a different sequence of emotions. In doing so, the game takes advantage of the single-mindedness of autistic children to assist in their development. ""It's a great way to help develop social and communication skills,"" said Anthony Warren of Aspect. A study conducted in the United Kingdom found that autistic children were far more fascinated by the television series, ""Thomas and Friends,"" than they were with other fictional characters. The study, by the National Autistic Society, summarized that the show held such appeal because of the clear facial expressions of the characters, the pacing of the program and the easy-to-follow story lines. ""We got those results down here, and we thought, how could we leverage that strength and give a little back to the community?"" said Tom Punch with Haven Licensing, the company that handles licensing for the characters in Australia. Warren said one of the reasons Thomas is particularly stimulating and motivating for children with autism is that it's very predictable. ""Children can understand the clear visual messages -- the big smile on the front of the engine,"" he said. ""The messages it communicates are very concrete, not abstract. And the emotions are primary emotions. It's uncomplicated."" Autism is a developmental disorder that affects physical, social and language skills. It usually appears before age 3, though the earliest signs are subtle. More doctors and researchers are referring to ""autism"" as ""autisms,"" because each child's case is different, as are the causes, helpful therapies and potential treatments. The Australian nonprofit unveiled the game this month to coincide with Autism Awareness Month in that country. After all, as the show's theme song attests: ""Red and green and brown and blue; They're the really useful crew.""","Online game uses Thomas the Tank Engine to help autistic children .

"(CNN) -- Diego Milito scored two second half goals as Inter brought an abrupt end to Juventus' 49-match unbeaten run in Serie A with a 3-1 win in Turin Saturday. The Argentina international striker snapped his goal drought against Juve with a coolly taken penalty and then scored the second when Gianlugi Buffon could only parry out a shot by substitute Freddy Guarin. Rodrigo Palacio grabbed a late cinching third to leave Juve stunned after the home side had taken the lead straight from the kick off through Chilean Arturo Vidal. They maintained the advantage and might have added to it during a high-quality first half, but Inter stepped up their game after the break. They have moved to within a point of Juventus at the top of the Italian standings with the pivotal victory. Juve's Angelo Alessio, standing in for Antonio Conte while the coach sits out a lengthy touchline ban, was left disappointed by their defeat. ""Unfortunately we lost after 49 games, but Inter took their chances and we didn't. It doesn't matter that it was Inter who did this -- we played well and had several chances to double our lead in the first half,"" he told Sky Sport Italia. Barcelona stayed on top of La Liga with a hard-fought 3-1 win over Celta Vigo in the Camp Nou to take their record to nine victories and a draw, their best start to a Spanish season. Adriano Correia put Barca ahead after 21 minutes before Mario Bermejo quickly leveled for the visitors. David Villa quickly restored the lead for the leaders and a Jordi Alba goal secured the three points in the second half. Barcelona's arch-rivals and reigning champions Real Madrid kept pace with a 4-0 win over Real Zaragoza but they remained eight points adrift of the leaders. Gonzalo Higuain and Angel Maria struck within two minutes in the first half with Michael Essien and Luka Modric adding late efforts after the break. Second-placed Atletico Madrid lost 2-0 to Valencia in the late game to fall three points behind Barca. Roberto Soldado and Nelson Valdez scored the goals to inflict a first defeat of the season on Atletico. In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich increased their advantage to seven points with a 3-0 win at Hamburg while second-placed Schalke 04 suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at Hoffenheim. Bayern were coming off their shock 2-1 home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen last Sunday but showed no ill effects as Germany midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos all scored in an easy victory. Schalke looked to have salvaged a point when Japan international defender Atsuto Uchida grabbed a late equalizer to make it 2-2, but substitute Sven Schipplock struck for the home side in the first minute of added time to sink the Royal Blues. Eintracht Frankfurt remained third after their 1-1 draw with Guerth Fuerth Friday while defending champions Borussia Dortmund stayed fourth after they were held to a goalless draw by VfB Stuttgart.

"(CNN) -- The remains of Amber DuBois, a 14-year-old San Diego, California-area girl who was missing for more than a year, have been found, police said Sunday. Human skeletal remains found early Saturday in Pala -- a rural, rugged  area in northern San Diego County, California -- have been positively identified as those of DuBois, Police Chief Jim Maher of Escondido, California, said at a news conference. DuBois was last seen walking alone to school on February 13, 2009. Her family lives in Escondido, a suburb of San Diego. Maher did not take questions at the brief news conference, saying the  investigation of DuBois' death is ongoing. ""Any detail, no matter how slight, would be inappropriate at this time,"" he said. The investigation is being handled by Escondido police, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, and the FBI. Amber DuBois' parents, who police said were notified of their daughter's found remains Saturday, attended the press conference. ""We'd like to thank everybody involved in the search for Amber... and above all, our huge volunteer corps,"" her father, Moe DuBois, said. ""They are the most dedicated people you can ever imagine."" ""Without them we cannot have done anything,"" he said. Authorities said last week they were investigating John Albert Gardner III, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to raping and murdering Chelsea King -- another San Diego-area teen -- to determine whether he was connected to Amber DuBois' disappearance. ""We have been working closely with San Diego Sheriff's Office, and our investigators are working with theirs in case there is a connection,"" Lt. Robert Benton with the Escondido Police Department said last week. ""We are involved in the daily briefings on the King investigation."" Amber DuBois' father attended Gardner's arraignment on Wednesday. Maher did not mention any suspects during his brief news conference Sunday.","Remains of Amber DuBois, 14 when she disappeared last year, found in San Diego County .

"(CNN) -- The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Tuesday that ""Hurt Locker"" producer Nicolas Chartier will not be allowed to attend the March 7 awards show because of an e-mail that has been deemed in violation of the Academy's campaigning standards. ""Chartier had recently disseminated an e-mail to certain Academy voters and other film industry figures in which he solicited votes for his own picture and disparaged one of the other contending films,"" the Academy said in a statement Tuesday evening. According to the Los Angeles Times, Chartier's e-mail asked the message recipients to spread the word about the Iraq war movie so that the independent feature would win, ""and not a $500M film,"" which many have interpreted as a slight against James Cameron's box-office blockbuster ""Avatar."" To the Academy, Chartier's appeal to voters and industry insiders crossed the line by ""casting a negative or derogatory light on a competing film,"" which, according to the Academy's statement, is against the organization's rules. Late Monday, the Academy decided that it would rescind only Chartier's invitation, ""stopping short"" of pulling ""The Hurt Locker"" out of the running altogether. If the film wins, remaining producers Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal and Greg Shapiro will accept the award. Chartier would receive his Oscar statuette later.","Nicolas Chartier won't be allowed to attend ceremony .

"(CNN)  -- Rousted out of bed by an early morning phone call, Kay Crosby stood in the rain and watched her church burn. ""We had choir practice Wednesday night, and then Thursday morning, it's gone,"" she said. ""Not even 12 hours later."" Despite the efforts of firefighters from Crosby's town of Wills Point, Texas, and beyond, Russell Memorial United Methodist Church was a total loss. The blaze was one in a string of 11 fires in east Texas churches this year. Eight have been ruled arson, leaving residents and churches on edge as authorities work to find the person -- or persons -- responsible. ""We certainly can connect several of them,"" said Tom Crowley, special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' Dallas, Texas, office. Two fires that broke out Monday had not been ruled arson as of Wednesday, but are considered suspicious, he said. There is no clear theme linking the fires, which have struck various church denominations -- Methodist, Baptist, Church of Christ Scientist -- on different days of the week and at different times of the day, he said. And while the churches are in small towns -- such as Wills Point, which has a population of about 3,800 people -- not all the fires were in remote locations, Crowley said. Authorities believe one person, or perhaps a group of people, are responsible. Investigators have ""people we're looking at"" from tips called in, but ""nothing specific yet,"" he said. ""I think maybe I would characterize the mood of our people as perplexed,"" said Randy Daniels, mayor of Athens, Texas, a town of about 12,000 that has seen three of the church fires. ""... I think most people would just wonder who could be doing this or even why. Most people consider it just incomprehensible and unconscionable that somebody could and would be doing this."" The fires have been a blow, he said, especially in east Texas, which has ""a faithful, church-going people."" Included in the total of 11 is a January church arson in Temple, Texas, Crowley said. Authorities are not sure if it is related to the others, as Temple is more than 150 miles away from the area east of Dallas where most of the fires have occurred. However, the ATF is in contact with investigators on that fire, he said. In addition, he said, one church fire from January has not been ruled arson. In Tyler, Texas, Tyland Baptist Church is ""displaced, but very much alive,"" the Rev. David Mahfood wrote on the church Web site. ""We grieve the loss of [our] church home, the place that we loved and shared so many memories with our church family,"" he wrote. ""It was a very special place to all of us, and our emotions at this time are varied and many."" Tyland burned on January 16, Mahfood told CNN Wednesday, so members have had some time to process the event. Still, he said, there is a ""real feeling of violation, a real feeling of 'I never thought this would happen to me.'"" Like Russell Memorial, the 120-member church was destroyed. ""Not a Bible, not a hymnal"" was left, Mahfood said. ""We've got some bricks. That's it."" Tyland Baptist is currently holding services in another church's sanctuary, he said. Russell Memorial's congregation, which numbers in the hundreds, is meeting in its nearby fellowship building, Crosby said. The burned building hasn't been released back to the church yet, she said Wednesday, although investigators had released it to insurance adjusters. ""We had a big, beautiful sanctuary,"" she said. ""It's a million-dollar loss."" Members are sorrowful, she said, because the church was built by donations -- one person donated the pews, another the cushions, and members donated hymnals, including some in memory of loved ones. A similar string of church arsons occurred in 2006 in rural communities outside of Birmingham, Alabama. Three college students were arrested and pleaded guilty to federal arson charges. Two were sentenced to eight years in prison, while a third was sentenced to seven years. Another string of suspicious church fires took place in the 1990s and led to the enactment of the 1996 Church Arson Prevention Act, which provided funding for investigations and assistance to congregations. But authorization for the act has expired, and Rose Johnson Mackey of the National Coalition for Burned Churches says it should be reauthorized. ""Funding ran out,"" she said. ""By 1998, 1999, 2000, the coordination efforts led by Justice and Treasury, they weren't meeting anymore."" ""If we still had that funding, then some of the people who were victimized in 1996 might not be victimized again in 2010."" The NCBC tallied nearly 500 suspicious church fires from 2005 to 2008, the last year they had complete data, including nearly 200 in 2006. In Texas, Federal authorities are working with the Texas Rangers and the state Department of Public Safety, as well as local police, sheriffs' and fire departments, to investigate the blazes, Crowley said. On Monday, officials contacted a number of local authorities in east Texas, warning them about the fires and urging them to remain vigilant. A number of locations have beefed up police patrols near churches, he said. The churches themselves are ""on heightened alert, I guess you would say,"" said Daniels. Some church members have been staying at their churches, while others are patrolling along with police. ""We're a rural area,"" he said. ""We don't have the cameras and surveillance devices that people have."" Some smaller churches are pooling resources to have overnight security patrols, Mahfood said, while larger churches are patrolling on a volunteer basis. ""The community is on edge,"" he said. ""We're certainly concerned,"" said Tyler Mayor Barbara Bass. In addition, she pointed out, with the current economic downturn, the burned churches will have to rebuild by using resources that could have been used to help assist others in the community. However, ""it's brought the community together in a lot of ways,"" she said. Churches in Tyler held a prayer rally on January 24 to show support for the churches struck by arson. Members are watching out for other churches as well as their own, she said. The ATF is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible, Crowley said. At Russell Memorial, meanwhile, church members are counting their blessings in the face of tragedy. A large brass cross that hung over the choir loft was found and salvaged, Crosby said. ""It was kind of twisted, but we're going to have it restored."" Also found was a cross borne by acolytes during services, she said. Members are grateful the church's offices and records remained intact, she said, as well as the church's set of English handbells. ""We're saddened,"" she said. ""But you know what, that building was not our church. ... We're OK, because we're strong people, and we know that God's hand is on us and he will take care of us.""

"(CNN) -- Pentagon security officer Marvin L. Carraway Jr. saw the man walking toward him. A split second later, he saw the man's gun. ""When I looked at the shooter, he looked at me and I recognized a certain look on his face,"" said Carraway. ""Once I saw that, what went through my mind -- 'This is it, something's about to happen.'"" Authorities say John Patrick Bedell arrived at the Pentagon late Thursday with two 9 mm semi-automatic weapons, at least as many magazines, and a vendetta. The 36-year-old had driven from California to Washington wearing a suit and a calm look. He could have passed for any tourist or worker who went through the security checkpoint every day on the way into the Pentagon. Officer Colin Richards, who mans the booth with Carraway, looked up to see Bedell point his gun at his colleague and fire. ""The shooter was so close,"" Richards recalled. ""I was surprised he missed. I thought he hit Officer Carraway or hit me."" ""There was a lot of chaos,"" said Carraway, a former Marine, who was grazed by Bedell's bullets and suffered minor injuries. Officer Jeffrey Amos was manning an exit area a few strides away. Also a former serviceman, he recognized the popping sound of gunfire and ran toward it. Amos took a bullet in his shoulder, but he and Carraway kept their focus. They fired. Bedell went down, hit with a fatal shot to his head. While Richard and Carraway stood over Bedell, ensuring he was no longer a threat, Amos knew he had to make sure the shooter was working alone. ""I went back to the exit to make sure nobody was going to ambush us from the rear,"" Amos said. On Monday morning, the three spoke with CNN's ""American Morning."" They answered questions directly, letting little emotion show in their voices. Asked whether the experience will always be in his mind when he goes back to work, Amos said that it would linger, but he and his colleagues train for attacks. They expect them. ""It is going to be on my mind,"" said Amos. ""But I'm always visioning [possible attacks] on my post."" ""I guess that's what we're there for,"" he added. ""They train us for the job and we're there to do the job."" Bedell had repeatedly tangled with police and had been institutionalized at least three times for mental problems, according to California authorities. Court records for a man whose name and birth date match Bedell's show that he suffered from bipolar disorder. Bedell appears to have railed against the government repeatedly on the Internet. Through podcasts and a Wikipedia page, a man identified online as JPatrickBedell cast the government as a criminal force destroying personal liberties. ""This seizure of the United States government by an international criminal conspiracy is a long-established reality,"" the man said in a podcast in November 2006, which also was published as text online. Such an organization, the man said, ""would use its powers to convert military, intelligence, and law enforcement bureacracies [sic] into instruments for political control and the domination and subjection of society, while discrediting, destroying, and murdering honest individuals within those services that work to root out corruption and faithfully serve their fellow citizens.""","Security officer on shooter: ""I recognized a certain look on his face""

"(CNN) -- Suppose that shortly after 9/11, when it became clear that Osama bin Laden and other members of al Qaeda were responsible for the attacks, President Bush had made the following announcement: . ""Those responsible for these attacks are cowardly, vicious murderers, and we will pursue them to the ends of the earth to capture them. They are not warriors, they are criminals, and they will be treated accordingly. And once we catch them, we will bring them back to the United States and put them on trial right there in lower Manhattan so that a jury of 12 fair-minded New Yorkers can decide their fate."" Such an announcement would not have been controversial in the slightest and undoubtedly would have been met with widespread approval. After all, putting terrorists on trial in federal court is how we always dealt with terrorists, including the first group of murderers who tried to blow up the World Trade Center. But President Bush didn't say that. Instead, on November 13, 2001, he announced that those responsible would be tried in military commissions, and declared that ""it is not practicable to apply in military commissions . . . the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts."" Like many Americans, I did not adequately consider the implications of that statement at the time. More of us should have challenged the president to explain why it was impracticable to apply regular principles of law and rules of evidence to these criminal suspects. In hindsight, it appears likely that the president's real concern was that he knew he had authorized the CIA to detain suspected terrorists in secret prisons and subject them to harsh interrogation methods. Those grossly abusive techniques would taint potential statements and pose a challenge for future criminal trials. Whatever his motivations, the president's decision to jettison the civilian courts in favor of military commissions was a grave misjudgment that diminished our stature in the world and ultimately accomplished nothing. As I witnessed as a military defense lawyer at Guantanamo Bay, the military commissions of the Bush administration were, indisputably, a catastrophic failure. Not a single person responsible for any major terrorist attack was tried. The countless millions of dollars and man-hours devoted to the commissions yielded only three convictions of minor figures, two -- David Hicks and Salim Hamdan -- who received token sentences and were then released. Neither of these defendants was convicted of a traditional war crime, but of providing material support to terrorism, a crime more appropriately tried in federal court. Since 9/11, many Americans have been tried and convicted of this same offense in federal court and received considerably longer sentences than Hicks or Hamdan. The third detainee who was convicted, Ali Hamza al Bahlul (whom I was assigned to represent but who refused to be defended), received a life sentence. Having sat through the trial, I'm quite confident the prosecutors could have achieved the same outcome in federal court. The convictions of  Hamdan and al Bahlul are now on appeal. Because of the many flaws in the law and procedures under which these men were tried, it is by no means certain that their convictions will be upheld. In November 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder made the decision that President Bush should have made eight years earlier, announcing that the 9/11 suspects would be tried in federal district court. This was more than just a symbolic repudiation of Bush era policies -- after eight years of failed efforts to prosecute the men in military commissions, during which hundreds of other terrorists had been tried and convicted in federal court, it was the only logical choice. Unfortunately, Holder also announced that other detainees would be tried in military commissions, creating a two-tiered system of justice. So far, the attorney general has failed to offer any principled basis for which defendants are sent to which forum, leaving many with the disturbing impression that the decisions are based on political, rather than legal, considerations. The latest news reports suggesting the administration is close to reversing itself has only reinforced this view. It's true that the Military Commissions Act of 2009, the third version of the military tribunals, is a substantial improvement over the previous version of the law, which has hastily passed in 2006 in response to the Supreme Court's ruling that the original military commissions created by executive order were unconstitutional. Indeed, ""the principles of law and rules of evidence"" that generally apply in U.S. criminal courts now largely apply to military commissions, ironically proving false President Bush's original justification for the creation of the military commissions -- the alleged impracticability of applying such principles and rules. Yet, even with improvements, the commissions are still a completely untested criminal justice system. The implementing regulations for the new law have yet to be published. The secretary of defense has failed to appoint a new Convening Authority or a new Chief Defense Counsel for the military commissions. The first hearings under this law have been plagued by confusion and delay, and there's every reason to believe that will continue. How much longer should the families of the 9/11 victims have to wait for justice? Perhaps there are sound practical and logistical reasons why the 9/11 trial should not take place in lower Manhattan; that is debatable. But there are no valid reasons why the 9/11 trial should not take place in a federal court under federal law. Let's show the world what distinguishes Americans from our enemies: our reverence for the rule of law and our respect for human rights and due process, even for those we despise. Let the alleged 9/11 co-conspirators have their day in court under fair, time-tested and internationally accepted laws, rules and procedures. If they are guilty of the appalling crimes of which they are accused, the capable prosecutors of the Justice Department (who have far more experience than their military counterparts) will prove it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frakt.","Obama administration now reconsidering trying 9/11 defendants in court .

"(CNN)  -- Canada is immediately limiting carry-on items for flights to the United States in the aftermath of a failed terror attack on a Northwest Airlines flight. ""Effective immediately, U.S.-bound passengers are not allowed to bring carry-on bags into the cabin of the aircraft, with some exceptions,"" said a statement from Transport Canada. According to the agency, carry-ons will be limited to medication or medical devices, small purses, cameras, coats, infant-care items, laptop computers, containers carrying life-sustaining or special-needs items, musical instruments, or diplomatic or consular bags. Crutches, canes and walkers also are permitted. ""These measures are expected to be in place at least for several days,"" Transport Canada said. Canada made the change after a botched terrorism attack on a U.S.-bound plane. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, is charged with attempting to destroy a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. He attempted to ignite an explosive device sewn into his underwear, authorities say. AbdulMutallab, a Nigerian who had a multiple-entry visa to the United States, had been added to a watch list of 550,000 potential terrorist threats. But ""the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list,"" a U.S. official said. AbdulMutallab first boarded a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria, to Amsterdam. Both Nigerian authorities and KLM, a Northwest partner, say he received secondary security screening. But a U.S. official said Friday that AbdulMutallab was not checked for traces of explosives using a more extensive test. The Transportation Security Administration had invoked a so-called ""one-hour rule"" after the thwarted attack, sources told CNN. The rule prohibited passengers on international U.S.-bound flights from leaving their seats during the last hour of a flight, the sources said. Passengers had to stow pillows and blankets, and maps viewed on in-flight entertainment screens were disabled during the final hour of flight. TSA has since modified the rule, giving airlines and crews discretion over implementation, sources said. ""When we were landing in the U.S. we couldn't get up or have anything on our laps,"" said Rati Lavanig, who traveled from Thailand with her small child. ""It was difficult because right at the end he wanted some milk, and I couldn't give it to him."" Several international airlines posted advisories on their Web sites regarding extra screenings and carry-on bags for international U.S.-bound flights, saying that the U.S. government's revisions have prompted changes for passengers flying to the United States. Only one carry-on bag is allowed for international U.S.-bound flights, the advisories said. Virgin Atlantic advised passengers to check in early; British Airways told passengers to check in normally. Passengers traveling across the United States braced for long lines and delays, as well. Barry and Angela Szczesny arrived at the airport in Detroit, Michigan, three hours ahead of their flight to Washington -- far earlier than they'd usually allow for a domestic flight. In Detroit, long lines at the ticket counters greeted Delta and Northwest passengers early Tuesday, but subsided by around 8 a.m. Security lines were long but moved, forcing passengers to wait only about 15 minutes. CNN's Allan Chernoff, Taylor Gandossy and Sandra Endo contributed to this report .","NEW: TSA modifies rule, gives airlines discretion when passengers may roam .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected al Qaeda member believed to have played a key role in a deadly December attack on CIA employees in Afghanistan appears to have been killed, a U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN Wednesday. Hussein al-Yemeni was the apparent victim of a strike last week in the Miran Shah area of Pakistan, said the official, who called al-Yemeni ""a vicious and dangerous figure who saw himself as an up-and-comer in the terrorist world."" CNN was unable to reach officials in Pakistan Wednesday to confirm the death. Al-Yemeni was believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s and had apparent ties to insurgent groups in Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the official said. Al-Yemeni is thought to have played a key role in the December 30 suicide attack on a U.S. base in southeastern Afghanistan's Khost province, the official said. Seven CIA employees and contractors were killed in the attack, the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight agents. The official did not specify who was responsible for the strike or how it was carried out. The Pakistani and U.S. militaries have been working to rout suspected militants from within the country's borders in the form of airstrikes and arrests. Earlier Wednesday, back-to-back drone strikes killed five suspected militants in the country's northwest tribal region, and at least six Taliban leaders have been arrested in the past month, according to Pakistani officials. ""Al-Yemeni would be the latest victory in a systematic campaign that has pounded al Qaeda and its allies, depriving them of leaders, plotters, and fighters,"" the U.S. official said. ""For them, there can be neither safety nor rest."" CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report.","CNN was unable to reach officials in Pakistan to confirm al-Yemeni's death .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Jerusalem authorities said Friday they hoped a court ruling would end three nights of protests by Israel's ultra-Orthodox community. Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest an arrest and the opening of a parking lot on the Sabbath in Jerusalem on Thursday. The decision by Jerusalem's Magistrate's Court will allow an ultra-Orthodox woman suspected of starving her 3-year-old son to be released from police custody and serve a temporary house arrest instead. The woman, whom police have not named, is from a radical sect of ultra-Orthodox Judaism known as Toldot Aharon, whose members believe that the modern state of Israel and its laws are a man-made creation beneath the religious teachings of the Talmud, the authoritative body of Jewish religious traditions. The case and the riots highlight the existence in Israel of extreme ultra-Orthodox religious groups that are awaiting the return of a messiah and that reject modern secular culture. The woman was arrested by police after staffers at a hospital passed on suspicions that her son was the victim of child abuse. Police officials said they had collected evidence indicating the woman purposely starved the child. Police also said they had reason to believe the woman, who is five months pregnant, physically abused two of her other children. Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aronoth published a photo of the child in which he appeared emaciated and reported the child's weight to be 15 pounds (about 7 kilograms). It said that her supporters had posted bail totaling more than $100,000 for her release. The woman has not made any statements to police, but her husband told Israeli Channel 2 that suspicions that she suffered from Munchausen's syndrome by proxy were not true. ""She was with me all the time. I know she didn't do anything,"" he said. Munchausen's syndrome by proxy is a condition in which a person deliberately causes injury to another in order to gain attention. Her arrest sparked three days of protests in Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, culminating in riots late Thursday in which two dozen people were injured and nine hospitalized, according to police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld. Dozens were arrested in the protests, in which hundreds of traditionally clad ultra-Orthodox, also known as Haredi, threw rocks at police and set garbage bins on fire. Police used water cannons and horse-mounted officers to disperse the crowds. The disturbances resulted in road closures around the city, and municipal officials estimate more than $100,000 in damage to city property. The Haredi riots, which were the worst the city has seen in years, led the city to cut off delivery of social services to some ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods because the safety of municipal workers could not be guaranteed. The protests highlight what has been an increasing tension between the Jerusalem municipality and the city's one-third Haredi population. Disagreement over a recent city plan to open a parking garage on the Sabbath has led to ongoing and sometimes violent protests by ultra-Orthodox Jews. Tamar El-Or, a sociologist at Hebrew University specializing in ultra-Orthodox groups, says the Haredi community is facing increasing problems of poverty and joblessness, which the community's leaders are making worse by ""constant pushing of families to enlarge ... where they have less economic support."" El-Or said cooperation between the ultra-Orthodox community and the city, which had improved in recent years, was a source of anger among the more radical Haredi groups like Toldot Aharon, which does not believe in the state of Israel. ""Extremists are using the case to really stress the point you should never collaborate with those Zionists -- you should never collaborate with those institutions -- all the efforts made during the last years to create those very gentle and fragile collaborations is now broken,"" she said. Zionism is the movement calling for Jews of all persuasions to return to their homeland.","Jerusalem Magistrate's Court to allow woman suspected of child abuse to go home .

"Petite Riviere de L'Artibonite, Haiti (CNN) -- The town of Petite Riviere de L'Artibonite lies two hours north of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Makeshift tents dot a hillside there, flimsy shelters made of sheets and coconut branches that are a respite from the sun, but no match for the recent torrent of rains that wash down rotting bodies from a nearby slope. At night, the lights from aid camps and surrounding areas do not reach here. It is pitch black. It is not the first time Marlie Casseus, 18,  has seen hell. A few years ago, the Haitian teen was forging a new future after doctors removed a massive tumor-like growth that had taken over her face, threatening her life and forcing her into mortified seclusion. She was making her way back into the world and smiling again. Today that future, like those of countless other Haitian children with chronic health issues, is threatened by fractures in the country's already weak health care system. If Marlie's name sounds familiar, it's because her story was featured in a 2004 Discovery Health special. In 2009, a follow-up episode chronicled her ongoing progress. Marlie suffered from polyostic fibrous dysplasia, a genetic disorder that causes bone tissue to degenerate and form a tumor-like mass. The tumor had consumed Marlie's life so wholly, her family contacted the International Kid's Fund in Miami, Florida. IKF Wonderfund, which is affiliated with Jackson Memorial Hospital, sponsors critically ill children from Latin America and the Caribbean. They agreed to take her case, and over the course of a year, doctors removed the 14-pound tumor and reconstructed Marlie's nose, jaw and lips. After several grueling surgeries, the face that had been rendered so unrecognizable bore the warmth of a familiar pair of brown eyes -- and a smile. ""When she was sick, we were so worried,"" said Stellecie Casseus, Marlie's sister. ""She grew big and big, we were so sad and upset about that. But after surgery, she looked better. She feels better. She doesn't want to kill herself."" The procedures reversed years of suffering and reclusiveness for Marlie, a change the family says affected far more than her face. ""She felt good,"" Stellecie said. ""All of the family feels good when Marlie feels good."" Six years later, as death rumbled through the streets of Port-au-Prince, Marlie faced the worst once again. ""All of the children were studying when it happened,"" said Stellecie. ""Marlie was with me. She was reading. When we felt the quake, we went, and Marlie fell. She cried. I remember that she cried a lot that day."" With the family gathered in the front yard, the tremors struck and their house crumbled to the ground. An aunt who was sleeping at the time of the quake died inside the home. Although the story of their survival may seem miraculous, Marlie and her family now face a suffocating new reality. Marlie's mother, Maleine, said they have no electricity and limited access to food. ""The situation is so bad, very bad for us, because we have lost something very big for the Haitian people,"" said Maleine. ""We have no house, no food, no city."" The people in their tattered, makeshift town are bitten raw by mosquitoes, bees and giant spiders. Gunshots ring out in the night and the stench of rotting bodies is a constant reminder of the fate Marlie's family narrowly managed to escape. Gina Eugene, a nurse for IKF, said young girls are left to wander the streets unprotected, and rape is a constant and heavy threat. ""It is hell,"" she said. ""All I can tell you, this is no life. No human wants to live like this."" In addition, IKF's efforts to get Marlie to Miami for further care have been stalled. Important documents were lost in the rubble of the family's ruined house, and without them, Marlie cannot leave. With the country in chaos, getting new visas or medical parole seems to be out of the question. IKF Director Jinelle Prieto said the recent controversy surrounding a group of American missionaries accused of child trafficking has left people unwilling to transport children for fear of legal action. ""There are no answers for anybody,"" she said. ""I have people that will bring Marlie over, but everybody's scared that they're going to be charged with kidnapping. Everybody is just running into walls. They see these kids dying every day, but nobody will risk bringing them over."" The staggering truth is Marlie is just one of the scores of Haitian children IKF and other organizations are scrambling to save. Prieto said nearly 30 of their kids are stranded in Haiti waiting for help, and there are countless more who could be endangered by lack of care for otherwise treatable conditions. She said her organization already has lost one child, a 4-year-old boy who had recently undergone open-heart surgery. He died after suffering a heart attack during an aftershock. ""All of these organizations have launched these campaigns, they have the money, the hospitals have stepped up, but they can't reach them,"" Prieto said. ""It is absolutely mind-boggling. Every single doctor, every single volunteer, every single person of leadership, nobody knows what to do."" Despite the recent earthquake in Chile and the threat of waning public concern, it is clear the struggle in Haiti is far from over. Marlie's mother and sister said it is hard to find hope among the ruins. ""We are in trouble now,"" Stellecie said. ""We don't know what to do. We don't know what we can do. We just need help. Marlie is OK, but she doesn't feel good because she is upset about so many things."" When asked what the future may hold, Maleine was at a loss for words. ""I lost everything,"" she said. ""I just ask for God to have some help for my family.""","Doctors removed massive growth from Haitian teen's face several years ago .

"Washington (CNN) -- A retired U.S. general said Thursday that the Dutch policy of allowing openly gay soldiers to serve in its military led, in part, to its failure to halt the massacre of Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, ""nations like Belgium, Luxembourg, the Dutch, et cetera, firmly believed there was no longer a need for an active combat capability in the militaries,"" John Sheehan, former supreme allied commander - Atlantic, told a Senate hearing on the don't ask, don't tell policy under which gays are not allowed to serve in the U.S. military openly. ""As a result, they declared a peace dividend and made a conscious effort to socialize their military,"" he said. ""That includes the unionization of their militaries. It includes open homosexuality demonstrated in a series of other activities, with a focus on peacekeeping operations, because they did not believe the Germans were going to attack again or the Soviets were coming back. ""That led to a force that was ill-equipped to go to war. The case in point that I'm referring to is when the Dutch were required to defend Srebrenica against the Serbs. The battalion was under-strength, poorly led, and the Serbs came into town, handcuffed the soldiers to the telephone poles, marched the Muslims off and executed them,"" Sheehan said. ""That was the largest massacre in Europe since World War II."" Asked whether Dutch leaders had told him that the Dutch military's performance was linked to its gay soldiers, he said, ""Yes. ... They included that as part of the problem."" He was referring to the incident that began July 11, 1995, when Serb forces overran the United Nations ""safe zone"" of Srebrenica and systematically executed men and boys while expelling the rest of the Muslim population. In all, 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed. Asked which Dutch officers had told him that the debacle at Srebrenica was in part due to the fact that gay soldiers serve in the Dutch army, Sheehan cited a ""Hankman Berman,"" whom he described as ""the chief of staff of the army who was fired by the parliament because they couldn't find anybody else to blame."" A spokeswoman for the Dutch Embassy in Washington said Dutch officials did not know to whom Sheehan was referring. A former general, Henk van den Breemen, is identified in news reports as having served as Dutch chief of defense staff from 1994-1998. CNN was not able to reach him. In a statement issued after the hearing, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said, ""Srebrenica was an unconscionable massacre, but it's way off the mark to attribute it in any way to the fact that gays can serve openly in the Dutch military, which failed to protect Srebrenica's citizens. ""I know of no historian or commentator who has attributed this massive failure to protect the citizens of Srebrenica to Dutch policy on gays serving openly in their military. The U.S. military serves side by side with the Dutch in Afghanistan without any difficulty whatsoever."" In a written statement, the Dutch ambassador to the U.S., Renee Jones-Bos, said of Sheehan's comments, ""I couldn't disagree more. ""I take pride in the fact that lesbians and gays have served openly and with distinction in the Dutch military forces for decades, including in leading operational positions, such as in Afghanistan at the moment,"" she said. ""The military mission of Dutch U.N. soldiers at Srebrenica has been exhaustively studied and evaluated, nationally and internationally. There is nothing in these reports that suggests any relationship between gays serving in the military and the mass murder of Bosnian Muslims."" Sheehan, who retired from the military in 1997, told the Senate Committee on Armed Services that he opposed a proposal to let gays serve openly in the U.S. military. The American Psychological Association submitted testimony to the committee that said ""scientific research has demonstrated that ending the ban on openly gay people serving in the military is unlikely to reduce military readiness or unit cohesion."" It said the gay ban was suspended during the Gulf War with no apparent detrimental impact on military readiness.

"(CNN) -- A Boonton, New Jersey, man's plot to have his wife shot to death included having himself shot as well in an attempt to conceal his involvement, New Jersey prosecutors said Friday. Kashif Parvaiz was wounded four times, and his wife, Nazish Noorani, was fatally shot about 11 p.m. Tuesday as the couple pushed a stroller carrying their 3-year-old son, Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi said at a news conference. Parvaiz and Antoinette Stephen of Boston, both 26, have been arrested, charged with murder, conspiracy and unlawful possession of a weapon, Bianchi said. Parvaiz also is charged with hindering apprehension and endangering the welfare of a child. The boy was uninjured, Bianchi said. The fact that Noorani, a Muslim, was killed during the holy month of Ramadan ""made this case especially compelling to us,"" he said. According to an affidavit on file with the court, Parvaiz has told police he arranged for Stephen to kill his wife and wound him while the couple was out for a walk. While being treated for his wounds, which were not life-threatening, Parvaiz described the shooters as three men who shouted ""slurs about terrorists"" at the couple before fleeing on foot, according to a release from Morris County prosecutors. But within hours of the crime, investigators believed ""it was obvious"" the victim's husband was behind the attack, Bianchi said. Noorani, 27, had sent text messages to her brother describing escalating hostility and abuse in her marriage, the affidavit says, warning that ""someday u will find me dead but its cuz of kashi ... He wants to kill me."" Bianchi said Stephen was arrested in Boston on Thursday night. On Friday, prosecutors would not characterize the relationship of Parvaiz and Stephen. Bail for Parvaiz is set at $1 million while Stephens, awaiting extradition, is being held in lieu of $5 million. Attempts to locate an attorney who could speak on behalf of Parvaiz or Stephen were not immediately successful Friday afternoon.","Police say man wounded in his wife's shooting death was behind the attack .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- The death toll from a powerful car bomb Wednesday morning in Buenaventura, Colombia, rose to six as the day went on, with at least 42 people wounded, authorities said. The explosion occurred in the town center, near City Hall and the regional attorney general's office, causing panic and chaos among nearby residents. A local hospital declared a state of emergency, media reported. Images on CNN affiliate Caracol TV showed mangled vehicles, one with an engine next to it on the sidewalk. Buildings also showed significant damage. The TV images also showed residents carrying off wounded people. There were no immediate claims of responsibility or a motive. ""It was a very powerful explosion,"" said Luz Morales, a reporter for Caracol TV who witnessed the blast. After the bomb went off, ""I couldn't hear anything, I couldn't see anything,"" she told CNN en Español. Gen. Freddy Padilla, commander of Colombia's armed forces, identified four of Wednesday's six victims as civilians and one as a policeman. The identity of the sixth was not immediately known. Padilla said he suspects the bomb was planted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The Marxist insurgent group has been weakened during the presidency of Alvaro Uribe, but has been fighting the Colombian government for more than 45 years. FARC guerrillas were suspected in a recent incident in Buenaventura in which seven tractor-trailers were set on fire on the main highway connecting the port to the rest of the country. Colombian Deputy Attorney General Guillermo Mendoza said he suspects drug traffickers. ""My first thought is that is an act by drug trafficking groups that operate in this area,"" he said. ""It could be a confrontation between rival drug groups or a retaliation against the regional attorney general's office."" The bomb was inside a Mazda 323 hatchback, he said. Buenaventura is Colombia's largest seaport, handling approximately two-thirds of its international imports and exports.

"(CNN) -- Tokyo faces the possibility of being hit by a massive earthquake within the next four years, according to Japanese researchers. The University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute predicts there is a 70% probability that the capital's metropolitan area will experience a magnitude-7 quake within four years and a 98% probability within the next 30 years. Nearly one year ago, a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off Japan's central Pacific coast, triggering a devastating tsunami and aftershocks that left more than 15,700 dead, according to a government report in December on Japan's recovery from the catastrophe. About 4,500 were listed as missing. Nearly 700 aftershocks registering magnitude 5 or greater followed last year's quake, the government report said. The March 11 earthquake -- dubbed ""Tohoku"" after the region in which it occurred -- also damaged the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station, where three reactors experienced full meltdowns, creating a nuclear crisis for a country already grappling with disaster. The research institute cited for its findings the Gutenberg Richter Law, which states that an increase in small tremors will likely increase the number of larger earthquakes. According to another paper published in September, the institute concluded that the quake ruptured a fault area nearly 500 kilometers in length and 200 kilometers wide offshore. The fourth strongest quake recorded in history, Tohoku caused abrupt stress changes in the upper plate and triggered widespread seismic activity throughout the Japanese island. The northern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, in particular, saw a significant increase of shallow seismicity after the quake compared with the extremely low rate eight years prior, the researchers said. Should Tokyo's inhabitants be worried? The research institute's findings carry great consequences for the 42 million people who live in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The Central Disaster Management Council has estimated that a large-scale earthquake in the next few decades could result in 11,000 deaths and an economic loss of 112 trillion yen (US$1.5 trillion). Its goal is to halve the estimated death toll and reduce the estimated economic loss. How precise are seismic forecasts? Gary Gibson, a seismologist at Australia's Seismology Research Centre, called the Earthquake Research Institute's findings ""not at all unexpected,"" given the level of seismic activity and their model. ""Seismologists cannot predict with certainty when, where and how large the next big earthquake will be,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""However, it is possible to forecast the probability of an earthquake in a particular time range (e.g. the next four years), location area (e.g. the Tokyo region), and magnitude range (e.g. greater than magnitude 7.0). ""Long-term forecasts use average activity levels from all known past earthquakes, geological data from fault displacements, and data about plate movement and deformation from very precise GPS measurements and other methods to determine these probabilities."" What is the government saying? The government's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion had put a 70% probability of a magnitude-7 quake in Kanto region, which encompasses Tokyo and Yokohama, within 30 years, based on long-term seismicity and hazard studies. Scientists have already dubbed as ""Tokai"" an expected 8.0 quake near Suruga Bay, where large quakes have historically struck every 100-150 years, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The last one, a magnitude-8.4 quake, occurred in 1854 -- nearly 160 years ago. According to Gibson, the seismologist, the enhanced seismicity in the area affected by the Tohoku quake may fall towards normal levels and could affect the research institute's findings. Results for the six-month period after the quake would become available after this coming March 11, the quake's anniversary, he noted. Why is Japan so prone to earthquakes? The Japanese archipelago and neighboring areas rest on or around four tectonic plates -- the Pacific, Philippine Sea, North American and Eurasian plates -- whose movements account for one of the most seismically active places on earth. Can Tokyo withstand a 7.0 quake? Gibson said that while the area is a very active one seismically, building standards are high, therefore reducing the damage caused by earthquakes. Buildings in Tokyo held up well in the face of the ""Tohoku"" quake. Reinforced concrete and anti-seismic systems in buildings are among features that have helped absorb shocks when earthquakes occur. Watch Tokyo's quake-proof communities . ""A magnitude 7.0 earthquake is very much smaller than the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake,"" he wrote. ""It would need 1,000 magnitude-7.0 earthquakes to release as much strain energy as the magnitude 9.0. The fault rupture size is tens of kilometers, rather than hundreds of kilometers, and the fault displacement two to three meters rather than 20 to 30 meters."" Serious damage could be limited, if it occurs offshore, he added. And the shallower the quake, such as within 10 kilometers of the surface, the more localized the damage.

"(CNN) -- Actors call it ""backstory."" Hugh Jackman stars as the title character in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" It's all the stuff that happened in the past, before the movie begins. All the stuff that might explain how the character became what he or she is today. It's obvious why that might be fascinating to the actor playing the role. But as for the rest of us, well, you have to figure the writer left it out for a reason. But these days we're seeing a lot more ""origin"" stories as the studios milk each franchise for every last drop, and thus arrives ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" about the blade-wielding character Hugh Jackman plays. (Jackman, no dummy, has a producer credit on the film.) You can be sure that someone at Twentieth Century Fox will be running the numbers Monday with a view to fast-tracking a sequel to this prequel, as well as further putative episodes devoted to Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm, Mystique and the rest of the class of X. Based on ""Wolverine,"" it's hard to get excited about the prospect. The film exhibits all the overly familiar hallmarks of the 21st-century comic book movie: an inflated sense of its own importance, turgid plotting and action sequences designed to showcase lavish CGI effects. In many ways, it was the first ""X-Men,"" back in 2000, that set the tone. On the one hand, director Bryan Singer embedded an earnest allegory about prejudice and minority rights; on the other, it was an FX geek's wet dream. Each mutant came with her or his own gimmick: One could shapeshift; another could levitate; yet another had a bad case of wind. The mutants all shared the same nasty temper, but Logan/Wolverine (Jackman) had the shortest fuse -- and the silliest haircut, a '50s ducktail with ferocious rockabilly sideburns. Predictably enough, ""Origins"" devotes more time to exploring the roots of his anger issues than his hair, but it doesn't worry about where his most distinctive genetic features might have come from: the retractable claws that spring from his knuckles when he's irked and his invulnerability to anything short of decapitation. In ""Wolverine,"" Logan has lost his taste for war in Vietnam after more than a century as a fighting man (or mutant) and finally walks away in disgust from the elite mutant unit put together by Col. Stryker (Danny Huston). But his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) has other ideas and knows how to get Wolverine to embrace his true, animalistic, nature. Borrowing wholesale from ""The Incredible Hulk,"" with Schreiber fairly effective in the Abomination part, ""Wolverine"" struggles to establish an identity of its own. The two brothers charge at each other like medieval knights jousting, and Victor -- also known as Sabretooth -- affects a dog-like, four-legged bound. But no matter how often he tries it, director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") never works out how to make a fight between indestructible foes tense or exciting. That's the trouble with CG-enhanced action: What you gain in spectacle, you lose in impact. Filmmakers today can engineer destruction on a scale that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago, but it's all so much collateral damage. It's rare, these days, for an American action movie to impart any genuine sense of pain or hurt or loss. Too much Wow, not enough Ow! In fairness, there are fleeting moments in ""Wolverine"" where we do feel Logan's emotional anguish. But they're only as a prelude to his anger, which is the only quality an audience is likely to find interesting about him. Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this ""Wolverine"" movie does just enough to keep the ""X-Men"" franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is rated PG-13 and runs 108 minutes.

"(CNN) -- A flowering California shrub thought to be extinct in the wild for almost seven decades was added to the federal endangered species list Wednesday after a sharp-eyed biologist spotted the plant on a highway median while driving off the Golden Gate Bridge. The last known Franciscan manzanita (Arctostaphylos franciscana) was discovered in 2009 during a highway construction project, and after genetic tests confirmed the species, the state spent $109,000 on a crane to move the plant and its 12.5-ton root ball to another site so the $1 billion project could continue, federal and state officials said. The low-growing coastal shrub was relocated to another area in the Presidio of San Francisco, a 1,491-acre national park next to the Golden Gate Bridge, federal officials said. The evergreen is estimated to be more than 50 years old and was growing a few feet from traffic along the Doyle Drive roadway, also designated as U.S. Highway 101, which connects the bridge and San Francisco, officials said. Cry endangered wolf? Not in Wyoming. The plant lay hidden under eucalyptus and other trees, officials said. When the trees were cleared, the manzanita became visible for the first time in decades and was spotted by biologist Daniel Gluesenkamp, director of habitat restoration for Audubon Canyon Ranch, who was driving home from speaking at a climate change conference, according to federal officials and the Wild Equity Institute. Gluesenkamp noticed the unusual plant while driving 40 mph in heavy traffic, and he confirmed his suspicions about the plant's identity when he returned to the site a few days later, the institute said. The manzanita was last seen in the wild in 1947 when a botanist stood in front of earth-moving equipment and saved what was then believed to be the last known wild specimen from a construction site, the institute said. The botanist sent the plant to a botanical garden. The manzanita found in 2009 had grown to a healthy size: Its roots stretched 20 feet wide and sank 18 inches into the soil, officials said. The plant's bright green leaves are smooth, flat and wider toward the tips. The shrub likes open bedrock outcrops and reaches 3 feet in height, displaying pinkish flowers from January to April. It reproduces from seed after a fire or other disturbance, and the seeds are eaten and dispersed by raccoons, coyotes, foxes, deer, rodents, quail and turkey, the wildlife service said. The agency is now proposing about 318 acres of federal and state parkland in San Francisco and the surrounding county be designated as critical habitat for the shrub, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Sarah Swenty. Clues to saving Tasmanian Devil from extinction . The plant is known only to exist on the San Francisco peninsula area and prefers serpentine soil, a low-nutrient area that allows it to out-compete non-native plants, officials said. ""Genetic diversity in plants is really important, as in animals as well,"" Swenty said. ""When you lose a link in the chain, there are unknown consequences that you can't see. ""This plant has been used to prevent erosion on our hillsides in the San Francisco area, so it is certainly of benefit to people as well as plants,"" Swenty added. The Wild Equity Institute said protecting the long-lost plant under the Endangered Species Act closes ""one of our coldest conservation cases."" The institute petitioned the federal government to put the plant -- ""a subtly charming flowering shrub,"" the group says -- on the endangered species list, the organization said. The Center for Biological Diversity and the California Native Plant Society co-petitioned for the protections, the institute said.

"(CNN) -- A plan to burn an effigy of Lance Armstrong -- and adorn it with references to Jimmy Savile, the British broadcaster accused of child sex offenses -- has caused outrage. The residents of an English town want to set ablaze a giant likeness of the cyclist this weekend as part of an annual ritual that focuses on popular hate-figures. The nine-meter high structure has around its neck a medal referencing Jimmy Savile, who died a year ago at the age of 84 and is now the center an investigation into hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse. The effigy, organized by the Edenbridge Bonfire Society, has already been criticized by members of the public ahead of the planned November 5 burning. ""Shame on you for selecting Lance Armstrong as your guy; who has personally raised over $500 million for cancer charities,"" read a comment from one visitor to the society's website on Thursday. ""What message are you trying to project? If the organizing committee had any morals or backbone you would scrap this decision and to further associate him with Jimmy Savile is disgraceful."" Lance Armstrong's demise: How an all-American hero fell to earth . Annual bonfire celebrations and fireworks displays are held across Britain on November 5 to mark a failed attempt by Guy Fawkes and others to blow up the houses of parliament and kill King James I in 1605. Fawkes was hanged as punishment for his part in the ""gunpowder plot."" Where once the November 5 ritual of burning effigies reflected political turmoil and dissension among the population, now it has become a family event controlled by strict rules and regulations -- but one where the wry British sense of mischief still emerges, making targets of establishment figures. Bonfires are traditionally decorated with a stuffed ""Guy,"" but Edenbridge Bonfire Society has gained a reputation for using celebrities instead. In 2011 it was controversial Manchester City soccer star Mario Balotelli, who caused a fire by setting off fireworks in his own home despite being the face of a firework safety campaign. Other celebrity ""victims"" have included former British prime minister Tony Blair, ex-French president Jacques Chirac and deceased Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. This year it is a yellow-jersey clad Armstrong holding a sign saying: ""For Sale Racing Bike, No Longer Required."" The effigy also has a medal reading ""Jim Fixed It For Me"" -- a reference to one of the television shows formerly hosted by Savile. Lance Armstrong's epic downfall . Another comment on the Edenbridge society's website read: ""Burning an effigy of a living person is disgraceful and wrong! I hope that all good minded people will condemn these actions. English people are today being broadcast in the news worldwide as effigy burners. ""These actions providing temporary laughs to a small minded mob will potentially have longer lasting negative repercussions around the world."" Another said: ""Lance Armstrong is 2 people a sportsman and a Cancer crusader whose efforts have helped thousands of people around the world. To pair him up with a child sex offender is unjust!"" Many societies similar to the body in Edenbridge exist across the county of Kent. The annual displays commemorate both Guy Fawkes and the deaths of 17 Protestant martyrs, known as ""The Sussex Martyrs,"" between 1555 and 1557. The Edenbridge society said it had considered depicting Savile, British chancellor George Osbourne or extradited Muslim cleric Abu Hamza. ""We had a shortlist which included Jimmy Savile but it was decided it would not be nice to use him as a lot of children attend the bonfire and they might start asking their parents questions,"" its co-ordinator Charles Laver told the UK Press Association. ""Then we had George Osborne but he hasn't really got a face that everyone knows and he's just a chap in a suit. We felt he would be a bit boring. ""We started to do Abu Hamza but then we decided we weren't entirely happy to do him, so Lance Armstrong came out of the woodwork. He's better because he's brighter ... We're very pleased with it."" Meanwhile, the fallout from the Armstrong doping scandal -- which led to the American being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and told to pay back millions of dollars in prize money and sponsorships -- continues in the world of cycling. The International Olympic Committee announced Thursday that it will investigate whether to strip the 41-year-old of the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Games. One of Armstrong's former teammates, Australian Matt White, was forced off the Orica-GreenEDGE team after admitting to using performance-enhancing substances during his professional career. White rode on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team between 2001 and 2003. His confession is the latest in a series of admissions from pros within the sport. Team Sky, which boasts 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins among its ranks, parted company with team director Steven de Jongh after the Dutchman admitted to taking banned substances during his 14-year career. American coach Bobby Julich also left the British team last week after coming clean regarding past doping offenses.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan -- the world's second-largest economy -- is in a recession, government officials announced Monday. Japan's Cabinet Office confirmed that its economy shrank another 0.1 percent in the third quarter, following a 0.9 percent drop in the second quarter. The country's gross domestic product -- second to the United States -- has fallen by 0.4 percent this year, pushing Japan into its first recession since 2001. Major indexes around the globe have plummeted over the last two months. The Russian stock market has lost 65.5 percent of its value since the start of the year. Stocks in Japan and the United States have been equally hard hit, falling 42 percent and 33 percent, respectively. In Europe, the pain has been particularly acute. The European Union on Friday officially declared that the 15-nation group had entered into a recession, with its gross domestic product declining 0.2 percent for the second straight quarter. Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso was among the Group of 20 world leaders who met in Washington over the weekend, unveiling a set of sweeping plans aimed at tackling the ever-expanding economic crisis, which has roiled financial markets worldwide. The G-20 members at the historic two-day meeting managed to find some common ground on the causes of the crisis and areas that need to be fixed. The plans include interest rate cuts by central banks around the globe or potential economic stimulus packages, and boosting developing countries struggling under the weight of the crisis. Japan's recession announcement was not unexpected. Part of the problem is the strong yen, which skyrocketed in recent weeks as turmoil in the world's financial markets and concerns about a global recession drove investors away from high-yielding currencies such as the euro and the pound. As a result, lower-yielding currencies like the dollar and the yen surged in value, because they are considered by many investors to be a safe haven. Since Japan is such a big exporter of goods, a more robust yen hurts profits for Japanese firms as sales from abroad get translated back into yen. The more that the yen has climbed, the worse Japan's stock market has performed, which has resulted in a ripple effect on European and U.S. exchanges. After an early sell-off Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index rebounded with a gain of about 2 percent late in the morning.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's cancer surgery Wednesday was successful, her spokesman said. There were no complications during the 3 1/2 -hour operation to remove Fernandez's thyroid gland, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said. Last week doctors said tests indicated that the papillary carcinoma detected in Fernandez's thyroid had not spread to her lymph nodes or grown beyond the gland. The president was awake after Wednesday's surgery and will recover in a post-operation room for 72 hours, Scoccimarro said. Hundreds of supporters waved flags and banners outside the Austral Hospital, located about 60 kilometers (35 miles) from Buenos Aires. ""The truth is I was praying a lot, with all my strength, and now I feel very happy. I think the Virgin has granted a miracle,"" supporter Sofia Godoy said shortly after the spokesman's announcement. Some said they planned to stay camped outside the hospital until the president's release. ""We are going to wait a little more until she recuperates from everything and can come outside,"" Angel Cifo said. ""We hope to wait to see if we can say hello."" Before the operation, Fernandez handed over power to Vice President Amado Boudou until January 24. Fernandez, 58, was sworn in for a second four-year term last month after she won re-election with more than 54% of the vote. She became Argentina's president in 2007. Her husband, Nestor Kirchner, was president from 2003 to 2007. He died in October 2010. During Fernandez's presidency, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has a high survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. More than 95% of adults with papillary thyroid carcinoma survive at least 10 years, according to a description on the library's website. Treatment includes surgery, radioactive iodine and medication, the library says. During Fernandez's surgery, doctors also likely took tissue samples from her lymph nodes to examine whether the cancer has spread, Washington-based oncologist Dr. Elmer Huerta told CNN. ""Now they are going to study them,"" Huerta said. ""That's why it is very important that we wait for the next report, which will be in about 10 days.""

"(CNN)  -- A Kentucky pastor said it was ""easier"" that a Mennonite couple that was engaged to be married died together in a car crash Friday instead of one having to live without the other. ""I'm just thankful that not one of them was left behind. It would be so much easier for them this way, both being able to go, be together in heaven,"" Leroy Kauffman, pastor of the Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood Church in Burkesville, said in a press conference Friday. The two were among 11 people killed in a fiery crash Friday morning after a tractor-trailer crossed a median and smashed head-on into a van in what is being called Kentucky's deadliest vehicle wreck in 20 years. The driver of the tractor-trailer, which was operated by Hester Inc., from Fayette, Alabama, was killed, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday. The passengers in the 15-person van were Mennonites traveling to a wedding in Iowa, Kauffman said. Nine of them were congregants in his church. ""It's been a tremendous shock,"" he told reporters later. ""At the same time, we're experiencing the grace and peace of God."" Mennonites and Amish trace their roots to the same Anabaptist movement and share some of the same beliefs concerning baptism, non-resistance, and basic Bible doctrines. They differ in dress, technology, language, form of worship, and interpretation of the Bible, according to Third Way Cafe, a Web site run by the Mennonite Missionary Network. WLKY: 10 family members die in wreck . John Eshe, a fellow minister in the church and his wife, Sadie, were killed, Kauffman said. So were four of the couple's 12 children; a daughter-in-law, a baby grandson and their daughter's fiance, Kauffman said. CNN affiliate WBKO reported that the 10th person in the van was a friend of the family. Two children, ages 3 and 5, survived, Kauffman said. They were adopted from Guatemala by the Eshes' eldest son, Leroy, and his wife, who were both killed, Kauffman said. The couple's third adopted child, a baby who was likely held by someone in the car when the crash occurred, was killed, Kauffman said. The surviving boys are with their mother's parents, the pastor said. A trucker who came upon the scene found the two of them alive and put them in his truck, where they fell asleep, he said, and they were ""kept warm"" there until the officials arrived. ""They're very sweet, very intelligent little boys,"" he said. The family was ""mission-minded,"" the pastor said, explaining that two of the couple's other children are missionaries in Brazil, and a son, Johnny, died on a mission trip to the Ukraine three years ago, he said. ""You can see that John's heart was to have his children in the work of the Lord,"" Kauffman said. The NTSB will begin an investigation into the wreck Saturday morning, spokesman Peter Knudson said. ""It's so early in the investigation, so we've ruled nothing out, but we do know the tractor-trailer did leave the roadway and crossed the barrier. We do know that happened, we don't know why it occurred,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of work to do."" The wreck happened between 5:30 a.m. and 6 a.m. at mile marker 63 on Interstate 65, roughly 40 miles northwest of Bowling Green, near Mammoth Cave National Park, said Lt. David Jude, a spokesman for the Kentucky State Police. Authorities briefly closed the southbound lanes of Interstate-65 so medical helicopters could land, but those lanes soon reopened. The northbound lanes remained closed early Friday afternoon, Jude said. Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear offered his condolences. He said his office was in contact with emergency personnel and will follow the investigation. ""Today and the days that follow will be very difficult for these families and the surrounding community,"" he said. ""Our entire state grieves with the community and all the families will remain in our thoughts and prayers."" Meanwhile, members of the tight-knit Mennonite community where most of the victims came from were trying to come to terms with the deaths. ""Life will go on, but it'll be difficult,"" said Kai Steinmann, a neighbor and friend of the Eshes. ""For us as a community, I think it's going to mean that a big piece of us is gone."" Steinmann, 25, described the Mennonite community as a ""largely construction-oriented"" group of about 100 people that formed 10 years ago. The night before the accident, Steinmann said the Eshe family attended a church meeting with other members of the community, expressing excitement over the wedding and requesting prayers for safe travel. ""We will accept it as the will of God,"" Steinmann said. ""This isn't an accident, God knew this from the beginning and that will be one of the beginning things that the community will do, accept it as the will of God.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry turned 25 Tuesday in the knowledge that he is now entitled to part of the multi-million dollar inheritance left to him by his late mother. Prince Harry is currently training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army. Harry was just 12 years old when Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997. His mother left an estate worth £21 million ($35 million), but more than £8 million ($13.31 million) was paid in inheritance tax, leaving around £13 million ($21.6 million) to be shared between Harry and his brother William, who is second in line to the throne, the British Press Association reported. Much of that money is thought to have been invested but it is not known if the economic downturn has affected the amount. Both princes are prevented from spending the lump sum of their inheritance until they turn 30. But Harry will pocket all income generated by his portion of the estate -- around £300,000 ($500,000) a year.  Watch more about Prince Harry's birthday windfall » . Prince Harry joined the British Army in 2006 and served in Afghanistan for more than two months from the end of 2007 to early 2008, before being withdrawn after news of his secret deployment leaked out to the media. There had been fears that Harry, who is third in line to the throne, could become a target for Taliban militants. According to British media reports, the prince's deployment was subject to a news blackout deal struck between the Ministry of Defence and newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad. He received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant in April last year and is now training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army's Air Corps. The young royal has also created a few negative headlines, particularly in Britain's tabloid press, in recent years. In February this year, he was formally disciplined by his Army superiors after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language -- referring to a fellow soldier as a ""Paki"" and another as looking ""like a raghead."" A spokesman for the prince told CNN: ""Prince Harry has apologized for his comments and has been subjected to normal Army disciplinary procedures. The matter is now closed."" In a well-publicized gaffe in 2005, Harry apologized after he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform at a party. ""It was a very stupid thing to do and I've learned my lesson, simple as that really,"" he said in an interview marking his 21st birthday. ""I'd like to put it in the past now. What's done is done. I regret it.""","Harry was 12 when his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- When first lady Michelle Obama took the stage Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, she told the kind of tale about President Barack Obama that only a wife can. She told of the profound impact of watching his grandmother and single mother's efforts to work and raise children in a system that often didn't value their efforts. ""Barack's grandmother started out as a secretary at a community bank, and she moved quickly up the ranks. But like so many women, she hit a glass ceiling,"" Michelle Obama said. ""And for years, men no more qualified than she was, men she had actually trained, were promoted up the ladder ahead of her, earning more and more money while Barack's family continued to scrape by. ""But day after day, she kept on waking up at dawn to catch the bus, arriving at work before anyone else, giving her best without complaint or regret. And she would often tell Barack, 'So long as you kids do well, Bar, that's all that really matters.' "" The first lady's remarks were much more than a counterpoint to stories Ann Romney told last week of her husband, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, during the GOP convention last week. The first lady was a heavy hitter on a female-dominated opening night speakers' roster that included Nancy Keenan, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League-Pro-Choice America; Lilly Ledbetter, for whom a gender pay equity law is named; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and a cadre of Democratic women from that chamber, among others. First lady seeks to reignite flame for president . Both presidential campaigns say their female-heavy convention speaker rolls are about underscoring that women's issues are America's issues. However, the female-centric messages also speak to the parties' battle over the deeply coveted female voting bloc. ""It's aimed at a specific group of voters that both parties need,"" Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the Cook Political Report said. ""This whole argument is aimed at appealing to this group and keeping them in the fold."" In Charlotte, Democratic women took the stage and hammered home the message that on issues of equal pay, reproductive health, health care for seniors, education and other matters they are poised ""to move America forward."" When ""Sisters are Doin' It For Themselves"" played, both the women on stage and those in the crowd waved and swayed to the beat. On Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is scheduled to speak at an Emily's List reception where she's on tap to discuss the ""historic number of women running for Senate this year."" Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown University law student and birth control advocate who made national headlines when conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called her a ""slut,"" is slated to speak at the DNC on Wednesday. ""At this time the Democratic Party is the only party for women because of the controversial stance the Republican Party has taken,"" said Alabama delegate Susan Brown. Not to be outdone, the first full day of last week's RNC was also heavy with female speakers including congressional candidate Mia Love of Utah, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Govs. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice had prime-time speaking spots later that week. ""The Republican Party is doing a good job of demonstrating the softer side of the GOP, that it is not just the party of business guys in suits,"" CNN contributor and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said. In his acceptance speech, Romney offered full-throated support of women's equal role in the political process. ""When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?' "" But, despite a week in which Republican speakers sought to appeal to female voters, a CNN/ORC International survey conducted just after the end of the RNC found that the double-digit gender gap between Obama and Romney was unchanged. Over the past few months, the battle over women voters has taken some nasty turns. U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin's recent comments that ""legitimate rape"" rarely resulted in pregnancy sent Republicans trying to push him out of the way and revived the contentious ""war on women"" debate from earlier this year. Democrats pounced and tried to connect Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to Akin's comments through a Web video called ""The Romney-Ryan-Akin Platform for Women."" Earlier this year, both presidential campaigns were roiled by heated rhetoric over a federal requirement that religious institutions provide contraception coverage for employees. Democrats said Republican pushback against the law and other proposed contraception regulation measures in several statehouses was an attempt to roll back women's rights. Republicans said Democrats were oversimplifying the issue in a ploy for female voters. ""I think it's a manufactured war on women, this narrative that Republicans want to take away birth control and access to doctors,"" Amy Kremer, chairwoman of the Tea Party Express said. ""This is a manufactured crisis to get the women's vote."" According to the most recent CNN/ORC International poll, Romney trails the Obama-Biden ticket by 12 points among women. When George W. Bush won a second term in 2004, in a relatively close election, he had only a 3-point deficit among women. Opinion: What candidates' wives are telling us . In a TIME/CNN poll of likely voters released last week, Obama led Romney by 12 points in Florida and 10 points in North Carolina among women voters. Women make up roughly 51% of the nation's electorate. The GOP women gathered at the Woman Up Pavilion at the Republican National Convention last week were a perfectly coiffed phalanx of policy parsing, politically-savvy conservatives on a mission to show their party does speak to women's concerns. As they lounged on chic white chairs beneath chandeliers dripping with pink flowers, the women plotted how to leverage social media to elevate the party's platform and bemoaned the nation's current economic state. However, the ladies steered well clear of discussing the types of polarizing social issues such as abortion and contraception that led Democrats to claim Republicans are launching a ""war on women"". ""Women have always played a huge role (in the Republican Party); one of the big problems has been the rhetoric,"" said Mary Anne Carter, policy director at the YG Network, a conservative think tank that put on the ""Woman Up"" event. However, Kremer and some Republican women said they also feel the tension between supporting their party and GOP leadership's push for social policies which some Republican women, including several high-profile members of Congress, disagree with. Earlier this year, both Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said they were concerned about some of the GOP rhetoric on women's rights. Some rank and file GOP women agree. ""Republicans are for getting government out of the boardroom, so they should be for getting the government out of the bedroom,"" said Ann Stone, chairwoman of Republicans for Choice, from the convention floor in Tampa last week. In the meantime, groups that represent women say all the pomp and circumstance surrounding both conventions is fine for the television cameras, but they are encouraging female voters to look beyond the flash and concentrate on such issues as reproductive health and stabilizing the economy. ""It's important not to be sidetracked by larger rhetoric; tune in to the specific ideas. Both conventions are trying to set a tone. Dig deep,"" said Deirdre Macnab, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Florida. ""We need the candidates to do more than tell about their childhood. What are they going to do?""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The top United Nations official in Afghanistan on Sunday defended himself against allegations that he has been wary to publicly address problems in the country's recent presidential election. U.N. representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide is under fire by critics who say he did not address election fraud. Clarifying his position at a news conference in Kabul on Sunday, Kai Eide admitted that the August 20 vote was marred by ""widespread fraud."" Eide, the special representative of the secretary-general for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), called the allegations against him ""personal attacks against me and my integrity"" by his recently fired deputy, Peter Galbraith. ""Some of these allegations are based on private conversations whilst he was a guest in my home for two months,"" the Norwegian diplomat said, referring to Galbraith. ""My view is that private discussions around the dinner table remain just that: private."" Eide defended his decisions to open as many polling stations as possible, despite security concerns; denied allegations that he refused to share information with the Afghan electoral officials; and rebuked allegations that he ""accepted that the IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) dropped its safeguards in order to bring President (Hamid) Karzai above 50 percent."" ""This is simply untrue,"" he said. Eide stressed that his main focus is moving forward Afghanistan's election process. His comments come a week after Galbraith wrote a scathing op-ed in The Washington Post, accusing the United Nations of trying to cover up the real reason he was fired. Galbraith blamed Eide for ""denying or playing down the fraud"" in the election because ""he was concerned that even discussing the fraud might inflame tensions in the country."" ""But in my view, the fraud was a fact that the United Nations had to acknowledge or risk losing its credibility with the many Afghans who did not support President Hamid Karzai,"" Galbraith wrote. Galbraith reportedly angered Karzai by calling for a complete recount after widespread allegations of election fraud and was abruptly recalled as Eide's deputy on September 30. In his October 4 op-ed, Galbraith said the disagreement was not about ""how"" UNAMA would respond to electoral fraud, but ""whether"" it would respond. The final results from the August 20 presidential election have yet to be certified because of an ongoing partial recount of suspected ballots. Karzai said Sunday that ""the delay in the announcement of the elections results has negatively affected the country's security and economy."" Karzai called for the immediate release of election results ""so the people of Afghanistan know their future and come out of uncertainty caused by the Western media and some elements in Western countries."" ""The Afghans need to know whether they can determine their destiny or, despite elections, it is still foreigners who decide about it,"" Karzai said.","Eide calls allegations against him ""personal attacks against me and my integrity""

"LOS ANGELES (CNN)  -- A trustee for Heath Ledger's daughter has sued an insurance company over a $10 million policy the actor took out seven months before his death in January from a drug overdose. John S. Laviolette, a Los Angeles entertainment industry attorney whom Ledger appointed custodian of the policy, alleges in the lawsuit that ReliaStar Life Insurance Co. is trying to avoid paying on the policy by continuing to investigate whether Ledger's death was a suicide. Under provisions of the policy, the company would not have to pay if Ledger committed suicide. The New York medical examiner ruled Ledger's January 22 death an accidental overdose of six prescription drugs. ReliaStar says in legal papers that it has the right to investigate all aspects surrounding Ledger's death ""to determine if the 'Suicide' provision is applicable."" If Ledger committed suicide, ReliaStar says, ""we will pay only the amount of premiums paid to us."" The outcome is pending, a company spokesman said Monday. ""We have not rendered a decision on this case yet,"" said Dana Ripley, a senior vice president for ING Americas, which is ReliaStar's parent company. Ripley declined further comment. Laviolette's attorney, Bill Shernoff, said Monday that ReliaStar is just ""looking for any possible loophole."" ""This information they want now, they should have done that before they issued the policy,"" Shernoff said. ""They want to have this lengthy investigation to drag this out. We think it's a fishing expedition."" ReliaStar has asked Laviolette to identify all doctors and hospitals or institutions that had treated Ledger since November 16, 1996. The policy was taken out in June 2007. The money from the policy is supposed to go to Ledger's 3-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose. The company, Laviolette says in the suit, ""acted maliciously, fraudulently and/or oppressively with the intention of depriving plaintiff of the insurance policy benefits."" ReliaStar replied in court papers that ""any and all actions taken by ReliaStar were fair and reasonable and were performed in good faith based on all relevant facts known to it at the time."" The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in July, has been moved to U.S. District Court. Ledger died at age 28 in New York . He is best known for starring in ""Brokeback Mountain"" in 2005, for which he was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award, and his portrayal of the Joker in this year's ""The Dark Knight,"" which was released after his death. Matilda Rose's mother is actress Michelle Williams, whom Ledger met on the set of ""Brokeback Mountain.""

"(CNN) -- A custody hearing for singer Michael Jackson's children scheduled for Monday has been pushed back for a second time. From left: Prince Michael Jackson II, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson and Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. The hearing, which was originally scheduled for July 6, has been rescheduled for July 20 at the request of Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, and Jackson's former wife Debbie Rowe. Rowe is the biological mother of two of Jackson's children -- 12-year-old Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., also known as Prince Michael, and 11-year-old Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson. Jackson's third child, Prince Michael ""Blanket"" Jackson II, was carried by a surrogate mother, whose name has not yet been released. Katherine Jackson was given temporary guardianship of the children by a judge several days after her son's death. According to Michael Jackson's will filed in 2002, he wanted his children to be cared for by his mother. If Katherine Jackson, 79, is not living, Jackson said in the will, ""I nominate Diana Ross as guardian."" Ross, star of the Motown singing group the Supremes, met Jackson when he was a 9-year-old sensation. The two performed together over the years and Jackson told an interviewer in 1982 he considered Ross to be one of his true personal friends. Jackson specifically left Rowe out of his will. Rowe reportedly signed away her parental rights to the children after she and Jackson divorced in 1999, but an appeals court re-established her parental status in 2006. Rowe has not publicly indicated whether she will challenge Jackson for custody.","Judge pushes custody hearing back another week .

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- The only surviving gunman in the 2008 Mumbai attacks will be sentenced Thursday, the judge at his trial said Tuesday. Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted Monday of murder, conspiracy, and waging war on India. The prosecution is calling for him to face the death penalty. More than 160 people were killed in Mumbai during the three-day siege in November 2008, as 10 men attacked buildings including the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks. India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility. Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack. Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused to bury them in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam. An Indian official in Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located, has said a burial took place in January this year. He did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral. Two Indian nationals accused of conspiracy were acquitted in the trial. The prosecutor said he would fight their acquittals.","Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was found guilty of murder, conspiracy and waging war .

"New York (CNN)  -- The three men accused of plotting to bomb the New York City subway last year planned to attack trains at Times Square and Grand Central stations, a federal law enforcement source said Monday. Najibullah Zazi and his two co-defendants wanted to inflict maximum casualties around the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the source said. The trio, wearing homemade bombs, plotted to position themselves in the middle of busy subway cars in order to kill the most people, probably targeting the 1, 2, 3, or 6 line trains, the source said. Since his arrest, Zazi has given authorities information about the plot. The law enforcement source said Zazi would probably have chosen September 14 for the attack, but was also considering the September 15 or 16. Zazi's co-defendants, Adis Medunjanin and Zarein Ahmedzay, are indicted in the plot and have pleaded not guilty. All three men went to the same high school in Flushing, Queens, New York. The plot was foiled when the FBI began following Zazi and police stopped him on a bridge into New York. Zazi said that prompted him to dump his bomb materials and return to Denver, Colorado, where he was working as a shuttle driver, authorities said. Prosecutors have said they plan one or two more arrests overseas. Zazi is scheduled for sentencing in June.","Najibullah Zazi, 2 co-defendants allegedly plotted to wear homemade bombs .

"Washington (CNN) -- For months, voters have been in the dark about key details of Mitt Romney's tax plans. He specified $5 trillion in tax cuts, a 20% cut in income tax rates, a 40% cut in the corporate tax rate, repeal of the estate tax and alternative minimum tax and elimination of taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains for households with incomes below $200,000. He did not want his changes to raise the deficit, but he was utterly mum on how to raise $5 trillion to offset the tax cuts. During the summer, two colleagues and I showed that if Romney did not want to add new taxes on savings and investments -- and raising savings and investments is the second of four main planks in Romney's overall economic package -- he could not finance his tax cuts without generating a net tax cut for households with income above $200,000. Politics: 5 things we learned from the presidential debate . Even if all the available tax expenditures were closed in the most progressive manner possible, it would not raise enough revenue among high-income households to offset the tax cuts they would receive. This was true even when we adjusted the revenue estimates to allow for the impact of potential economic growth, and even when we gave the campaign a trillion-dollar mulligan by ignoring the cost of the corporate tax cuts. As a result, we concluded that if Romney did not impose new taxes on savings and investments, the only way to finance his tax cut proposals and reach revenue neutrality was to raise taxes on households with income below $200,000. This was not a forecast of what Romney would actually do; it was simply a matter of arithmetic. But it highlighted the need for specifics; $5 trillion is not a trivial amount, even in Washington, and the prospect of middle-class tax increases sets off alarm bells. Earlier this week, Romney finally started the process of proposing ways to pay for his tax cut proposals. He broached the idea of putting a cap on each taxpayer's total amount of itemized deductions -- including mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions. Although critical design features remain foggy, Romney has said the cap could range from $17,000 to $50,000, and it could vary with income. Several things are already clear. Opinion: Why you should vote for Romney . First, capping -- or even eliminating -- itemized deductions will not come close to paying for Romney's tax cuts. It would be a step toward financing, but much more will be needed. Nevertheless, as a piece of the revenue puzzle, a cap is an interesting and important idea and a welcome step forward. Members of Congress are quick to see the political advantages of a cap. Relative to curtailing specific deductions, a cap allows them to leave existing deductions in place but restrict the overall use of such deductions. In that sense, the cap is like the alternative minimum tax was intended to be -- a limit on the overall use of tax shelters, even if political leaders could not shut down each one. A cap on itemized deductions goes after one of the three areas of the income tax where the money is. The other two are the exclusion of health insurance premiums from taxation and saving and investment incentives like 401(k) plans, and the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends and carried interest. A cap on a taxpayer's use of all of these subsidies -- as opposed to just itemized deductions -- could get at all three areas. Martin Feldstein of Harvard University and the Romney campaign and Maya MacGuineas of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget have proposed a different style of cap that applies to more than just itemized deductions. While Romney's cap appears to apply to all itemized deductions, it may have a disproportionately negative effect on charitable contributions. After all, people have to pay their state and local taxes, and many people are already in the middle of a long-term commitment to pay down their mortgage. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race . For those households, there may be little room left under the cap to take deductions for charitable contributions. And, for all households, the cap would eliminate tax deductions for contributions larger than the cap, so large gifts to charities would automatically lose their tax-preferred status. So, a cap is not a panacea, but it could well be one part of a constructive solution. Likewise, his acknowledgment that his earlier, disparaging comments about the 47% of households that do not pay federal income taxes were misguided suggests a reconsideration of the role taxes play in those households. If the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, Romney has finally taken the first step. But there is still much more work to be done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Gale.","William Gale: Mitt Romney's $5 trillion tax cut proposal didn't add up for months .
He says new idea of a cap on deductions is a first step toward a viable plan .
Gale says the cap wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for the tax cuts, but it would help .
He says that it could make taxpayers much less likely to give to charity ."
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Is Jerry Brown planning to run for governor of California next year? He sure sounded like it when I spoke with him this week. Jerry Brown, a one-time governor of California, is reportedly looking to run again next year. Brown was first elected governor of California in 1974.  At age 36.  He was -- and still is -- the state's youngest governor since the turn of the 20th century. And now? ""I think about the problems of California all the time, and, with the experience I've had as attorney general, lawyer to most of the state agencies, mayor for eight years and governor for eight years, I'd like to tackle the challenges that face the state,"" Brown told me. ""I don't say that solving that budget thing is going to come easy, maybe not even in the first year, but I really think I can make an impact, particularly in energy, prison reform, education and water."" Brown, currently the state's attorney general, adds: ""I would work very hard to transcend the poison of partisanship which has totally changed state government for the worse since I was there."" In fact, polls suggest Brown is the frontrunner in next year's race for California governor. He's 71 years old.  If he wins, he would also become California's oldest governor. Republican contender Steve Poizner alluded to that fact when his Web site marked the 40th anniversary of the day Brown first ran for public office. ""When it comes to Jerry Brown and Election Day for California voters, it reminds us of the film 'Groundhog Day.'  Every day is the same. Jerry's always on the ballot,"" Poizner said. California's got huge problems, daunting even for ""The Governator,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger.  So I asked Brown, ""Why would anybody want to be governor of California?'' ""That is really a critical question.  Having been there, I have to reflect on that,'' Brown answered.  ""It is an impossible job, or nearly impossible, but quite frankly I love this kind of work."" For Brown, it's the challenge -- one challenge in particular. ""That's one of the reasons I'm seriously thinking about running,'' Brown told me. ""I consider a it challenge worthy of all the imagination and energy I can bring to bear to try to unravel this poisonous partisan mess that state government has become."" During his two terms as governor, Brown captured the public imagination.  He was new, young, unconventional, cutting edge.  He was called ""Governor Moonbeam.'' Has he changed? Well, he did get married four years ago. ""When I was governor, I wasn't married. I stayed at the office until 11 or 12 o'clock at night and then went and spent a little time in Sacramento,'' Brown said. ""Other people say that I'm a hell of a lot better now, having married Anne.  All I can say is, good, I'm glad of that."" Can a 71-year-old man still be cutting edge? His thinking remains unconventional. ""I went to a Jesuit seminary and I lived in a very authoritarian, very black-and-white world,'' Brown explained. ""When I left that a long time ago, I retained a skepticism and an independence and an inquiring mind that doesn't easily fit into the mold of either of the parties."" Brown may be the only politician ever brought down by an insect. In 1981, his handling of a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation that threatened the state's crops caused a lot of voters to hit the roof and doomed his 1982 Senate campaign. Asked about his biggest mistakes, Brown answers Jesuitically. ""Even though I used to go to confession quite regularly in my youth, I hesitate to enumerate my flaws.  My critics have done that so eloquently that I would rather leave it there,"" Brown told me. Brown ran for president three times. Does he still harbor those ambitions? ""I'd say those ambitions have dissipated with time.  Certainly, if I do run for governor, that's enough for one lifetime,"" Brown says today. When Brown lost his bid for the Senate in 1982, he turned around and started a whole new political career, from the bottom: party chairman, radio talk show host, mayor of Oakland, and now attorney general. Who says there are no second acts in American lives?  After all, this is California.","Jerry Brown is currently California's attorney general .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German investigators Thursday acknowledged ""credible information"" indicating that one of the world's most wanted Nazi war criminals died almost 20 years ago in Egypt. The former the hotel in Cairo where Heim spent his final days. The announcement from the Baden-Wuerttemberg State Criminal Investigations Office came a day after German public broadcaster ZDF reported similar findings about Aribert Heim, wanted since 1962. ZDF said research it conducted with the New York Times showed that Heim died in Cairo in 1992 of intestinal cancer. Witness accounts and documents, including a passport, prove that Heim lived under the false name of Tarek Farid Hussein, ZDF said. CNN spoke to Heim's son, Ruediger Heim, who said his father fled Germany to Egypt via France, Spain and Morocco. Ruediger Heim told CNN he visited his father in Cairo several times, including in the final weeks of his life when the terminal cancer was discovered. The German investigators said they were was checking the new information. ""This information has not yet been verified due to time constraints,"" the office said in a statement. But German authorities said they already had hints that Heim was living and working in Egypt. The office said it received information in 1965 and 1967 indicating Heim was working in the country, but Egyptian authorities at the time, acting on a German request, did not find any conclusive evidence. ""Our main goal now is, in cooperation with the Egyptian authorities, (to) identify the remains of Aribert Heim,"" the office said. The chief Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff, said the news about Heim's death, if true, is deeply disappointing. ""I personally feel a tremendous sense of disappointment that he escaped justice,"" Zuroff told CNN. But he emphasized that he had not seen the evidence that Heim was dead. ""There is no body and no grave, so we can't do a DNA test,"" he said, adding that ""there are people who have a vested interest in convincing us that he is no longer alive."" He said he expects to see the documentary evidence of Heim's death on Thursday. Heim would be 94 years old if he were still alive. Zuroff described Heim as ""the most wanted Nazi war criminal,"" and said the Simon Wiesenthal Center was about to raise the reward for information about him from €315,000 ($405,000) to €1 million ($1.3 million) when it heard the reports of his death. During World War II Heim was a doctor at the Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was known to inmates as ""Dr. Death"" for performing often-fatal experiments on prisoners. After the war, he was initially cleared of wrongdoing, but in 1962 German authorities issued an arrest warrant for him.

"Dokdo/Takeshima (CNN) -- Catching a glimpse of the disputed islands in the distance, you can't help but wonder how such unremarkable rocks have soured diplomatic relations for so many decades. The rocky, unforgiving terrain reflects the current relationship between the two protagonists, South Korea and Japan. Seoul calls the islands Dokdo, Tokyo calls them Takeshima. Both countries claim them, Seoul controls them. And the public relations battle to win international support is in full swing. The South Korean government organized a helicopter trip to the territory Thursday, inviting CNN as well as other international media, in a move that angered Tokyo. In a statement to CNN, Japan's Foreign Ministry called the trip ""extremely regrettable and totally unacceptable."" Read: Why Asia is arguing over its islands . Japan says South Korea is illegally occupying the islands. The police presence is the first thing you notice when you touch down. South Korea has had armed guards stationed on the island since the 1950s. The head of the Dokdo guards, Lee Gwang-seup says, ""Japan wants to take our land by force. This has been our land since ancient times and we have to protect it."" Tokyo recently asked Seoul to resolve the matter diplomatically by referring it jointly to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, but Seoul refused, saying there was no question of sovereignty. Japan may now apply to the Hague unilaterally. Read: Disputed islands: Who claims what? Kim Sung-do is 71 years old. He and his wife are the only permanent residents here. When I ask him if life is hard on an island that can be cut off from the outside world for weeks at a time in bad weather, he simply says, ""I chose to come here, so I can't complain. And what is there to complain about? Everywhere you look you see fish."" These waters are rich fishing grounds, the reason Kim visited so often since the 1970s before moving here in 1991. There are also believed to be gas reserves here. No one knows how large the reserves might be, but they're potentially big enough to merit a diplomatic spat. And then the tourists arrive. Police salute the daily ferry as it docks in the tiny port. Once the gangway is in place, more than 100 visitors swarm onto the island, some carrying Korean flags, others shouting with joy as their feet touch the ground. It's a patriotic duty for some, a religious experience for others. One group of Christians gathers in a circle to pray, giving thanks for being allowed to visit. But the visit is brief, 20 minutes later they are herded back onto the ferry, but not before telling the assembled journalists how much the visit means to them. Kevin Kim, 40, says, ""I'm a native of Korea and an American citizen, but in my blood I'm Korean... I feel so great to be here... It really makes me upset when Japan claims this island, it's absurd, and it should not be tolerated."" Others talk of their joy at making this pilgrimage and showing their support for South Korea's claim on the islands. But despite a choreographed visit designed to show Seoul's side of the story, the dispute shows no signs of waning. In fact, the trip itself looks like a fresh chapter of tension in a dispute that has raged between the two neighbors for decades. CNN's K. J.

"(CNN) -- South African mining giant Anglo-American Platinum said Friday that it has fired about 12,000 striking workers who declined to attend disciplinary hearings. Workers at the company's Rustenburg, South Africa, mine have been on strike for three weeks. The company called for disciplinary hearings for the strikers, and those who attended were informed of the outcomes Friday. Those who did not attend were fired, the company said. ""Despite the company's repeated calls for employees to return to work, we have continued to experience attendance levels of less than 20%. Currently four of the company's mining operations in the Rustenburg area have insufficient staff to operate and only essential services are being carried out at those mines,"" Anglo-American Platinum said in a statement. Ronald Lamola, deputy president of the the ruling African National Congress (ANC) Youth League, criticized the move and said the parties could have reached an alternative solution. ""What they have done is extremely unreasonable and cannot be accepted,"" he said, stressing that many more than 12,000 people are dependent on those incomes. ""We have been trying to assist workers because we believe a solution can still be reached. The workers are devastated,"" said Lamola. Tensions at mining operations in South Africa are high following a strike that turned deadly at the Lonmin-owned Marikana platinum mine in the nation's northwest. Police opened fire on demonstrators there in August, killing 34 workers. An additional 10 people, including two police officers, died in incidents in the Marikana area in the days before. South African authorities at first charged 270 miners with murder before dropping the charges, pending further investigation. Workers at the mine ended their weeks-long strike last month after accepting a pay increase of up to 22%. The Anglo-American Platinum mine was also the site of violence Thursday. South African police clashed with 100 to 150 protesters who tried to gather at a mountain near the mine, police spokesman Brig. Thulani Ngubane said. The protesters may have included striking miners, strike sympathizers and local residents, he said. The gathering was not authorized by authorities, and police used force, including water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets after the crowd refused to disperse, Ngubane said. North West Provincial Government Premier Thandi Modise expressed concern about the recent violence and called for ""urgent interventions."" ""We are extremely worried that violence is once again rearing its ugly head and spilling over to local businesses and people who are not party to the labor dispute. Wage negotiations should not be characterized by violence,"" he said. ""The price that we all paid in Marikana was too costly. Sanity has to prevail for an urgent solution to be found to avert further violent confrontations that might have dire repercussions for the mining sector and the economy.""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The copyright to a home movie of Marilyn Monroe ""just sitting around"" with friends will be offered through an online auction this week, according to a man who found the film while researching the actress' death. A short clip of the four-minute, silent 16 mm film provided to CNN to shows Monroe puffing on a cigarette, laughing and drinking wine on a couch. An FBI agent involved in the investigation of Monroe's death on August 5, 1962  -- which was ruled a suicide by drug overdose -- tipped off collector Keya Morgan to the film's existence. Morgan was interviewing the agent for a documentary titled ""Marilyn Monroe: Murder on Fifth Helena Drive,"" he said. The documentary, due out next year, examines the theory that Monroe was killed by government agents because of her affair with President John F. Kennedy. Morgan said he paid $275,000 for the faded color film because it is ""very rare"" to find images of the actress' private moments. ""It's a side of Marilyn that no one has ever seen before,"" he said. ""You see the private Norma Jeane, the girl. You don't see Marilyn Monroe, the movie star."" Monroe changed her name from Norma Jeane Baker to Marilyn Monroe early in her acting and modeling career.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan is blocking access to Facebook in response to an online group calling on people to draw the Prophet Mohammed, officials said Wednesday. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority issued the order a day before ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,"" scheduled by a Facebook group with the same name, because of ""the objectionable material"" on the social networking site, said Khoram Ali Mehran of the telecommunication authority. ""We have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time. We are just following the government's instructions and the ruling of the Lahore High Court. If the government decides to unblock it then that's what we will do,"" he said. The organization has not received any complaints from internet users about the blocking of Facebook so far, he said. Devout Muslims consider it offensive to depict Mohammed. There were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005, and at least two European cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the Muslim prophet. Mimi Sulpovar, who started the Facebook group, said she read about the idea on a blog after Comedy Central bleeped out part of an episode of ""South Park"" that mentioned the prophet. ""This is meant to be in protest,"" said Sulpovar, who is American. ""This is something I have felt strongly about for a long time: Bullying by certain Muslim groups will not be tolerated in a free country."" Sulpovar said Pakistan's decision to block Facebook was ridiculous. Her group and a similar one had attracted about 7,000 fans between them Wednesday. Groups opposing the idea had about 68,000. A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the idea behind the group was offensive. ""Islam discourages any visual representations of the prophets of God -- Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship,"" Ibrahim Hooper said. ""The majority of Muslims worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of God."" The idea of ""Draw Mohammad Day"" originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea, Sulpovar and Hooper said. ""The whole campaign has been taken up by Muslim-bashers and Islamophobes,"" Hooper said. Sulpovar denied being anti-Muslim. ""This extends beyond being able to draw Mohammad,"" she said. ""If it's offensive to you, that's fine, but I don't feel it's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation. ""This is nothing to do with hate or bigotry,"" she said. ""Nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals."" Sulpovar said she is not a Muslim but added that she had received ""hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me."" One group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised. ""This is a hot-topic debate, but so is abortion, illegal immigrants, gay marriage and politics. If we allow even a small compromise for one group, then the free speech on topics like abortion, illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate,"" Autumn Meadows said on CNN's iReport. ""Hate speech is wanting a group eradicated, physically harmed or dead. I don't think drawing Mohammed falls under that category,"" she said. ""Islam is not above criticism or cartoons. I believe in equality, and censoring Mohammed while we can draw every other figure in the world does not equal equality,"" she said. Facebook is investigating the block, said Debbie Frost, the company's director of global communications. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","NEW: Facebook group's creator says idea meant to protest ""bullying"" by Muslim groups .

"(CNN) -- A politician, an athlete and an entertainer. What do they have in common? Some would say rude behavior. In less than a week, millions of people witnessed displays of anger and rage that have many wondering whether decorum is a thing of the past. Kanye West's behavior at the MTV Video Music Awards was widely condemned. ""I think we're seeing a decline in our protocol and etiquette skills,'' said Pamela Eyring, director of the Protocol School of Washington. Last week on Capitol Hill, South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson yelled ""you lie!"" at President Obama as he addressed Congress on heath care. ""It was an obvious breach of decorum. There's a time and a place for everything, and that was obviously not the time or the place,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Wilson apologized to Obama but has balked at the idea of giving a formal apology before the House of Representatives. Just days later, in a heated display of frustration over a questionable call, tennis star Serena Williams threatened a line judge at the U.S. Open. The outburst, like Wilson's, was seen by millions on live television. Williams later issued an apology and has tried to put the incident behind her.  Watch: Where have our manners gone? » . One day after the Williams meltdown, it was Kanye West's turn. But this wasn't a fit of rage; it was an outrageous display by the rapper toward singer Taylor Swift. The 19-year-old was accepting her award at the MTV Video Music Awards ceremony Sunday when West took the microphone from her hand and told the audience that singer Beyonce Knowles' video had been better. West was booed off the stage. Eyring says these three high-profile incidents serve as reminders to public figures and regular people alike to watch their behavior. ""They're mentors, like it or not. They are mentors, and they need to show their good side,"" she said. It's one thing for a public figure to have a bad or very bad moment. But more and more Americans are wondering whether rudeness has become the norm in society in general. ""Everybody's lashing out for no apparent reason. It's starting to be this virus that's going on these days now,"" said David Stuart of Washington. How did it get to this point? Eyring blames technology. ""Blogging, texting, the twittering; we're finding that people aren't focused on their people skills any longer, and so they're doing outbursts. They're just saying what they feel and what they want to say, when they want to say it."" Eyring is quick to point out that not all of society is lacking in people skills. But she does stress a return to simple gestures: opening a door for someone, giving up your seat for an elderly person or simply saying ""thank you."" ""I think actions are more powerful than words. We have to learn this, and you can do it, and it doesn't cost anything. You can do it. It costs nothing to be nice or civil or polite. It's easy, and it makes you feel good.""","America is experiencing decline in etiquette, protocol expert says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The cause of a deadly Washington Metro subway crash last month remains a mystery, with one problem identified by investigators persisting even after engineers replaced a key part that was believed to be faulty, a top Metro official said Tuesday . Investigators are shown at the crash scene in Washington. Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident. At a congressional hearing, Jim Graham said Metro replaced a device that was ""fluttering,"" signaling the presence of a train one moment and not the next. ""You'd think that that would remedy the issue, that ... we would have solved the problem,"" said Graham, chairman of Metro's board of directors. ""In fact, the new device ... continued the same fluttering as the former device."" ""We're left with a very compelling mystery as to what is going on here,"" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, acknowledged that Metro's system of detecting trains continues to have unexplained, intermittent failures. ""Sometimes it's working; sometimes it's not, even with those changes,"" NTSB member Deborah Hersman told a House committee. ""We've walked back the cable to see if there might be some cabling issues. There's a lot of challenges here and we're changing out some components and trying to identify what the problem is,"" she said. Metro has said it will operate the subway trains on manual control until officials have identified and fixed the problem with the automatic train system. Nine people were killed and scores were injured during the June 22 crash just north of the Red Line's Fort Totten station. At Tuesday's hearing, a passenger on one of the trains gave a dramatic description of the accident. Patrick Tuite of Kensington, Maryland, said he had just put down his newspaper and closed his eyes to relax when he heard a screeching sound, someone yelling and ""one of the loudest bangs I've ever heard in my life."" Tuite said in the impact, he hit the seat in front of him. When Tuite peered into the forward-most car, he saw extensive damage. The floor of the car had collapsed ""accordion-like,"" he said. ""We could hear the people at this point in the first car,"" he said. ""And it was pretty chaotic. They were screaming; they were upset,"" he said. But the collision had jammed the doors between the cars, making it impossible to reach victims in the front car. It wasn't until he got off the train that he realized the first car was thrust into the air, he said. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's Congressional delegate, chided the NTSB for making prohibitively costly safety recommendations while ignoring cheaper, common sense solutions, such as putting the newer, more robust rail cars at the front and back of trains. ""Over and over again, you said, 'Do the impossible,' "" Norton, a Democrat, said, referring to NTSB recommendations that Metro replace older cars with sturdier new ones. ""Why didn't the transportation board at least recommend this rather low-tech, low-cost step?"" Hersman said the NTSB's role is to push for safety improvements. ""We do make recommendations, Ms. Norton, and we don't have to pay for them, so we recognize that frustration,"" she said. ""But our charge is not to [consider costs]. Our charge is to recommend what we think is in the best interest of the safety community. We are the conscience and the compass of the transportation industry, and they [transportation providers and regulators] get to decide if and how they implement it,"" Hersman said.","Unexplained, intermittent failures persist despite repairs, Metro official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top White House aide and the managing director of oil giant BP provided differing versions Sunday for who provided the initial inaccurate estimates of the size of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Robert Dudley, the BP official who appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" and other talk shows, said early estimates that 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) were leaking into the ocean each day came from government satellite imaging, rather than BP's figures. An updated estimate issued last week by a government-led team put the leak at 12,000-19,000 barrels (504,000 to 798,000 gallons) a day, more than double the initial figure. ""The best way to measure those early rates or estimate those early rates were from satellite data, not BP data,"" Dudley said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" Not true, countered Carol Browner, the assistant on energy and climate change to President Obama, who spoke to the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" and the CBS show. ""The very, very first estimates came from BP,"" Browner said on the CBS program. ""They had the footage of the plume. The government then did satellite imagery and we realized that those estimates were not accurate."" Browner noted that BP had a ""vested financial interest"" in downplaying the size of the leak. ""They will ultimately pay a fine based on those rates,"" Browner said. ""That's why we brought in an independent team. We did not include BP in the estimates that were made available this week."" Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who heads the House Energy and Environment subcommittee, agreed that the company ""had a stake in low-balling the number right from the very beginning."" ""I think that they were either lying or they were incompetent,"" Markey said on the CBS program. Noting that BP has consistently provided information that proved to be wrong, Markey said he had ""no confidence whatsoever in BP."" ""I think they do not know what they are doing,"" Markey said, adding: ""I don't think that people should really believe what BP is saying in terms of the likelihood of anything that they're doing is going to turn out as they're predicting."" Browner emphasized steps the government has taken to oversee BP's efforts to stop the leak, noting the administration ordered the company to begin digging two relief wells intended to eventually stop the leak instead of a single one proposed by BP. In addition, she said, it was government scientists led by Energy Secretary Steven Chu who recommended that BP halt the so-called ""top kill"" effort to pump heavy mud down the well to try to plug the leak. ""It was that group of people yesterday who looked at the information we had gotten from 'top kill' and realized that it was too dangerous to continue to proceed to put pressure down into that well, that things could happen that would make the situation worse,"" Browner said. Dudley told CNN that BP was ""disappointed the oil is going to flow for a while and we're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches."" The top kill effort failed because ""there was just too much flow"" of oil and gas coming out of the well, Dudley said. He detailed a plan to cut a new opening in equipment from which the oil is leaking to try to lower a cap over it and pipe up most of the leak. A similar previous effort failed, and Dudley said steps would be taken to prevent the problems from the first attempt. ""Our objective is to contain a majority of the oil and gas,"" Dudley said, adding that cutting the new opening was unlikely to increase the amount of oil leaking out before the cap is placed. Browner, however, said on the CBS program that an increase of up to 20 percent was possible. And Markey, on the same show, contended that BP ""has been making it up as they go along the whole way. ""They do not know for sure what the result is going to be of anything which they are doing,"" Markey said.","White House aide, BP official differ on who gave initial estimates on size of leak .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown acknowledged Thursday he has renewed his ""friendship"" with Rihanna, the woman he was convicted of beating on the eve of the Grammys in February 2009. Brown, 23, has two more years of probation to serve for his felony assault conviction, although the judge lifted the ""stay away"" order that kept him from his victim last year. The singer sent an unsolicited statement to CNN announcing he was breaking up with Karrueche Tran, the 24-year-old model he began dating a year after he was arrested for the felony assault. ""I have decided to be single to focus on my career,"" Brown said. ""I love Karrueche very much but I don't want to see her hurt over my friendship with Rihanna. I'd rather be single allowing us to both be happy in our lives."" Tran tweeted a short message Wednesday that appeared directed at Brown: ""Bye baby."" The announcement follows publication of paparazzi photos showing Brown and Rihanna together in public and rumors the two entertainers had reunited romantically. Source: Rihanna argument did not spur Chris Brown fight . The talk of their reunion was fueled last month when Rihanna gave Brown a quick kiss and a hug at the MTV Video Music Awards last month as Brown walked to the stage to accept an award. Rihanna told Oprah Winfrey in an emotional interview in August that Brown had been her ""best friend"" and she still loved him. The judge overseeing Brown's case imposed a ""stay away"" order when she sentenced him to five years of probation, community service and domestic violence counseling for his felony assault conviction in August 2009. The order, which was to expire in 2014, required Brown to stay 50 yards away from Rihanna, 10 yards if the two are at the same industry event. The judge lifted the order in February 2011 with Rihanna's consent. ""He just can't bother her,"" Rihanna's lawyer, Donald Etra, said at the time. Brown has made several public apologies to Rihanna for the attack, which he seemed to blame on his youth. He was 19 at the time. ""I feel like that we're young,"" Brown told CNN's Larry King days after his sentencing. ""We're both young. So nobody taught us how to love one another. Nobody taught us a book on how to control our emotions or our anger. I'm not trying to fall on the fact that I'm young. I'm just saying it's a lot of stuff that I wish I could have changed that night."" Brown was arrested after an early morning argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street on February 8, 2009. Chris Brown's rep on his tattoo: It's not Rihanna . According to Brown's probation report, the argument began over an incident at a Beverly Hills party. An earlier, sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" The pair argued while in the car driven by Brown, the police statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched Rihanna -- identified in the statement by her real first name, Robyn, and the first initial of her last name, Fenty -- numerous times and put her in a headlock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to beat her and kill her, according to the statement, and he bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, the statement said, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a domestic violence emergency protective order."" Fans react positively to Rihanna's honesty . The detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Rihanna's injuries included cuts and bruises inflicted by a large ring on Brown's right hand, which he used to punch her, the probation report said. ""Officers at the scene observed numerous contusions and abrasions to the victim's face and forehead, as well as bruising to her left arm near the bicep,"" it said. ""They also saw abrasions to her arms near both wrists and on her upper chest near her collarbone and around her neck. There were abrasions on her left leg and on the inside of her upper lips."" Rihanna declined to speak to the probation investigator, so the probation report's details were gathered from police detectives who interviewed her soon after the attack. ""He beat me up,"" Rihanna told the police, the report said. Brown made a public apology that July in a video statement posted on his personal Web site. ""I have told Rihanna countless times, and I'm telling you today, that I'm truly, truly sorry in that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better,"" Brown said in the Web site statement. ""What I did was unacceptable, 100 percent. I can only ask and pray that you forgive me. Please.""

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- One of two men arrested over the weekend on terrorism charges was twice put on ""home instruction"" for exhibiting threatening, ""radicalized behavior"" during his high school years, a school spokesman said Tuesday. Mohamed Mahmood Alessa, 20, of North Bergen, New Jersey, and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, 24, of Elmwood Park, New Jersey, are charged with one count each of conspiracy to kill, maim and murder persons outside of the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The men, who were taken into custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday, intended to take separate flights to Egypt on their way to Somalia ""to join designated foreign terrorist organization Al-Shabaab and wage violent jihad,"" according to federal prosecutors. Alessa grew up in an upstairs apartment in North Bergen with his parents, who are from Jordan, according to the landlord, Hemant Shah. He attended ninth grade at Al-Huda School, a Muslim parochial school in nearby Paterson, New Jersey. The school refused to comment on Alessa's tenure there except to say that it was ""shocked and saddened by these allegations."" The teenager transferred to the public North Bergen High School in late 2004, but within months, he was placed on administrative ""home instruction"" for exhibiting ""radicalized behavior that was very threatening,"" according to spokesman Paul Swibinski. ""Home instruction usually arises from disciplinary or security issues,"" Swibinski said. ""In this case, school administrators were very concerned for the safety of students and staff. ... He received his home instruction at the North Bergen public library with a security guard present at all times."" Alessa transferred to KAS Prep, an alternative public school in nearby Hudson County, in September 2005, according to Swibinski. ""He spent one semester there and exhibited the same behavioral problems."" Swibinski wouldn't comment on the exact nature of Alessa's behavior. ""He was well remembered,"" Swibinski said. ""A lot of people remember exactly what kind of behavior he exhibited, and they're not surprised"" by the charges against him. After going back to North Bergen High in March 2006, Alessa was immediately returned to home instruction, Swibinski said. Almost a year later, school records say, he moved to Jordan. The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Newark alleges that in 2007, Alessa and Almonte traveled together to Jordan, where they intended to enter Iraq in order to commit violence against U.S. troops there. The U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey said the investigation of the two men began with a tip to the FBI -- from someone who knew them -- in October 2006. ""Every time they access the Internet all they look for is all those terrorist videos. ... They keep saying that Americans are their enemies, that everybody other than Islamic followers are their enemies ... and they all must be killed,"" court documents said. Alessa and Almonte made their first court appearance Monday, and Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo set a bail hearing for Thursday and a pretrial hearing for June 21.

"(CNN) -- Aruban and Peruvian authorities have agreed to ""help each other"" in the murder investigation of Stephany Flores -- in which Joran Van der Sloot is the prime suspect, an Aruban government spokesman said Tuesday. Investigators hope the cooperation will lead to new information about the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway in 2005 in Aruba. Van der Sloot is also a suspect in that case. Following a phone meeting with Peruvian Judge Carlos Morales on Tuesday morning, Aruban government spokesman Taco Stein said Peruvian authorities have agreed to allow Aruban investigators into Peru to interview van der Sloot once a formal request has been made. Stein did not indicate when the request would take place or when Aruban investigators are expected to arrive in Peru, but described the meeting as a ""positive start"" to information sharing that many Arubans hope will shed more light on the Holloway case. Holloway's father, Dave Holloway, met with Aruban authorities on the island Tuesday and told CNN he believes progress is being made in the investigation. He declined to elaborate further. Peruvian authorities have charged van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, with murder in the death of 21-year-old Flores last month. Van der Sloot said he was in Peru for a poker tournament and had met Flores while he was gambling. Police have said they think van der Sloot killed Flores to steal money she won from gambling. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case.

"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Puerto Rico's Gov. Luis Fortuno on Tuesday outlined a plan that would cut spending by $2 billion per year and slash government payrolls by what could be more than 30,000 workers, or 10 percent of the government's work force. ""It's up to us to confront the bitter reality that the government is bankrupt,"" Gov. Luis Fortuno said Tuesday. ""It's up to us to confront the bitter reality that the government is bankrupt,"" he said in a televised address. The number of laid-off workers will depend on how many accept voluntary buyouts and how many agree to cut their hours, he said. ""But I am frank,"" he said. ""The quantity could be significant and I fear they could exceed 30,000 workers."" Though he did not lay out a timetable, Fortuno prefaced his prediction by calling for ""immediate action"" to emerge from a crisis that has left the government unable to pay its bills. The situation is dire, he said. ""Imagine that in June, the government stopped paying the light bill,"" he said. ""Or the water and phone."" Failure to take quick action, he predicted, could delay recovery by a decade. ""Simply put, I am not going to permit it,"" he said. Fortuno said his plan would slash government operations by 10 percent, cut his own salary by 10 percent, cut salaries of chiefs of agencies by 5 percent until 2010, and freeze others' salaries. He said since entering office two months ago, he discovered the fiscal deficit is four times greater than what he had been told -- or more than $3.2 billion, which translates into the highest per capita deficit figure in the nation. Failure to take immediate action would result in an unemployment rate above 10 percent in two years, he added. To achieve his ""reconstruction plan,"" Fortuno said he was sending the Legislative Assembly proposals to inject money into the economy through public works and to resolve the fiscal crisis ""that has broken the government."" In addition to the $5 billion that Puerto Rico is to receive under the federal stimulus plan, Fortuno said he was submitting to the legislative assembly a plan for $500 million to provide benefits, carry out public works projects and create jobs. A stimulus package would invest $180 million to guarantee loans to small- and medium-sized businesses, he said. An additional $142.5 million would be for public works projects in the cities -- $100 million of which would go directly to mayors, he said. In addition, more than 106,000 pensioners making less than $20,000 per year will each get a voucher worth $300, he said. More than 5,000 families that risk losing their homes because of lost jobs or lost income of 20 percent or more would be eligible for a program to reduce their monthly payments -- either by lowering their mortgage interest rates or lengthening the term of their loans, he said. ""Public-private alliances"" will help ensure Puerto Rico's port and highways have the money they need to keep working, he said. Fortuno said he would work to avoid increasing taxes on items that disproportionately affect the middle class, like gasoline and cellular phones. But he said he would impose a temporary 5 percent increase on income tax for corporations, banks, insurance companies and international banking entities as well as for individuals making more than $100,000 per year and couples making more than $150,000 per year. The only permanent tax increase will be levied on cigarettes, wine and beer, he said. ""Simply put, the government has to shrink,"" he said. ""I know that this plan is painful, but we have no alternative."" Some union representatives said the plan was gruesome and called for a series of protests this week. Most of the syndicates had negotiated collective agreements with the former governor. Fortuno argued that those agreements may not be honored since the agencies that negotiated them failed to identify where the money was to come from.

"(CNN) -- Aruban authorities have called off a dive team's search for the remains of Natalee Holloway after two days of searching the waters off Aruba proved fruitless, a spokeswoman for the Aruban prosecutor said Wednesday. The search was initiated after a Pennsylvania couple vacationing on the island told authorities that a picture they took last year while snorkeling looked like a skeleton. Aruban police contacted the island's tour companies and used a dive team to search the island's snorkeling locations, said Ann Angela, spokeswoman for the Aruba prosecutor's office. After searching Sunday and Wednesday, police ""feel pretty confident"" they scoured all areas typically used by snorkelers and found nothing that resembled the image depicted in the photograph, she said. ""It's a dead end,"" she added. ""We're assuming the photo is of coral."" Though no more dives are planned to follow up on the couple's tip, Angela said the prosecutor's office will continue ""to follow every lead"" in an attempt to determine what happened to Holloway, an 18-year-old Alabama high school student who was on a graduation trip in May 2005 when she was last reported seen leaving a bar in the capital of Oranjestad. Three months after snapping what she said she thought were pictures of ""colorful fish,"" Patti Muldowney and her husband said they realized that one of the pictures depicted what appeared to be human remains. ""When I looked at that photo, I said, 'By darn, that certainly does look like a skeleton,' "" John Muldowney told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" last week. The main suspect in the case, Joran van der Sloot, remains free. Van der Sloot has made alleged confession-like statements in TV interviews, one of which involves dumping Holloway's body in the ocean after she suffered a seizure on the beach. Aruban judges have ruled there isn't enough evidence to arrest him. Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, has declined to comment on the photo. The couple, who took the photo to police and the FBI, said it was taken near an old shipwreck. The FBI said it is investigating. Whether the object in the photo is human remains is still up for debate. In underwater burials, it is typical for arms, legs and other extremities to be dispersed and for lighter bones to be carried away from heavier bones by fish, wildlife and water, according to Heather Walsh-Haney, a forensic anthropologist. ""It looks as if there's something that may be on top of the skeleton,"" Walsh-Haney said of the image in the photograph. ""That would certainly bode well for preserving the center of the mass of the body and keeping most of it there."" But Dr. Marty Makary, a physician on the faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, said he sees mixed signs, some indicating the image may not be a skeleton. ""What I don't like about the photo is, there's no spinal cord or vertebral column,"" he said. ""In fact, below this roundish skull-type profile, you see a curvature which doesn't really represent a normal spinal column.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal judge from Montana and the dean of Harvard's law school are among several names being added to the short list of potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court, a government source said. Sidney Thomas, a 14-year veteran on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, is being vetted by the White House, said the source, who has been regularly consulted in the selection process. Two women who were not on other published lists of potential candidates are now being seriously considered. Harvard Law school dean Martha Minow has been on the school's faculty since 1981. And Elizabeth Warren heads the Congressional Oversight Panel, which reviews government efforts to boost the shaky financial and private investment sector. Neither woman has judicial experience. Sources close to the selection process said the new names represent an effort to expand what had been a short list of candidates, many of them left over after last year's court vacancy was filled by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Some White House officials have been urging the president to expand the list of possibles to include more non-judges and people with different backgrounds and from other regions of the country. All the current justices except the retiring John Paul Stevens are Ivy League law school graduates. Thomas, who is white, was born in Bozeman, Montana, in 1953. He is little-known and has attracted little fanfare beyond the San Francisco, California-based court, which is considered the most liberal among the nation's 13 appeals courts. Among rulings he authored was a 2006 decision in Nadarajah v. Gonzalez, in which Thomas concluded that the government illegally detained Ahilan Nadarajah for four years while the Justice Department appealed a grant of asylum. The man is a member of the Tamil ethnic minority and asserted that he was tortured and persecuted by members of the Sinhalese majority. Minow is the daughter of former Federal Communications Commission head Newt Minow. She clerked for former Justice Thurgood Marshall. In her mid-50s, Minow replaced as dean the woman considered near the top of potential high court nominees, Elena Kagan, now solicitor general. Warren is also a Harvard law professor. She has been a regular on the talk-show circuit, including CNN, to discuss the economy's effect on families. The Oklahoma native has also co-authored two books with her daughter. One name mentioned by some analysts for years as a potential blockbuster choice has been all but ruled out for consideration. Supporters of Hillary Clinton have long touted her credentials, but White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Monday that the president ""thinks Secretary Clinton is doing an excellent job as secretary of state and wants her to remain in that position."" The White House has given no indication when Obama will name a successor to Stevens, who announced Friday that he will retire this year. Stevens has been on the high court nearly 35 years and leads the four-justice liberal bloc.","Appellate judge, Harvard law dean, Harvard professor among possibles .

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- A Moroccan man charged with plotting a suicide bomb attack on the U.S. Capitol will remain in jail, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. Amine El Khalifi made a brief appearance in federal court and waived his right to have a preliminary hearing and to contest his detention. Magistrate Judge John Anderson said there are no conditions under which El Khalifi should be released at this time both because of the seriousness of the charge against him and because the defendant is in the U.S. illegally. Khalifi, wearing a green jail jumpsuit, spoke only to confirm to the judge he had talked with his federal public defender and did not want a preliminary hearing. El Khalifi was arrested on Friday as the result of an FBI sting operation. According to a criminal complaint, El Khalifi accepted a MAC-10 automatic gun and what he thought was a suicide vest containing explosives. He was quickly taken into custody as he attempted to leave a parking garage wearing the vest and walk to the U.S. Capitol building, said the document. ""Unbeknownst to El Khalifi, both the weapon and the bomb had been rendered inoperable by law enforcement,"" said the criminal complaint. El Khalifi allegedly told an undercover FBI agent and another man assisting law enforcement that he intended to use the MAC-10 to ""shoot people before detonating the bomb."" El Khalifi allegedly thought he was working with al Qaeda but a man referred to in court documents as ""Yusuf"" was an undercover agent. U.S. officials said El Khalifi had been closely monitored since early December and that the public was never in danger. U.S. officials said the suspect was not connected to terrorists and was working alone. U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said Friday that El Khalifi ""devised the plot, the targets and the methods on his own."" According to the affidavit, El Khalifi changed his mind about what to target and at various points had considered hitting a restaurant, a military installation and a synagogue. He finally decided to try to blow himself up in the United States Capitol, according to the court document, and said ""he would be happy killing 30 people."" Threatening letters sent to congressional offices . El Khalifi, age 29, came to the United States in June 1999 under a B2 visa, which allows visitors for tourism and medical treatment. But U.S. officials said his visa expired later the same year and he has been in the country illegally ever since. The court document said that in January 2011 a confidential source reported to the FBI that El Khalifi met with people at a residence in Arlington, Virginia, where another individual brought out some weapons, including an AK-47. ""El Khalifi expressed agreement with a statement by this individual that the 'war on terrorism' was a 'war on Muslims,' and said that the group needed to be ready for war,"" according to the affidavit. A young man who would only give his last name as Mohamed attended Wednesday's court hearing. Afterward he told reporters that he and El Khalifi often attended prayers at the same mosque. Mohamed said the extent of his relationship with El Khalifi was to exchange greetings with him, but he said El Khalifi stood out for having tattoos and sometimes sporting a Mohawk haircut, and because he sweated so much that he carried a towel around at the mosque. Mohamed said he believes FBI informants frequent the mosque where he and El Khalifi pray and that the Moroccan man was entrapped by law enforcement. However, he said, El Khalifi ""probably had a willingness to attack Americans."" U.S. officials said that El Khalifi was not entrapped. The affidavit prepared by an FBI agent said there are video and audio recordings that were taken during the course of the investigation, but the document does not discuss what is in those recordings. In an e-mail, El Khalifi's federal public defender, Kenneth Troccoli, said he would make no immediate comment. El Khalifi faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted on the charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction to attack the Capitol.","Amine El Khalifi made a brief appearance in federal court Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- President James K. Polk holds a distinction among those who have sought the nation's top job: He's the only major candidate to win the White House despite losing the vote in the state where he was born and the state where he lived. It happened in 1844, and now 168 years later, Republican nominee Mitt Romney may need to duplicate Polk's feat if he wants to defeat President Barack Obama in Tuesday's election. According to polls, Romney faces the prospect of losing both the state of his birth, Michigan, and the state where he lives and served as governor, Massachusetts. CNN Polling Center . Obama holds a double digit lead in Massachusetts, but the race is closer in Michigan, with the polls tightening, though the president remains in front. Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. There are a total of 538 electoral votes available, meaning 270 are required to win. Romney has many plausible paths to victory on Tuesday without winning Michigan or Massachusetts. Yet the prospect that he might lose either or both raises the question of how many other presidential candidates in U.S. history also were unable to win their birth or home states? Winners who overcame the loss of a state with strong personal ties included Abraham Lincoln, Richard Nixon and both George H.W. Bush and his son, George W. Bush. New national poll shows Obama, Romney virtually tied . Honest Abe won his home state of Illinois, but lost his birth state of Kentucky in both of his presidential runs in 1860 and 1864. In 1968, Nixon won his birth state of California, where he also ran unsuccessfully as governor, but lost his home state of New York, where he had been working as a lawyer for a few years. Both of the Bushes won the state where they lived -- Texas -- in their three successful presidential campaigns, but lost their birth states -- Massachusetts for the father and Connecticut for the son. Many more candidates who lost either their birth or home states also lost the election. Al Gore would have defeated George W. Bush in 2000 if the Democratic vice president carried his home state of Tennessee. Democratic President Grover Cleveland won a larger share of the popular vote than Benjamin Harrison in 1888, but he lost his home state of New York and the electoral vote to his Republican foe. Here's a look at some of the presidential candidates who lost their home or birth states: . Two candidates, two journeys, one race of lost dreams . 1844 -- Democrat James K. Polk lost both his birth state of North Carolina and home state of Tennessee, but still managed to defeat Henry Clay. 1860 -- Republican Abraham Lincoln lost his birth state of Kentucky, but won his home state of Illinois in defeating Stephen Douglas. The same dynamic occurred four years later when Lincoln defeated George McCLellan. 1888 -- Incumbent Democratic President Grover Cleveland won his birth state of New Jersey, but lost his home state of New York in falling to Benjamin Harrison. In this race, Cleveland won a slightly larger share of the popular vote than Harrison, but lost in the Electoral College. 1916 -- Incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson won his birth state of Virginia, but lost his home state of New Jersey in defeating Charles Evans Hughes. 1932 -- Republican President Herbert Hoover lost his birth state of Iowa in falling to Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As the incumbent and a former cabinet secretary, Hoover had been living in Washington for years before the election, and he also lost the District vote. 1944 -- Republican Thomas Dewey lost both his birth state of Michigan and his home state of New York, where he was governor, in falling to incumbent President Franklin Roosevelt. 1952 -- Democrat Adlai Stevenson lost his birth state of California and his home state of Illinois, where he was governor, in falling to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. The same thing happened four years later, when the incumbent President Eisenhower also won California and Illinois in defeating Stevenson. 1968 -- Former Republican Vice President Richard Nixon won his birth state of California, but lost his home state of New York in defeating Democrat Hubert Humphrey, who lost his birth state of South Dakota, but won his home state of Minnesota, which he had represented in the U.S. Senate. 1972 - Democratic Sen. George McGovern lost South Dakota, both his birth and home state, in getting swamped by incumbent President Nixon. 1992 - Incumbent President George H.W. Bush lost his birth state of Massachusetts, but won his home state of Texas in falling to Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton. 2000 -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush won his home state, but lost his birth state of Connecticut in defeating Democratic Vice President Al Gore, who won his birthplace of Washington, D.C., but lost his home state of Tennessee, which he had represented in the U.S. Senate. 2004 -- Incumbent President George W. Bush again won his home state of Texas, but lost his birth state of Connecticut in defeating Democrat John Kerry, who lost his birth state of Colorado, but won his home state of Massachusetts, which he represented in the U.S. Senate.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A priest accused of child abuse denied the charges Tuesday in a high-profile trial taking place in the shadow of the Vatican. ""I am not a monster. I am innocent,"" the Rev. Ruggero Conti said in court. Conti is accused of molesting seven young boys at the Nativita di Santa Maria Santissima parish in Rome. He faces charges of committing sexual violence and prostitution. Two alleged victims told police that Conti masturbated them and forced them to perform oral sex on him in his home, where he often invited them to dinner and to watch movies, according to court documents. Anti-abuse activists say Conti's superiors knew of allegations against him as early as 2006 but did not do enough to stop him. Prosecutors say they will call Conti's bishop, Monsignor Gino Reali, to testify. Reali was interrogated by police as part of their investigation into Conti, the activists say. Putting a bishop on the stand in Rome, the capital of deeply Catholic Italy, would be potentially explosive, particularly against the background of a European-wide scandal. The Catholic Church has been rocked this year by allegations of child abuse by Catholic clergy in Ireland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, following similar accusations in the United States in the past decade. A damning Irish government-backed report last year said the Dublin Archdiocese had systematically covered up the allegations. Pope Benedict XVI met this month with a group of men in Malta who say they were abused. He prayed and cried with them. He has repeatedly insisted the church will do everything in its power to prevent child abuse. But the trial taking place on his doorstep may undercut such assurances, not least since the alleged abuse of boys took place well after the scandal came to light in the United States. Conti, a former adviser to the mayor of Rome, was arrested in June 2008, more than a year after an anti-pedophilia organization says it brought accusations against him to Catholic Church officials. Roberto Mirabile, the president of the organization, said his group was warned about Conti by another priest in the spring of 2007. The group, La Caramella Buona, met with the alleged victims and their families, Mirabile told reporters on Friday. Mirabile himself went to top Vatican officials, including the man responsible for prosecuting alleged child abusers within the Catholic Church, Monsignor Charles Scicluna, he said. Scicluna told the child-protection activist there was no Vatican record of complaints about Conti and advised him to go to the police with his concerns, Mirabile said. Mirabile accused Scicluna of washing his hands of the matter. Scicluna did not respond to CNN attempts to contact him about the case. Caramella Buona officials did go to the police, who launched an investigation in November 2007. Conti was arrested as he prepared to go to World Youth Day in Australia in June 2008. Police believe he continued abusing children until March 2008, Mirabile said. Conti's superior, Bishop Reali, told police in December 2008 he knew of vague accusations against the priest two years before he was arrested but did not take action, according to court documents. Nino Marazzita, a lawyer for La Caramella Buona, provided CNN with what he said were transcripts of the prosecutor's interrogation of the bishop. ""You know that there are so many 'rumors,' "" Reali told investigators, according to the lawyer. ""And I can't run after each one of them."" Conti accused La Caramella Buona of being ideologically opposed to him in his testimony Tuesday. The group denies it. Reali did not respond to CNN attempts to contact him by phone and e-mail.","Rev.

"(CNN)  -- Lawmakers on Thursday are getting their first chance to grill BP CEO Tony Hayward, the man fighting to save his and his company's reputation as BP tries to stop the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. Hayward is testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is chaired by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan. The hearing is examining what caused the April explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig and the oil disaster. A letter to Hayward from House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-California, says a congressional investigation alleges that the besieged oil company took a low-cost, speedy approach to drilling the now-broken deepwater well responsible for the growing spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The hearing comes a day after Hayward met with President Obama, who last week said that if it were up to him, Hayward would have been fired. In his opening remarks, Hayward struck an emotional tone, acknowledging the loss of life and reminding the Gulf Coast's residents of the company's longstanding commitment to the region. ""I want to speak directly to the people who live and work in the Gulf region: I know that this incident has had a profound impact on your lives and caused great turmoil, and I deeply regret that,"" Hayward said. Addressing the anger and frustration coming from the public, Hayward said, ""I know that these sentiments will continue until the leak is stopped and until we prove through our actions that we are doing the right thing."" CNNMoney: BP's Hayward strikes emotional tone . In the eight weeks since the rig explosion, Hayward has become the punching bag for Gulf Coast residents who are furious that the oil is still spewing. BP's costly public-relations campaign features an apologetic Hayward detailing cleanup efforts and promising, ""We will get this done. We will get this right."" But the company's effort to repair its image has been countered by its inability to contain the oil and Hayward's penchant for gaffes. A month after the rig sank, Hayward told Sky News that the environmental impact of the disaster would likely be ""very, very modest."" He later described the oil spill as an ""environmental catastrophe."" Fortune: Tony Hayward's most memorable quotes . Hayward also took heat for telling The Guardian that the size of the spill is ""relatively tiny"" in comparison to the ""very big ocean."" BP's top man faced the most criticism from his poorly worded apology for the disruption the largest oil spill in U.S. history has caused. ""There's no one who wants this over more than I do. I would like my life back,"" he said. In response to Hayward's comment, Christopher Jones, a brother of one of the 11 workers killed in the oil rig explosion, told the Senate Judiciary Committee, ""Mr. Hayward, I want my brother's life back."" Hayward issued another apology for what he said was a ""hurtful and thoughtless comment."" ""When I read that recently, I was appalled. I apologize, especially to the families of the 11 men who lost their lives in this tragic accident,"" he said on his Facebook page. In the past two months, Tony Hayward has become a media fixture and a household name. Hayward, a 53-year-old Briton, grew up outside London and started at BP as a geologist in 1982. He held technical and commercial jobs in Europe, Asia and South America in the 1990s, according to his bio from BP. By 1997, he was on the executive committee, and in May 2007, he was named CEO. Hayward replaced Lord John Browne, who resigned three months earlier than planned after a judge cleared the way for a newspaper to publish details about an alleged homosexual relationship that Browne had. When Hayward took over, BP was still recovering from the March 2005 explosion at a Texas City, Texas, refinery that killed 15 workers and a spill in Alaska the following year that was blamed partially on poor maintenance of pipelines. Hayward vowed to turn the company around. Pressed on how he'd be different from his predecessor, Hayward reportedly replied, ""John Browne was John Browne. I'll be me. There is not a lot more I can say."" Before April, there had been no major disasters for the company since the Alaskan pipeline incident. Financially, the company has increased revenues every year since Hayward took over, with the exception of 2009, a year plagued by the recession. Profits have been strong, but up and down. Last year, Hayward made $6 million. Despite calls for him to quit, Hayward insists he has no plans to step down. Asked if the president trusts Hayward, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told CNN, ""It's not about trusting Tony Hayward or anybody at BP. It is about ensuring that they live up to each and every responsibility that they have and that's exactly what the president and everybody in this administration will do."" This month, BP's stock hit a 14-year-low. Since the oil disaster began, the company has lost half of its market value.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will stand trial Monday for an incident in which an American allegedly swam across a lake and stayed for two days in her closely guarded residence, where she is under house arrest. Officials in Myanmar say this self-portrait was found on John Yettaw's digital camera. The southeast Asian country's military junta rarely allows visitors to see Suu Kyi, and foreigners are not allowed overnight stays in local households. The government said the presence of the American, John William Yettaw, in the lakeside home violated the conditions of Suu Kyi's house arrest. Yettaw, was charged Thursday on two criminal counts -- entering the country illegally and staying at a resident's home without government permission, according to a spokesman for Suu Kyi's political party. Both charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Suu Kyi on Thursday was taken to a prison compound near Yangon , where authorities set up a special room for her until the trial, said Nyan Win, spokesman for her National League for Democracy party. The government detained her at the Insean Prison compound under Section 22 of the country's legal code, a law against subversion of government, Nyan Win said. If convicted, Suu Kyi could face three to five years in prison. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the immediate release of Suu Kyi on Thursday. ""I am deeply troubled by the Burmese government's decision to charge Aung San Suu Kyi for a baseless crime,"" Clinton said at the State Department in Washington, referring to Myanmar by its former name of Burma.  Watch former U.S. president Jimmy Carter talk about Aung San Suu Kyi » . ""We oppose the regime's efforts to use this incident as a pretext to place further unjustified restrictions on her. We call on the Burmese authorities to release her immediately and unconditionally, along with her doctor and the more than 2,100 political prisoners currently being held."" The junta changed the nation's name, and changed the capitol's name from Rangoon to Yangon, when it seized control of the country. Political dissidents and nations including the United States have refused to acknowledge those changes and still use the old names. Clinton was speaking at a question-and-answer session with the visiting foreign minister of Malaysia, and Clinton said she was raising the issue of Suu Kyi's arrest with Malaysia and the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Countries. She said the United States also will raise the issue with countries like China. The timing of her detention raised suspicion among Suu Kyi's supporters, who said the government's action Thursday is an excuse to extend her house arrest, set to expire this month. ""This is the cunning plan of the regime to put Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in continuous detention beyond the six years allowed by the law they used to justify the detention of her,"" said the U.S. Campaign for Burma, a pro-democracy group fighting for her release. ""Daw"" is an honorific. Rights group Amnesty International said the junta was reacting to a decision last year by the United Nations' Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that ruled her house arrest illegal both domestically and internationally. Suu Kyi's lawyer, U Kyi Win, blamed the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's prison detention on Yettaw. Some initial reports out of Myanmar spelled his name differently: Yeattaw. Local media said the 53-year-old former military serviceman from Falcon, Missouri, swam almost 2 miles across Inya Lake on May 3 and sneaked into Suu Kyi's home. Police maintain a round-the-clock presence outside the house, and swimming in the lake is forbidden. A neighbor of Yettaw's in Falcon, Mike Assell, described him as someone who was friendly but did not actively participate in community activities.  Watch Yettaw's neighbor describe him » . ""I think he wasn't really afraid to talk to folks, but he really was not outgoing and went out of his way to stop and talk too much,"" Assell said. ""He has his own -- I don't know if agenda's the right word -- he has his priorities and he is working toward those."" Public records yielded little about Yettaw, a father of seven. At one point, he owned a construction company. And he lost a 17-year-old son to a motorcycle wreck in Lebanon, Missouri, in 2007. Yettaw appeared in court Thursday along with Suu Kyi and two of her assistants, party spokesman Nyan Win said. A U.S. Embassy official met with Yettaw on Wednesday for three minutes, the first since his arrest. He appeared to be doing well, the embassy said. On Thursday, Myanmar officials were expected to charge Yettaw with immigration violations. But the charges had not been announced. Yettaw entered Suu Kyi's house once before, in 2008, the U.S. Campaign for Burma said. She refused to meet with him, and this time, she spoke to him only long enough to tell him to leave, it said. Reports from news outlets affiliated with the military junta said Yettaw confessed to the 2008 visit and said he had stayed for a longer period then. This time, the reports said, Yettaw met Suu Kyi's two housekeepers, a mother and daughter who are her only permitted companions. Yettaw, a diabetic, apparently told the women he was tired and hungry after his swim. They offered him food, the newspapers said. The housekeepers also were charged under Section 22 on Thursday. Yettaw was arrested while swimming away from the house. Authorities said he told officials he was visiting Yangon on a tourist visa and was staying at a hotel when he swam across the lake with a 5-liter water bottle, presumably to use as a float. Authorities found a U.S. passport, a backpack, a flashlight, a pair of folding pliers, a camera and money on him, local reports said. The Myanmar-language Web site tharkinwe.com published two photos that officials said they found on Yettaw's digital camera. One showed a middle-aged man posing in front of a mirror for a self-portrait. The other was a picture of a pair of feet with flippers on them. Assell, the neighbor, said the man in the picture was Yettaw. Suu Kyi's party said Yettaw's appearance at the house confirms security concerns the leader has voiced to the government. ""This is a political issue, not a criminal issue,"" said Nyan Win, the spokesman. ""She has done nothing wrong."" Suu Kyi, 63, rose to global prominence during protests in the country in 1988. She was first detained in 1989 and has been under house arrest for 13 of the past 19 years. In 1990, her party won the general elections, which the ruling military junta did not recognize. The following year, she won the Nobel Peace Prize. Myanmar's government has scheduled elections for next year that it says will lead the nation toward democracy. Human-rights organizations have said the vote will merely extend military rule in the nation.

"(CNN) -- Debt-stricken Greece has agreed on final details with its international creditors on the terms for the next installment of a bailout deal, the prime minister said Tuesday. However, the agreement on new austerity measures and the country's budget must still be approved in two parliamentary votes -- which are likely to test the strength of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' governing coalition. Samaras said Greece's representatives had done ""everything possible"" in their negotiations with the so-called troika, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Read more: Euro crisis opens old wounds for Greece, Germany . ""We exhausted all possibilities, pressures and time. We achieved important improvements, even at the last moment,"" Samaras said. ""As long as this agreement is approved and the budget voted into approval, Greece will remain in the euro and will find its way out of the crisis."" The Greek government has until now struggled to nail down all of the â‚¬11 billion of spending cuts it needs to satisfy the conditions of its international bailout. The harsh austerity measures already in place have angered many people in Greece, which is in its fifth year of recession and has seen its unemployment rate soar to more than 25%. Greece's parliament is under pressure to pass the new austerity package before November 12, when eurozone finance ministers are expected to announce whether they will release the money. The first parliamentary vote -- this one on the budget -- is expected Wednesday, with the second vote, on reforms and austerity measures, scheduled for Monday. Samaras warned that the danger for the Greek people going forward did not lie in which measure was or wasn't passed, but rather in what might happen if the agreement was not approved and the nation plunged into chaos. ""These dangers must be avoided. And that is now the responsibility of all parties and of every member of parliament individually,"" he said. The coalition headed by Samaras is made up of his center-right New Democracy party, the socialist party Pasok and the Democratic Party of the Left, or DIMAR. While Pasok has not yet commented, it seems Samaras may struggle to bring the Democratic Left on board. Read more: Greece brought to standstill by anti-austerity strike . ""DIMAR fought for labor relations with specific positions in order to protect already weakened labor rights,"" the party said in a statement Tuesday. ""We don't agree on the outcome of the negotiations. DIMAR maintains its position."" Radical leftist party Syriza also voiced opposition to the austerity package -- and urged people to take to the streets to demonstrate against its passage. ""Government measures should not be voted into effect, they will not be implemented,"" a statement said. ""Public protests are the only effective answer to the plans to demolish the rights of workers and of young people (that) will mean the subordination of the country to its lenders and to big capital."" Greece, and particularly Athens, has seen repeated street demonstrations against the austerity measures imposed on the nation, some of which have turned violent. Two general strikes have been called in recent weeks by unions who say that another round of cuts to wages and pensions will be too painful for the Greek people to bear. Critics of austerity argue that the country needs measures to promote growth and create new jobs. Samaras said he was already pushing for Greece to be given more than the 31 billion euros expected in the latest installment of funds ""so that there is a significant effect on the real economy."" Greece's long-running economic woes have shaken global markets and led to fears it could crash out of the 17-member eurozone single currency if it defaults on its debt. The turmoil in the eurozone has exacerbated concerns about other ailing nations such as Spain and Italy, which are also struggling with high unemployment and debt.

"(CNN) -- So it comes down to this: On Tuesday, the president who can't possibly win re-election confronts the challenger who can't possibly beat him. Licensed, as I am, to pump gas and commit punditry in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, I am obligated to make a prediction. Or, in other words: It's time to guess. Three weeks ago, on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" I ventured that something happened at that Denver debate beyond President Barack Obama not showing up for work. The president, I noted, had never run a campaign to get re-elected, just a campaign to stop the other guy, Mitt Romney, from getting elected. When the Romney who arrived to debate was not the sulfur-breathing demon the president had led us to expect, Obama was left with no campaign at all.  ""This is a man with two empty holsters,"" I noted. ""His campaign could collapse."" I think it did. Romney: My vision for America . Then an unexpected voter named Sandy resuscitated Obama's campaign. What factors must we understand in these final hours to identify the winner of this election? First, we'd have to understand who is going to win independents. Four years ago, Obama won independents by 8 points over John McCain. After the Denver debate, that advantage reversed itself. In recent Washington Post/ABC News tracking polls, Obama has trailed Romney among independent voters by 16 to 20 percentage points.  Recent CBS polls also reported that Romney has led Obama among independents by 5% in Ohio, 6% in Florida and a massive 21% in Virginia. If this lead among independents held through Election Day, Romney would win these states. Post-Sandy survey data, however, indicates the storm may have blown away Romney's advantage with independents, at least temporarily. The Politico/GW Battleground Poll has the president pulling within 1 point among independent voters, 43% to 44%. Our own PurplePoll of swing states has the president taking a one point lead among purple state independents, 45% to 44%. However, the final NBC/WSJ national poll reports that Romney is winning independents by 7 points. And the new CNN/ORC poll gives Romney a 22% lead with independents. Who wins independents might depend upon whether Obama's ""Sandy bounce"" was a real change or a temporary bump in the president's fortunes. If voters believe the president's energetic response indicates he has learned a lesson and will be more responsive to them in a second term, this election could break Obama's way. Obama: My vision for America . Second, to identify the winner, we'd have to see whether Romney has closed the gender gap. The latest Associated Press poll has Romney erasing a 16-point gender gap in the past month. Pew Research tells us Romney's and Obama's favorability ratings among women voters are now nearly equal.  Pew analyst Michael Dimock expects the gender gap ""to look very similar to the last few election cycles, with women somewhere between 6 and 8 points to favor Obama, and fairly consistent with where we've been since 1980."" Our own post-Sandy PurplePoll has Romney closing the gender gap to 7 points, enough for him to win. Third, to call the election for Obama, I'd have to believe he doesn't hit his head on the ceiling every time he stands, but he does.  The president's percentage number is stuck some 2% or 3% short of the 50% mark. The Real Clear Politics national average has Obama stuck at 47.8% with Romney tight on his heels at 47.3%. Our last two PurplePolls of likely voters in swing states have Obama at 47% to 48%. Surveys that show a higher percentage for the president, cracking the 50% line, such as the overcooked Marist poll in Ohio, are preposterously overweighted with Democrats. Marist unexplainably paints Ohio 9% more Democrat than Republican, with the Republican share of the electorate lower today than in 2008, when Republicans were swallowing razor blades and Obama mania was cresting.  Other surveys, which perhaps have spent less time in the crock pot, show a different Ohio:  A CBS/NYT poll reports Republican enthusiasm outstripping Democrat enthusiasm in Ohio by 14 points. Politics: If Obama wins... My experience is that polarizing incumbents running against acceptable challengers can count on getting just about exactly what they are getting in the last poll, heading into the election -- and no more. The electoral ceiling over Obama's head is hard. In my view, it is a couple of points too low for him to win re-election. What else would we have to understand to identify the likely winner? Fourth, we'd have to see who has captured the powerful remnants of the 2010 surge that renewed the ""silent majority's"" voice and secured GOP control of the House of Representatives. Anecdotal evidence and survey data tell us that Romney has momentum with white, working-class men in swing states and nationally. A new poll from the conservative American Future Fund has Romney within a point in blue-collar Minnesota. Obama's campaign is suddenly running ads in a working-class state such as Pennsylvania that he had previously put in his pocket.  New data has Romney tied with Obama in Pennsylvania, 47% to 47%, within 2 points in Ohio, and tied with the president in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, Romney is drawing the largest crowds of his campaign, packed with those Reagan-Democratic men, in, of all places, Ohio.  Early on Election Night, if Romney starts winning blue-collar, working class counties in western Pennsylvania, he will win them everywhere, including Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Minnesota.  At this point, it is almost impossible for Romney to win the presidency small. He either loses or puts around 300 electoral votes in the bank. Fifth, to identify our next president, we would have to understand who has the edge, compared with '08, in early and absentee voting. GOP sources tell me that in Ohio, for example, Republicans have increased their early turnout by more than 100,000 from 2008 while Democrat turnout is down 150,000. That is a 250,000-vote swing in a state Obama only won by 260,000 votes at the apogee of his popularity. This pattern, I'm informed, holds in other swing states. Sixth, we have to examine whether the Obama campaign can compensate for dimming passion among its supporters with a more energetic turn-out-the-vote machine on Election Day. It's fair to admit that Team Obama has had a four-year head start, nearly endless resources and a brilliant team of social media wizards to build an unmatched get-out-the-vote operation. But Obama has disappointed even his own supporters. The thrill of his historic political accomplishment is gone. Without passion to fuel the machine, a turnout engine is just a collection of bolts. Politics: If Romney wins... My experience is that the Beatles were right:  Money can't buy you love, or turnout. Seventh, to identify our next president, we have to understand how publicly embarrassing it is to be a Republican these days. Hollywood, the music industry, the news media, the fashion industry, the intellectual elite and the news media all fawn over Obama. To identify yourself as a Republican Romney voter, however, is to admit that you are culturally backward. In effect, survey questioners are asking Obama voters if they self-identify as cool.  They are asking Romney voters if they would publicly admit to wearing socks with sandals. Too often, Republicans dare not speak their name, because they know the cool kids won't invite them to play. This phenomenon, the reticent Republican factor, like the shy Tory factor found in British polls in the '90s, could easily account for a 4% to 5% unexpected pro-Romney bump on Election Day. Late polls in 1980 gave Ronald Reagan only a 2% to 3% lead over Jimmy Carter.  Reagan ended up winning by nearly 10%.  For the same reason, I would expect this campaign's final public opinion polls and exit polls this Tuesday to underreport the Republican vote by a handful of points. Add it all up, and this is a close call. Perhaps it is best made both with my heart and my head. Four years ago, Obama's campaign claimed a unique energy.  Electing the first black president of the United States was a singular moment of national pride. Now the Obama campaign pretends the opposite: They tell us that history-making event was ordinary.  Team Obama and many others model their turnout predictions and surveys upon 2008, overloading them with Democrats. They would have us think that the electoral cosmos has been realigned in a stable and permanent way. In the end, I cannot embrace as common the rarest of political astronomies. I do not believe Obama's comet comes around every day. That leaves Mitt Romney as the next president of the United States.

"(CNN) -- Exposure to the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has resulted in 162 cases of illnesses reported to the Louisiana state health department, according to a report released Monday. Of those cases, 128 involved workers on oil rigs or individuals involved in the oil spill cleanup efforts, the report said. Among the most common reported symptoms were throat irritation, shortness of breath, cough, eye irritation, nausea and headaches, according to the department's oil spill surveillance report. The weekly report gathers data from a surveillance network of doctors, clinics, emergency care locations and medical facilities. According to the most recent report, since the beginning of the oil spill, of the workers who reported illnesses, 120 were male and eight were female. Of the general public affected, nine were male and 25 were female. Most of those who reported symptoms were between the ages of 18 and 64, the report said. There were six illnesses reported the week of June 20, a sharp decrease from a high of 38 reported illnesses the first week of June, the report said. Several of the workers who fell ill reportedly had been exposed to fumes from the dispersants being deployed in the Gulf, the report said. Most of those affected worked on the cleanup efforts in some way. Twenty-three of those with symptoms worked on an oil rig, the report said. Most workers went to an emergency room or an urgent care center when they developed symptoms. At least 21 people were briefly hospitalized. In a related development, Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals Secretary Alan Levine asked Monday that BP pay $10 million to fund six months of mental health services to people affected by the spill. ""There exists anger, anxiety and uncertainty among the families and communities affected by the spill, which will easily manifest into addiction and various forms of mental health crisis if not confronted,"" he said in a letter to BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles. Teams have counseled almost 2,000 people in affected areas, and are reporting increases in anxiety, depression, stress, grief, excessive drinking, earlier drinking and suicidal ideation, he said. ""These are early warning signs of developing substance abuse and dependence, mental illness, suicide and familial breakdown including divorce, spouse abuse and child abuse and neglect."" In a separate request, Catholic Charities is seeking $3.2 million for six months of mental health services, he said in the letter, which asked Suttles to respond within a week.","Louisiana report says 162 people have reported illnesses .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Lillo Brancato Jr., an actor who appeared in ""The Sopranos,"" was acquitted of the 2005 killing an off-duty New York City police officer but found guilty of attempted burglary. Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on ""The Sopranos"" and played alongside Robert De Niro in ""A Bronx Tale."" Brancato, 32, was also acquitted of two counts of burglary, but could face three to 15 years in prison on the attempted burglary charge. He has already served three years, according to his attorney, Joseph Tacopina. Police officer Daniel Enchautegui, 28, was killed trying to break up a burglary attempt at his neighbor's house in the Bronx in December 2005. During the trial, Brancato said there was not a break-in. Brancato said he knew the owner of the home, and that he and friend Steven Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium. Brancato told the jury that the owner, a Vietnam veteran, gave him permission to come to his house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted. Brancato admitted to breaking a window at the home, but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and he said he was trying to wake up his friend to get the drugs. When Brancato and Armento entered the home, the next door neighbor -- Enchautegui -- came outside to investigate. That's when prosecutors said Armento shot the officer through the heart with his .357 Magnum. Armento was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November. The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento. Enchautegui was shot in the chest by Armento when he interrupted the alleged robbery, but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying. ""This jury spoke loud and clear, that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer,"" Tacopina said. Brancato appeared on six episodes of the hit HBO series ""The Sopranos"" as a wannabe mobster in 2000.

"(CNN) -- Syrian warplanes pounded rebel fighters and car bombs went off in the Damascus suburbs Wednesday as the architect of a failed cease-fire huddled with Chinese officials in Beijing. At least 121 people died in the 19-month-old conflict on Wednesday, opposition activists reported. Russian-built MiG jets and artillery targeted neighborhoods in and around Damascus, the commercial capital of Aleppo and the southern city of Daraa, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Rebel groups accuse Syria's longtime ally, Iran, of supplying surveillance drones to help direct the airstrikes, displaying what they say are captured aircraft and operating manuals. Iran says it's not providing military aid to Syria. A rebel group, meanwhile, claimed responsibility for a bombing that Syria's state news agency SANA said killed 11 people in the Damascus suburb of Saida Zaynab. The group said the blast killed eight Syrian troops and no civilians, but another rebel faction said three children were among the dead. Brahimi in Beijing . Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N- Arab League special envoy tasked with finding an end to the long-running conflict, was in Beijing on Wednesday for talks with Chinese officials. China has offered a four-point plan to end the war, calling for a cease-fire, plans for political settlement and transition and international humanitarian aid. Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China wants to work with world powers to reach a ""fair, peaceful and appropriate"" resolution, the state news agency Xinhua reported. But he said Syria's future should be determined by its citizens, and its sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity should be respected. ""A political resolution is the only pragmatic option in Syria,"" Yang said. Brahimi worked for a cease-fire during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which ended Monday, but the truce never took hold. On Wednesday, he said a political resolution to the conflict is the only realistic approach to the ""complicated and sensitive situation in Syria,"" ""All parties involved should cease fire and violence so as to create conditions for a political resolution,"" Brahimi said. Both China and Russia, where Brahimi held talks Monday, have blocked tough U.N. Security Council initiatives against the Syrians. Rebels target 'nerve center' in Aleppo . Rebel fighters in Aleppo, the scene of heavy fighting since August, focused their efforts Wednesday on a military headquarters compound they say houses political prisoners. ""The air force intelligence building is the nerve center for the regime operation in Aleppo,"" Abdulla Yasin, a spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army, told CNN. Syrian troops surround the building and have moved the prisoners held there to upper-story offices, ""to prevent the FSA from firing rockets or artillery rounds into the building,"" Yasin said. ""We must be very careful to prevent harm to the innocent civilians and political prisoners trapped inside, because it appears they are being used as some type of human shields,"" he said. Fighting extended into the countryside around the city, with artillery fire and airstrikes targeting the town of Atarib. At least 10 people were killed and 20 wounded there, Yasin said, while three more died in the nearby town of Kafr Hamr. CNN cannot independently confirm accounts of fighting or death tolls from Syria as the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. The numbers reported by the LCC do not include deaths from security forces or the military. More than 35,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, according to the Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria, a group that tracks fatalities.

"Washington (CNN) -- We were somewhere down South in the back half of October 1996. I believe we were in a theater. I remember thinking how terrible the lighting was, how small and deflated the crowd. I remember the look on the candidate's face. Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole was on stage with Heather Whitestone, the first deaf Miss America. She signed, ""I love you"" to the crowd. Then he signed it, too. They said what they were supposed to say, but there was something wordless encapsulated in that moment. I remember for the first time thinking, ""Dole knows he's going to lose."" I have covered campaigns since 1984. It is the losing ones I remember most. Sure, Dole had been the consistent underdog in his bid to unseat then-President Bill Clinton. But politicians are like gamblers, wired to believe they will beat the odds. Unlike gamblers, though, when presidential nominees run out of chips, they can't fold and go home. Greene: What it's like to lose an election . As it turns out, late October is about when Dole and company knew the game was lost but not over. One top aide tells stories of a dispirited Dole who said during a West Coast swing that he was done and wanted to go home. The source says Dole was eventually persuaded to keep moving with a nonstop, cross-country trek to gin up some campaign excitement and try to help down-ballot Republicans. But a senior Dole strategist told me this week that it was the candidate's idea to lead this last hurrah. 'Kinda says it all about the man' ""We knew we were going to lose ... and Dole came up with the selfless idea to do the 96-hour fly-around and to help save the Congress. Kinda says it all about the man."" The result was a 96-hour victory tour. Staff wore 96-hour victory T-shirts, and the press received caps that read ""96 hours until the White House Beat."" We flew crazily around the country, visited bowling alleys and diners in the dead of night, Dairy Queens and factories by day, interrupted by ""hygiene stops"" at various hotels. It all led to a final sentimental stop in Dole's hometown of Russell, Kansas, where he voted on Election Day. The Senate and House stayed in Republican hands. It was perhaps some solace for Dole, who exited the political scene on November 5, 1996. He opened his Election Night speech in typically wry, painfully truthful fashion: ""I was thinking on the way down in the elevator -- tomorrow will be the first time in my life I don't have anything to do."" Politics: Romney trails in states with personal ties . Flash forward 12 years. Sen. John McCain, of a different generation but like Dole an old warrior, knew his political battle was lost as early as mid-September, according to former top aide Steve Schmidt. ""With the '(on the) right track' number in the country dropping to 6% and the stock market diving, we were the incumbent party. The blame would default to the Republicans. We knew at that point it was not survivable."" In contrast to the Dole campaign, losing was never spoken about out loud in Camp McCain. ""I never said anything to him,"" Schmidt says, ""and he never said anything to me, but everyone was reality-based."" There was never a question in the McCain camp that the candidate would be out there fighting until the end of what everyone knew was coming. Anything less than a full-on effort can shave a point or two off the percentages of down-ballot candidates. However long a candidate or his staff has to prepare mentally for defeat, it is still a blow of surprising proportions. Those who have been through it liken it to having a terminally ill loved one -- you know what's coming, but it doesn't help. Opinion: What's really at stake in election 2012 . 'We lost. It's so hard' Schmidt describes Election Night with McCain like this: ""When you are at that moment in the suite 'we lost Ohio. We lost North Carolina.' You know it's over. We lost. It's so hard."" In a graceful concession speech bowing to the sweep of history, McCain congratulated the nation's first African-American president and told his supporters that ""we fought as hard as we could. And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."" If there is something worse than campaigning for weeks without hope, it may be losing in overtime. Al Gore won the popular vote and lost the electoral vote in a presidential election ultimately untangled 35 days later with a controversial Supreme Court decision. Gore yielded, saying while he disagreed with the court, he accepted the decision ""for the sake of unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession."" Four years later, John Kerry went to bed in Boston on Election Night believing that Ohio absentee votes would make him the president. It was clear by morning he was wrong. Politics: If Romney wins... Elated by early exit polling on Election Night, Camp Kerry was both stunned and devastated. But the candidate insisted he didn't want to drag things out since there was no chance of winning: He ended his campaign at Faneuil Hall in Boston just hours after a meeting of close aides. ""I'm sorry,"" he told the crowd, ""that we got here a little bit late and a little bit short."" People often say that candidates seem different -- better, bigger, more likable in their goodbye moments than at any point in the election process. Kerry was seen as removed, unemotional and often peeved to be so challenged by a man he didn't believe should be president. There was none of that in his parting words: ""I wish that things had turned out a little differently. But in an American election, there are no losers, because whether or not our candidates are successful, the next morning we all wake up as Americans."" Politics: If Obama wins... Coulda, shoulda, wouldas and a world of hurt . As poetic and gracious as the losers generally are, there is bitterness over the slash-and-burn nature of campaigns that lasts for years, anger over lost moments, frustration over coulda, shoulda, wouldas and a world of hurt. One source in a losing campaign called the concession speech ""the highest point of acting, but the lowest point of sincerity."" Still, they do seem different at the end, maybe because it's not about them. The finale of a losing campaign might be acting on the personal level, but it's real democracy on a grand scale. In saluting Dole, Gore, Kerry and McCain, Schmidt explains, ""You have people who were all senators deeply rooted in the best aspects of that institution, duty-bound to play their part in ensuring a smooth and peaceful transition of power."" Think about it -- the first person who addresses the winner as Mr. President-elect is the loser. It is the loser who offers the first legitimization of the election with a concession speech, beginning a series of events that ends in the swearing-in of a president in January.

"(CNN) -- The judge in the sodomy case of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on Monday postponed the trial until August 9 because of allegations a female prosecutor had an affair with his accuser. As a result of the allegations, the defense has asked that charges against Anwar be dropped. A blogger reported last week that the female member of the prosecutor's office allegedly had an affair with the male aide who accused Anwar, 62, of sodomizing him at a luxury apartment in June 2008. Sodomy, even if consensual, is punishable by 20 years in prison in the majority-Muslim country. Anwar has pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecution said the woman has been removed from the team even though the allegations involving her haven't been verified. The prosecution must respond over the next week to defense charges that the case has be compromised. Anwar has filed a police report against the woman and the 25-year-old male aide, accusing them of violating the country's Official Secrets Act. The defense team believes the aide may have had access to confidential trial information. Investigators arrested Anwar in July 2008 -- four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties he led made gains on the ruling party in parliamentary elections. ""I don't believe that I'm going to get a fair trial,"" Anwar told CNN in February. ""A fair trial would require a competent, independent judge to immediately strike out the charge because any sexual assault must have a case to support the charge."" Anwar has called his arrest a ""dirty trick and conspiracy"" orchestrated by authorities who are trying to discredit him. ""They think that by doing this they can frustrate the opposition because they think the coalition will be more fragile without me,"" said Anwar, who oversees a multiethnic opposition alliance and his own Justice Party. ""Clearly they have underestimated the commitment of the (parties)."" The U.S. State Department has said that Anwar's arrest ""raises serious questions and concerns."" Anwar was the heir apparent to former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged for corruption and sodomy. Anwar spent six years in prison after being convicted on corruption charges in 1999 and on sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. Malaysia's highest court overturned the sodomy conviction and ordered him released from prison in 2004. However, the corruption verdict was never lifted, barring him from running for political posts until 2008. A loose coalition of opposition parties -- with Anwar at the helm -- won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections in March of that year. It was the second time in the country's history that the ruling party failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. Anwar has said the investigators trying to build a case against him are the same ones who hid evidence that could have cleared him in his sodomy-related conviction in 1999. Journalist Liz Gooch contributed to this report.","A junior prosecutor is accused of having an affair with the accuser .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The last living survivor of the Titanic earned only a small fraction of what auctioneers hoped to raise when she sold her final remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills. Millvina Dean, 97, was trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers. The 17 items belonging to 97-year-old Millvina Dean sold for about $8,000 on Saturday, according to auctioneer Alan Aldridge -- not enough to pay for two months at her nursing home. Aldridge had earlier speculated the sale could raise up to $50,000 for her. But the bidder who bought the Dean item with the closest connection to the doomed voyage returned it to her after the sale, Aldridge said. ""A young man bought the canvas bag for £1,500 ($2,200) and donated it back to Millvina,"" Aldridge said. He did not reveal the buyer's identity. The canvas bag might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, Aldridge said. ""Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia, the rescue ship, in a mail sack,"" Aldridge said. After her rescue, Dean, her mother and brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions. ""There is speculation that this would have been the bag. It's a leather and canvas bag. You would easily get a child or infant in it,"" Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag. It was the second auction in less than a year at Henry Aldridge & Son for Dean, who was a 9-week-old baby when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Aldridge said before the sale he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible. ""She's in a residential nursing home. She's 97 years of age. She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees,"" he said. ""As she said, £3,000 a month is £36,000 a year, which is a lot of money,"" he said. ""When she runs out of money, the state will pay fees for her, but while she can pay her fees, she decides where she gets her care. When the state pays, they decide."" Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said. ""It's made a lot of people aware of her plight, a lot of people have sent her funds,"" he said. Dean never married and had no children. ""There are cousins but there is no one directly to support her,"" Aldridge said. ""The property she lived in (before she moved to the nursing home) was not hers. She's just an ordinary little old lady. ""If she's lucky, she'll get another four or five years, she's quite a fit lady,"" he said. Dean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection, Aldridge said. The auction included 17 items from her collection -- most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her, but not from the ship itself. The auction, in Devizes, southwest England, also included letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton-West which fetched more than $36,000. One letter sold for about $21,800, while two others went for about $5,800 and just over $10,000, Aldridge said. The letters include descriptions of her family's trip to board the Titanic and the immediate aftermath of the sinking. Dainton-West, who was 10 months old when the ship went down, died in October 2007, the auctioneer said.","Last survivor of Titanic earns fraction of what auctioneers hoped to raise .

"(CNN) -- In the chaotic weeks during Egypt's revolution, thousands of inmates escaped from jail. Untold hundreds among them were Islamist militants. Many more detained for belonging to jihadist groups have been released from detention in the 18 months since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted -- and the activities of some are beginning to cause serious concern to Egyptian and Western intelligence agencies. Muhammad Jamal Abu Ahmad, 48, was one of those released. A heavyset, bearded man, Abu Ahmad was raised in the poor and crowded Cairo suburb of Shoubra. He joined Egyptian Islamic Jihad as a young man and spent time in Afghanistan training mujahedeen and in Sudan in the 1990s -- before being jailed when he returned to Egypt in 2002. He spent the next nine years in detention but appears never to have faced a trial. Former jihadists who knew him describe him as ""ultra-radical,"" according to Barak Barfi of the New America Foundation, who has spoken with former senior members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Cairo. Just what Abu Ahmad may be doing now goes to the heart of the dilemma facing counterterrorism agencies in the Arab world and the West: Of the thousands of Islamist militants now back in circulation in the wake of the Arab revolutions -- who is taking up arms again in the cause of global jihad? The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Abu Ahmad is suspected of a role in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11. The Journal quoted a former U.S. official as saying that intelligence reports suggested some of the attackers trained at camps Abu Ahmad established in the Libyan Desert. ""Mr. Ahmad, although believed to be one of the most potent of the new militant operatives emerging from the chaos of the Arab Spring, isn't the only one, according to Western officials,"" the article continued. Like many former jihadists now out of Egyptian jails, Abu Ahmad is difficult to trace. There is no clear evidence that he has spent time in Libya or is still there, though the long desert border would make a crossing relatively straightforward. Former comrades insist he is in Cairo, studying for his master's degree in Islamic law. Magdi Salem, a founding member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, told CNN that Abu Ahmad had been a fierce fighter. But he added: ""I last saw him three months ago but he had no announced intentions of jihad and informed me that he is staying in Egypt and was determined to finish his studies."" ""Like many jihadists who were against Gadhafi killing his own people, he may have communicated with rebels in Libya during the revolution,"" Salem said. Nizar Ghorab, a prominent lawyer in Cairo who has represented jihadists in court, told CNN: ""I have been contacted by different foreign government agencies requesting information about him."" And Mohamed al-Zawahiri (brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and a former member of Islamic Jihad himself) told CNN Wednesday that Abu Ahmad was definitely in Cairo. But keeping track of the activities and intentions of former jihadists -- many of whom have stayed in touch with each other since being released -- is no easy task. In May 2011, Egypt's interior minister, Ahmed Gamal El Din, told CNN that around 23,000 prisoners had escaped during the collapse of the Mubarak regime (though they included many common criminals), and only some 7,000 had been apprehended. The new Muslim Brotherhood government has granted pardons to dozens more jihadists, some of whom had been held in ""administrative detention"" by the Mubarak government without ever seeing a courtroom. Last month, Mustafa Hamza -- a prominent member of Gamaa Islamiya -- was freed. He had been implicated in the slaughter of foreign tourists in Luxor in 1997, when some 60 people were gunned down and then mutilated. Hamza was also implicated in the attempted assassination of Mubarak in 1995. He was extradited to Egypt from Iran eight years ago. Of those released, some -- like Magdi Salem -- have taken up roles as mediators between the government and jihadist cells that have emerged in the volatile Sinai Peninsula. With the blessing of President Mohammed Morsy, Salem met with religious and tribal leaders in the Sinai town of El Arish in August -- in an effort to prevent further attacks on security forces by groups such as Supporters of Jihad in the Sinai Peninsula. ""We believe there is a conspiracy to damage the reputation of the Islamists through attacks like these,"" he said in remarks quoted by The National, a Persian Gulf newspaper. Osama Rushdi, a former Gamma Islamiya member, says the situation in Sinai is the most alarming facing the government. Attacks by militants on police posts have killed dozens of members of the security forces, and there have been several attempts by militant cells to cross into Israel. Last month militants carrying black flags (often associated with al Qaeda) invaded a U.N. peacekeepers' base in the Sinai. Another of those released, Tareq al Zumour, who was convicted in 1981 of involvement in the assassination of President Anwar Sadat, has founded the political wing of Gamma Islamiya, the Building and Development Party. Other militants, such as Mohamed al-Zawahiri, also appear to have embraced the new political process in Egypt. He demands Egypt become an Islamic republic under sharia law, but does not espouse violence. Last month, al-Zawahiri presented CNN with a manifesto for a truce between al Qaeda and the West, though he says he has not seen his brother since 1996. The Egyptian government's ability to track militants back in circulation has been dramatically impaired since Mubarak's fall. The State Security Investigative Service was disbanded, to be replaced by another agency called Homeland Security. Hundreds of senior police officers were sacked; thousands of security files vanished or were burned. Compounding a sense of general insecurity, the Libyan revolution released a flow of weapons across the border, many of which ended up in Sinai. According to Egyptian security sources, these have included antiaircraft missiles. In addition, European counterterrorism officials are concerned that Cairo has become an easy destination for Westerners bent on jihad. They say a number of militants have left Europe for Cairo in recent months; some are going to Cairo to transit to Yemen and other fronts. Egypt's president draws much of his support from religious conservatives and Salafists, and is anxious not to be seen as using Mubarak-era tactics against Islamist radicals. Morsy also has called very publicly for the release from jail in the United States of Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind sheikh convicted of playing a role in the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. Rahman is known as the 'godfather' of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Mohamed Al-Zawahiri insists the fuss over Abu Ahmad and other jihadists is misplaced and exaggerated. ""I think the United States is once again trying to create a new bogeyman and are giving him a much higher status than he deserves. The media and certain governments will try to prove that the release of Islamists after the revolution was a mistake. But it is only justice served,"" he told CNN. Whatever the merits of the release program, Western counterterrorism agencies fear the law of unintended consequences may apply.","Untold numbers of Islamist jihadists escaped prison during Egypt's revolution .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Something in the lakes around Orlando, Florida, has claimed the lives of three boys this summer. Will Sellars' family says he died after being exposed to a deadly amoeba on a Florida lake. ""This thing is just there. It's lurking like some deadly thing in the water which can take our children's lives and we all have to be aware,"" said Orange County Health Department Director Dr. Kevin Sherin. The ""thing"" isn't a fish or alligator. It is so small it cannot be seen with the naked eye. The killer that lives in the hot, fresh water is a single cell amoeba that once exposed to the human brain through the nasal passages is almost always fatal. At first people exposed to the amoeba, naegleria fowleri, suffer from flu-like symptoms. Very quickly, in from one to 14 days, the symptoms worsen, Sherin said. ""There's a downhill course. Folks lapse into a coma; there are abnormal movements of the eyes and a terrible cascade of events leading to the actual death of parts of the brain."" Sherin said exposure to the amoeba can be detected by an MRI and it can be treated with antibiotics if caught early enough, but Sherin said he believes medical personnel are not in the habit of looking for the disease. That is because the amoeba is very rare. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, has documented 24 cases in the United States since 1989. Health officials do not know what caused three cases in Orlando in one summer. Theories range from warmer temperatures to a drought that has lowered lake levels. Sherin said officials considered closing access to the lakes, but concluded they did not have the authority. Even if public lakes had been closed, private lakes would have remained open. So, at 15 parks and lakes around the city, warnings about the amoeba have been posted. The signs urge bathers to wear nose clips or stay out of water warmer than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which can be a breeding ground for the amoeba. The warnings provide little solace for Steve Sellars. Health investigators said they believe Sellars' 11-year old son, Will, was exposed to the amoeba during an August weekend spent learning to wakeboard on Orlando's Lake Jessamine. ""You think it won't happen to me, it won't happen to my family."" Sellars said. ""You're wrong"" ""[Will's] symptoms were like a flu bug,"" Sellars said, ""We rushed him to the hospital and two days later he's passed away. It's like a nightmare."" A month later, a 10-year-old boy died from exposure to the amoeba. Investigators have not determined where he was exposed. The death of a 14 year-old boy in June in the Orlando area also is being blamed on the amoeba. As he investigates the deaths of the three boys from the amoeba, Sherin is concerned these type of deaths may be underreported. Health departments in Florida are not required to report amoeba infections to the state. The illness is so rare, he said, it may be commonly misdiagnosed in the United States and internationally. He said anyone who exhibits flu-like symptoms who has been in a lake recently should see a doctor immediately. Speaking in Will's old bedroom, which Steve Sellars has decorated with photographs of his son, Sellars said he hopes he can help get the word out. He does not want anyone to lose a family member as quickly and mysteriously as he did. ""It's the worst thing we ever had to go through and I hate to see any other parent go through this and another child lose his life,"" Sellars said.

"(CNN) -- The dispute between the NCAA and the University of North Dakota over its Fighting Sioux nickname and logo took a new turn Wednesday when the school said the filing of petitions requires it to use the nickname and logo while the issue plays out, possibly in a statewide vote. The National Collegiate Athletic Association has a policy against mascots ""deemed hostile or abusive toward Native Americans."" But people who favor the mascot filed petitions Tuesday with North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger. The petitioners have a two-pronged strategy. One move calls for the state constitution to be changed in order to stipulate the use of the Fighting Sioux name. If certified, that measure would be on the November ballot. Petitioners have until August to submit signatures. The other effort calls for voters to decide in June whether to repeal a law that permitted the school to drop the name. Those petitions were filed this week. In the meantime, university President Robert Kelley said the school is resuming the use of the name and logo. ""I want to reaffirm our respect for the laws of the state and the processes guaranteed under the North Dakota Constitution,"" he said in a statement. The NCAA said Wednesday the ""university is subject to the terms of the policy if it uses the logo and nickname."" ""Those terms include not being able to host NCAA championship events and a prohibition against using the nickname and imagery on uniforms for student-athletes, along with cheerleaders, (the) mascot or band members, in any NCAA championships,"" said Erik Christianson, NCAA director of media relations, in a statement. The wrangling has been complicated. The state Legislature in early 2011 passed a law requiring the university to use the Fighting Sioux nickname. But that law was repealed in November 2011 when legislators approved a bill that allowed the school to stop using the moniker. The state requires 13,452 certified signatures to put the law repeal issue before voters. North Dakota has about 684,000 residents. Petition supporters said they turned in more than the minimum number of signatures. ""By filing the petitions last night, the law as passed in early 2011 is now again in effect,"" Jaeger told CNN on Wednesday. ""The law passed in November 2011 is now suspended. I have 35 days to review the petitions. If I find the petitions sufficient, it will be certified for the ballot. If not, the bill passed in November will again become the law."" UND's rock-and-a-hard-place scenario marks the last gasp of a years-long controversy: North Dakota is the last holdout in the NCAA's campaign to get schools to drop their Native American monikers or get tribal blessings to keep them. In 2007, the North Dakota Board of Higher Education agreed to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname by August 15, 2011, in accordance with the NCAA's then-2-year-old policy on Native American mascots. Doug Fullerton will be paying close attention to what plays out. As commissioner of the Big Sky Conference, he is overseeing North Dakota's ascent from Division II obscurity to the far more lucrative stage of Division I. ""When we invited (North Dakota's football team) into the (Big Sky) conference, this was not an issue,"" he said last summer. Citing the conference's ""close, close ties to Native American tribes"" and the threat of boycotts, Fullerton said that he was on 'heightened alert' Wednesday, noting that North Dakota's conference membership -- slated to begin July 1 -- could be rescinded if the college presidents within Big Sky so decide. The 13 college presidents of the Big Sky Conference -- including Robert Kelley of North Dakota -- are scheduled to meet in early June, according to Fullerton. A message left by CNN with the North Dakota University System was not immediately returned Wednesday. In 2005, the NCAA sought to end the longstanding controversy surrounding Native American mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed ""abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin"" to either get Native American permission to use their name and likeness, or to come up with a new one. The resulting actions varied among the targeted schools. The Arkansas State Indians became the Red Wolves; the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Indians became the Crimson Hawks. Other schools satisfied the mandate by tweaking their name, like Southeastern Oklahoma State, where the Savages are now known as the Savage Storm. Others, like the Bradley University Braves, whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe, were allowed to keep their name so long as Native American logos and imagery were eschewed. Schools with higher-profile athletic programs fared better. The Florida State Seminoles, University of Utah Utes and Central Michigan University Chippewas each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course. But the North Dakota Fighting Sioux -- winners of seven national championships in men's ice hockey -- were denied such an endorsement from the Tribal Council of the Standing Rock Sioux.","NCAA has a policy against mascots ""deemed hostile"" to Native Americans .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London police said Thursday they are planning one of the largest and most complex operations in their history as the city gears up to host the G-20 summit next week. Police divers carry out security checks near the site of next week's G-20 summit in London. London's three police forces are being brought under a single umbrella for the G-20 security plan, dubbed Operation Glencoe, said Cmdr. Simon O'Brien of London's Metropolitan Police. Police forces from surrounding counties like Essex and Sussex are also assisting with security, he said. Officers will be protecting the summit venue, delegates, their hotels, their official engagements, as well as monitoring protests around the capital, O'Brien said. ""This is one of the largest, one of the most challenging, and one of the most complicated operations that we've ever delivered,"" he told reporters Thursday. The Met Police has canceled all staff leave for April 1 and 2. The summit takes place April 2.  Watch security preparations for the G-20 meeting » . O'Brien would not say how many police officers would be on duty, but he said there were 10,500 police shifts being scheduled between March 24 and April 2. The total cost of the security operation is £7.2 million ($10.4 million), he said. The G-20 summit brings together heads of state and financial leaders from the top 20 industrialized and emerging economies. Leaders from non-G-20 nations will also be represented, along with hundreds of other officials including the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The one-day summit is already attracting a ""significant amount of interest"" from protest groups, O'Brien said. ""Old faces on the protest circuit"" have started to reappear ahead of the event, he said, although he gave no names. ""Some see the G-20 as an opportunity to galvanize support"" for their various other causes, he said. The first big protest is expected to take place Saturday in Central London. Police expect some 20,000 people to turn out, O'Brien said. Though organized by trade unions, some 120 different groups are taking part in the ""Put People First"" march, which will start at Victoria Station, wind through Trafalgar Square, and end in a demonstration at Hyde Park. Heavy rain is predicted for Saturday. April 1, the day before the summit, will see various smaller demonstrations in central London. Protesters are calling it ""Financial Fools Day,"" a play on April Fools Day and the anger surrounding the current economic crisis. An ""Alternative G-20 Summit"" will also taking place near the summit venue, the ExCeL convention center in east London. Police have been developing intelligence about all the demonstrations and a policing plan for each one, O'Brien said. There will be no special laws under which officers can arrest protesters who break the law, he said, and counter-terrorism measures will only be used when they apply. Asked about reports that some protesters may be planning violence similar to the recent riots in Greece, O'Brien said simply that police have ""well-rehearsed tactics"" and an experienced team on hand to deal with it. ""We will not tolerate any people breaking the law, attacking buildings, people, or our officers,"" he said. There have also been reports that protesters may be planning to storm important buildings like the Bank of England. O'Brien said only that police were prepared for a ""range of instances."" The ExCeL venue is in East London, 10 minutes from the financial district of Canary Wharf, and there are concerns that protesters angry about the economy could target workers in the area. The London Chamber of Commerce said many firms are advising their staff to take precautionary measures, including wearing more casual clothing, hiding any company logos, canceling unnecessary meetings, and keeping movement in and out of the building to a minimum. ""The vast majority of firms will have robust security arrangements in place,"" said the Chamber's chief executive, Colin Stanbridge. ""Canceling unnecessary meetings may have to be considered, but people shouldn't feel as though they can't travel in London to conduct important business."" UBS, which has offices in the financial district, would not confirm any specific measures but said the company was prepared. ""We are aware of the situation and we'll have appropriate security measures in place,"" a company spokeswoman told CNN. O'Brien called the precautionary measures ""common sense"" but said police would work to ensure that companies face no disruption next week. ""This is a very complex operation with some really experienced public order commanders,"" he said. ""We're up for it and we're up to it.""","Police say they are planning one of their largest and most complex operations .

"(CNN) -- English football's battle to eradicate racism suffered another blow on Thursday as police launched an investigation into allegations that a Chelsea supporter made a racist gesture towards a Manchester United player. A photo of the fan making a ""monkey"" action, which appeared to be targeted at United's Danny Welbeck during a League Cup match that Chelsea won 5-4, was published in a British newspaper Thursday . Chelsea has launched its own investigation into the matter and has already promised to assist the police in any way possible. A statement from the Metropolitan Police read: ""Today, Thursday, November 1, police have received a complaint regarding alleged racist behavior at Stamford Bridge last night, Wednesday, October 31. ""An investigation has been launched. There have been no arrests and enquiries continue.""

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- There is a shiny addition among the Ottoman mosques and palaces that make up Istanbul's stunning skyline: the metallic, mirrored dome of the new Sakirin Mosque, a Muslim place of worship built with a woman's touch. When sun reflects off Sakirin Mosque's dome, light can be seen across the Bosphorus Strait. For what may be the first time in history, women have been at the forefront of the construction of a mosque in Turkey. One of the project's leaders is Zeynep Fadillioglu, an interior decorator who has designed restaurants, hotels and luxury homes from New Delhi, India, to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and London, England. She helped organize a team of traditional mosque artists specializing in Islamic calligraphy, along with craftsmen in glassworks, metal-casting and lighting who, like Fadillioglu, have built careers working in exclusively secular architecture and design. ""I want people to feel peaceful and be left with themselves as much as possible and yet have beautiful art and artistic symbolism around them,"" she said. Istanbul has a venerable tradition of mosque architecture, dating back centuries to when Ottoman sultans declared themselves caliph, or spiritual leader of the Muslim world.  Watch Zeynep Fadilioglu show off her work and inspirations » . The shores of the Bosporus Strait are studded with 16th century masterpieces such as the Suleymaniye Mosque, built by the Ottoman Empire's most famous architect, Mimar Sinan, and ornate, neo-Baroque jewels designed by the Armenian Balyan family in the 19th century. But Istanbul's most senior Muslim cleric laments that mosque design suffered a decline after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I. ""In the last 70, 80 years, we have built mosques that are copies of Ottoman architecture,"" said Mustafa Cagrici, the mufti of Istanbul. ""This wasn't a good development, because the copy can never be as good as the original."" Fadillioglu and her team of artists are hoping to change that.  Look at photos of the mosque » . The Sakirin Mosque was commissioned by a wealthy Turkish Arab family and built in one of Istanbul's oldest cemeteries. The designers put a number of contemporary touches on the structure, giving it plate glass walls etched with gold-leaf verses from the Quran, framed by giant cast-iron grids. The mihrab -- the alcove that points worshippers in the direction of Mecca -- is made of asymmetrical ovals, similar to a design used by Fadillioglu to decorate a restaurant in London. And the chandelier is a multi-layered series of metal and plexiglass rings, carrying Quranic inscriptions and dripping with scores of delicate glass teardrops. ""The glass chandelier brings the high dome down to the people,"" Fadillioglu explained. ""So when they pray and kneel they don't feel lost with the light and it shelters them."" Many of the artists here never worked on a mosque before. ""It's special that a woman's hand is involved in this,"" said one of them, a male carpenter named Metin Cekeroglu. ""If you think about it, a home is made by woman. And if we think about this place as a home of God, we can also say women will make this place much better."" Fadillioglu said one of her goals was to bring extra attention into the design of the women's section of the mosque, an area that she says is often neglected by architects. According to Islamic tradition, worshippers are segregated by gender at mosques. ""I have seen mosques where women have been pushed to the worst part of stairs, cramped area. Sort of as if (they are) unwanted in the mosque,"" she said. ""That is not what Islam is about. ... Women are equal in Islam to men"" Five minutes' drive from the Sakirin Mosque stands the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, a 16th century structure built by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in honor of his favorite daughter. Unfortunately, female worshippers do not get to enjoy its stunning stained glass windows the way the men do. They have to pray in a small women's section, hidden behind a bank of chest-high shelves that store shoes. At the Sakirin Mosque, Fadillioglu said, she gave women praying on the balcony an unobstructed view of the dome, the ornate chandelier, and the area on the floor where the imam will lead prayers. ""I would like to come here to pray,"" said Elif Demir, an 18-year old art student with a funky, orange-dyed haircut who was working on the chandelier. ""This mosque is completely different because of the light that's coming through the walls, through the glass."" Fadillioglu's role in the Sakirin Mosque is all the more surprising because she comes from a jet-set side of Turkish society not normally associated with Islam. ""It is unusual,"" she conceded, ""because first of all not many modern people have been commissioned to design a mosque."" She spoke in a recent interview at Ulus 29, the expensive Istanbul hilltop restaurant and bar that is owned by her husband. Amid the Ottoman- and Selcuk-inspired flourishes she has sprinkled around the restaurant are echoes of designs seen at the Sakirin Mosque. A glass chandelier made of hundreds of crystal tear drops hangs above the bar, similar in style to the mosque's chandelier. Fadillioglu said being a night club owner does not prevent her from also being a Muslim. ""You might be surprised in Turkey to find some very modern-looking people being very religious at the same time,"" she said. Religion is a hot-button political issue in Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country with a strict secular system of government. For the past eight years a fierce power struggle has been under way between an urban secular elite and a rising new class of religiously conservative Turks from the Anatolian heartlands. Unlike the wives of Turkey's Islamic-rooted president and prime minister, Fadillioglu does not wear the Islamic headscarf that is often seen as the symbol of this new class of Turks. Fadillioglu said politics have polarized society. ""In my childhood ... you didn't differentiate between who was religious,"" she explained. ""Whoever wants to worship or visit this mosque, its open, its ready for them."" On May 8, Turkey's prime minister attended an inauguration ceremony for the Sakirin Mosque. Afterward, in an interview with CNN, the mufti of Istanbul called it the start of a new era of mosque design in Turkey. ""It is in Islamic tradition for women to commission mosques ... and now we have women who are building mosques as well,"" Cagrici said. ""God willing, I hope the world will see more of these beautiful mosques, touched by women's hands.""","For possibly first time in history, women take lead in building mosque in Turkey .

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech Tuesday night  compares favorably with a number of historic orations, a linguist said Thursday. Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Chicago, Illinois, after winning the presidency Tuesday night. ""His goal was to be understood by the widest possible audience during his victory speech, and he seems to have done a great job doing it,"" said Paul J.J. Payack, president of the Austin, Texas-based Global Language Monitor, which analyzed the speech for content, tone and length. ""He's at his best communicating directly and forthrightly with this audience and using different types of rhetorical devices,"" Payack said, noting that the speech was written to a seventh- or eighth-grade level. That's lower than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech (grade 8.8), President Reagan's 1987 ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech (grade 9.8) and even Obama's own 2004 Democratic Convention speech (grade 8.3), Payack said. In the four years since then, ""he has learned to speak more directly and more succinctly when he's giving a major address,"" the word aficionado said. He spoke admiringly of Obama's repeated use of the phrase ""Yes, we can,"" calling it ""very effective."" ""That's a very short, direct sentence,"" Payack said. ""Almost like a drumbeat hammering into people's minds and hearts."" He added, ""something like that comes across as a very effective rhetorical device."" That phrase compares with Reagan's ""Tear Down This Wall"" and President Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"" delivered in his inaugural speech. At about 2,000 words, the speech was short enough not to lose the audience's attention but long enough to cite specifics and cover the subject matter, Payack said.  Watch Obama's victory speech » . Twelve of those words were ""hope"" or variations of the word, which indicates optimism about the change (used nine times) he has promised to effect. Another 23 of the words were ""will,"" another way of making the speech forward-looking. Though most of Obama's verbs were in the active voice, 11 percent of the sentences were in the passive voice, a dependable method of deflecting responsibility, Payack said. He cited Obama's ""There will be setbacks and false starts"" as an example. ""He's spreading the responsibility around,"" Payack said. ""He didn't say, 'I will have setbacks. I will be wrong. I will make mistakes.' He used the passive voice for those types of constructions."" But the vast majority of the hopeful references were in the active voice, he said. ""It's very personal and very active. 'I promise we, as a people, will get there.' "" The speech was notable for what it omitted, too, Payack said. In this case, the absence of a reference to the September 11 terrorist attacks indicates a change in tone, he said. In his closing phrase, Obama repeats the mantra, ""Yes, we can,"" which serves as a call to action, an acknowledgment that the country faces hard work, Payack said. Obama is saying, ""I'm asking you to do something big, but we can do it together,"" Payack said. ""We are the change; we are the hope.""","Linguist says Obama's speech was on seventh- or eighth-grade level .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Dogs bred for the fighting pit have only one thing in their future: death. Fighting dogs may die in the ring or at the hands of their owners. If they are confiscated in a bust, they are almost always euthanized, experts say. Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, Merritt Clifton says. Thursday is the deadline for owners to retrieve any of the 50 remaining pit bulls seized in April from the Virginia property of suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who is accused of using them in vicious dogfights. A federal judge is expected to issue a court order to euthanize the animals. Officials and animal rights advocates agree that the dogs must lose this last battle for their lives because of their brutal training and risks to people and other animals. ""They're just not in any situation where they can be adopted,"" said Dr. Lauren Adams, a veterinarian with Emory Animal Hospital in Decatur, Georgia. ""They can snap at any point."" Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, according to the latest data from Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People. The pit bull is not a breed but a type that includes American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and pit bull mixes, according to the Pit Bull Rescue Central Web site. Clifton and other experts estimate anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of pit bulls euthanized at shelters were fighting dogs. ""Those dogs have been bred for aggression. You can breed for certain physical traits, but you can also breed for behavioral characteristics,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States. Dogs that lose the fights often are abandoned at shelters, but not all of them make it that far. Owners sometimes kill the dogs that don't win. Court documents from the Vick case say ""the losing dog was sometimes put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method.""  Learn about the dark world of dogfighting » . If the dogs do make it to shelters, they are usually euthanized quickly. Keeping them alive puts a burden on shelters, which can be held legally responsible if anything goes wrong, and puts the other animals at risk.  Watch why some say euthanasia is the only option for fighting dogs -- viewer discretion advised » . ""It's very difficult to deprogram that behavior once it is instilled,"" Pacelle said. ""Even if you can do it to some degree, all it takes is one lapse in the animal's behaviors to kill another animal or exhibit some other type of aggression."" Additionally, shelters face the threat of theft. In the United States, there are an estimated 40,000 people who are considered professional dogfighters and another 100,000 amateur ""streetfighters,"" according to John Goodwin, an expert on animal fighting with HSUS. Those involved compete for prizes as high as $100,000, and confiscated pit bulls are extremely valuable. Inside the overpopulated shelters, where it's survival of the most adoptable, shelters focus their limited resources on the dogs that stand a better chance of finding a home. The stigma associated with pit bull types has victimized the ""good"" pit bulls, Pacelle said. In some shelters, as many as 60 percent of dogs are pit bull mixes. More than 90 percent of pit bulls in shelters -- fighters or not -- end up euthanized, said Clifton, who has been researching animal shelters for more than three decades. In the early 1900s, pit bulls were characterized as ""nanny dogs"" because they were used by families to baby-sit their children. ""By the end of the century, they were these horrible, aggressive, fighting dog machines, and that's very unfortunate,"" said Ed Boks, general manager of Los Angeles Animal Services in California. The secondary fighting market has contributed to over breeding of pit bulls, Clifton said.

"(CNN) -- Memo to the ""adults"" of the Republican Party: . If you notice that I have changed my current missive to address adults (as opposed to addressing the establishment as I've done in the previous two), this was done to acknowledge Indiana GOP Chairman Eric Holcomb. Holcomb said recently, ""Republicans are fretting the four dancing now can't beat Obama in the fall â€” so their national talent search continues,"" adding that the pleas had come from ""the adults"" in the party. The truth of the matter is I like the phrase ""the adults"" much more than ""the establishment"" because it gives much more insight into the current state of the GOP. Chairman Holcomb clearly meant to differentiate the adults from the many children in the Republican Party. This caused me to get very nostalgic in thinking back to Thanksgiving dinners at my grandparents' house in the 1950s. In rural South Louisiana, the adults sat in the big dining room with real chairs, silverware, china, crystal and wine. Whereas the children were relegated to sitting on the front porch with folding chairs, card tables, paper plates and Dixie cups. We had our choice between orange pop and Barq's (that's root beer.) What really used to tick me off -- in fact it was the most scarring event of my childhood -- my Aunt Lilly used to bring Leidenheimer New Orleans french bread for the adults and we kids were forced to eat cruddy Baton Rouge sliced white bread. We were a rowdy bunch but deep down inside we always wondered what it would be like to sit with the adults at the big table. Herein lies your problem. You've got Karl Rove, Chris Christie, Mitt Romney, George Will, Mitch Daniels, Jeb Bush, and all the rest of 'em in the dining room. Out on the front porch is Sarah Palin, Newt, the Ricks (Santorum and Perry), Michele Bachmann, and Donald Trump. The adults have been trying to wire this thing up for some time and the children just won't behave on the front porch. You've got Santorum sneaking upstairs checking the medicine cabinet to see who is taking birth control pills. Let's not forget, just as Thanksgiving dinner was over we all had to get together under the oak tree in the front yard for the family photograph. And this was the '50s, we just did as we were told. But when you guys organize the family photo shoot in Tampa this coming August you are gonna have a hell of a time getting all of the children to line up for the picture. Sarah is not too happy about the way that you look at her. In fact, she has expressed a willingness to help out in Tampa by indicating her willingness to serve as your party's nominee. And if it is possible for George Will to get any whiter than he is, he will certainly turn to some shade of John McCain. Then you've got the problem of Newt out at the children's table. He doesn't play well with others. And it is gonna be hard to get him in line for the family photo. Newt is the kind of guy who can't seem to get the proper amount of attention and he's not the ""go along to get along"" type. I see from the news that Mitt has sent his super PAC goons to snatch up little Ricky Santorum and take him behind the woodshed for a little ""chat."" That ought to keep him subdued through Michigan. But that child has built up a lot of resentment over the years and has proven to be quite pesky. My guess is that you could have more trouble ahead with Santorum. He is what my aunt would refer to as a ""difficult"" child. Now the kids on the front porch have gotten restless and they are demanding entry into the big dining room. For the longest time you've been able to keep these pesky brats at bay. Every now and then one of them serves as some kind of an irritant -- Pat Buchanan being a notable example. You let him sit at the big table at the convention in Houston in 1992 and he used the wrong fork to say the least. It strikes me that a lot of these people will want to sit at the big table in Tampa. And like Pat Buchanan (he's still giving you guys fits) they are gonna have bad table manners. Rick Santorum will want to give a speech on the evils of contraception. Newt is going to talk about the Apocalypse. And how are you going to be able to shut up people like Trump, Bachmann, Perry and the rest of them? It's enough to make me feel sorry for you boys. In the end, you have to get this thing to work out. And Mitt is your only hope because Santorum is going to be part of a seven-state strategy. He can carry Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. That's about it. You know as well as I do that if Santorum is your nominee, you won't have two Senate candidates come to Tampa. You will have House candidates running away from the national ticket as fast as the devil runs from holy water. The whole thing will break down on you. In other words, you got a mell of a hess going on. And a well-mannered adult table conversation would never lead to making another guest uncomfortable. It seems that Jeb Bush couldn't help but chastise fellow adult Mitt for his stance on immigration. Y'all are really having some problems. You adults better watch Newt because he could bust in at any time and demand papers for the help. You're having what I refer to as a Ray Charles/Lester Maddox moment (by that I mean your problem is obvious.) Other than both being from Georgia, what could Lester Maddox and Ray Charles have in common? I'm sure that you recall they once asked the great Mr. Charles what was the worst thing about being blind, he instantly replied, ""well you can't see."" Lester Maddox once observed the problem with conditions in the Georgia prisons was the quality of the inmates. Obviously, the problem you adults are having is the quality of the Republicans voting in these primaries and caucuses. They are making y'all as batty as they are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville says the ""adults"" in GOP are unhappy with the four remaining candidates .
He says they fear that none of them are capable of defeating President Obama .

"Washington (CNN) -- Solicitor General Elena Kagan was easily confirmed Thursday as the next associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, completing the 50-year-old native New Yorker's climb to the peak of the American legal profession. The 63-37 vote was mostly along party lines. Five GOP senators backed Kagan, and only one Democrat -- Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska -- opposed her. Republican leaders offered spirited floor opposition to the nominee, but were unable to muster a prolonged delay or filibuster of the vote. Kagan is set to begin a lifetime position as the nation's 112th justice. She will be sworn into office Saturday afternoon, taking the traditional constitutional and judicial oaths. The newest justice will then be able to assume her court duties immediately. Her brisk confirmation was a political victory for President Barack Obama -- who placed Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the high court last year -- and for Senate Democrats. Obama after the vote predicted Kagan will be an ""outstanding Supreme Court justice,"" and thanked senators for giving his nominee a fair and timely hearing. ""They got a sense of her formidable intelligence, her rich understanding of our Constitution, her commitment to the rule of law, and her excellent and occasionally irreverent sense of humor,"" said the president. ""And they have come to understand why, throughout her career, she has earned the respect and admiration of folks from across the political spectrum, an achievement reflected in today's bipartisan vote."" Kagan was the administration's solicitor general when Obama nominated her on May 10 to replace retired Justice John Paul Stevens. She will become the current court's youngest member and third woman. White House and Justice Department sources said Kagan watched the confirmation vote on television at the Justice Department, with colleagues in the solicitor general's office. During the final day of floor debate, Republicans continued to raise deep concerns over what they contended was Kagan's lack of judicial experience, her views on gun rights, and her past work inside the Clinton White House. They said that she will become a judicial ""activist"" intent on twisting the law to fit her personal political agenda. ""Throughout Ms. Kagan's career she has put her politics above the law,"" said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee and leader of opposition to Kagan. ""The American people will not easily forgive this Senate if we confirm Ms. Kagan to the Supreme Court. They will not easily forgive the Senate if we further expose our Constitution to revision and rewrite by judicial fiat."" Among other things, Republicans have repeatedly slammed Kagan's handling of military recruiters seeking access to the Harvard Law School campus earlier this decade, when Kagan served as dean. Kagan has said she staunchly opposes the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military. One last-minute ""no"" vote came from Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, the chamber's newest Republican. ""I believe nominees to the Supreme Court should have previously served on the bench,"" said Brown, generally considered to be a key moderate. ""Lacking that, I look for many years of practical courtroom experience to compensate for the absence of prior judicial experience. In Elena Kagan's case, she is missing both. ""The best umpires,"" he said, referencing to a popular line from Chief Justice John Roberts' confirmation hearings, ""must not only call balls and strikes, but also have spent enough time on the playing field to know the strike zone."" Brown, who replaced the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy in February, had earlier effusively praised Kagan, and personally introduced her at the start of her confirmation hearings in June. Kagan lived in Massachusetts for several years before becoming solicitor general. Democrats argued that Kagan possesses the intelligence and professional background necessary to be a force on the high court. They said they hope she will help counter what many on the left contend are excessively conservative court rulings that defy the will of Congress while hurting individual workers and voters. When confirmed, ""average Americans will be a step closer to once again having their voices heard in the highest court in the land,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York. ""Elena Kagan is a role model for so many women entering the legal profession today,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. ""Her intellect, other broad range of legal experience, her sense of fairness (and) her profound respect for the law make her well-qualified to serve as an associate justice of the court."" Conservative opposition to Kagan failed to resonate this election year, a stark contrast to the heated Supreme Court confirmation battles of Roberts and Samuel Alito in 2005. Television and radio ads from advocacy groups were few, and serious grassroots outrage never materialized. Administration officials painted Kagan as a moderate liberal, and many legal analysts seemed to agree she was a politically safe pick for Obama. ""The president probably got exactly what he wanted, and that's not someone who makes either the far right or the far left terribly happy. She seems to be a centrist, pragmatic progressive -- someone who's on the left but not the extreme left,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a top Washington lawyer and founder of the Web site scotusblog.com. ""She's a nominee without much of a track record, and therefore not much to attack. And the air really went entirely out of the balloon when trying to draw attention to her, maybe paint her as a liberal, or create her as an issue for the upcoming elections in November."" Kagan was born in Manhattan in 1960, one of three children of a lawyer father and schoolteacher mother. She graduated from Harvard Law School and served in a prestigious Supreme Court clerkship with the late Justice Thurgood Marshall. While never a judge herself, Kagan's resume is diverse: work on Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign; a lawyer in private practice for two years; stints as a law professor and later, dean; four years as a legal and policy adviser in the Clinton White House; and most recently as solicitor general in the Obama Justice Department. She supervised every federal appeal presented to the high court during her tenure at the Justice Department, and personally argued six cases before the same justices she will now count as colleagues. Kagan will join a closely divided court that often splits in favor of a shaky 5-4 conservative majority. Despite no judicial record to draw clues on the kind of justice she would become, White House officials had quietly assured allies Kagan would be a ""reliable"" liberal vote similar to Stevens, the well-respected unofficial leader of the left-leaning bloc on the court. She is, therefore, not expected to tilt the current ideological balance on the high court. Among the cases she will confront in her first term beginning in October will be disputes over protests at military funerals, state bans on violent video games, and the death penalty. High-profile appeals that may reach the court in the next couple of years include Arizona's sweeping immigration reform law and California's ban on same-sex marriage.

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez may have been the villain of Liverpool's 2011-12 season, but the Uruguay striker is doing his best to make amends in another difficult start to this English Premier League campaign. The fallout from Suarez's eight-match suspension for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra ultimately led to Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish losing his job as manager in May. His successor Brendan Rogers is under increasing pressure after the club's worst start to a season in more than a century, but Suarez's inspirational performance in Sunday's 1-1 draw with 10-man Newcastle helped prevent a fourth defeat in 10 EPL games. His second-half equalizer -- a superb display of control for his 10th goal this season after chesting down a long pass and rounding the keeper -- lifted the 18-time English champions up to 12th in the table. The confrontational Suarez is never far from the headlines, having been accused by several opposition managers of diving and going to ground too easily. Such was his combative presence on Sunday that he lured visiting defender Fabricio Coloccini -- a fellow South American from neighboring Argentina -- into a rash challenge that earned a red card. While Liverpool couldn't capitalize on that advantage, Rodgers was grateful for another virtuoso show from Suarez -- who also scored in last weekend's Merseyside derby draw with Everton, when he had a late winner wrongly ruled out for offside. ""I thought he was unplayable. Coloccini getting sent off was frustration,"" said Rodgers, whose team trailed to Yohan Cabaye's strike just before halftime. ""I don't think he could get near him today, and he's a good defender, Coloccini. ""Suarez is so bright, so clever, he's a world-class striker. On that form today he really frustrates and provokes defenders. He has a hunger for the game, he has a hunger for goals."" It was, however, Liverpool's fifth draw this season and followed a humiliating 3-1 midweek League Cup defeat at home to Rodgers' former club Swansea -- when Suarez also scored. ""Once we can turn those draws into wins by converting the chances ... but that's about players, the type of players you need. If we can get that over the next couple of (transfer) windows it bodes really well for us,"" said Rodgers, who was criticized for his lack of top signings in August while allowing England striker Andy Carroll to leave for West Ham. The result left Newcastle in 10th place, and came at a cost of injuries to midfielder Cabaye, defender James Perch and top scorer Demba Ba. Meanwhile, Queens Park Rangers moved off the bottom after a 1-1 draw at home to Reading in Sunday's other EPL game. French striker Djibril Cisse scored a second-half equalizer that will lift some of the pressure on his manager Mark Hughes, though both teams remained in the bottom three. In Italy's Serie A, Napoli failed to capitalize on Juventus' first defeat in 50 matches, being held 1-1 at home by Torino on Sunday despite a sixth-minute goal from Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani. Substitute Gianluca Sansone leveled in time added on to leave Napoli -- beaten by Atalanta in midweek -- in third place, five points behind leaders Juve. Fiorentina moved up to fourth after a 4-1 win at home to Cagliari, while Lazio went in the other direction after a 4-0 defeat by seventh-placed Catania. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fourth place after beating Fortuna Dusseldorf 3-2 despite having midfielder Simon Rolfes sent off just over a minute after he came on. Leverkusen went 3-1 ahead straight after the substitute's 65th-minute dismissal and held on against a team that is battling to avoid an immediate return to the second division. Werder Bremen beat Mainz 2-1 in Sunday's other Bundesliga fixture, with two goals from Aaron Hunt lifting his team to seventh place and above the visitors on goal difference. In Spain's La Liga, Levante moved up to fifth after a 0-0 draw with seventh-placed Sevilla on Sunday. Real Betis can reclaim that position with a draw at Getafe on Monday. Valladolid claimed eighth spot with a 1-0 win at bottom club Osasuna while Espanyol won 1-0 in a clash with fellow strugglers Real Sociedad. Deportivo la Coruna joined Sociedad and Celta Vigo on 10 points from 10 games after beating Mallorca 1-0, while Athletic Bilbao moved above that group to 14th with a 2-1 win at Grenada thanks to two goals from Aritz Aduriz.","Luis Suarez's 10th goal this season earns Liverpool a 1-1 draw with Newcastle .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Saudi army lieutenant colonel died Tuesday during a training flight at a Spanish air base, the Spanish Defence Ministry said. The incident happened around 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) during a training flight aboard a Eurofighter Typhoon jet. A few minutes after takeoff, the plane hit the ground for unknown reasons, the Defense Ministry said. A Spanish pilot who was also on board ejected before the plane hit the ground, the ministry said. A special committee has been sent to the Moron Air Base in Seville to investigate, the Defense Ministry said. The Saudi pilot was at Moron to sign an agreement on Spanish-Saudi cooperation, which includes training for Saudi pilots on the Eurofighter, the ministry said. Saudi Arabia is one of the customers for the Eurofighter, which is manufactured by an international consortium of Britain's BAE Systems, the German and Spanish arms of EADS, and Italy's Alenia Aeronautica.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Attorneys supporting the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in California filed a notice of appeal in the case Thursday, one day after a federal judge ruled that the measure is unconstitutional. However, Chief U.S District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco granted a temporary stay along with his ruling Wednesday, which stops his decision from taking immediate effect. ""Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license. Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples,"" Walker, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his opinion. Supporters of Proposition 8 argued, prior to Walker's ruling, that same-sex marriages would be performed soon after his decision and could be complicated by rulings and appeals farther down the legal road. The judge's decision striking down the ban handed supporters of gay rights a major victory in a case that both sides say is sure to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case will be appealed to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor and criminal defense attorney, said he believes Walker's decision is likely to be upheld there, saying the appeals court ""is a very liberal court which is favorable on these issues."" Walker's 136-page decision does a good job in laying out a compelling case for the unconstitutionality of the proposition, Callan said. ""He's looking ... to the appellate process, which is going all the way to the Supreme Court."" But, he said, the nation's highest court typically handles big social questions like this one slowly, allowing state and lower federal courts to issue decisions. ""And they kind of let it percolate in the lower courts,"" Callan said. Opponents of same-sex marriage have said their best bet lies with higher courts. ""The court's disregard for the historical purposes of marriage would require California to embark on a novel experiment with the fundamental institution of marriage,"" said Charles Cooper, lead counsel for Proposition 8 supporters, in a statement. He said Walker's decision treats children as a ""mere afterthought when it comes to marriage ... And the court also found that there is no benefit whatsoever for a child to be raised by its own biological parents. ""Fortunately, the Constitution does not require the people to substitute the social science musings of gay rights activists for common sense,"" Cooper said. ""This decision will not stand."" Callan said he doesn't expect the Supreme Court to enter the fray immediately. ""I think it's probably going to be another couple of years. A lot of cases will be decided by the lower courts, and then they'll move in and make the big decision as to whether it's legal or not, gay marriage,"" he said. The proposition defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. At stake in the trial was whether the ban violates same-sex couples' rights to equal protection and due process, as protected by the U.S. Constitution. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five U.S. states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire -- and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey. Walker pointed out in his ruling, ""race restrictions on marital partners were once common in most states but are now seen as archaic, shameful or even bizarre. Gender no longer forms an essential part of marriage; marriage under law is a union of equals."" Elated supporters of same-sex marriage gathered to celebrate the judge's opinion in the Castro district of San Francisco. After speeches and songs, they began a march to City Hall. People waved rainbow flags and U.S. flags, and carried signs that read, ""We all deserve the freedom to marry,"" and ""Separate is Unequal."" Similar rallies unfolded in cities across California -- including Los Angeles and San Diego. ""For our entire lives, our government and the law have treated us as unequal. This decision to ensure that our constitutional rights are as protected as everyone else's makes us incredibly proud of our country,"" said Kristin Perry, a plaintiff in the case along with Sandy Stier. Jeffrey Zarrillo and Paul Katami are the other couple at the heart of the case. Many Americans, however, still oppose same-sex marriage. In a national survey, conducted by Gallup in May, 53 percent of respondents said such marriages should not be recognized by law, while 44 percent said they should. Proposition 8 is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests over the controversial issue. It passed in California with some 52 percent of the vote in November 2008. ""Big surprise! We expected nothing different from Judge Vaughn Walker, after the biased way he conducted this trial,"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage. ""With a stroke of his pen, Judge Walker has overruled the votes and values of 7 million Californians who voted for marriage as one man and one woman.""","NEW: A notice of appeal has been filed in the case .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The so-called ""barefoot bandit"" suspect will be sent to Washington state to face charges there, a federal judge in Miami, Florida, ruled Friday after Colton Harris-Moore waived his right to an extradition hearing. He will be transferred in the next two weeks aboard a secure federal transportation service called ""con air,"" said Barry Golden of the U.S. Marshals Service. Harris-Moore, 19, is believed to be the person who earned the ""barefoot bandit"" nickname because he was unshod when he broke into houses in Washington. He was captured in the Bahamas after he apparently flew a stolen private plane there. He appeared in Miami Federal Court Friday morning dressed in government-issued socks, sandals and shackles.  Before the hearing, the young defendant appeared relaxed and even shared a few laughs with another detainee. Harris-Moore did not speak during the session, which was a continuation of his first appearance earlier this week. A public defender represented Harris in lieu of his attorney in the state of Washington, who will be present when a court there reads the charges against Harris and then conducts a detention hearing. The Washington attorney, John Henry Browne, on Friday filed the request to waive the extradition hearing so his client could be immediately transferred to Washington.  Magistrate Judge Robert L. Dube granted the request once he confirmed through the public defender that Harris-Moore has legal representation. U.S. Marshal Albert Diego said the defendant will continue to be held at the Federal Correctional Center in downtown Miami until a secure flight to Seattle, Washington, is available for him. Harris-Moore was taken into custody on Harbour Island in the Bahamas early Sunday. He was sought in a string of home and airport break-ins in various U.S. locations, along with thefts of vehicles. In the Bahamas, Harris-Moore pleaded guilty to a charge of illegally landing a plane, paid a $300 fine and was ordered deported, his lawyer said. Police said the plane was a Cessna that was stolen in Indiana and flown to the Bahamas, where it was found in the shallows off Abaco Island. Harris-Moore was flown to Miami on Tuesday, the FBI said. Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington. The Southern District of Florida, in Miami, is the closest jurisdiction to the Bahamas, she said. He is named in a federal complaint that was sealed until last week after being filed last December. The charge in the complaint -- interstate transportation of stolen goods -- stems from the theft of a plane in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, that crashed outside Granite Falls, Washington, Langlie said. A conviction on the charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Under the federal system, the case will go to a grand jury. If an indictment is returned, more charges could be filed. Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case, but the courts Washington will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant, Langlie said. ""He seems to be very remorseful,"" Monique Gomez, a Bahamian lawyer who represented Harris-Moore in Nassau,  told CNN in a telephone interview. Asked whether he acknowledged guilt in the other cases, Gomez said, ""Let me put it this way -- he wishes he had done things a little differently in his life."" Still, she added, he appeared ""in good spirits."" Authorities in Madison County, Nebraska, issued an arrest warrant for Harris-Moore last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception. The affidavit supporting the warrant alleges the youth waged a crime rampage. The teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Harris-Moore has amassed more than 80,000 Facebook fans. In December, Time magazine dubbed him ""America's most wanted teenage bandit."" And 20th Century Fox has purchased the rights for a film based on his exploits. CNN's Ashley Hayes, John Couwels, Patrick Oppmann, Susan Candiotti and Tom Watkins, and InSession Correspondent Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Barefoot bandit"" likely to be transferred to Washington state within 2 weeks .

"New York (CNN) -- With chants and banners, opponents of the planned construction of an Islamic community center and mosque near ground zero faced off Sunday with demonstrators in favor of the facility. Hundreds of critics and supporters of the proposed center in New York showed up despite an overcast and drizzly sky to express their views amid the national debate over the facility. Police estimated that supporters of the center numbered up to 250, and critics numbered about 450 during the demonstration. iReport: See, share your images and opinions with CNN . A banner on the anti-center side said, ""Land of the free. Stop sharia before it stops you,"" referring to Islamic law. Another sign read, ""No mosque here. Preserve the dignity of our loved ones killed on 9/11."" Opponent Mike Meehan said he would not be opposed to the center if it were built elsewhere in the city, ""just not down here, please. ... It's just too close to ground zero."" Another critic, Shawn Gilfeather, called it ""a breeding ground for terrorists."" ""I think the people that are backing, the people that are funding it, are actually in cahoots with them ... the terrorists,"" Gilfeather added. ""I don't think they're just people practicing religion. I think there's something more."" Those in favor of the construction said freedom of religion was the main issue in the debate. ""There are many Muslims who lost Muslim family members at ground zero, so when they come to visit ground zero as a memorial, they should be able to walk two blocks down and pray for their loved ones,"" supporter Ali Akram said. Others said Americans need to set an example of tolerance to the rest of the world. ""It would be giving in to bigotry and intolerance to demand that it be moved and I think in the end, it makes us less safe because we need to show the world that we are a tolerant, open society,"" supporter Ruth Massie said. Lt. Col. Chris Dzubek, an Army reservist preparing to head to Iraq, agreed, saying developers have ""the right and the ability to do it wherever they would like."" ""That's what I like about the country is the ability for people who disagree with one another to hash it out without guns,"" Dzubek said. At the conclusion of the protest, those opposed to the construction marched by ground zero. The Islamic center's leaders say the $100 million facility calls for a community center including a mosque, performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. It will be built near where the World Trade Center was destroyed by Islamic extremists on September 11, 2001. The attacks killed more than 2,700 people. Some New Yorkers say an Islamic center near the site is a painful affront. The Coalition to Honor Ground Zero organized the rally against the construction of the center. The NYC Coalition to Stop Islamophobia staged the counter-protest. Plans to build the center near the site have stirred emotions nationwide. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released earlier this month marked nationwide opposition to the proposed facility at 68 percent. ""What that tells me is the wounds of 9/11 haven't healed, and I think if they haven't, perhaps we can find ways to bring about that healing by perhaps creating a situation where people will feel more comfortable,"" New York Gov. David Paterson said last week. Paterson said there is no local, state or federal statute that prevents the construction of the facility. On Sunday, Daisy Khan, who is heading the development of the project with her husband, said moving the project to another site is not under consideration for now. She added that a move could be considered after consultations with ""all major stakeholders."" ""We have to be very careful and deliberate in making any move,"" Khan said. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Protesters march by ground zero .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian billionaire businessman and outspoken Kremlin critic Alexander Lebedev has dismissed a charge of hooliganism and assault filed against him after he punched a fellow guest on a television show last year as unsubstantiated and ""clearly a political act."" The part-owner of Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose son Evgeny owns Britain's Independent and Evening Standard, faces five years in prison for attacking businessman Sergey Polonsky on the ""NTVshniki"" show, which aired on September 16, 2011. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Lebedev conceded he may have gone too far but insisted he was acting in self-defense when he launched his extraordinary assault on Polonsky. ""I felt threatened,"" he said. ""My point was I need to stop it otherwise it's going to go into not only an insult and intimidation but a hit in the face. ""I might have over-reacted: normally I'm a very quiet person ... I was not looking for any violation of public order."" Lebedev, who was described by the Investigative Committee as a lawmaker in the Kirov region, has been charged with hooliganism and assault motivated by political hatred, the same offense for which members of punk band Pussy Riot were jailed this year. On Monday the band members launched an appeal against their sentence, which followed their performance of a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of Moscow's grandest cathedrals. The Pussy Riot charges sparked international concern about freedom of speech in Russia, and Lebedev said his case is similar. ""How could political hatred emerge from a completely cut-out and edited discussion about some murky subject of the world economic crisis? Why should it be considered hooliganism? It's the same as the Pussy Riot case. It's clearly a political case. All motivation is political; everything else is fabrication."" He said the charge against him is ""completely unsubstantiated but carrying a heavy sentence and prison."" He said he could have left the country but wanted to stay in Russia to fight the charges and air his concerns about the political direction of his country. Questioned if it is true that wealthy Russian businessmen should not get involved in politics if they want to stay on the right side of the Kremlin, Lebedev agreed. ""It's a rule. It clearly exists,"" he said. ""I thought I'm not a politician, just a publisher of a paper and I'm also a citizen who might, from time to time, voice concerns about things. ""I'm still defending the position that it would be much wiser for Putin to install real European quality, adapted to Russian realities and institutions with competition between political forces."" He said he is prepared to pay a heavy price for his principles, but hopes he won't go to prison. In the meantime, ""I'll stay and face the charges and go for a trial.""","Alexander Lebedev charged with hooliganism after punching guest on TV show .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's prime minister vowed to wind down the month-long crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant ""at all costs"" Tuesday after his government officially designated the situation there a Chernobyl-level nuclear accident. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he wants the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, to produce a timetable for bringing the disaster to an end, ""and they will be doing that soon."" And a day after his government warned that thousands more people would need to be evacuated from the surrounding region, he pledged to provide jobs, housing and education for those uprooted by the accident. Japanese leader invokes WWII to urge quake recovery . ""The government will not forsake the people who are suffering because of the nuclear accident,"" Kan told reporters in a Tuesday evening news conference. Japan declared the Fukushima Daiichi crisis a Level 7 event on the international system for rating nuclear accidents Tuesday, putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The top-scale designation was based on the massive release of radioactivity since the accident began, particularly in its early days, and classifies Fukushima Daiichi a ""major accident"" requiring long-term countermeasures. ""At all costs, all the reactors and the spent nuclear fuel pools must be brought under control so that we can prevent a further expansion of the damage,"" Kan said. Tetsunari Iida, a former nuclear engineer-turned-industry critic, told CNN the declaration has no immediate practical impact on the crisis. But it's a sign that Japanese regulators have rethought their earlier assessments of the disaster, said Iida, who now runs an alternative energy think-tank in Tokyo. Analysis: Fukushima and the 'nuclear renaissance' that wasn't . Tokyo Electric's president, Masataka Shimizu, issued a new apology for the disaster and the ""enormous anxiety"" it has caused after the Level 7 designation Tuesday. ""We would like to stabilize the situation as soon as possible, and we are working on the measures and steps to cool the reactors and prevent the spread of nuclear substances,"" he said. ""While continuing to ask for the support and cooperation of the government, the ministries, and the municipalities, we would like to maintain close communication with them, and we will make the utmost effort to bring the situation to an end."" Scientists believe the amount of radiation released is only a tenth of what was released at Chernobyl, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the chief spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. But the levels for radioactive iodine and cesium that have been spewed into the air, water and soil around the plant are in the thousands of trillions of bequerels -- 15 times higher than the threshold for a top-scale event, according to figures released by the safety agency Tuesday morning. The crisis began with the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Japan. The tsunami knocked out the plant's cooling systems, leaving operators with no way to keep the three operational reactors from overheating after they shut down. Interactive explainer: Japan's nuclear concerns . Engineers are now pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the damaged reactors to keep them cool, but Tokyo Electric said long-term solutions must wait until it can get the highly contaminated water out of the basements of the units' turbine plants. In addition, more water is being poured into pools housing spent but still-potent fuel rods in units 1-3 as well as unit 4, which had no fuel in the reactor at the time of the quake. The work has been complicated over the past five days by a series of powerful aftershocks that have forced workers to clear out of the units and seek shelter. Monday, Japan ordered new evacuations for towns around the plant, including some outside the 20- and 30-km danger zones drawn in the early days of the accident, and warned others to stand by. But after Tuesday's declaration, both Nishiyama and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano tried to draw distinctions between their crisis and Chernobyl. ""What's different here from the Chernobyl accident is that we have not yet seen a direct impact on the health of the people as a result of the nuclear accident,"" said Edano, the Japanese government's leading spokesman on the crisis. ""The accident itself is big, but we will make, as our first priority, our utmost effort to avoid any health impact on the people."" And Nishiyama said that unlike the Chernobyl disaster, the reactors inside the badly damaged buildings at Fukushima Daiichi remain largely intact, ""although there are some leaks being seen."" ""In the case of Chernobyl, the radioactive material release made it very difficult to enter the facility itself,"" he said. ""It had to be left alone for a very long time by itself. But it in the Fukushima Daiichi case, day and night, workers are there trying to salvage the situation."" Thomas Breuer, a researcher for the anti-nuclear group Greenpeace, told CNN that Japanese authorities were ""too slow"" to respond to the crisis at first -- but they have stepped up their efforts in recent days due to pressure from local officials, outside critics and their own people. Now, he said, they have to step up their plans to evacuate towns that have been dusted with large quantities of longer-lived radioactive particles. Japan marks 1 month since deadly quake, tsunami . ""There are still a lot of measures to be done, but they have to do it now,"" said Breuer, who has studied the aftereffects of Chernobyl. Breuer said Greenpeace, which called for evacuations in towns outside the 30-km radius in late March, believes the accident will end up being ""worse than Chernobyl"" because it has occurred in a more densely populated area. Evacuation orders have so far covered about 85,000 people inside the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) zone, while another 62,000 within 30 kilometers have been told to stay inside, Fukushima prefecture officials told CNN. Japan's government said it had no estimate of the number of people who would be covered by the new directives. Nishiyama said Tuesday's designation was made ""provisionally,"" and that a final level won't be set until the disaster is over and a more detailed investigation has been conducted. The previous event level of 5, equal to the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, was also a provisional designation. Three Mile Island involved a partial meltdown of the radioactive core of one reactor, with only a limited release of radioactivity, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At Chernobyl, an explosion and fire at a nuclear power plant resulted in the permanent evacuation of a 30-km radius around the plant. There were 32 deaths among plant workers and firefighters, mostly due to radiation exposure, and the International Atomic Energy Agency estimates another 4,000 will or have died of related cancers.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will award the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for bravery, to Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Richard Etchberger for his valor in saving the lives of three wounded comrades at a then-secret base in Laos in 1968, the White House announced Friday. After Etchberger saved his fellow airmen, he was shot and killed by enemy fighters. His heroics were kept a secret for years because the United States wasn't supposed to have troops in Laos during the Vietnam War. President Lyndon Johnson rejected a nomination for Etchberger to receive the Medal of Honor at the time because of the political trouble it could have stirred up. Etchberger was part of a secret U.S. Air Force radar base in northern Laos, just 120 miles from Hanoi in North Vietnam. The base's purpose was to guide U.S. bomber crews on their missions over North Vietnam and parts of Laos that were under communist control. Laos was officially neutral during the war, but its leaders were upset that North Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong guerrillas were moving through Laos to attack U.S. troops in South Vietnam. So the Lao government allowed construction of the U.S. radar site provided it was kept secret, according to Tom Keany, an Air Force B-52 squadron commander during the Vietnam War and currently a military historian with the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. In March of 1968 North Vietnamese troops attacked the site, called Lima Site 85, with a force of 3,000 soldiers against fewer than a couple dozen U.S. airmen and about a thousand Laotian soldiers. Eventually, American helicopters were sent in to evacuate the Air Force personnel, but by then eight Americans had been killed and several more wounded. It is considered by some the deadliest ground attack against Air Force troops in the entire Vietnam era. According the White House, Etchberger deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire ""in order to place his three surviving wounded comrades in the rescue slings permitting them to be airlifted to safety."" It took an act of Congress in 2008 for Etchberger to be reconsidered for a Medal of Honor so long after the war had ended. In most cases, the medal recommendation must be made within two years of the act of heroism for which it is to be awarded. Rep. Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota helped push for the reconsideration. Etchberger was a native of Bismarck, North Dakota. ""Chief Etchberger was denied the Medal of Honor because he was serving his country on the wrong side of a geographic barrier,"" Pomeroy said in written statement. ""Heroism knows no boundary. While it's regrettable that this medal is coming forty years after Mr. Etchberger's death, I am honored to be part of the effort that recognized this true hero."" The ceremony for Etchberger, which will include his three sons, is scheduled for September 21 at the White House.","NEW: The United States did not want to admit it had troops in nominally neutral Laos .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two Pakistani girls who were injured in an attack that nearly took the life of their classmate, schoolgirl activist Malala Yousufzai, are to be honored with a medal of courage, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Saturday. Kainat Riaz Ahmed and Shazia Ramzan were both hurt in the ambush on October 9, when armed thugs stopped their school van in the Taliban-held Swat Valley. The medal, known as Sitara-e- jurrat, or star of courage, is the third highest military award in Pakistan and is not normally given to civilians. The militants' target, Malala, was well-known for her efforts to encourage her fellow Pakistanis to stand up to the Taliban, who have been trying to push girls from classrooms. The attack prompted anger against the Taliban and an outpouring of support for Malala, both in Pakistan, where thousands rallied in her name, and internationally. Speaking to CNN from her hospital bed a week after the attack, Kainat, who was shot in the upper right arm, echoed Malala's message. Malala is face of global attacks on schools . ""I want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education,"" Kainat told CNN. ""Girls' education here is more important than boys' because boys can do any sort of work. However, girls can't just do any sort of job. Girls must have respectful jobs so that they can feel secure."" And the 16-year-old said she had no regrets about defying a group that wants to stop girls from learning. ""God willing, I will continue my education,"" she said. On Monday, Malik visited the British hospital where Malala was flown for treatment days after she was shot in the head. She has made good progress since her transfer, but medical staff have said she has a long road ahead to a full recovery. She is expected to undergo reconstructive surgery to her skull once she is strong enough. Malik said he hoped Malala would recover soon and that her family would support her in this difficult time. The family is not settling in the United Kingdom but remains there while Malala is recovering, he added. Malik said Saturday that the government was very close to catching Ihsanullah Ihsan, the spokesman for the Pakistan Taliban. The Taliban, who claimed responsibility for the attack, issued a statement online saying that if Malala lived, they would come after her again. Police said this week they suspect two boys of being behind the attack but did not name them. They are also seeking a man they say drove the youths to the van. Malik identified the adult suspect as Attah Ullah Khan, 23, but he did not name the boys. Khan is a masters' chemistry student, police said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former Los Alamos National Laboratory nuclear scientist and his wife were indicted on charges of trying to provide nuclear secrets to Venezuela, but U.S. officials stressed the Venezuelan government knew nothing about the plans. The officials said they have no information from the undercover operation that Hugo Chavez's government has any plans to try to build a nuclear weapon. Pedro Mascheroni, 75, and Roxby Mascheroni, 67, are U.S. citizens who worked as contractors at Los Alamos in New Mexico, officials said Friday. In 2008, Mascheroni, who had left the laboratory years earlier, had a series of conversations with an undercover FBI agent posing as an official of the Caracas government, according to the indictment. ""Mascheroni allegedly said he could help Venezuela develop a nuclear bomb within 10 years and that under his program Venezuela would use a secret underground nuclear reactor to produce and enrich plutonium and an open, above-ground reactor to produce nuclear energy,"" the Justice Department said. According, to a U.S. Justice Department statement, Mascheroni allegedly asked about obtaining Venezuelan citizenship and described how he expected to be paid for his classified nuclear work for Venezuela. Mascheroni said his fee for producing certain information was $793,000, the indictment alleges. U.S. Attorney Kenneth Gonzalez said the charges against the couple ""are very serious."" He said laws were designed to keep ""restricted data"" from getting to the wrong people.","NEW: Indictment alleges physicist wanted $793,000 for services .

"New York (CNN) -- Four people were killed early Saturday when a double-decker Megabus slammed into a railroad overpass and turned on its side in Salina, New York. Authorities said 25 passengers were transported to the hospital. By Saturday evening, five were still in the hospital, while one person was injured critically, said Onondaga County Sheriff Kevin Walsh. The owner of the bus said it was off its designated route, but did not explain why. ""Obviously the driver didn't see the signs or didn't realize the height of his bus, that the double-decker bus wouldn't fit under that bridge,"" Walsh told CNN affiliate YNN. Walsh said authorities suspect the driver missed a turn when a road split. A flashing yellow light alerts drivers of a low bridge, he added. The bus, part of a fleet of low-cost express buses, was on its way to Toronto, Canada, from Pennsylvania. The accident occurred around 2:30 a.m.on the Onondaga Lake Parkway in Salina, a Syracuse suburb. ""Our immediate thoughts and concern are with those who have lost their lives or been injured, as well as their families and loved ones,"" a Megabus spokesman said. ""Safety is our absolute priority and we will be carrying out a full investigation into the accident as well as assisting the police and other authorities in any way that we can."" The dead were people from India, Malaysia, New York and a Midwestern state, Walsh said. Don Carmichael, senior vice president of Coach USA, which operates Megabus, said the company was tending to the needs of those on the bus. ""The key thing is to ensure that our customers and passengers are looked after,"" he told reporters.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Filmmaker Roman Polanski, arrested in Switzerland over the weekend, will fight extradition to the United States where he faces sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl, his California lawyers said Monday. Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris, France, in June 2009. ""An issue related to the Swiss extradition matter is presently being litigated before the California Court of Appeal,"" attorneys Douglas Dalton and Chad Hummel said in a prepared statement. Separate legal counsel will represent Polanksi in any legal proceedings in Switzerland, they added. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Los Angeles, California, released a detailed timeline of the Polanski case, which dates to 1977. It indicated that prosecutors had tried to have Polanski arrested and extradited from Israel in 2007. It also shows that prosecutors obtained a ""provisional arrest warrant"" upon learning on September 22 that Polanski planned to travel to Switzerland to participate in a film festival. The warrant was obtained through the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, and Swiss authorities executed it on Saturday.  Watch Polanski's victim speak out » . The DA's timeline revealed that multiple attempts have been made over the years to take Polanski into custody for extradition. Those attempts involved Polanski's planned travels to England, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Brazil and Israel. Earlier on Monday, French authorities expressed solidarity with Roman Polanski's family and outrage over the arrest. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he hoped authorities would respect Polanski's rights ""and that the affair (will) come to a favorable resolution,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The French culture and communications minister, Frederic Mitterrand, said he ""learned with astonishment"" of Polanski's arrest. He expressed solidarity with Polanski's family and said ""he wants to remind everyone that Roman Polanski benefits from great general esteem"" and has ""exceptional artistic creation and human qualities."" Investigators in the United States say Polanski drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl in the 1970s. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, but he fled the United States before he could be sentenced. He settled in France. U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978. Police in Switzerland arrested Polanski on that warrant Saturday after the 76-year-old tried to enter Switzerland to attend the Zurich Film Festival, which is holding a tribute to Polanski this year. Filmmakers have reacted with outrage at the arrest. ""As a Swiss filmmaker, I feel deeply ashamed,"" Christian Frei said. ""He's a brilliant guy, and he made a little mistake 32 years ago. What a shame for Switzerland,"" said photographer Otto Weisser, a friend of Polanski. The Polish Filmmakers Association posted a letter on its Web site Monday from the European Film Academy secretariat that protested ""the arbitrary treatment of one of the world's most outstanding film directors."" The letter, which was read aloud at the festival, was signed by directors Wim Wenders, Volker Schloendorff and Bertrand Tavernier; actress Victoria Abril; cinematographer Peter Suschitzky; and screenwriter and actor Jean-Claude Carriere. Mitterrand said he has spoken with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and that Sarkozy ""shares his hope for a rapid resolution to the situation which would allow Roman Polanski to rejoin his family as quickly as possible."" Mitterrand said he ""greatly regrets that Mr. Polanski has had yet another difficulty added to an already turbulent existence."" Polanski won an Academy Award for best director in 2003 for ""The Pianist."" He was nominated for best director Oscars for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown"" and for best writing for ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which he also directed. A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport. A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles, California, after authorities learned he was going to be in Switzerland, Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, told CNN on Sunday. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child."" The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put ""in provisional detention."" But whether he can be extradited to the United States ""can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalized,"" ministry spokesman Guido Balmer said in an e-mail.  Watch what happens now for Polanski » . Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland, but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski's sentencing process, depending on what happens in Zurich. Polanski was accused of plying the then-teenage girl, Samantha Geimer, with champagne and a sliver of a Quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. He was 43 at the time. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was there. She said Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. ""I don't think he's a bad man,"" she said in a probation report. ""I think he's an unhappy man."" Polanski's lawyers tried this year to have the charges thrown out, but a judge in Los Angeles rejected the request. However, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. According to court documents, Polanski, his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the teen avoid a public trial. But the original judge in the case, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanski fled the United States for France, where he was born. In the February 2009 hearing, Espinoza mentioned a documentary film, ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,"" that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" Espinoza said. But he declined to dismiss the case entirely. Geimer is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. She filed court papers in January saying, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim."" Geimer, now 45, married and a mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. CNN's Morgan Neill, Frederik Pleitgen, Brooke Bowman, Karan Olson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Polanski was arrested en route to Zurich Film Festival, which was honoring him .

"(CNN) -- In a jailhouse interview with a Dutch television station, Joran van der Sloot said he is remorseful for telling so many stories regarding the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, but once again denied culpability in the case. ""For everything that's happened since 2005, all the things said in the media and everything, I feel guilty for, yeah,"" van der Sloot, 22, said in the interview, portions of which were aired on NBC's ""Today"" on Tuesday. The Dutch citizen is jailed in Lima, Peru, where he is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores. Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot, which the two were seen entering on surveillance camera video. He also is charged with a count of wire fraud and a count of extortion in Alabama for allegedly trying to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In the interview, van der Sloot said he feels guilty about his father's fatal heart attack, for not listening to his mother and for telling lies, as well as his past behavior. ""I was doing a lot of things that I shouldn't have been doing, and mostly only going out all the night and sleeping all the day,"" he said, describing himself as ""impulsive."" Asked why he's told so many different stories about the Holloway case, he said, ""There were people who were paying me to make up stories, and I was really good at making up stories. Everybody keeps coming at you asking questions ... if you want something, I'll tell you whatever you want to hear, sure."" Still, he said, he has ""misused the situation for my own advantage."" He said he feels bad about that and would take it back if he had the opportunity. It's a familiar refrain, said John Q. Kelly, an attorney for Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty. ""He's always a victim. He's always seeking attention. He's always misunderstood and someday he's absolutely going to tell the truth,"" Kelly said on NBC. ""... He's a pathological liar."" He said it was van der Sloot who contacted him about revealing the location of Holloway's body in exchange for payment. ""We knew he was going to lie, and was going to make up the basis for wire fraud,"" Kelly said. ""It's attention-seeking behavior, as simple as that,"" he said. ""He wants to be in the spotlight ... he just can't help himself."" Van der Sloot would not answer questions about the Flores case, saying it is ""not in my best interest to talk about it at all."" But he maintains police tricked him into making a confession, saying they would not let him call his mother, talk to anyone or arrange for an attorney. Police said van der Sloot admitted that he attacked Flores, 21, on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. Asked about the extortion case, van der Sloot said, ""I have had five years long that people have just been blaming me for something, and yeah, I have a lot of anger built up because of that."" He said the Holloway family kept insisting he had information, and wanted to give him the money, so he thought, ""I've already told a lot of different stories. I'll do it again."" He added, ""I know it's very wrong."" On Twitty's reaction to that statement, Kelly said, ""I think in deference to Beth, I won't repeat what she said about what he had to say."" He said he isn't surprised that van der Sloot admitted the extortion, saying he has more than three weeks of e-mails between himself and van der Sloot, as well as audio and videotapes. Van der Sloot said in the interview he wished he'd gone along with his mother's plan and sought psychiatric treatment, but instead he took the money and went to Peru to gamble, according to NBC. Van der Sloot also spoke about Flores' family, saying, ""I feel really bad that her family had to lose a daughter. It really does hurt me. I think about it all the time."" Asked if he will ever disclose what happened, he said, ""When I speak to the judge, and the time is right, I'm going to tell the whole truth, absolutely."" ""I've got 20 e-mails where he says he's very sorry for what happened, he's going to tell the truth, absolutely,"" Kelly said. ""... He's just incapable of it."" He said if van der Sloot ever does tell the truth, he believes it will be out of a sense of self-preservation and fear -- not his conscience or respect for either Holloway's or his own family. In the interview, van der Sloot acknowledged he has a ""web of problems. But I created all of them myself, so yeah, I have to deal with it now, deal with the consequences."" Van der Sloot also admitted he extorted money from Holloway's family in an interview with a Dutch newspaper. His attorney in the Flores case suggested Monday that his comments may have been mis-translated. In that interview, van der Sloot told the Telegraph he wanted to ""get back at Natalee's family. Her parents have been making my life tough for years."" ""When they offered to pay for the girl's location, I thought: 'Why not?'"" he said. ""Maybe there were some mistakes in the translation,"" said attorney Maximo Alteza, who said he is not involved in the Holloway case. Also Monday, a Peruvian court voted 2-1 to reject van der Sloot's contention that he is being held unlawfully, but the court requires three votes to secure a decision. Alteza said that a fourth jurist will hear the case and cast a vote at a public hearing next week. If that judge votes in favor of van der Sloot, a fifth judge will hear the case to break the tie. Alteza said that van der Sloot's constitutional rights have been violated and he ""could be released because of the mistakes made by the police during the investigation."" But Kelly pointed out Tuesday that if he is released, van der Sloot will be held in Alabama on the charges related to extortion.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier who blew the whistle on his fellow soldiers' links to the killing of civilians in Afghanistan -- and who himself is accused of one slaying --has been moved to solitary confinement for his safety, a source said. Spc. Adam Winfield, 21, told Army investigators that he alerted his father to the civilian killings early this year and told him that he feared for his own life, according to an interrogation tape obtained by CNN. His father tried and failed to get the military to intervene, Winfield's attorney, Eric Montalvo, said. Winfield now is held in a military facility at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington along with other soldiers he said instigated the killings. Some of those soldiers are facing charges in connection with three slayings of civilians, and Winfield would be a key part of any case against them. Winfield contacted his father about the serial killing ring inside his Stryker Brigade squad, and his father, Christopher Winfield, telephoned the Army but with little result, Montalvo said. The father's phone calls, from the family's home in Cape Coral, Florida, and the failure of the Army to take swift action to intervene are the focus of a separate military investigation, an Army spokesman said. A person familiar with the case against Winfield and the other soldiers said Sunday that Winfield had been moved to solitary confinement amidst concerns about his safety. But that person insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Authorities at Lewis-McChord, Winfield's home base, would not comment on any questions about Winfield. But a spokeswoman said that an investigation is underway, although she would not identify who was involved. ""We will not comment on measures taken to ensure this individual's safety,"" Maj. Kathleen Turner, a public affairs officer for Lewis-McChord, said. ""The U.S. Army CID is investigating allegations that a threat was made to one of the defendants; however, we are not releasing any further information associated with these allegations."" The Army would provide no details of how Winfield and the other defendants are being housed or whether they have been allowed to communicate amongst themselves. Winfield, Cpl. Jeremy Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska; Pfc. Andrew Holmes of Boise, Idaho; Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, Nevada; and platoon leader Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs of Billings, Montana, are charged with premeditated murder charges in the killings of three Afghan civilians between January and May of this year. Seven other soldiers face charges ranging from conspiracy and interfering in a military investigation to drug use, specifically smoking hashish, while in Afghanistan. Military reports say that Gibbs kept track of the killed with skull tattoos and collected body parts as souvenirs.","Safety concerns prompt Winfield's move, source says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal authorities arrested more than 50 suspects Wednesday and smashed what they describe as an Armenian-American organized crime enterprise engaged in a nationwide scheme to defraud the Medicare program. The Justice Department indicted 73 individuals in New York and four other states for allegedly defrauding Medicare and other health care programs of an estimated $163 million. The government said 44 defendants were indicted in New York, along with 10 in California, seven in New Mexico, six in Ohio and six in Georgia. Indictments said the schemes included billing Medicare from phantom clinics for unnecessary medical services, or services never performed. ""The emergence of international organized crime in domestic health care fraud schemes signals a dangerous expansion that poses a serious threat to consumers as these syndicates are willing to exploit almost any program, business, or individual to earn an illegal profit,"" said Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler. By midday Wednesday, federal agents had taken at least 52 of the suspects into custody. According to a multiple-agency announcement, the charges ranged from fraud and conspiracy to money laundering, identity theft and immigration fraud. Maximum penalties upon conviction range from 10 years to life in prison. Justice prosecutors said the defendants would be tried in the five states where they were indicted.","Group is described as an Armenian-American crime enterprise .

"(CNN) -- In an otherworldly landscape, with controllers in hand, players must conquer the Beast in order to release a powerful demigod. No, this isn't ""World of Warcraft."" It's ""Guitar Hero."" And with a playlist steeped in monster riffs and a quest mode that winds through scenes populated with the dungeons and dragons of fantasy lore, it might just expose heavy metal's darkest secret. ""The ultimate trick that musicians played on the world is that they were cool,"" said Brendon Small, whose band Dethklok (from his Adult Swim cartoon ""Metalocalypse"") lent the song ""Bloodlines"" to ""Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock."" ""They're not cool. They're all nerds. They all love Monty Python, 'Star Wars' and Rush. Everybody from Cannibal Corpse to Metallica, they are all nerds. We are all nerds."" The game, released September 28 and available on PS3, Wii and XBox360,  likes Rush, too. It includes all seven parts of the Canadian progressive rock band's ""2112"" suite and even weaves the legendary rockers into the fabric of the game. The members of Rush worked on the ""2112"" game sequence, helping create in-game venues based on scenes from the liner notes of their original album. The band gave suggestions for imagery and recorded voice-overs for the scenes, said Brian Bright, ""Warriors of Rock"" project leader for game creator Neversoft. He said the story of ""2112"" parallels the story in the game. ""The songs tell the story of a man who discovers a guitar, something he has never been exposed to, as the world he lives in is very Orwellian and controlling,"" Bright said. ""In the game, the player is in search of the Demi-God's legendary guitar as it is the source of his power."" Small acknowledges that including 21 minutes worth of Rush on a game known for mainstream appeal is a nod toward rock's inner nerd. ""Absolutely!"" he said. ""Without a doubt, yeah! Oh man, but they picked the right Rush. That's certainly my favorite, and it's got amazing guitar moments, too."" It also has what Small calls the nerdiest thing of all in music: odd time signatures, which could mean difficult play in Warriors of Rock. ""When people start counting odd times like 7/4 instead of 4/4, [they're trying to] be different and make a new groove, and that is a nerdy, nerdy thing. But Rush gets away with it because they're good,"" said Small. Neversoft worked closely with other artists to create the ultimate metal quest mode. Megadeth's Dave Mustaine -- whom Small considers one of the world's best rhythm guitarists -- wrote and recorded ""Sudden Death"" for the finale of the game. ""The game ends with an epic battle between the Demi-God of Rock and the Beast raging on an apocalyptic landscape, so we wanted a track that would completely shred,"" Bright said. Additionally, Gene Simmons, the ""demon"" bassist of iconic rock band KISS, is the narrator of the game's quest mode and makes a cameo as the Demi-God of Rock. Other musicians who metalheads and rock guitar enthusiasts are sure to geek out to include Steve Vai, Slayer, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne and Anthrax. Bright said ""Warriors of Rock"" songs were selected chiefly on their playability. ""A good song for 'Guitar Hero' would have a memorable riff but not feel repetitive. There would be a good amount of chord changes and, ideally, a fun guitar solo to add to the challenge,"" he said. But being a good guitar player doesn't necessarily make you a good ""Guitar Hero"" player. Mike Keneally, Small's bandmate in the live, touring version of Dethklok, said he thought Dethklok songs were easier to play on an actual guitar. ""Bloodlines"" is Dethklok's third song on a ""Guitar Hero"" game. Small had to disagree with his friend. ""I said, 'Nah, that's not true. There's 11-year-olds out there who can just shred through [Dethklok songs] ""Thunderhorse"" and ""Laser-cannon Death Sentence."" ' "" Those 11-year olds who play ""Warriors of Rock"" are about to discover some of the music that helped build Small's career as a musician and cartoon producer. Small's current cartoon project, ""Metalocalypse,"" follows a fictional metal band, Dethklok, who have become so popular that they influence world economies. ""One of my favorite things about 'Guitar Hero' is you're turning a whole generation on to music that wouldn't, I think, have discovered it any other way,"" Small said. ""Because in order to know about metal, you've either got to have a cool older sibling or a dude down the street who just knows what's up. Some people don't have either of those things. Some people have a really uncool older sibling who listens to Brittney Spears or some kind of dance or club or trance, and they're never going to learn about cool guitar stuff or Van Halen or any of that stuff. ""But now that they have 'Guitar Hero' in their life, they can learn about Skynyrd. Foghat. Sabbath. Soundgarden."" A sad omission on ""Guitar Hero's"" part from its sixth offering, said Small, was that of lightening-fast guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. Malmsteen, a Swedish guitarist, is known for his classical approach to metal music, as well as his fantasy-laden album covers and music videos. ""Yngwie, of course is the king. I love him. That should be on 'Guitar Hero,' because it would just be unplayable,"" Small said. ""He did [a video] with a wizard, a dragon and him in really high-waisted spandex pants and Sgt. Pepper's jacket flipping his Stratocaster around. Pretty awesome -- what rock 'n' roll is built for.""","""Warriors of Rock"" sets a metal playlist to a fantasy-driven quest play mode .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Connecticut jurors recessed Saturday without deciding the sentence of Steven Hayes, who was convicted of killing two sisters and their mother during a brutal 2007 home invasion. He faces life in prison or death. Judge Jon Blue ordered the five men and seven women on the jury to resume their work at 10 a.m. Sunday. Total deliberation time in the sentencing phase of the trial now stands at around 11 hours. Earlier Saturday, the jury sent a note requesting a read-back of some of the testimony of Dr. Eric Goldsmith, a psychiatrist who had said Hayes was significantly impaired at the time of the crimes and experienced an extreme emotional rage. Goldsmith was a witness for the defense. Friday, the jury asked Blue for clarification of the statute regarding mitigating factors -- evidence presented that would provide a reason for a sentence less than death. ""How do we fill out the form?"" the jurors asked. Blue instructed the panel members that they could not go into the second phase -- determining whether the prosecution has proven the aggravating factors -- until they were unanimous about whether there were mitigating factors. Thursday, Hayes' lawyer told jurors his client would suffer more if given a life sentence. ""Life in prison without the possibility of release is the harshest penalty,"" said Tom Ullmann. ""It is a fate worse than death."" Ullmann then had his 47-year-old client stand directly in front of the jury.  He put his hand on Hayes' shoulder and said to the jurors, ""He isn't a rabid dog that needs to be put to death. He has lost 80 pounds. He will never have a private bath. He goes to the bathroom in public. He will never eat a dinner that he makes, but one that they provide. He has a rec cage for an hour a day. Like an animal at the zoo."" As he stood, Hayes -- who did not testify during the trial -- looked down at the floor. His lawyer continued, ""If you want to end his misery, put him to death. ... If you want him to suffer and carry that burden forever, the guilt, shame and humiliation, sentence him to life without the possibility of release."" But prosecuting attorney Michael Dearington sought to persuade the jurors to order Hayes be executed for his role in in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. ""We cannot tie Steven Hayes to a bed, pour gasoline on him and set him on fire,"" Dearington said, referring to the killings. ""But under our laws, we do have the death penalty."" He added that the Petit family had been ""destroyed because Steven Hayes wanted money."" A psychiatrist testified last month that Hayes had told him, ""I would rather they kill me,"" reflecting Hayes' apparent hope that he'd be executed. The high school dropout said he had a long history of substance abuse, the psychiatrist said. But Dearington said Thursday that that did not excuse the murders. ""Drugs don't necessarily lead to violent crimes,"" he said. Hayes was convicted last month of 16 of the 17 charges against him, including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, Connecticut; beat Dr. William Petit; raped and strangled his wife, Hawke-Petit; sexually molested one of their daughters; set the house afire; and tried to flee. The girls died of smoke inhalation; Petit himself escaped to a neighbor's home. Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately.

"Washington (CNN) -- Food-safety advocates and survivors of food-borne illness called Wednesday for the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that has been in limbo since last year. ""When things go wrong with the food supply, consumers sometimes are the last to know but the first to pay,"" said Caroline DeWaal of the Washington-based, non-profit advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. The group released a report Wednesday detailing the food recalls that have occurred since July 2009, when the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that would give more power and responsibility to the Food and Drug Administration to make the food supply safer. In the 13 intervening months, the Senate has failed to pass companion legislation, she said. During that time, 85 recalls of FDA-regulated foods have been announced, she said. Christopher Waldrop, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America, which helped prepare the eight-page report, said 14 of the recalls covered all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Eighty percent were the result of microbial contamination -- salmonella (42 percent) or listeria (38 percent) -- both of which can prove fatal, he said. The recalls were associated with 1,850 reported illnesses -- most from the recent egg recall -- though that likely underestimates the true number since ""reported illnesses account for only a fraction of the true number of food-related illness in the country,"" he said. One of those reportedly sickened by recalled food was Rylee Gustafson, 13, of Henderson, Nevada. Four years ago, after eating spinach contaminated with E. coli, she got pain in her stomach, she said. That was followed by bloody diarrhea, swelling around her brain, kidney failure, diabetes and loss of vision and hearing, she said. ""I am OK now,"" she said, looking healthy. After recovering from her illness, she started advocating for food safety, she said. ""My experience has shown me you can't assume we are protected, so we have to demand the government does its job well."" The proposed Food Safety Enhancement Act (S. 510) covers many aspects of food safety, including better preventive control measures by manufacturers, more frequent inspections of facilities, and greater FDA authority over recalls. ""We believe it would significantly cut down on the number of recalls and, when they do occur, it would allow the FDA to identify the food more quickly,"" CSPI's DeWaal said. She said that, despite bipartisan support for the bill, it has not been brought to the floor. ""We've been told that the legislation was on the calendar for at least the last six months,"" she said. ""This is an urgent priority for the American consumer and we need to make it an urgent priority for American senators as well.""","Advocates want the Senate to pass a food safety bill when it reconvenes .

"Editor's note: Ted Danson is an Emmy Award-winning actor, a founding board member of Oceana, the world's largest international organization dedicated solely to  ocean conservation, and narrator of a new film, ""End of the Line."" For more information about Oceana, read here . Ted Danson says a ""closed"" sign on a beach led him on a 20-year quest to save the world's oceans. (CNN) -- Today, Monday, June 8, we recognize the first U.N.-sanctioned World Oceans Day. The event comes after years of pressure from conservation groups and thousands of activists who clamored for everyone to know and understand what's happening in our oceans. I became an ocean activist in 1987. It was the fifth year of ""Cheers"" and my family moved into a neighborhood that was on the water, in Santa Monica, California. One day I took my daughters to the beach to go swimming, but it was ""closed"" and I couldn't answer my daughter's question why. That's really how it started. That and ""Cheers"" was paying me a lot of money and I felt I had better be responsible with it. So, I started to get involved. It turned out in our new neighborhood there was a fight to keep Occidental Petroleum from drilling 60 oil wells on Will Rogers State Beach in Los Angeles. They wanted to slant drill into the Santa Monica Bay. The fight was led by a man named Robert Sulnick and we became great friends and found a way to beat them. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we wanted to continue this work. So Robert Sulnick and I, full of passion and naiveté, started American Oceans Campaign, which ultimately became a part of Oceana. And, here I am, still at it, 20 years later -- because our oceans are in trouble.  Watch Danson talk about his commitment to save the world's oceans » . The U.N. reports that 75 percent of seafood species are maxed out or overexploited and catches of nearly a third of these species are less than 10 percent of what they once were. Ninety percent of the big fish -- sharks, tuna, swordfish -- are already gone, according to a 2003 study in Nature. The chemistry of the oceans is changing as they absorb 11 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, and scientists say the acidifying waters will make it impossible for coral reefs, the nurseries of the sea, to grow. At the current rate of acidification, corals, sea snails and other calcium-carbonate-requiring life forms could begin to dissolve by the middle of the century, with potentially catastrophic results. Shellfish and fish will be in deep trouble as well. This is all happening on our watch. My friend Charles Clover, then a reporter for the U.K.'s Telegraph, wrote an incredible book about all of this called ""The End of the Line"" that lays out, in devastating detail, how this has happened. The book is now a film, released today, and I'm honored to serve as the narrator. The movie describes how marine scientist Daniel Pauly (a fellow Oceana board member) discovered China had been falsifying its fish catch data, and that instead of increasing, global fish catch had actually peaked in the late 1980s at about 80 million tons a year and had been falling ever since, despite better and faster technology and billions of dollars in government subsidies. The film also describes how we are about to fish one of the most magnificent fish in the ocean, the bluefin tuna, into extinction. It's not the only one we're eating into oblivion. Cod, once a staple in the working man's lunch of fish and chips, is increasingly a delicacy. Unable to catch once-prized species, fishermen are selling creatures that you would never have considered eating, like the once-disdained skates that replace scallops on European tables. Even jellyfish are becoming a commercially viable species. World Oceans Day is an opportunity to bring these underwater challenges to light. And it's a chance to explain how we can restore our oceans to their former glory. Ocean conservation is rewarding because you absolutely can make a difference. You leave a fish population alone for a while, and it rebounds. The oceans are incredibly resilient. We have the opportunity right now to protect the oceans and the life they harbor for future generations. By protecting important habitats like corals from destructive fishing techniques, and setting science-based quotas on seafood species, the battle is halfway won. Fish species will recover, and the marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds that rely on them for sustenance have a fighting chance. In addition, we must commit to renewable energy sources to end the excessive carbon dioxide emissions that are acidifying the oceans and making them inhospitable to life. The ocean does represent a source of energy, and it's not offshore oil and gas drilling -- it's offshore wind. Europe is a leader in developing offshore wind power, and it's time for the United States to catch up. Today, on World Oceans Day, don't just go green. Go blue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Danson.","Ted Danson: June 8 is the first U.N.-recognized World Oceans Day .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Miss California USA pageant officials appear close to announcing if they will strip Carrie Prejean of her crown because of her lingerie photos and same-sex marriage statements. Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in. The pageant's first runner-up, Tami Farrell, who would assume the Miss California USA title if Prejean is disqualified, will be at a Beverly Hills news conference Monday to ""address many issues surrounding Miss California USA,"" said pageant spokesman Ron Neal. The controversy began last month when Prejean, 21, declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage. She finished as first runner-up to Miss USA. Calls for her dethronement took on renewed energy this week when at least two photos of Prejean from a lingerie modeling session were published online, which Neal said violated the contract she signed to be in the pageant. In a statement given to CNN on Tuesday, Prejean said the photos were being used in a ""vicious and mean-spirited"" effort to silence her for ""defending traditional marriage."" She vowed to ""continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is."" The presence of Farrell on the list of those expected to be at the announcement -- and the absence of Prejean -- may suggest officials already have decided to replace her. Shanna Moakler, co-executive director of the state pageant, met with Farrell this week to discuss the possibility of her taking over as Miss California USA, Neal said. Ironically, Moakler -- who was the 1995 Miss USA -- became a Playboy centerfold model. As a top official with the Miss California USA organization, she plays a key role in deciding if the lingerie photos of Prejean are too racy for a beauty queen. State pageant officials met this week with lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump, who owns the international competition, to consider whether they had grounds to take the crown away from Prejean, according to Neal. ""When you compete for Miss California, you're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos, because it's grounds for disqualification,"" Neal said.  Watch reaction to racy photos » . CNN obtained a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year, in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification. The two photos show Prejean -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top. She is turned away from the camera, with an arm hiding most of her breast. It was unclear whether pageant officials would consider them semi-nude photos. During the pageant, contestants must parade across the stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more skin than the photos reveal. Prejean defended the photos, which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a professional model. ""I am a Christian, and I am a model,"" she said. ""Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos."" She said the photos ""have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith."" ""I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be,"" she said. ""But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks."" Her publicist, Melany Ethridge, confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was 17 when she posed for the photos, hoping they would land her a modeling job. ""In her naivete, an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company, claiming they could make her the next Victoria's Secret model,"" Ethridge told TMZ. ""She has since learned what a lie that was, and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken."" Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign supporting what she called ""opposite marriage"" (marriage between a man and a woman) funded by the National Organization for Marriage. ""Marriage is good,"" Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign. ""There is something special about unions of husband and wife. Unless we bring men and women together, children will not have mothers and fathers.""","Miss California USA pageant officials to have Monday news conference .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- France and some other NATO nations may begin to withdraw some troops from Afghanistan next year -- but the move is not tied to a threat issued against the country supposedly by Osama bin Laden, the country's defense minister said Thursday. Minister Herve Morin told French radio station RTL that France will begin to transfer the control of certain districts to Afghans in 2011. ""There is a fixed date by NATO in the framework of its new strategy. That is the start of 2011,"" he said. ""In 2011, we are going to transfer a whole series of districts to the Afghans."" ""At this moment, there could be the first movements or withdrawal of allied forces from Afghanistan,"" Morin said. But Morin, insisted, the decision to withdraw was ""in no way linked"" to a taped message broadcast by the Al-Jazeera television network Wednesday. In the tape, a man believed to be bin Laden warns France to get its troops out of Afghanistan and not to oppress Muslims at home. ""The only way to safeguard your nation and maintain your security is to lift all your injustice and its extensions off our people and most importantly to withdraw your forces from Bush's despicable war in Afghanistan,"" the al Qaeda leader says. The tape is audio only. The speaker does not appear. CNN was not immediately able to confirm that it is really bin Laden. Al Qaeda has issued a series of threats against France in the past, and French citizens have been killed by groups in Africa claiming affiliation with Bin Laden's group. France has 3,750 troops in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force.","The move is ""in no way"" linked to a new bin Laden tape, minister says .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the race is done, the balloons have wilted, and the confetti has been swept up, Campaign 2012 may be marked more by its failures than its triumphs. But here's the starkest failure in these final days before the vote: Neither candidate has made a convincing enough argument for his presidency to break free of the margin of error in the polls. No matter who is elected, close to as many Americans will have voted against him as for him. Sure, Barack Obama has generally stayed a point or two ahead of his rival in most battlegrounds, but despite his mighty pushes and the advantage of the bully pulpit he has rarely done any better. And Mitt Romney, while he has managed to relentlessly nip at the president's heels like a dog chasing a car (as opposed to one riding on top), he has never been able to decisively bridge the gap from ""also ran"" to ""front runner."" Mad dash in final bid for votes . The most recent CNN Poll of Polls -- an average of 10 national polls -- has Obama just one point ahead of Romney, 48%-47%. The latest CNN/ORC survey in the battleground state of Ohio has Obama up 50%-47%, and in Florida by just one point, 50%-49%. Both results are well within the polls' margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. And if both parties are not haunted by the ever-growing mob of voters calling themselves independents, they ought to be. At least Dr. Rita Kirk at Southern Methodist University thinks so. She is director of the Maguire Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility. ""Independent isn't a party,"" she says. ""It just means 'none of the above.' People are not really satisfied with either party."" Romney's difficulties in breaking through the margin of error have been well documented: a slow start that allowed the White House to paint his strongest positive, his business experience, as a negative; a clumsy trip overseas; and more than one stumble that helped build the caricature of an out-of-touch fat cat. Note to future campaigners: Working class folks have a little trouble relating to a guy who proposes $10,000 bets. Being pulled from the right . But perhaps a deeper part of Romney's trouble dates back to Obama's single biggest humiliation since taking office. Two years ago this month, Republicans ripped control of the House of Representatives from the Democrats, seized new ground in the Senate, and captured 10 extra governorships in what appeared to be a resounding rejection of the White House agenda. A subdued Obama called it a ""shellacking,"" admitting in a masterpiece of understatement, ""Some election nights are more fun than others."" If Romney wins... Romney: My vision for America . The Republican charge up Capitol Hill, however, was not led by party purists. The flags of the tea party waved high over the Democratic trouncing, and created a whole new road for GOP presidential hopefuls such as Romney. The uncompromising tea partiers made it clear they would get behind only someone who paid the toll of a hard and unmistakable turn to the right, especially on fiscal matters. And as Kirk puts it, ""A candidate (who makes that turn) stands very little chance of getting back to the center in time for the general election."" Was he ever 'severely conservative' enough? Romney was always an awkward fit. He had a hard time embracing the far right with enthusiasm, and the right felt the same about him. That is one reason why the nomination process dragged on so long, as the faithful tried to make it work with Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. But Romney was not just wrestling with philosophical differences. ""Something else that pulls candidates away from the middle is money,"" says assistant professor Georgia Kernell at Northwestern University's Department of Political Science, where she is a fellow in The Institute for Policy Research. She notes that Romney's now infamous ""47 percent"" comment was almost certainly spurred by the need to appeal to right-wing donors at that fundraiser. ""He didn't have to say it,"" Kernell says, ""but it certainly made (his message) more powerful."" The same might be said about candidate Barack Obama's similar stumble four years ago when he privately told donors that rural voters ""cling to their guns or religion."" Kernell believes the Republican nominee, all things considered, has walked the tightrope well. ""I actually think Romney did a great job using the first debate to position himself back in the middle."" It all came at a price. His vacillation between the right and center has allowed Team Obama to pelt him with accusations of flip-flopping and a schizophrenic candidacy, leaving Romney unable to crawl out of the margin-of-error trench. Crowley: It's the losing campaigns I remember most . A president marginalized . Obama did not have to tack nearly as far left as he would have if he were fighting other Democrats for the nomination this year, and undeniably he had some accomplishments to carry into the election. Health care reform was upheld by the Supreme Court. The war in Iraq was concluded and Afghanistan is winding down. As Vice President Joe Biden loves to say, because of Barack Obama, ""Osama Bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive."" Despite all that, the president, too, has spent the campaign in a marginal spot, right alongside Romney. His enemy is the economy, or as Kernell puts it, ""Unemployment hasn't gone down;"" at least not down to the 5% range Obama himself promised early in his term when he was touting the stimulus. Most voters have been willing to blame the legacy of the Bush years, and the president has encouraged that thinking at every juncture, reminding anyone who will listen that he inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression. An unwilling participant in his own reelection . But his reelection team clearly knew ""It could be worse"" was not much of a campaign slogan, so over the summer they steadily shifted to a divide-and-conquer strategy. Gone is ""No Drama Obama"" -- the apparently easygoing man who went into the White House promising to bring warring political parties to the table of peace and prosperity. In his place is a much tougher talking candidate who misses no chance to savage the Republicans, to ridicule Romney as a ""bull****er,"" and like his opponent, to bend the truth until it breaks. ""They're ignoring the fact checkers,"" Kirk says of both Obama and Romney. If Obama wins... Obama: My vision for America . The president, clearly much happier preaching Hope and Change in 2008, has seemed at times an unwilling participant in his own reelection. At the Democratic Convention, critics widely saw Bill Clinton's speech as superior, Joe Biden's as more passionate, and the president's as acceptable at best. The first debate with Romney brought even more concern for Democrats. President Obama sat looking down much of the time and seemed alternately angry, bored, or disengaged. His showing was so lackluster even faithful fans wondered whether he really wanted the White House anymore. Perhaps that is why he too, aside from one brief surge in August, has been unable to establish a commanding lead. Despite his consistently strong personal popularity, he's had to cling for his political life to every vote he can scrape up within the margin of error. Opinion: What's really at stake in election 2012 . More money, less unity . Neither candidate can say his deadlocked fate in the polls is because people have not heard his message. No other election has ever seen so much money raised and spent to win the White House -- latest estimates have the 2012 campaign costing, all in, as much as $6 billion. All those ads, all those TV interviews with the candidates and their surrogates, all the debates and bus trips. They've each had their chances to break out over and over again. Yet neither has been able to get the job done. They may have, however, accomplished another task. Although they each gave lip service to the idea of us all being in this together, the divisiveness of the race itself seems to have hardened opinions even more in red and blue America. In the end, it remains to be seen if there will be a president of the United States. With trust at a low, paranoia grows . Sure, someone will win the office, but arguably both campaigns have done all they can to make sure the country will be anything but united. If Obama wins, the stalwarts of red America may hunker down in their ""bitterness,"" simply enduring the next four years while awaiting the next chance to storm the castle. If Romney wins, the faithful of blue America may feed on their fury and do to the other party's president exactly what they accuse Republicans of doing to theirs; obstructing his every plan. Kernell likes to think not. She believes the very political partisans who've helped lead the country to this point may lead it back to more conciliatory days, if only for cynical reasons. ""The economy is going to turn around,"" she says, ""and they're all going to want to claim some responsibility."" Kirk, however, believes those better days may be a longer time coming. ""I think leadership will emerge. I just don't think it has yet."" Maybe, she suggests, the candidates once had ideas of a great, unifying moment -- of a nation coming together to confront its common issues in this campaign, but along the way those dreams were lost in the margins.","ANALYSIS: Both Romney and Obama have been unable to break through to unite voters .

"(CNN) -- It's just another coming of age story -- one we've all heard before -- but now it's about us. Just as Holden Caulfield awoke to the excitement of the adult world around him and wanted to escape the phonies, youth voters brought a novel and intense energy to the world of politics during the 2008 election in an effort to escape the phonies we'd been listening to our whole lives. Our debut into the world of politics was significant: The candidate with overwhelming youth support, Barack Obama, came out on top. I was too young to vote in that election, but after volunteering for the Obama campaign, I felt what many first-time voters and volunteers felt after the last election: proud, accomplished and significant. Four years later, what was once to us the novel and exciting adult world of politics now seems bitter and partisan. We're a little bit older, less bright-eyed and a little more cynical. It is not surprising that a generation not tempered by past disappointments, that had hoped its representatives would work in good faith to fix America's problems, might be less enthusiastic this time around. The percentage of youth voters who plan on voting fell from 78% in 2008 to just 58% this summer. We're the least likely of any age group to vote in November. Opinion: What Democrats need to do in Charlotte . But what a mistake it would be for us to throw in the towel now. Just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes doesn't mean we should forget how far we've come. President Obama understands what our generation contributed in 2008. He knows where we stand on issues and he agrees with us -- he's been our biggest ally in Washington since the start of his presidency. The president's signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, allows us to stay on our parents' health plan until we are 26. That means we'll have health insurance when we graduate from college, which more and more of us will be able to do thanks to the president's push to double funding for Pell Grants and his insistence on keeping interest rates low for the 7.4 million students taking out student loans. Because of Obama's repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" anyone can join the military, regardless of sexual orientation, an issue important to our generation. When Congress refused to pass the DREAM Act, Obama changed policy administratively, enabling immigrants who came to the country as children to avoid deportation. Opinion: Can Obama convince voters to turn to him again? Our president showed both political courage and moral responsibility when he stood up for women across America under attack from extreme Republican rhetoric and aggressive legislation curtailing women's rights and threatening women's health. Obama's swift, bold action to fix the broken American economy bequeathed to him by President George W. Bush has preserved homes and jobs for our parents and has preserved the possibility for home ownership and jobs for us. Obama has acted aggressively on the issue most important to my generation: climate change. Our generation believes in healing the Earth. Between 2010 and 2011, the United States cut its foreign oil imports by 10%, or 1 million barrels a day. Domestic natural gas production has increased during each year of the Obama presidency, providing jobs and a cleaner source of energy. After saving the American auto industry, the president then set out to strengthen it by demanding that car companies stay competitive in a global market and meet a 54.5 miles per gallon standard by 2025. Finally, in addition to investments in clean energy projects and jobs, Obama agrees with the 97% of scientists who recognize humans as the cause of climate change, while Mitt Romney ""isn't sure."" John King: To win, Obama must make history again . To be sure, none of this has come easily or without opposition. Part of growing up is realizing the frustrating, heartbreaking truth that intense and sustained long-term effort is needed to effect change. The difficulty of the obstacles that must be overcome and the scope of the fight that must be won make our accomplishments all the more impressive. Electing the first African-American president was a tremendous accomplishment, but it hasn't erased racism. Electing the first Catholic president, my grandfather, in 1960, did not mean that religious intolerance disappeared from our land. Whether it was the American Revolution, the Civil War or the civil rights movement, change has never come easy, and Americans have always had to fight for change we believe in. If we can appreciate the long strides our country has made since 2008 instead of dismissing them as imperfect attempts, we will prove that not only are we quick learners but we're in it for the long haul. Participation in the democratic process is not only a right: It's a responsibility we all share. Voting is something we can all do for our country. If we turn out to re-elect this president, we will prove that 2008 was not an anomaly, and that our generation and its concerns cannot be dismissed. Instead, 2008 will be seen as just the beginning. This fall let's display a deep commitment to our country, its ideals and provide a preview of the America we intend to build.

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for imprisoned former football great O.J. Simpson on Tuesday appealed his conviction to the Nevada Supreme Court, claiming his trial was ""fundamentally unfair."" O.J. Simpson is appealing his conviction for charges including kidnapping and armed robbery. A jury in October 2008 convicted Simpson, 61, on charges including armed robbery and kidnapping. He was sentenced in December to serve a term of up to 33 years in prison, with eligibility for parole after nine years. In the 47-page brief filed Tuesday, Simpson's attorneys accuse Clark County, Nevada, District Judge Jackie Glass of judicial misconduct, saying her behavior constituted ""cumulative error that was so egregious and prejudicial that the defense could not get a fair trial."" The judge inflicted herself into the trial proceedings, issued improper jury instructions, improperly admitted hearsay evidence and refused to allow defense attorneys to fully cross-examine witnesses, the filing alleges. In addition, she would not allow defense counsel to ask prospective jurors about their ""known and unknown"" biases, the brief said, and allowed prosecutors to strike the only two African-American potential jurors eligible to be on the jury. ""Because of the unique nature of the case, a full and complete questioning of potential jurors needed to take place,"" the appeal said. ""The District Court gave no deference to the fact that Simpson brought a lot of baggage into the courtroom."" Simpson's conviction came on October 3 -- the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman. The former Heisman Trophy winner, record-setting NFL running back and movie actor had enlisted the help of Clarence ""C.J."" Stewart and four others in an effort to get sports memorabilia items that Simpson claimed had belonged to him from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley. The six men confronted the dealers in a room at the Palace Station Hotel Room and Casino in Las Vegas on September 13, 2007, brandishing weapons but not firing them. Four of the men testified against Simpson, while Stewart stood trial alongside him. The four received probation in exchange for their testimony; Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson's, but will be eligible for parole in seven and a half years.

"(CNN) -- A Holland America cruise ship was disrupted early Saturday morning by an intoxicated passenger who released the ship's anchor, according to an affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun website. California resident Rick Ehlert, 44, released the anchor and a life buoy between 5:25 a.m. and 5:55 a.m., according to the affidavit. The MS Ryndam was unharmed, but the release of the anchor could have caused ""significant damage to the ship's rudder or propeller, which could disable the ship's ability to maneuver, or puncturing of the ship, which could result in sinking or severe flooding,"" according to the affidavit. The ship was traveling from Costa Maya, Mexico, to Tampa, Florida. A surveillance video shows Ehlert taking multiple steps to deploy the anchor while the ship was in motion. The MS Ryndam's maximum speed is 22 knots, which is approximately 25 mph, according to Holland America's website. Ehlert confessed to dropping the ship's anchor when questioned by special agents from the FBI. He admitted to being intoxicated at the time and detailed the multiple steps he took in deploying the anchor, including entering an area marked as off-limits to passengers. ""There is probable cause to believe on November 27 that Rick Ehlert did attempt to damage, destroy, disable, or wreck a vessel,"" FBI agent John Manning stated in the affidavit. Ehlert was arrested Sunday on a felony charge and taken into custody. He has not yet hired an attorney, according to the office of the magistrate who is handling the case.","An intoxicated passenger on a Holland America cruise ship released the ship's anchor .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Ron Asheton, the guitarist for the influential punk rock band The Stooges, was found dead this morning, police tell the Detroit Free Press. Ron Asheton helped form The Stooges in 1967 with his brother Scott and Iggy Pop. The 60-year-old's body was found in his Ann Arbor, Michigan, home after a caller phoned police saying they hadn't heard from him in a few days. Authorities are investigating the cause of death, but foul play is not suspected. The Stooges were founded in 1967 in Ann Arbor by Iggy Pop, Asheton, and his brother, Scott Asheton. Though never a major commerical success, the band has been cited by artists like Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Jack White of the White Stripes as a major influence. The group's albums included a self-titled debut, which was released in 1969, and 1970's ""Fun House."" Among the group's songs are ""I Wanna Be Your Dog,"" ""1969"" and ""Raw Power."" The Stooges are nominated for induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with inductees set to be announced later this month.

"Washington (CNN) -- The threat of publication of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables by a muckraker website has prompted a massive review of documents at U.S. embassies around the world, a U.S. official says. The official, who was not authorized to comment on the record, tells CNN that the State Department has, for months, been intensively dealing with the potential impact of the release of documents that WikiLeaks just recently hinted it will publish. The documents are believed to include hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of diplomatic reporting cables from around the world from between 2006 and 2009, the official said. In October, WikiLeaks released nearly 400,000 U.S. military reports about operations in Iraq. In July, it released more than 70,000 reports from the war in Afghanistan. ""Next release is 7 [times] the size of the Iraq War Logs,"" the WikiLeaks stated in a posting on its Twitter page on November 21. ""Intense pressure over it for months. Keep us strong."" The State Department has directed every diplomatic mission in the world to analyze cables issued from their locations during that period and to highlight those cables that might contain material sensitive enough to harm the relationship with the host country or put in danger the lives of any sources of information. The State Department website lists 297 embassies, consulates and diplomatic missions. The source says the concern is that the WikiLeaks release could undermine the United States all over the world. Honest diplomatic reporting is essential, the official says, and the leaks could hurt that, as well as compromise traditional diplomatic sources. The leaks could ruin their careers or even result in their deaths. In preparation, the State Department has been reaching out to other governments to warn them and has notified Congress about what could be published, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said earlier this week. For example, David Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, has called Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon to inform him of the matter, said Alain Cacchione, a Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman. The Canadian Embassy in Washington is working with the U.S. State Department, he said. The Pentagon also is concerned about the newest release. Officials there expect the documents to be released soon, possibly by the end of the week. The agency is increasing the size of a task force assigned to comb through the records of the already-leaked documents regarding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. If the new documents are published as threatened, the Pentagon team will help assess how damaging they are to U.S. interests. The task force numbers more than 100 people, including staffers from other agencies. The military has charged Pfc. Bradley Manning with leaking videos to WikiLeaks, as well as downloading documents from military computers while he served as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Among the documents he is alleged to have taken are 150,000 diplomatic cables. WikiLeaks has denied being in possession of those cables. Manning is being held at a military jail in Quantico, Virginia.","Source: Every diplomatic mission document issued from 2006-2009 is under review .

"(CNN) -- Kathryn Hire: With one woman and five men aboard, the space shuttle Endeavour launched early Monday morning and is heading to the international space station. Endeavour's two-week visit is the first of NASA's five final shuttle missions before the space agency retires its aging space shuttle fleet later this year. It's also the last major construction project on the 11-year-old space station. NASA says the crew members are Cmdr. George Zamka, pilot Terry Virts, and mission specialists Nicholas Patrick, Robert Behnken, Stephen Robinson and Kathryn Hire. Hire's official NASA biography details that she was born in Mobile, Alabama, served in the U.S. Navy for 7 years, and in 1993, became the first female in the U.

Today, he's scheduled to be in Washington to take part in a celebration of Boy Scouts of America's 100th birthday. The Scouts were incorporated on February 8, 1910. According to the Boy Scouts, there are some 2.8 million people between the ages of 7 and 20 who participate in scouting, but fewer than 5 percent earn the highest rank, Eagle Scout. Thomas, a junior at Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, Minnesota, has been involved in scouting since age 7. His parents adopted him from Korea, and he volunteers as a counselor to Korean adoptees. Thomas has been traveling the country as a 100th anniversary youth ambassador. He rode the BSA float in the Tournament of Roses parade last month and in March is scheduled to meet President Obama when the Boy Scouts deliver their annual Report to the Nation. Thomas, who has also earned 26 merit badges, told CNN Sunday that the greatest lesson from scouting is, ""Once you learn to lead a little bit, you learn there is a fine line between being strict and being nice.

What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.

"(CNN) -- Iran's judiciary chief has temporarily halted the execution of a woman convicted of adultery, state media reported Sunday, citing a judicial official. ""Although the verdict still stands and is definite, the execution has been halted on humanitarian grounds from the order of the honorable judiciary chief, and will not be implemented at this time,"" Malek Ajdar Sharifi, a judiciary official in East Azerbaijan province, told Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. The well-publicized case involves Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani, who faces the possibility of execution by stoning after being convicted in 2006 of adultery. Her lawyer, Mohommad Mostafaei, told CNN that Ashtiani confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. She later recanted that confession and has denied wrongdoing, he said. Ashtiani's case has drawn international attention and many human rights activists have called for the sentence to be changed. Protesters in London, England, on Saturday condemned the sentence and called for the end of hanging and stoning executions during a rally outside the Iranian Embassy. But Ajdar Sharifi said Sunday that ""whenever the minister (Sadeq Larijani) orders the verdict again ... it will take place despite the Western media propaganda,"" according to IRNA. ""We do not pay attention to the Western media,"" IRNA quoted Ajdar Sharifi as saying. Last week, in what was the Islamic republic's first public statement on the case, Iran seems to back away from an execution-by-stoning sentence, although it left open the possibility that Ashtiani could be executed by another method. The Iranian Embassy in London, England, said Thursday that ""this mission denies the false news aired in this respect and ... according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran, she will not be executed by stoning punishment. But in response to that statement, Drewery Dyke of Amnesty International in London said Ashtiani still faced the possibility of execution. ""We have noted in the past that those who have been sentenced to stonings have gone on to be hanged,"" he said. ""That remains a concern."" Ashtiani's lawyer has said his client's conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges. She has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency. Iran's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007. Ajdar Sharifi told IRNA Sunday that Ashtiani's crimes were ""numerous"" but added ""because of morality and ethics, I cannot go into the details of the crimes, but if the public knew, they would understand the criminal nature of them.""

"(CNN) -- A sailor found dead earlier this week at California's Camp Pendleton was shot while standing sentry, and a fire was set in an attempt to cover up evidence, the U.S. Navy said. Seaman August Provost, shown on his MySpace page, was killed while on sentry duty at Camp Pendleton. The death of Seaman August Provost of Houston, Texas, is being investigated as a homicide, Capt. Matt Brown told reporters on Thursday. A sailor is in custody in the case, Brown said. Although at least one of Provost's relatives said she believes he was killed because of his sexual orientation and his race, Brown said there was no indication the killing was a hate crime. A U.S. congressman also said on Friday there are indications Provost may have been killed because of his sexual orientation. Provost was killed while he was standing guard as a sentry for the Assault Craft Unit 5 compound at Camp Pendleton, Brown said. He had begun the shift at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, and his body was discovered by his replacement around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday. ""Preliminarily, it appears that Seaman Provost suffered gunshot wounds and it appears that someone attempted to destroy evidence by lighting a fire at Seaman Provost's assigned place of duty,"" Brown said. Provost's aunt, Rose Roy, of Beaumont, Texas, said by telephone on Friday that her nephew had told her he was being harassed because of his sexual orientation and because he was African-American. She described him as bisexual. ""He mentioned it to me and a couple other family members,"" she said of the harassment, and said he had first told her about it sometime last year. ""He was frustrated by it,"" she said. She said she had advised him to speak to someone of higher rank, but said she wasn't sure if he had done so. ""He went to serve and protect, but he didn't get the protection,"" she said. Brown said Thursday that he had no information on claims of harassment. Asked whether she believed her nephew was killed because of race and sexual orientation, she said, ""In my heart, I do."" She added, ""it was like an execution-style killing, and nobody does that unless you have that kind of hatred in your heart."" The Navy has one sailor in custody who ""has been linked to the commission of this crime through both physical evidence and his own statement,"" Brown said.  Watch Brown talk about the killing as a random act » . He did not identify the sailor, who has not been charged with wrongdoing. It is unclear if the sailor served with Provost in the same unit. A second sailor whom authorities initially questioned has since been released, Brown said. He said the Navy has no indication that Provost's death is a hate crime, although he emphasized the investigation is ongoing. ""What I can tell you, unequivocally at this point, based on the preliminary information that we have, is that regardless of the person standing watch in that sentry station, this crime would have most likely been carried out in the same way,"" he said. ""In other words, another sailor could have been on that post and would have been the victim of this crime."" Rep. Bob Filner, a California Democrat, has called for a full and transparent investigation. Asked Friday if Provost was killed because of his sexual orientation, he said, ""There are indications that that's the case. His family says he was harassed."" Filner said he was on Camp Pendleton hours after Provost's body was found, although no one told him of the killing. ""When I was on the base for another event, the commander of the base was sitting next to me and never mentioned a word, which I find very strange,"" he said. He said he was asking for the ""truth of what happened."" ""We're going to ask, if I may coin a phrase, and we hope that they tell,"" he said. Roy said her nephew was ""a good kid,"" who didn't have a ""bad bone in his body"" and had loved the Navy. He joined the service in March 2008, according to Brown. ""He was a people person,"" Roy said. ""If he could give you the shirt off his back, he would."" A funeral has been planned for July 10 in Houston, she said. ""We loved him dearly,"" she said.","Fire was set to cover up evidence, U.S. Navy says .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- ""There are the bloodstains on the wall, and here it is dried on the floor,"" Abu Muhanad said as he walked through a torture chamber in a Baghdad mosque where more than two dozen bodies have been found. Two women clutch photographs of loved ones believed killed by the Mehdi Army. ""And here, a woman's shoes. She was a victim of the militia. We found her corpse in the grave."" Chunks of hair waft lazily across the floor in the hot Baghdad breeze. ""This was the torture room,"" said Muhanad, the leader of a U.S.-backed armed group that now controls the mosque. ""This is what they used for hanging,"" he said, pointing to a cord dangling from the ceiling. ""Here is a chain we found tied to an old man's body."" Go inside the mosque's torture chamber » . The horrific scene at this southwestern Baghdad mosque is what officials say was the work of a Shiite militia known as the Mehdi Army. Residents who live near the mosque say they could hear the victims' screams. The militia had been in control of the mosque, called Adib al-Jumaili, from at least January 2007 until May of this year.  Residents say coalition forces weren't in the region and the torture and killings went unchecked. Some of the victims were accused of being spies for U.S. forces. Other family members don't know why their loved ones disappeared. The family members at the mosque who spoke to CNN were all Shiite, the same branch of Islam as the Mehdi militia. But, they say, some of the victims were Sunni as well.  Watch mosque atrocities uncovered » . The neighborhood lies in an area that became one of the capital's many sectarian fault lines when violence was at its worst. It's been about three months since the Mehdi Army, loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, abandoned this mosque as it withdrew from several strongholds across the country. Spray painted on the walls is a chilling warning: ""Spies, you will dig your own graves. Long live the Mehdi Army."" Now the mosque is under the watch of the Sons of Iraq, a local armed group that is largely financed by the Americans working alongside the Iraqi police. They are charged with trying to keep the peace in the neighborhood. Muhanad is their leader. ""We found this chain on an old man's corpse that we dug out of the grave,"" he said, gesturing to a bloodied chain on the floor. ""We recovered about 22 corpses and then another five."" Only now are people able to understand the true magnitude of the Shiite militia's atrocities and the brutal laws they were enforcing on the people. ""This was my son's grave,"" Abu Wissam said, pointing to one of the many shallow holes in the mosque's garden. ""We recovered his corpse completely rotten. His hands and legs were amputated, and his head was decapitated."" ""He was just a college graduate,"" his mother sobbed, clutching her 25-year-old son's photo. They say the Mehdi Army abducted their son about a year ago, accusing him of being a traitor. They shot up and looted his home. The family fled. A gruesome video of their son's mutilated body was delivered to their doorstep. The militia ""still raid our homes,"" Abu Wissam said. ""Their families are in the district. The day before yesterday, at noon, they tried to assassinate me, but I was able to call the police for help."" The neighborhood is eerily deserted. Most of the residents fled the militia's reign; many who stayed bore the brunt of the violence. Homes stand abandoned, shops shuttered, buildings shot up. A single car drives down the main street as a pack of dogs runs through the twisted piles of metal that was once an outdoor market. Lingering at the mosque are a handful of residents whose loved ones were also abducted, looking for clues. ""They said they were just taking him for a few minutes, for an investigation,"" said Karima, who only wanted to be identified by her first name, as her eyes filled with tears. ""But they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque."" Umm Diab's breath came in shallow gasps as tears flowed from her turquoise-green eyes. She wiped them away using the corner of her abaya, or robe. In her hand, there's a passport photo of her father, who was abducted by the militia. ""All we want are their dead bodies,"" she said. Although the Mehdi Army has moved out of this mosque and is less visible on the street, residents know that they're not gone. ""They're still threatening us,"" Umm Diab said.","Iraqi authorities discover 27 bodies at mosque and find torture room .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court can seem a distant, dusty place, far removed from what young people, especially, see as relevant in their lives. It's an institution closed to cameras, with justices issuing dense written opinions while working mostly from their private chambers. So how do you get high schoolers interested in the important judicial stakes that affect everyone? Attorney Josh Blackman has found a way, using digital technology to give students the power to pick high court winners and losers through an interactive hands-on nationwide competition. Through his FantasyScotus.org website, Blackman created a nationwide teaching tool involving 200 classes around the country, and growing. Using a fantasy league concept popular with sporting events, Blackman organized a web-based game where students analyze current high-profile cases, then predict the outcomes. Points are awarded, and winners get bragging rights, badges of honor and Internet recognition. ""It's not dry history, these cases are live, they're new,"" Blackman told CNN. ""The big thing is they haven't been decided. High school students in the past have been told to accept the law, but here they can participate and have a stake in the outcome, by making predictions."" The 26-year-old Staten Island, New York, native created the lesson plans in his spare time, with the help of a few friends. He works as a law clerk for a federal judge in western Pennsylvania and hopes to be a law professor one day. The year-old project is an offshoot of a larger fantasy league he also created, targeted at adult court aficionados. Blackman explains he did all this initially as a hobby -- ""almost as a joke"" -- after a colleague dared him to test his skills at picking the winning side in several big Supreme Court cases in 2009. ""People around the world play it and seemed to like the original version, but then teachers started calling me, saying they were using it as an educational tool. They said it was too hard to navigate,"" said Blackman. ""So we modified things, making it easier to operate, using basic English and a simple points system."" Through his nonprofit Harlan Institute -- named after the first Justice John Marshall Harlan -- Blackman also gathered a teacher advisory network, having volunteer lawyers appear via Skype to various classrooms. A recent ""Teach-A-Thon"" found him and other attorneys advising students on court prediction strategy in seven schools -- from Iowa, Michigan, Virginia and elsewhere, even Canada. Among the Supreme Court cases the students are predicting: whether states can ban ""violent"" video games from being sold to minors and the free speech rights of an angry anti-gay church group that protests loudly at the private funerals of military personnel killed in wars overseas. Rulings in those appeals are expected next spring. One attractive feature for cash-strapped schools is that the FantasyScotus project is free. Funding comes from private donations, combined with the relatively inexpensive operating costs. Technology also allows volunteer lawyers to advise students without having to leave their offices, through computer video linkups. In addition to enlisting teachers and lawyers, the project is working with iCivics, the education resource founded by retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. ""It's been blast, seeing young people connect with the law in a way I never had the opportunity to when I was a kid,"" Blackman said. ""They're looking at the Constitution now not as this dead document, but something they can participate in, where they can try and make a difference."" Technology is music to Scalia's ears . ""It's a brave new world."" So says Justice Antonin Scalia on the technological changes occurring in his court and in his own life. The 74-year-old jurist revealed his heavy use of an iPod media player and iPad portable tablet computer, for both work and pleasure. Speaking at a recent black-tie dinner sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society, Scalia said his musical tastes tend to opera and classical works, which he proudly noted he downloads himself. Many of his fellow benchmates shun technology, preferring to handwrite the first drafts of their opinions and communicate through formal hand-delivered paper messages. But the senior associate justice says he relies on his computer so much, he ""can hardly write in longhand any more."" And his iPad is filled with the reams of legal briefs he needs to read up on pending and current cases. He can now take his caseload anywhere he says, and does not have to ""schlep the [written] briefs around."" But Scalia told the audience another powerful communication device will not soon invade his courtroom: television. As he has said many times before, the justice worries that greater public access to the open sessions where the court conducts oral arguments would not necessarily be a good thing. ""Familiarity breeds contempt,"" he said. ""The fact that the court is somewhat removed is a good thing."" C-SPAN and other broadcasters have long pushed to televise the court arguments, with support from several lawmakers. Only audio of the sessions is available, but those recordings are released days after they happen. The public, of course, can attend in person, but seating is limited and requires waiting in line. Scalia admits most of the cases are fairly boring, about such areas of law as bankruptcy and utility taxes. What he worries about are the hot-button cases like abortion and gay rights, where isolated comments by the justices aired by the media could be taken out of context. And one televised event you are not likely to see Scalia attend is the State of the Union, which he compared to ""cheerleading sessions."" As judges, the justices are not supposed to show any favoritism, so they sit there politely in their black robes. ""I don't know at what point that happened, but it has happened, and now you go and sit there like bumps on a log while applause lines cause one half of the Congress to leap up while [the other] causes the other half to leap up,"" he said. ""It is a juvenile spectacle. And I resent being called upon to give it dignity."" Sitting in the Federalist Society event at a local Washington hotel was Scalia's conservative colleague Justice Samuel Alito. He came under some criticism after January's State of the Union for mouthing the words ""not true"" when President Obama slammed the court's ruling in a controversial campaign finance case. Alito later said he felt ""like the proverbial potted plant"" at such occasions and would not be attending in the near future. Scalia was more blunt: ""You just sit there, looking stupid."" For the generally verbose and animated jurist, sitting still for an hour or more at such a gathering may be an exercise he would just as soon avoid. And he does. Shooting with friends . So what does Scalia do in his free time? Take a field trip with the newest justice. He and Elena Kagan, both native New Yorkers, were seen recently at a suburban Washington gun range, according to legal sources. Scalia had invited Kagan, 50, for an afternoon of target practice soon after she joined the high court. The ideological opposites were spotted skeet shooting, with the more experienced Scalia offering tips on holding the shotgun for the apparent novice. Skeet involves firing at clay targets propelled into the air from various angles. Scalia is a member of the Fairfax Rod and Gun Club, but neither the company nor the court would comment officially on the excursion. Sources close to both justices say Scalia and Kagan have gotten along famously in their first few months together on the bench. The conservative Scalia, those sources say, has warmly embraced his new liberal colleague and fellow Harvard Law School alum. Scalia has been a longtime gun owner and hunter. As a high school student, he was a rifle team member. As he once recalled, ""I used to travel on the subway from Queens to Manhattan with a rifle. Can you imagine doing that now in New York? I mean, 'There's a man with a gun!' "" On a more serious note, Scalia drew criticism after going shotgun hunting in Louisiana with then Vice President Dick Cheney at a time when the court was considering an appeal over access to Cheney's internal records. Critics called it a conflict of interest and asked him to step down from the case, but he refused. To make things worse for the 2004 private trip, the hunting party didn't get many ducks.","Attorney getting students interested in important cases that affect everyone .

"Washington (CNN) -- Baseball all-time home run champion Barry Bonds won a big legal victory Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in a divided opinion, said the government cannot use urine samples and other evidence in its perjury case against the former San Francisco Giants star. Bonds was indicted in federal court in December 2008 on 10 counts of making false statements to a grand jury -- specifically, denying that he knowingly took steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. His criminal trial has been delayed while the legal issues are being worked out. It was unclear whether the Justice Department will now appeal to the Supreme Court in an effort to allow the evidence to be used in court. The Appeals Court ruling upholds a February 2009 ruling from U.S. District Judge Susan Illston that there was no proof that positive steroid tests from 2000 and 2001 were Bonds' and that out-of-court statements from his former trainer, Greg Anderson, are hearsay. The appeals court majority said the repeated refusal of Anderson to testify against Bonds means evidence allegedly gathered by him is considered ""inadmissible, since he would be unable to vouch for its authenticity."" Robert Talbot, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law said the ruling essentially torpedoes the prosecution's case, which was heavily dependent on evidence and information from Bonds' former trainer. ""There was a link missing here, that the only way to get down to the nitty-gritty that this was from Barry Bonds was using hearsay testimony,"" Talbot said. Anderson, he said, ""had possession of the evidence and he had that knowledge, and you can't use that knowledge unless he actually testifies under oath."" ""To try and prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly in San Francisco where there are going to be many, many people chosen for a jury who would be behind Barry Bonds -- it should be the death knell,"" Talbot said. ""Practically speaking they should say, 'We gave it our best shot, and it's just not there,'"" he said. Anderson allegedly took urine samples and delivered them to a Bay-area lab known as BALCO. At issue in the appeal was whether the tested samples actually came from Bonds, and Anderson's employment status at the time. The appeals court concluded Anderson was an ""independent contractor"" -- not directly hired by Bonds. Because Bonds also did not control the samples, the court reasoned, Anderson would need to testify in person on the material and the chain of possession. The government said it would instead bring BALCO executive James Valente to the stand to testify Anderson told him the samples indeed came from Bonds. The court ultimately agreed with the arguments presented by Bonds' lawyers. ""Because the government was attempting to use Anderson's out-of-court statements to prove the truth of what they contained, Bonds argued that Anderson's statements were inadmissible hearsay and that the lab results could not be authenticated as Bonds' in that manner."" Bonds hit a record-setting 73 homers in the 2001 season. That same year, as well as before and after, the FBI said BALCO Laboratories recorded urine and blood tests, under the name ""Barry Bonds,"" showing ""positive"" results for steroids and performance-enchancing drugs. The government had the burden of showing the samples came from Bonds, then went to Anderson and then to BALCO. Anderson has refused to testify and has been jailed for contempt of court on several occasions. ""There must be at least some manifestation of assent to the principal's right to control,"" said the court of Bonds. ""Here, the testing was performed on Anderson's own initiative and not at the request of Bonds. The dissent incorrectly assumes otherwise. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Anderson was not an agent for the limited purpose of the drug testing."" The government alleges BALCO helped supply Bonds with steroids and drug-masking substances. BALCO was accused of covertly marketing tetrahydrogestrinone -- known as ""the Clear"" -- a then-undetectable performance-enhancing steroid. Company founder Victor Conte and associates such as Anderson allegedly supplied other top athletes with the Clear and human growth hormone, assuring the competitors they would not be caught cheating. The lab performed repeated tests on athletes, said the government, to check whether the drugs were detectable. Top professional football and track stars were caught up in the scandal, prosecutors say. Steroid use was banned by Major League Baseball in 2003. Neither the government nor Bonds had an immediate reaction to the ruling. In light of the decision, it remains unclear whether the criminal trail will proceed. The case is U.S. v. Bonds (09-10079). CNN's Augie Martin and Matt Cherry contributed to this report.","NEW: Law professor: ""It should be the death knell"" for prosecution .

"(CNN) -- Bud Greenspan, the filmmaker known for producing documentaries about the inspirational stories of Olympic athletes, has died. Greenspan, 84, succumbed Saturday afternoon to complications from Parkinson's Disease, according to companion Nancy Beffa. Greenspan, who began his career in sports radio broadcasting in the mid-1940s, became a filmmaker a decade later. His first documentary to attract widespread attention was his 1964 film, ""Jesse Owens Returns to Berlin."" That documentary -- and 21 other Greenspan films that made up the series ""The Olympiad"" -- garnered him an Emmy Award in 1976. Greenspan went on to make numerous other films including docudramas. He also authored several books about the Olympics. CNN was provided with an e-mail Beffa received from Norm Bellingham after he had been told of Greenspan's death. Bellingham is chief operating officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee and an Olympic gold medalist. ""I am feeling a terrible loss,"" Bellingham. ""I was just thinking of him this morning -- looking through the many Olympic stories and wondering how he picked the ones that he did and then sorted out how to tell them with such extraordinary power."" In a prepared statement released Sunday afternoon, USOC chief executive officer Scott Blackmun said, ""For more than six decades, Bud Greenspan has connected the Olympic Movement to everyday people in ways the founders of the Games couldn't have imagined."" ""While the entire Olympic Movement mourns the loss of a giant today,"" Blackmun stated, ""his stories will continue to live on, carrying his passion for the Olympic Movement for years and years to come.""

"(CNN) -- Some of the nation's top experts Tuesday were looking for clues into sudden, mass deaths of birds in two states over New Year's weekend. ""This one is unusual because of the time period over which so many birds died,"" said LeAnn White, a field investigator with the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin. The center, part of the U.S. Geological Survey, is receiving samples from Arkansas, where as many as 5,000 red-winged blackbirds and starlings fell from the sky in a square-mile area in less than an hour on New Year's Eve, according to the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission. The center will also examine samples from Louisiana, where 500 red-winged blackbirds, starlings and grackles were found dead in Labarre. A preliminary report conducted Monday by the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission found that the birds in Beebe, Arkansas, likely died from massive trauma. There had been reports of loud sounds in Beebe before the reports of birds falling began to come in. It's possible the sounds made the birds disoriented, and they went into sudden, chaotic flights, crashing into each other and into objects, White said. ""You're disturbed, you're disoriented, you're trying to figure out where you are. We have seen some stuff like this before when there's heavy dense fog, and they'll run into towers and power lines,"" she said. Other bird experts agree that that's a likely explanation. Still, the sudden deaths are quite unusual. ""It's kind of a freak event,"" said Greg Butcher, director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society. ""You just don't see these kinds of mass deaths very frequently at all."" At this time of year, blackbirds are in huge roosts, particularly throughout the southeastern United States, he said. They generally don't fly at night. ""In the course of a year, about half the birds that are around die -- even under the best circumstances. The life of a bird is brutish and short. But it just usually happens out of the sight of people,"" said Butcher. It's possible that the loud sound that triggered the incident was New Year's Eve fireworks, though officials said the investigation is ongoing. ""If it had been any other day of the week,"" Butcher said, he might have suspected people to be behind the deaths. ""There's a lot of purposeful killings. ... People really don't like these big roosts. But I can't see anybody doing that on New Year's Eve."" Doug Inkley, senior scientist with the National Wildlife Federation, said his ""first suspicion is that they were frightened and went into a mass panic."" ""I would call this event unusual,"" he said, ""but not unprecedented."" Keith Stephens, a spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, said the birds showed evidence of trauma in the breast tissue, with blood clots in the body cavity and a lot of internal bleeding. All major organs were normal. Karen Rowe, an ornithologist for the commission, said such incidents can be caused by a lightning strike or high-altitude hail. A strong storm system moved through the state earlier in the day Friday. The experts CNN spoke with saw nothing surprising in there being a similar report of bird deaths in Louisiana. ""It's another one of those coincidences,"" said White, adding, ""I'm really interested to see if there's anything that could possibly be related. I asked about weather conditions there. There's sometimes high-altitude hail."" But, she said, so far officials were not aware of ""any strange weather patterns"" in the area. Butcher, with the National Audubon Society, said there may be more reports of dead birds found around the country. ""As soon as one of these things hits the airwaves, people are just more sensitive to seeing dead birds around."" Meanwhile, Arkansas officials are investigating the death of an estimated 100,000 fish in the state's northwest, but suspect disease was to blame, a state spokesman said Sunday.","Thousands of birds died suddenly Friday night in two separate locations .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Trinnette Morris and her group of girls followed in President Obama's footsteps when they stopped at Ben's Chili Bowl during a recent visit to Washington. Barack Obama pays for a chili dog during a visit to Ben's Chili Bowl in January. ""I just put on my Facebook page last night that we're on Obama watch for the girls,"" said Morris, of West Palm Beach, Florida. She was waiting for breakfast with her 9-year-old niece, her best friend and her friend's two young daughters at the landmark U Street restaurant -- one of the first places Barack Obama visited after arriving in the capital in January. District of Columbia tourism officials hope the Obama family's presence in Washington will help boost visitor interest in the city, as destinations worldwide struggle with a drop in travel. ""Having a young, photogenic, African-American first family is really great for D.C.,"" said Bill Hanbury, CEO of Destination DC, the city's tourism organization. ""They're going to restaurants, they're going to sporting events, they're outside at the White House playing on their jungle gym. You know it shows D.C. as a real city, not just a city of monuments and memorials.""  See photos of the president around town » . So far this year, hotel occupancy rates in the city are down less than in many competing markets, but how the capital city fares in the tourism downturn really will be determined as the peak season heats up. To take advantage of public curiosity about what the first family is doing around town, Destination DC has posted an Obama itinerary on its Web site that features many of the local spots the president has visited. If you want to explore beyond the typical presidential stomping grounds of the White House and Capitol, here are a handful of Obama-approved places you might want to check out. Ben's Chili Bowl . Chili dogs may not figure prominently into the president's health-conscious diet, but President Obama has been spotted tucking into one at Ben's Chili Bowl. Ben and Virginia Ali opened this neighborhood eatery in 1958 on U Street in then-segregated Washington. The U Street corridor was known as ""Black Broadway"" because performers such as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald played and socialized in local clubs and restaurants. The restaurant weathered neighborhood upheaval, decay and rebirth to celebrate its 50th anniversary last year. On January 10, then president-elect Obama came into ""The Bowl"" with Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty and sampled the restaurant's signature chili half-smoke  -- a smoked sausage served on a bun with chili, mustard and onions.  Watch the co-owner of Ben's Chili Bowl talk about Obama's visit » . Equinox . Want to celebrate your trip to Washington in high style? Take Michelle Obama's lead at Equinox, an intimate restaurant not far from the White House that features fresh mid-Atlantic cuisine. On January 15, the first couple and a group of friends celebrated Michelle's 45th birthday at Equinox. The Obamas came in, Secret Service in tow, and ordered off the menu. The first lady started with pan fried Rappahannock oysters with apple-celery root puree and caper butter. The president and first lady both had grilled strip loin with slow-cooked gold potato pave and cabernet wine jus. ""It was a lovely little three-course, nothing over-the-top-extravagant, nice meal,"" said Ellen Gray, who owns the restaurant with her husband, chef Todd Gray. Washington Wizards Game, Verizon Center . You don't have to be a huge sports fan to take in a little excitement at a professional basketball game. In February, the president watched the Washington Wizards defeat his hometown Chicago Bulls at the Verizon Center. Equinox's Gray sat in a box behind President Obama at the game. ""We had more fun watching him than the game, I think,"" she said. ""He was having a beer and he was so cool and he was sitting next to this little kid. I think the kid was coming unglued, he was like 'Oh my God, President Obama is next to me.' "" The Wizards are wrapping up their season next week, but next year's Wizards-Bulls matchup might yield another presidential sighting. The Kennedy Center . Ready for some entertainment? Follow the first family to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where they saw a performance by the Alvin Ailey dance company in February. ""It wasn't announced, but when he came in it was as if a rock star had entered the building. It was loud, everybody was cheering,"" said Kennedy Center spokesman John Dow. In addition to a full schedule of world-class acts, the Kennedy Center is the site of free one-hour performances every day at 6 p.m. The Hay-Adams Hotel . If you're looking for a posh place to lay your head, consider the Hay-Adams Hotel in Lafayette Square across from the White House. The Obama family stayed in the hotel before moving into Blair House before the inauguration. The hotel, which opened in 1928, was built on the site of homes that belonged to John Hay, President Abraham Lincoln's private assistant who later served as secretary of state, and Henry Adams, a respected author and descendant of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. If rates starting at more than $300 a night are out of range, consider checking into Off the Record, the hotel's elegant bar, for a cocktail and a snack. Or have an executive breakfast at The Lafayette overlooking the White House. Obama pajamas are another festive substitute for the presidential suite. Inauguration Station, a sliver of a shop on Georgetown's M Street, has been selling unique Obama-themed souvenirs since mid-January. The shop's owners are still selling items such as The Audacity of Soap bars ($10) and Obama pajamas ($39.50), so they're keeping the business going. While bumping into the commander-in-chief is unlikely, experiencing local venues on his heels provides a glimpse into life in the nation's capital. As for Trinnette Morris' Obama watch: No presidential encounters for her young travel companions. ""We didn't track down Obama,"" Morris said via e-mail after her trip. ""But [we] had a great time making the girls think we could."" CNN's Lauren Kornreich contributed to this report.","D.C. tourism official says popular, active president helps city's image .

"New York (CNN) -- Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy of New York -- who ran for office after a gunman killed her husband and injured her son -- is drafting legislation that would ban the sale of high-capacity gun ammunition magazines to civilians in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Tucson, Arizona. ""What we're looking at is high-capacity magazines and nothing else,"" McCarthy Press Secretary Shams Tarek told CNN, explaining the legislation would be streamlined to maximize odds of passage. A prohibition on the sale of ammunition magazines containing more than 10 bullets was part of the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. ""We're hoping to introduce it this week,"" said Tarek. The alleged gunman in Tucson fired a Glock semi-automatic handgun with a clip reportedly having the capacity for 31 rounds. Only after the gunman's ammunition was spent and he tried to reload were bystanders able to tackle and restrain him, according to the Pima County Sheriff. ""The most immediate and obvious thing to do is ban high-capacity magazines. There's no reason for a civilian to have it,"" said Daniel Vice, senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""It would have saved people from being shot."" The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, 22, was scheduled to appear in a Phoenix, Arizona, courtroom Monday afternoon, according to prosecutors.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Three bombings targeted Shiite pilgrims Monday in and around Karbala, Iraq, killing at least 33 people, officials said. A suicide car bombing in the small town of Twareej, just outside Karbala, killed at least 20 people and wounded 35 others, Interior Ministry officials said. Earlier, at least 13 people died when a car bomb exploded in a Karbala bus station crowded with Shiite pilgrims, who had traveled to the city for a religious observance, according to the Interior Ministry. Another 45 people were wounded in the attack, which came near the peak of the Arbaeen, a religious observance that is one of the holiest days in the Shiite religious calendar. An hour after the bus station bombing, a roadside bomb targeting Shiite pilgrims exploded in Karbala, wounding six people. Karbala is located about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Baghdad. The dead and wounded included women and children, and were among the hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims who have gathered in Karbala for the observance. The Arbaeen is the culmination of 40 days of mourning for Imam Hussein, a grandson of Mohammed who died in a 7th century battle in Karbala. The latest explosions come four days after multiple bombings that left 50 people dead and 150 wounded, most of them Shiite pilgrims. Also Monday morning, the governor of Iraq's Salaheddin province escaped unharmed after his convoy hit a roadside bomb in central Tikrit, police said. Five of Gov. Ahmed Abdullah's guards were wounded in the attack, Tikrit police said. Tikrit is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad.

"(CNN) -- Federal agents have backed up al Qaeda captive Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's confession in the killing of journalist Daniel Pearl by using photographs of the veins in his hands, according to a new report released Thursday. Mohammed confessed to beheading Pearl after his 2003 arrest in Pakistan. But the U.S. admission that he had been subjected to ""waterboarding"" -- a practice historically treated as torture -- while in CIA custody cast doubt on the reliability of his confession, according to a lengthy investigation of the Pearl case by the Center for Public Integrity. According to the report, the FBI and CIA used stills from the video of Pearl's killing to match the patterns of the veins in Mohammed's hand in 2004 and repeated the process in 2007, after Mohammed repeated his confession during a hearing at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""Beyond KSM's confession, the U.S. government has never revealed any corroborating evidence,"" the report states. But it called the vein match the ""best evidence"" the United States has linking Mohammed to Pearl's 2002 slaying. The FBI had no comment on the report that it used vein-matching technology to confirm Mohammed's identity, and said in a written statement that it is not using the technology ""at this time."" Mohammed is accused of planning al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. According to military prosecutors, he admitted responsibility for the attacks ""from A to Z"" during a hearing before a military court at Guantanamo Bay. He has not been charged in Pearl's death, however. According to the report, U.S. officials decided against bringing charges in the Pearl case to avoid complicating Mohammed's prosecution for the 9/11 attacks. Pearl was kidnapped in the Pakistani city of Karachi while on his way to what he believed was an interview with a radical cleric connected to al Qaeda operative Richard Reid's ""shoe bomb"" plot. A video of Pearl's beheading was distributed online nearly a month after he was abducted, but the face of the killer who slit his throat was not visible. According to Thursday's report, his captors were ""inept, plagued by bungling plans, a failure to cover their tracks, and an inability to operate cameras and computer equipment."" Even the grisly video of Pearl's death had to be restaged, ""because the cameraman failed to capture the original scene."" Mohammed moved so quickly to cut Pearl's throat that the photographer failed to load a tape into his camera, according to the report. He repeated the killing for the camera, severing Pearl's head in the process and making sure the photographer showed the blood still pouring through Pearl's throat. The scene ""would later turn the stomachs of even the most hardened Pakistani and U.S. investigators,"" the report states. But the report is also critical of Pakistani authorities' pursuit of the killers. Prosecutors ""knowingly used perjured testimony"" against the four men who were convicted in Pearl's death, it states. ""While the four were involved in the kidnapping plan and certainly were culpable, they were not present when Pearl was murdered. Others, who were present and actually assisted in the brutal beheading, were not charged,"" the report states. And 14 people suspected of working as guards, ""fixers"" or drivers in the abduction remain free, the report states. At least five others suspected of involvement have been killed or died under suspicious circumstances, according to the report. Mohammed and one of his nephews remain in U.S. custody, another man is being held in Pakistan on unrelated charges and another of Mohammed's nephews is believed to be in custody, ""but his whereabouts cannot be confirmed."" Mohammed told the FBI that a senior al Qaeda operative advised him to take control of Pearl from his original kidnappers, the report said. Pakistani authorities freed a guard who was a key informant and failed to follow potential leads, according to the report. The three-year Pearl Project was prepared by faculty and students at Georgetown University in Washington.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ted Williams, the homeless ""golden voice"" sensation on the internet, checked himself out of drug rehab 12 days after he voluntarily entered the facility, Dr. Phil McGraw said Monday. Williams, 53, admitted during a taping of ""The Dr. Phil Show"" earlier this month that he was still drinking, claiming in other interviews in the past week to have been sober for the past two years after years of addiction. ""Ted was given the chance to voluntarily enter a drug rehabilitation facility in order to help him in dealing with his dependency on drugs and alcohol,"" McGraw said. ""In that it is voluntary, the decision to remain in treatment is Ted's to make."" Williams' substance abuse separated him from his family and left him homeless for years, until a reporter for the Columbus Dispatch in Ohio videotaped him panhandling on a roadside last month. The video quickly went viral on the internet, and he was offered a several announcing jobs, including a contract with Kraft Foods. Williams had been on a whirlwind spiral of publicity when he traveled to Los Angeles with his family to tape three interviews with ""The Dr. Phil Show,"" The decision to seek professional help came after ""a lengthy one-on-one conversation with Dr. Phil,"" show spokeswoman Stacey Luchs said in a statement issued then. ""The decision was made due in part to Williams' strange behavior over the past several days, which culminated in a physical altercation with one of his daughters at a Hollywood hotel,"" the January 12 statement said. ""He was briefly detained by police and later released."" ""We certainly hope that he continues his commitment to sobriety, and we will continue to help and support him in any way that we can,"" McGraw said Monday.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former Manson family member Susan Atkins has requested a ""compassionate release"" from prison because she has less than six months to live, a California prisons spokeswoman said Friday. Susan Atkins, Califorina's longest-serving female inmate, is shown in her most recent mug shot. Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others. She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California. But Atkins, the state's longest- serving female inmate, has been hospitalized since March 18 and is listed in serious condition, state corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton said. Because of privacy laws, Thornton would not disclose the nature of Atkins' illness. Atkins' husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, was quoted as saying she has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday, citing sources close to the case. The compassionate release request has been approved by the prison, which conducted an evaluation, and is under corrections department review, Thornton said. If the department approves, the Board of Parole Hearings and the sentencing court in Los Angeles also must sign off on the request. There is no timeline for a decision to be made, Thornton said. Atkins, known within the Manson family as ""Sadie Mae Glutz,"" has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times. According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8½ months pregnant, and scawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski. ""I don't want to seem like a heartless creature, but in all my years, I never considered this could happen,"" Debra Tate, the actress' sister, told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. ""She showed no compassion. She told my sister as she slit her throat that she didn't (care) for her or her unborn baby,"" Tate added. Sharon Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home. A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed. The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles. All of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. Atkins, like Manson, received a death sentence, and the punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconsitutional in 1972. Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Atkins, told the Los Angeles Times that she ""has paid substantially, though not completely, for her horrendous crimes. Paying completely would mean imposing the death penalty."" But, he told the paper, given her terminal illness, ""I don't have an objection to her being released."" According to her Web site, Atkins is a born-again Christian who during her incarceration has worked to aid at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children. Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there. Nothing was found, police said.","Susan Atkins seeks ""compassionate release"" from prison .

"(CNN) -- A few weeks into the fall TV season, and already one show is down for the count. The cast from ""Quarterlife"" played young, artsy 20-somethings on the incredibly short-lived show. But let's look on the bright side. ""The Beautiful Life"" got at least two episodes in before the CW gave it the ax, spared from that TV-land rarity: the single episode show. Although the jury's still out on which series will last to see this year's November sweeps, none of them (as their developers are certainly thankful about) can be lumped in with the truly cringe-worthy and sadly uninteresting one-episode wonders. Here are some of the shows that saw the light of your television screen for just a single episode. 1. Known as the show that started the idea of the quick hook, CBS's 1961 live celebrity game show ""You're in the Picture"" was hosted by Jackie Gleason. The grand idea was to invite celebrities on and ask them to stick their heads into a painted scene and guess which one it is. It was so dismal, Gleason spent a half-hour the following week apologizing for letting the show air, and it was then replaced with ""The Jackie Gleason Show."" 2. There were a few shows pushing buttons in the tumultuous time of the 1960s, but the producers of the late-'60s sketch comedy show ""Laugh In"" thought the envelope hadn't been pushed quite enough.""Turn On,"" a similar comedy show, hit ABC's airwaves in February 1969 and was so controversial, it was turned off after just one episode. 3. Networks have capitalized on popular movie trends for decades (looking at you, ""Vampire Diaries""), and 1979's ""Co-ed Fever"" was no different. Attempting to ride the popularity of ""Animal House,"" this half-hour show asked the question, ""What happens when all-female Baxter College goes co-ed?"" Answer? CBS cancels it. 4. Americans are finicky about their cop shows, as Steven Bochco, the man who brought us ""NYPD Blue"" and ""L.A. Law,"" knows all too well. Some of them spark enough spinoffs to keep a show alive throughout generations, and others, like 1996's ""Public Morals,"" a sitcom about the humorous antics of the NYPD, just spark hate. One-hit wonders: 3; CBS: 0. 5. In 1997, Fox unveiled ""Lawless,"" an action series featuring NFL star Brian Bosworth as a detective. After the pilot episode, ""Lawless"" was outlawed, although Bosworth did go on to act again. 6. Right in the middle of the dot-com bubble, ABC tried to stake its claim with ""Dot Comedy"" in 2000, a sort of online version of ""America's Funniest Home Videos."" ""Dot Comedy"" was also like a premonition for the Internet bubble that was about to burst: it went belly-up after the pilot. 7. Not to be confused with a ""Maury"" episode, 2005's ""Who's Your Daddy?"" was a Fox reality series-turned-reality ""special"" about a woman who was adopted at birth, trying to pick out her birth father from a set of eight men, with $100,000 riding on the line. Needless to say, that gem of a concept angered viewers and adoption advocates alike. 8. It's true that there isn't much reality television fans won't watch, but CBS's 2005 series ""The Will"" was one of them. It featured a cast of 10 fame-seekers all angling to get in a wealthy 73-year-old man's will. The show died before the money-grubbers could craft a eulogy. 9. Heather Graham may be known for a few things, but pulling off a ""Sex and the City""-esque series isn't one of them. ""Emily's Reasons Why Not,"" 2006's show about a book publishing career woman with the requisite gay guy sidekick, was just no replacement for HBO's Manolo-ed foursome. That doesn't mean ABC stopped trying, though: ""Cashmere Mafia"" rolled out in 2008, only to meet a similar fate as Graham's bomb of a sitcom. 10. Next on the ""so bad it shouldn't have aired"" reality show train is ""Anchorwoman,"" a 2007 show about model Lauren Jones becoming an anchor for a small-town Texas station. If you don't remember it, it's because you were among the millions and millions of viewers Fox was hoping would tune in, and didn't. 11. Who knows what did in CBS's 2008 ""Secret Talents of the Stars."" Maybe it was the thought of watching not one but two boxers perform musical acts? (Joe Frazier was slated to sing R&B, and Roy Jones Jr. would have wooed the audience with his rapping.) We watch them dance awkwardly and duke it out in isolated jungles but, apparently, we don't care what ""secret talents"" celebrities are holding close to the vest. 12. As if being 25 isn't depressing enough. ""Quarterlife,"" NBC's 2008 attempt to take a Web-based show and turn it into a small-screen drama, failed miserably despite its online popularity. The show, focused on a group of 20-somethings trying to make their way through life and the digital age, earned some of the worst ratings NBC had seen in years. The rest of the season's episodes were exiled to Bravo.","The CW canceled ""The Beautiful Life"" last week after just two episodes .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian investigators on Saturday picked through the remains of a burned-out nightclub and detained at least five people in the aftermath of an explosive inferno, the result of an alleged misuse of fireworks that claimed more than 100 lives. Friday night's fire -- in the Ural Mountain area industrial city of Perm -- swept through a party in full swing at the Lame Horse, a local nightclub celebrating its eighth year in business. The blast and fire engulfed the club, law enforcement officials said, as a performance artist juggled cold-flame pyrotechnical maces. As he threw them high in the air, the club's ceiling caught fire and almost immediately spread on to the wooden walls, cutting off exits. People succumbed to smoke inhalation or were trampled attempting to escape the panicky chaos. The latest death reports varied, with one count as high as 109. Around 130 people were injured, authorities said, with dozens were in critical condition and many of them hooked up to artificial lung ventilators. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office said several people have been detained: two club co-owners, a club manager, the night club art director, and a businessman who provided the fireworks and is now suffering from burns at a hospital. ""A lot of people were lying on the floor of the club,"" according to one young female witness. ""Those of them who breathed were carried out and put in cars. The biggest problem was that each ambulance took only one person. They didn't take any more. We were yelling at doctors, forcing them to take more people at once."" Igor Goncharov, a Perm municipal official, said city workers were helping distraught relatives, who wanted to know the fate of their loved ones. ""We work with the victims' relatives here. We give them the information about people who are in hospitals and those who were found dead and recognized by the forensic bureau,"" Goncharov said. Shocked residents placed flowers outside the burned club in memory of the victims, a scene that brought back memories of two other Russian deadly club fires -- one in Moscow in 2007 and the other in Omsk in 2008. The tragedy startled Russians, reeling after last week's derailment of a luxury express train from Moscow to St. Petersburg. That incident -- which killed 26 people and injured more than 100 others -- has been called a terror attack, the most lethal terrorist act outside of Russia's troubled North Caucasus region since 2004. But this latest nightclub accident, in the Russian heartland around 900 miles east of Moscow, is believed to have been caused by what one Russian official says was the ""unsanctioned use of pyrotechnical devices."" ""The breach of technology while setting off a firework was the cause of the accident,"" said Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office. ""It was not a terrorist act."" In a televised address from his country residence near Moscow, President Dmitry Medvedev demanded that those responsible for the accident get the harshest possible punishment. He sent government officials to Perm to handle the aftermath of the accident, organize medical assistance to survivors and investigate. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dispatched two planes from Moscow equipped to carry people with extensive burns. CNN's Max Tkachenko in Moscow and Luis Graham-Yooll in Perm contributed to this report .","At least five people detained in relation to fire that engulfed Russian nightclub .

"ROME (CNN) -- Seven people went on trial for manslaughter Tuesday in Italy, accused of failing to predict an earthquake that killed more than 300 people in L'Aquila in April 2009. The seven -- six scientists from the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology and a member of the Civil Protection Agency -- were members of a governmental panel that prosecutors accuse of giving a ""rough, generic and ineffective assessment of the seismic risk."" The seven, members of a so-called ""major risks"" panel, published ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers of seismic activity undermining the protection of the population,"" prosecutors said. The first hearing Tuesday morning in L'Aquila's tribunal was devoted to technical matters and claims by injured parties. The city of L'Aquila has requested 50 million euros ($68 million) in compensation. Only one defendant was in court, the vice president of the panel, Bernardo De Bernardinis. ""I thought it was important to be here, not only because this is my turf but also to underline the professionalism ... of the other public officers,"" De Bernardinis told reporters. The trial has attracted the attention of the scientific world. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) wrote to Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano in June last year to express ""concern"" over the indictment of its Italian colleagues. ""The charges against these scientists are both unfair and naive,"" the letter said. The basis of the indictments appears to be that the scientists failed to alert the population of L'Aquila of an impending earthquake. However, the letter continues, ""there is no way they could have done that credibly."" Lawyer Marcello Melandri is defending Enzo Boschi, who was president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology at the time of the quake. Melandri denies that it's a trial against science, saying: ""Professor Boschi simply said that the earthquake is unpredictable, that it could or it could not happen."" The Civil Protection Agency had organized a meeting of the major risks panel in L'Aquila on March 31, 2009, amid concern among the city's residents over ongoing seismic activity. After that meeting some members of the commission made reassuring statements to the press. In particular De Bernardinis said in an interview with a local TV station that the scientific community was ""reassuring"" him, and that the numerous tremors were in some ways a good thing, as they released seismic energy. The interview concluded with a joke. ""Meanwhile, let's go and have a glass of wine,"" the journalist said. ""Absolutely!"" De Bernardinis replied. Six days later, the magnitude-6.3 quake hit the city and surrounding areas, causing wide destruction and loss of life. Eugenio Carlomagno is among the citizens of L'Aquila to feel let down by the panel. ""There are big responsibilities that this trial has to establish. No one alerted us, there were no evacuation plans that could have saved lives,"" he told CNN. ""It's not a matter of drinking a glass of wine, it's a matter of respecting rules."" The next trial session was scheduled for October 1.","More than 300 people died in the April 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila .

"(CNN) -- Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona, once dubbed ""America's Sheriff,"" turned himself in Tuesday to a Colorado federal prison to begin serving his 5 1/2-year sentence for a witness tampering conviction. Carona, 55, will serve 66 months in a minimum-security facility called ""The Camp"" at the Englewood federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, said John Sell, a corrections spokesman. The prison is 15 miles southwest of Denver. Carona will have to serve at least 85% of his sentence, spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Central District of California told CNN. Carona was sentenced in April 2009 in federal court in Santa Ana, California. He was convicted of trying to persuade a former assistant to lie to and withhold testimony from a federal grand jury investigating claims of corruption in Carona's campaign and his administration, according to a statement by Mrozek. Carona was also ordered to pay a fine of $125,000, according to Mrozek. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of a wide-ranging corruption scheme in which Carona used illegal campaign contributions and personally accepted cash bribes, Mrozek's statement said. According to the U.S. attorney's office's press release, U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Guilford sentenced Carona and called witness tampering ""a very serious offense."" The judge added that ""lying will not be tolerated in this courtroom, especially by law enforcement, especially by the highest-ranking law enforcement official in the county,"" according to the prosecutors' statement. During the trial, prosecutors said they presented evidence of a secretly recorded meeting in August 2007 in which Carona tried to persuade former Assistant Sheriff Don Haidl to lie to a grand jury that Carona thought had subpoenaed Haidl, according to Mrozek. In papers filed with the court before the 2009 sentencing, prosecutors charged that Carona received or solicited cash and other items of value worth at least $432,144, according to Mrozek's statement. The FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation into Carona. California news outlets have referred to Carona as ""America's Sheriff"" and have credited former CNN host Larry King with the nickname. In 2002, then-Sheriff Carona appeared on ""Larry King Live"" because he caught the kidnapper and killer of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion, whom Carona dubbed ""America's Little Girl."" King called Carona and the girl's mother, both guests, ""genuine American heroes and heroines,"" according to a CNN transcript.","Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The wrath of Typhoon Morakot has affected nearly 9 million people across four coastal China provinces and killed dozens in Taiwan, officials said Tuesday. A rescue worker carries a child on Tuesday who survived flooding in southern Taiwan. The typhoon, which stormed through the Philippines and Taiwan before slamming into eastern China over the weekend, has forced more than 1.4 million people to relocate on the mainland, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said. At least six people -- four of them in Zhejiang province -- were killed along the coast, and more than 6,000 homes were destroyed. In Taiwan, Morakot was blamed for at least 38 deaths, 35 injuries and 62 missing people, said Yu-Chu Liang, a senior official with Taiwan's National Disasters Prevention and Protection Commission. The village of Siaolin was one of several engulfed by flooding and mudslides in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County over the weekend, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported. Villagers rescued from a massive mudslide in Siaolin said at least 300 others were feared trapped beneath debris, state-run media reported Tuesday. Liang couldn't confirm that figure, but said officials thought that more than 100 people were buried alive. Helicopters plucked more than 60 survivors from Siaolin and headed back for 150 more people still struggling through the debris, he said. The mudslide buried roadways and cut water and electric supplies, Liang added. Morakot caused the worst flooding in decades in Taiwan -- where floodwaters as high as 7 feet were reported, China Daily said. The village of Siaolin was just one of several engulfed by flooding and mudslides in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County since Morakot arrived over the weekend, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported. ""The most pressing needs now are providing shelter, food and clean water for those who have had to evacuate their homes,"" said Hank Du, executive director for the humanitarian group World Vision in Taiwan. ""We also want to make sure the children are secure and have a safe place where they are cared for."" The group has started to distribute food, cleaning supplies, raincoats, flashlights and other supplies to those displaced in several Taiwanese communities. ""Many of the affected live in remote areas, and the roads are in bad condition. Highways and bridges are flooded and blocked by mudslides, fallen trees and other large debris,"" said Wesley Chen of World Vision. ""For those who can't reach shelters, we are working to find ways to bring aid to them."" Morakot-linked mudslides also have spilled into provincial eastern China, crushing homes and burying people in their path. In one coastal town, a massive mudslide crushed a half-dozen buildings and buried an unknown number of people, the Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday. The mudslide occurred about 10:30 p.m. Monday in Pengxi township in Zhejiang province -- one of eastern China's regions hardest hit by Morakot, Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. The incident destroyed four-story apartment buildings standing at the foot of a mountain. Rescuers pulled six survivors from the debris; one was in critical condition, according to Xinhua. However, it wasn't clear how many others were buried, and rescuers were hindered by huge piles of mud and rock. The storm made landfall in the coastal area of Beibi town, Xiapu county, in Fujian province, about 4:20 p.m. Sunday (4:20 a.m. Sunday ET), according to Xinhua. Morakot's winds were clocked at 118 kilometers per hour (73 mph) in its eye, according to the province's meteorological bureau.","NEW: Dozens dead, even more missing in Taiwan from storm-caused flooding .

""There's no doubt in my mind that lifted up her spirits."" The congresswoman, who will be moved to a rehabilitation center in Texas later this week, had worries about her safety long before she was critically wounded by a gunman at a public event this month, her husband said on Tuesday. ""We've discussed it a number of times,"" Mark Kelly told KVOA. ""She felt that that was a possibility, pretty much exactly what had happened ... there have been threats against her and other members of Congress."" Giffords was hosting a constituents' meeting outside a supermarket in Tucson when a gunman opened fire. Six people, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, were killed and 13 others wounded. Giffords was shot in the head. In an e-mail sent to friends and family members Tuesday and obtained by CNN, Giffords' mother, Gloria, writes that she will be moved from Tucson's University Medical Center to rehabilitation facilities in Houston on Friday. ""There is a team of medical specialists involved ... including military surgeons who specialize in bullet wounds to the head,"" the e-mail says. ""They want to start aggressive rehab immediately."" Giffords' office confirmed the move and said that while the move is expected to be Friday, ""the exact day of the move will depend on the congresswoman's health."" Her family chose TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston, part of the Texas Medical Center, because of its reputation, one of her doctors said. ""The congresswoman's family wants to ensure she receives the best rehabilitative care possible for her type of serious penetrating brain injury,"" said Dr. Michael Lemole. Kelly said that Memorial Hermann's proximity to Tucson was another factor in the decision. ""I am extremely hopeful at the signs of recovery that my wife has made since the shooting,"" he said. ""The team of doctors and nurses at UMC has stabilized her to the point of being ready to move to the rehabilitation phase. Their goal -- and our goal -- has been to provide Gabby with the best care possible."" Loughner is next set to appear in court on Monday in Phoenix. Richard Kastigar, chief investigator for the Pima County Sheriff's Department, said Wednesday authorities believe he showed his gun to a friend before the shooting, ""between Christmas and New Year's."" After the shooting, the friend told his father about the exchange, and the father contacted police, he said. He would not name the friend. Police have said Loughner bought the gun in November after passing a background check, and bought ammunition at a Walmart near his home hours before the shooting. Seven boxes of ammunition were found after the rampage in a black bag discovered in a dry river bed in Loughner's neighborhood. In addition, authorities said Wednesday that the gunman apparently fired 32 shots, one more than previously thought. A woman found a bullet casing in her purse several days later, Kastigar said. ""A woman who was around the shooting scene that day found the casing and reported it to police,"" he said. ""It fits right into our investigation. We always knew Loughner had one round in his chamber and 31 in the magazine."" Kastigar said he didn't know whether the woman attended the event at the Safeway, was a passerby or was coming out of the store at the time of the shooting. Gloria Giffords writes that her daughter shows improvement every day ""and shows higher levels of comprehension and complex actions. ""Yesterday, when Mark came back from speaking at her aide's memorial service, she reached up and untied his tie and undid the top button to his shirt,"" according to the e-mail. ""Last night, she took his iPod and scrolled through all the pictures. Early this morning she began to read cards made for her by some 4th graders! Her unbandaged eye tracked the lines, she opened the cards and turned them over reading the back. Mark's gotten pages of large print of Harry Potter's 1st book for her to hold and read."" The e-mail also says that Giffords gave her husband ""a 20-minute neck and back rub."" Giffords remains in serious condition. A second, unnamed victim is listed in good condition. Kelly told the affiliate the couple had been concerned about heated and divisive political debates, but despite the fears, Giffords' passion for public service was a priority. ""She was doing what she loved, she was representing the people of southern Arizona,"" Kelly said. ""She felt it was very important for them to have the opportunity to walk up to her and tell her what they think."" Kelly said the lawmaker will resume her public service ""stronger than ever"" as soon as she's well enough. He predicted she would return to the scene of the shooting. ""She loves southern Arizona more than anything,"" he told CNN affiliate KGUN. ""She's here every week, doing stuff like 'Congress on your Corner,' and I'm sure the first thing she's gonna do, when she's ready, is a 'Congress on your Corner' at that Safeway"" where the shooting occurred. The outpouring of support has been tremendous, Kelly said, including an elementary school student who sent his $2.85 in lunch money to Giffords with a card. ""I sealed it back up, and we're gonna give it back to him,"" Kelly said. ""It almost made me cry just standing there in the room, just to see the kid put his lunch money in the envelope for her.""' Gloria Giffords wrote in the e-mail that her daughter has hard work ahead of her. She has been moving her limbs on command, according to the e-mail, and doctors have had her sitting up in a chair. ""So now comes the 'true grit' part,"" she wrote, ""and (it) won't be a stroll in a park although Mark predicts she'll be up and walking around in 2 weeks. The physical and emotional therapy will proceed side by side and it'll be stringent."" Giffords has not been able to speak because of a breathing tube in her throat. Her mother wrote that Giffords will continue communicating more as she becomes more alert and will speak after the tube comes out. ""You notice I'm speaking in the present tense ... because that's where all your future prayers are going to come in,"" she wrote. The e-mail said Giffords' parents are ""humbled by the outpouring of love and prayers and overwhelmed with gratitude."" The hospital's front lawn and the perimeter of Giffords' Tucson office are ""illuminated by thousands of candles, get-well placards, hers and the other victims' photos, prayers, stuffed animals and people."" Surveillance video of the January 8 shooting shows Loughner walking up to Giffords and firing at her face from 24 to 36 inches away, Kastigar, told CNN. Kastigar said he viewed the surveillance video the day of the incident, and the hard drives have been turned over to the FBI. He said its contents have not been previously discussed for a variety of reasons, chief among them protecting the victims' families from the graphic details it contains. On the video, the suspect can be clearly seen walking around a table and up to Giffords, pointing a gun at her face and pulling the trigger. Giffords is barely in the frame of the video, he said. The gunman then turns to his left and walks out of the video, when witnesses said he began firing indiscriminately at others. U.S. District Judge John Roll can be seen on the video putting his arms over Giffords staffer Ron Barber and attempting to push him down and crawl under the table with him, Kastigar said. In trying to help Barber, Roll exposes his back to the gunman and is shot. Roll died; Barber was also shot, but survived. ""I have to detach my personal feelings"" about the video as an investigator, but the video offers investigators a way to sort out sometimes confusing or conflicting witness statements about what took place, Kastigar said. It also clarified that the gunman's intended target was Giffords, as it made clear that he walked up and fired the first round at her, Kastigar said. A law enforcement official said federal and local authorities have conducted more than 300 interviews as part of the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Jackie Alpers, a photographer from Tucson, Arizona, has documented food at her local county fair for the past couple of years. ""My favorite fair food has elements of the unexpected,"" she said. ""It's bigger and weirder than the food I see every day, and it evokes awe... the more absurd the better."" Alpers, who tries mostly everything she photographs, drew the line when she snapped a picture of Super Fries -- french fries covered in pinto beans, chile sauce and cheese. ""It looked like they weighed about two pounds and that there was enough for a family of four to share,"" she said. ""I'd say there was more saturated fat on that plate than I care to imagine."" But fat and calories aren't enough to stop many fair-goers from indulging in such creations once a year, even when healthy options are available. Fair foods can be enjoyed in moderation, says Dr. Donald Hensrud, who specializes in nutrition and preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic. ""Instead of kind of throwing caution to the wind ... it's still possible to enjoy yourself and enjoy some good tastes, yet stay reasonably on track."" For that, Hensrud offered some suggestions: . Before you go . Devise a plan ahead of time. ""Put a little thought into it -- what kinds of foods do you want to try? How much do you want to eat?"" he said. ""Just have a general plan instead of going in and just eating everything in sight or the first thing that you see."" A workout and a healthy meal can help you resist temptation later. ""If you don't eat anything in the morning, you might get there and be ravenous ... that can lead to overeating,"" Hensrud said. The deep-fried belly of the fair food beast . During the fair . Splitting food with family or friends allows smaller tastes of multiple things. In addition, you can satisfy yourself by having a little bit of food when you get to the fair, Hensrud suggested. He said it's best to stop eating before you're full. ""You'll be glad that you did later on,"" he says. Remember to use some common sense. Limit portion sizes of fatty or fried foods. He also recommended using your time at the fair to get in a great walk, helping to burn off some of those calories. Finally, don't forget that liquid calories add up. Stay well-hydrated with water. Following the fair . Indulging once a year ""isn't going to cause a huge amount of problems,"" Hensrud said. ""We can recover from that relatively easily."" ""People should forgive themselves and move on... and not throw in the towel completely if they do overindulge."" Hensrud advised fair-goers to focus their attention elsewhere, instead of solely on the food. Typically, people can take in an abundance of sights and sounds from arts and crafts, scale-tipping pumpkins, livestock and live entertainment. For Alpers, there is always something new to see -- and taste -- every year. She is looking forward to documenting next year's fair. ""Everyone has their own trigger and the fair is a perfect excuse to pull it,"" she said. ""The look of excitement on their face is unmistakable, and similar to the look I see in line for the roller coaster or the freak show.""

"(CNN) -- The Coast Guard said Tuesday that its crews and other agencies have suspended the search for three children a woman claims she threw off a bridge into the Delaware River overnight. Delaware River Port Authority officials said there was ""no evidence"" to support the woman's claim, the Cherry Hill New Jersey Courier-Post reported. ""We have no evidence of any activity of that type on our bridge during the hours in question,"" the Courier-Journal quoted authority spokesman Ed Kasuba as saying. Kasuba added that the bridge is under constant surveillance. Authorities called off the search at 12:25 p.m. after searching 10 square miles for more than eight hours, the Coast Guard said. Crews from Coast Guard Station Philadelphia; Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey; Camden Police and Fire Departments; Delaware River Port Authority; New Jersey State Police; Philadelphia Fire and Rescue; and Philadelphia Marine Police aided in the search, a Coast Guard statement said. They focused on an area of the Delaware River near the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the Coast Guard said, which connects Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia. A nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, called the Coast Guard just before 4 a.m. to say a woman told her she had given birth about 3:35 a.m. and threw her baby into the river, a Coast Guard statement said. The woman told another nurse that she threw her 2-year-old and 4-year-old children from a bridge into the water, the statement said. Kasuba told the Courier-Post the bridge's walkways are closed overnight. If the woman had driven a car and stopped on the bridge, Kasuba said, she would have had to cross over the PATCO High Speed Line rail on the bridge to get to the walkway. ""Somebody would have seen it,"" Kasuba was quoted as saying. The whereabouts of the woman, whom the Coast Guard identified as Michelle ""Shelly"" Perez, are unknown.","Agencies have suspended a search for children reported in Delaware River .

"(CNN) -- Put Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Nigel Godrich, drummer Joey Waronker, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea and percussionist Mauro Refosco into a studio for three days, and you know the sound coming out of that session is going to be otherworldly. The musicians seem to have created exactly that as the band, Atoms for Peace, is edging closer to the release of its debut album, ""AMOK,"" early next year. The move toward an album was an organic one, Yorke explains in an interview in Rolling Stone. The Radiohead singer-songwriter initially booked studio time for the group -- which was banded together to perform live songs from his 2006 album, ""The Eraser"" -- because of how great they sounded during rehearsal for the string of eight concerts held in 2010. They went into their recording session with nothing, Yorke says, and ended up coming out ""with a f*****g mountain."" Yorke and Godrich then edited that mountain, combining it with other laptop and studio work they'd done until it turned into a nine-track album. Yorke and Godrich agree that their intent on ""AMOK"" was to ""step into the unknown,"" as Godrich put it. ""One of the things we were most excited about,"" Yorke added, ""was ending up with a record where you weren't quite sure where the human starts and the machine ends."" The method to creating that kind of ambiguity was its own ""form of madness,"" Yorke recalled. ""We'd go in at midday and pretty much work through to 10. We were playing all the time. It was bonkers. We'd stop to change beat. Joey and Mauro would scribe the beat out, using whatever weird notation they have, and then go off on it for another hour."" Yorke's role in the process was more of a conductor, he said, as he and Godrich would pipe up with approval or disapproval of the sound's direction. ""It was about trying to get interesting grooves,"" Yorke said. ""When we first hung out, we were at Flea's house. We got wasted, played pool and listened to Fela Kuti all night. It was that idea of trance-ing out. But there are still songs here."" Although he's tempted not to, Yorke couldn't help but remark that he ""really want(s) to say, 'This is the beginning of something.' "" Besides, ""this was after three days in that studio. God help us if we'd had a week."" Will Atoms for Peace head out on tour again after ""AMOK"" drops? ""I hope so,"" Yorke said.

"New York (CNN) -- A woman suspected of snatching an infant from a New York hospital in 1987 was in custody Sunday after surrendering to authorities in Connecticut and will face federal kidnapping charges, authorities said. Ann Pettway turned herself in to the FBI office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Sunday morning, FBI spokesman William Reiner said. She is expected to appear Monday in a New York federal court to face federal kidnapping charges, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. A law enforcement source previously told CNN that Pettway contacted a Bridgeport police officer via Facebook from Stratford, Connecticut. Reiner and Bridgeport police spokesman Detective Keith Bryant would not comment on that report. Reiner also would not comment on whether Pettway was cooperating with police. A warrant had been issued Friday in North Carolina for Pettway's arrest. She is suspected in the abduction of Carlina Renae White. After 23 years, White tracked down her real mother earlier this month, saying she had had a nagging feeling all her life that she was brought up by a family she didn't belong to. Earlier, Bryant told reporters that Pettway was spotted at a pawnshop in Bridgeport on Saturday She was seen at Joe David Pawnbroker at about noon, asking about pawning jewelry, he said. A store employee called police after recognizing the woman from news reports, Bryant said. ""By the time our officers arrived, she was gone. They canvassed the area and didn't find her."" Authorities used surveillance video from the store to confirm the woman was Pettway. ""Based on that video and what we have in the database, it's her,"" he said. ""They're 100% sure."" The North Carolina warrant sought Pettway's arrest for allegedly violating her two-year probation sentence on attempted embezzlement charges, said North Carolina Department of Corrections spokeswoman Pamela Walker. As part of her probation, she would have had to get permission to leave North Carolina, Walker said. Pettway had not gotten such permission, Walker said. White's mother, Joy White, told the New York Post last week that she last saw her daughter when she was 19 days old. She took her to a Harlem hospital on August 4, 1987, because the baby had a high fever, a New York police official said. Carlina was admitted to the hospital, and her mother went home to rest. When she returned, the baby was gone. ""That was a big part of my heart that was just ripped apart,"" Carlina White's biological father, Carl Tyson, told the Post regarding her disappearance. Carlina White told the Post that Pettway raised her. Pettway was pregnant in 1987, she said, but lost the baby. Carlina White was raised under a different name, but always felt she did not belong to the family, said Ernie Allen, president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Her suspicions grew after the woman who raised her could not produce a birth certificate for her. ""I just started typing in Yahoo and Google different articles -- anything that pulled up in 1987 with any child that went missing -- and I came across the article, and the baby picture just struck me because ... it looked like my daughter,"" Carlina White, who has a 5-year-old daughter, told the Post. On January 4, Joy White's phone rang. The woman on the other end said she was Carlina, and sent a picture taken in 1987 in which she bore a striking resemblance to a baby picture Joy White had held on to. A DNA test proved the link. The family has since been joyously reunited. ""This is what I wanted ever since I found out that lady wasn't my biological mother,"" Carlina White told the Post. ""I just hope that the officials will be able to get her in their hands so we could just hear her side of the story now."" Her biological family, meanwhile, wants justice. ""I want her to go to jail ... for what she did and what she did to my family,"" said Lisa White-Heatley, Joy White's sister. ""She destroyed my family.""

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Pilot error caused the crash of a U.N. helicopter in March which killed 10 people, a Nepalese investigating official said Wednesday. A U.N. worker at the site of the March helicopter crash that killed 10 people in Nepal. The helicopter was traveling from a camp for former Maoist rebels in eastern Nepal to the capital, Kathmandu, when it crashed on March 3. The crew did not consult the weather forecast, nor did it plan a route before taking off, said Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, the joint secretary of the civil aviation ministry and part of the investigation commission. Once the helicopter encountered bad weather, the pilot's unfamiliarity of local terrain compounded the problem, Ghimire said, summarizing the commission's findings. ""He thought that, 'If I climb into the clouds, I will be safe above the terrain and continue to Kathmandu,'"" he said. Instead, the crew found itself unable to control the aircraft. But the pilot kept the helicopter on auto-pilot mode. ""The pilot should have manually handled the aircraft to rotate safely to the ground,"" Ghimire said. ""Unfortunately, he didn't."" The chopper crashed in a mountainous region near Bhawasa, about 145 km (90 miles) east of Kathmandu. The U.N. mission said three victims were Nepalese citizens. The others included four international arms monitors from Gambia, Indonesia, South Korea and Sweden. The air crew, from a Russian company, comprised of two Russians and one Belarussian, the U.N. mission said. The helicopter was returning from inspecting a camp for former Maoist rebels who fought a 10-year civil war to end Nepal's monarchy. More than 13,0000 people died in the fighting. The rebels signed a peace deal with the government in 2006, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly. The victory transformed Nepal from a monarchy to a republic after 239 years of autocratic rule.","Pilot error caused U.N. helicopter crash killing 10 people, probe finds .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- On Tuesday, the United States votes to elect its next president. For Americans, the choice is about which candidate will improve the economy, healthcare, the employment rate and ensure better living standards. However, for Pakistani citizens living in the country's northwest, especially for the 800,000 people in the tribal region of Waziristan, the American election is a question of life and death. Malik Jalal Khan lives in Datta Khel, a small town in North Waziristan, and is an elder of the Mada Khel tribe. He told me that more than 200 people from his tribe have been killed through the CIA-run clandestine drone program in the last seven years. Thanks to Pakistani local channels which translated all three presidential debates into Urdu, Malik Jalal has paid close attention to every word uttered by President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney. Just like these candidates, Malik Jalal is also responsible for the wellbeing of his people. He has to ensure that his tribe's young have stable jobs, children can go to school and sick people are treated in the best possible way. Malik Jalal listened very carefully when Obama said he would further strengthen health care, improve employment, raise taxes on the rich and improve public education. Such promises were doubled by Romney, who said that he would do even better if elected president. This was all good news for Americans voting in the elections. But when it came to matters concerning Malik Jalal and his tribe's people, there was no good news. Both Obama and Romney promised to continue with drone warfare that has targeted northwest Pakistan if elected. This means that Malik Jalal still has to live with the fear that any of his tribe's women, children or men like him are all potential targets, as reports suggest the CIA considers every male of able military age a potential terrorist in North Waziristan . It means his 9-year-old will still not go to school due to fear that his school might be targeted by a drone. It means people will still not attend funerals, have large weddings or conduct their fruit export or mining businesses openly. Drone strikes started under President George Bush but were escalated in real sense by President Obama since he took office in 2009. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, more than 3,300 people have been killed in more than 350 drone strikes during the last nine years. So far, according to our estimates, these strikes have only killed 41 of the Al Qaeda-linked individuals who were meant to be the real targets of the drone program. No names are known of all the others killed, and the CIA expects Americans to accept their word that everyone killed in a drone strike is a terrorist posing an imminent threat to the United States of America. In a recent conversation with an American diplomat in Islamabad, I was astonished when he said to me that civilian deaths number only in two digits, according to their records. I was further shocked when I asked him if he knows about independent sources that report on civilian deaths such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, or the recent report compiled by Stanford and New York universities. The diplomat looked completely lost. Why do American presidents love drone technology? The obvious answer lies in American politics. Any president at war cannot afford large numbers of American soldiers coming back in coffins. But the U.S. would like to keep its hegemony, and drone technology makes this dream a reality. Now the U.S. can wage war anywhere in world without putting American troops on ground, and the resulting loss of political capital. Drone warfare is also keeping the very strong American defense lobby happy and busy with new technology. But Malik Jalal tells me this does not work for him, his people and certainly not for peace in the region. Policies like drone attacks, extrajudicial murders committed by a state, and covert programs like rendition and secret prisons in timid allied states not only kill people -- they decimate any hope for peace. These killings help extremists recruit more discontented youth. A person in tribal society who has lost his family members in this manner is bound by the Pashtun honor code -- Pashtunwali -- to retaliate and opt for ""badal"" (revenge or justice). There is growing anti-American sentiment in regions affected by drone attacks and some people are tempted to resort to illegal means when the system does not deliver justice to them. This discontent is spreading among Muslims. Pakistani-born US citizen Faisal Shahzad is one example of this as he cited drones as one reason for his failed attempt to car bomb New York's Times Square. Malik Jalal worries when he listens to war-mongering presidential candidates and wonders if he ever will be successful in preaching peace to his kinsmen if the opponent has only contempt, and a message of death for his people. Malik Jalal wishes that Waziris were also able to vote in American elections.","Obama and Romney both say they will continue the CIA-run drone program .
According to one report, the program has killed more than 3300 people in nine years .
The attacks are breeding resentment against America, says Akbar ."
"(CNN) -- Long, slow-moving lines stretched around polling stations across New York City a week after Superstorm Sandy's fury threatened to keep many citizens from voting. ""It's inspiring to see so many people up and out to vote already,"" said one woman at a makeshift polling station in Brooklyn established to replace regular precinct locations made unusable by storm damage. While inspiring to some, the long wait to cast a ballot was frustrating for others. Cold intensifies misery for Sandy victims . Gov. Andrew Cuomo's last-minute decree that any voter could vote at any precinct, intended to help those displaced by Sandy, made it ""a little insane right now"" at the polling station at Public School 41 in Greenwich Village, a poll coordinator there told CNN Tuesday afternoon. ""So we have everybody coming in from everywhere,"" said the coordinator, a Republican who asked not to be named. ""It was for displaced people, but others are taking advantage of it."" The affidavit ballots these people cast take longer to process, she said. Technology changes voting process . Another reason for slower voting is that the city adopted a new system of machines that scan paper ballots, replacing the levers of the old-style voting machines, she said. Voters must stand in two lines now: One for filling out the ballot and a second for scanning it. ""Today is an interesting day,"" New York City Elections Commissioner J.C. Polanco said. In some cases, three or four voting sites were consolidated into one location because of Sandy damage, Polanco said. That means 3,000 or 4,000 voters potentially standing in the line instead of just 1,000, he said. Heavy turnout reported . ""We'd ask the patience and tolerance of New Yorkers,"" Cuomo said during an afternoon news conference. ""This is a critical election. I believe this country, this state, has many important issues it's facing. Whatever your preference today, please vote and exercise your right."" The New York City Board of Elections temporarily relocated or combined some polling locations serving 143,000 voters across all five boroughs because of damage from Sandy. Long lines, sporadic snags . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said late deliveries of polling equipment occurred in some areas and at least one site did not have enough gas to keep electric generators going. ""I know many people are encountering long lines at the polls,"" he said. ""Be patient. It's part of the process."" At one temporary polling station inside a Brooklyn school, which was also used as a shelter for residents displaced by last week's storm, one man said the long line was too much for him Tuesday morning. ""I've got time in the afternoon, but right now I don't,"" he told CNN. ""But I'll be back to make the wait."" Voters in some New York counties could get an extra day to cast ballots if disruptions caused by Sandy prevent enough citizens from showing up at the polls, a state official said Sunday. Opinion: Rethinking grid dependence . County election officials could ask the state Board of Elections to allow polling places to reopen for another day if Tuesday's turnout is less than 25%, according to board spokesman Thomas Connolly. The state board would consider the request and, if approved, a second day of voting would be scheduled within 20 days of Tuesday, he said. Polls would be open for 11 hours on the second day, with only those who were eligible to vote on Tuesday allowed to cast ballots. How to help victims of Sandy .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a powerful earthquake that hit Myanmar has gone up to 75, state media reported Friday. At least 111 people were injured, Myanmar Radio reported. The 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Thursday near its borders with China, Thailand and Laos, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was a relatively shallow quake, which can be very destructive. The Geological Survey  said the quake was 6 miles (10 km) deep, putting it fairly close to the surface. Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has been badly hit by natural disasters in the past few years. A powerful cyclone in 2008 left an estimated 100,000 people dead and another one two years later left 70,000 people homeless, the United Nations said. The quake was significantly less powerful than the one that hit Japan two weeks ago, causing a tsunami and prompting fears of a nuclear meltdown.  The series of disasters in Japan has left more than 10,000 people dead. The Myanmar quake was roughly comparable in magnitude and depth to last year's Haiti earthquake, which measured 7.0. More than 200,000 people died in the Haiti earthquake, and millions were affected. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report .","At least 75 people are killed .
