"Detectives have released images of two suspects wanted after £8million worth of oil was stolen from underneath Nick Clegg's country estate. More than 1.4million gallons of fuel were siphoned from an Esso pipeline that runs beneath the Deputy Prime Minister's Chevening House estate in Sevenoaks, Kent. It is believed that nearly 300,000 litres a day were stolen from the pipe using what police have described as 'highly specialised and dangerous techniques'. Suspects: Police want to speak to these two men after £8million of oil was stolen from a pipeline in Kent . Investigations have already led to the arrests of nine people in relation to the sophisticated crime, but Kent Police are appealing for people to come forward if they recognise the two men pictured. The crime was uncovered in August beneath Mr Clegg's grace and favour estate, which he gets rent free due to his Government position. Det Con Angela Holder said: 'We are asking anyone who may recognise these men to get in touch. 'We believe they can help with our inquiries in what continues to be a major and widespread investigation into the theft of fuel from underground pipelines. Detectives have released images of two suspects wanted after £8million worth of oil was stolen from underneath Nick Clegg's country estate . 'These incidents have occurred in a number of regions across the UK, whereby highly specialised and dangerous techniques will have been required to siphon fuel from pipelines which operate at very high pressure.' The theft took place beneath Chevening House, the grace and favour home of Nick Clegg near Sevenoaks . The pipeline targeted by the criminal gang passes directly beneath the Deputy Prime Minister's estate . In response to the theft, Esso has stepped up its security along the pipeline. A spokesman for the oil firm said: 'The section of pipeline was temporarily shut down to make repairs, which have now been completed. There has been no impact on supplies to customers. 'We strongly condemn the highly dangerous criminal action by those involved and are working closely with the police in their criminal investigations.'","Thieves siphoned off more than a million gallons of oil from pipeline .

"Twit twoo, who's a pretty boy then! Two owls roosting in Cape Coral, Florida, appear to be having a hoot as they get to grips with a GoPro camera. Photographs show the bright-eyed birds posing in front of the lens, cracking semi-grins with their beaks open. Wildlife photographer Megan Lorenz, 39, put the GoPro out on a patch of grass in a bid to film the animals and was charmed by their reactions.

The feathered friends are burrowing owls which measure just 11 inches long and are native to North and South America. They get their name from the fact that they roost in burrows on the ground. Lorenz, who is based in Toronto, Ontario, has followed colonies of burrowing owls in Florida, for the past few years. She concluded: 'I love photos that show a link between people, animals and their environment and I'm very happy that I had such a curious owlet to photograph this year. 'When I take photos that I look back on years later and they make me laugh . . . that's when I know I have a winner. If they make me laugh, I hope that others have the same reaction.'

"A violent boyfriend high on a cocktail of alcohol, cocaine and cannabis, stabbed his mistress to death after she found his £1,500  gambling winnings and threatened to spend it on their love child. Andre Bright, 30, stabbed Victoria Adams, 22, in the chest and in the stomach in Oldham, Greater Manchester, on December 8 last year, leaving her with a wound so deep it reached her kidney. As police arrived  to arrest Bright they found him watching Miss Adams bleed to death on her hallway carpet while she begged for her baby daughter, who was asleep upstairs. When he refused to go with police an officer shot him with a 50,000 volt Taser. He didn't move, and after the officer threatened to shoot him again he sneered: 'I enjoyed that. You need more volts.' Andre Bright, 30, sentenced to 17 years in jail for the murder of Victoria Adams, 22. When police went to arrest Bright in Oldham, Greater Manchester, last year they found him watching as Miss Adams bled to death . Bright was convicted at 14 after shooting him in the face with a BB gun. He also stabbed a man in a bar fight, beat a pregnant ex-girlfriend, and attacked a bouncer with an Afro pick after trying to urinate on him . Today Bright was jailed for 17 years after being found guilty of murder and assault at Manchester Crown Court. He shrugged as the unanimous verdict was read out, while friends and relatives of the victim wept, screamed and cheered in the public gallery. Bright had a long history of violence stretching back to when he was just 14. He was arrested after he shot a man in the face with a BB gun, causing him to loose the sight in one of his eyes. He was also convicted of stabbing two men in a bar fight, leaving one with a perforated bowel, and of beating up a previous girlfriend while she was pregnant when she accused him of cheating. Police arrested him three months before the attack outside a nightclub with scissors in his pocket. Just hours before killing Miss Adams he was caught on CCTV trying to urinate on a bouncer, and when the man pushed him away he stabbed him repeatedly in the face with an Afro pick. Bright often bragged to friends that, on the estate where he lived, it was cool to carry a knife. Bright married in 2009 and had three children with his wife, but kept a string of secret girlfriends in tow, and had at least one other child with Miss Adams. She was a travel and tourism graduate who first met Bright when she was just 16, and the pair began a stormy six-year on-off relationship. The court heard that Bright never went out with Miss Adams as a couple, and instead used her flat as a place to crash whenever he was drunk or high on drugs. Mr Mark Kellet, prosecuting, said that Miss Adams found out she was pregnant with his child after taking a pregnancy test in January 2013, and sent him a text with the good news. Miss Adams met Bright when she was 16, beginning an abusive six-year relationship. Manchester Crown Court heard they never went anywhere as a couple, and Bright used her house to crash in while drunk or high . Bright married in 2009, and has three children with his wife, but in kept seeing Miss Adams, who fell pregnant in 2013. After telling him about the baby, Bright told her to delete his number and never call him again . But Bright was furious, telling her to delete his number and to never call him again. Three days before she was killed, on December 5, Miss Adams had a fight with Bright after she went out with friends for the first time since having her baby in August. Bright stormed to her house, and began calling his other girlfriends in front of her. When she told him to stop he spat on her, told her he would sleep with her friends, then threw a bottle at her. Mr Kellet said: 'She had run from the house fearing that Andre Bright would kill her.' She later turned up at a friend’s house crying, wearing a dressing gown and no shoes. She told Bright’s sister Michelle Dunkley that 'Andre’s conduct had become frightening' and when he turned up at the flat again she sent to a text message to Ms Dunkley saying: 'I don’t wanna stay here but he’s in such a bad way.' On the night of the murder Bright and a friend visited another house in the area, buying three bottles of wine along the way, before he returned to Miss Adams flat in a taxi at around 9.35am. She found a wad of cash in his pocket, and threatened to keep it 'given what little he had done for their daughter.' Just half an hour later Bright phoned police, saying: 'Can I have an ambulance please? Someone is dying in front of me. Someone has stabbed her, I don’t know what’s happened. She’s dying.' Pressed for more information on how the stabbing had happened, Bright became angry. When the call handler asked him for a third time he shouted 'shut up' and slammed the phone down. On the night of the murder Bright was four times over the drink-drive limit, and had taken cocaine and cannabis. During a row over his gambling winnings, he stabbed Miss Adams in the chest and stomach . Three days before the attack Miss Adams went out with friends for the first time since having the baby. Bright came to her house, called his other girlfriends in front of her, spat on her, and threw a bottle at her . When officers arrived they found Bright, who was three times over the drink drive limit, and high on cocaine and cannabis, standing with a ‘fixed, almost vacant gaze’, with his hands in his pockets. Only a short distance away, Miss Adams lay bleeding to dead in the doorway of her flat. Paramedics treating Miss Adams say they tried to ask her about what had happened, but every time she spoke it was to ask where her baby was. Fearing Bright was still holding the knife, an officer hit him with a Taser. He was warned that if he moved he would be hit again, and he said: 'I enjoyed that. You need more volts in your taser.' Mr Kellet said: 'A female officer states that as the defendant was being escorted out of the premises, he looked directly at her and smiled. 'The Crown say the defendant was doing as he did, seeking to intimidate police officers.' Miss Adams was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where doctors discovered a three inch deep stab wound to her chest, and a five inch wound to her abdomen which had penetrated her kidney. She bled to death several hours later, despite the efforts of surgeons to save her. Bright attempted to deny the crimes, saying Miss Adams had run into him while he was holding a knife, and that he had been in the middle of a psychotic episode and unable to control himself. Bright shrugged as he was sentenced today, while family and friends of Miss Adams cried, screamed and cheered in the public gallery . However, a jury swept his claims aside to deliver a unanimous guilty verdict today. Sentencing Bright, Mrs Justice Susan Carr said: 'You have a history of violent offending and show no remorse whatsoever for the victim’s family. 'You had a wife and three children and other girlfriends from time to time and it is clear you were using Victoria for sex. 'Whether your motive was the fact she had found and spent some of your money or you felt trapped in some way by the arrival of your child doesn’t matter. 'You have a propensity for violence and this was sheer violence. “I’m quite satisfied you intended to kill Victoria when you stabbed her. Victoria’s family and friends have attended every day of this trial. 'Mr Adams described in graphic terms the ordeal of the trial which has intensified their despair and anguish. He speaks with pride of a wonderful daughter who did well at school, went to college, was a hard-worker with a vibrant social life and many friends. 'She had everything to look forward to. He describes her as beautiful, intelligent, funny, happy and wonderful. So many people loved her and have had their hearts broken. “The pain he and his wife and feel is difficult to describe. He describes a total debilitating grief, an incredible sense of loss is with them all of the time and it has affected the lives of so many others. 'The pain her daughter will suffer, the guilt and sadness as she grows up. Her daughter has to live her life without her amazing mother.' Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Bright's relationship with Victoria had been described as volatile and his family members had noticed he had recently been drinking heavily and taking drugs. 'For reasons only known to Bright himself, he decided he would get a taxi to Miss Adam's house and stab her. 'Victoria had a young daughter and, tragically, she will grow up never really knowing who she was. 'Not only has Bright robbed her of her mum, he has also taken away a beloved daughter of Victoria's parents. 'They have been left truly devastated by what happened that morning and will never truly recover.'","Began dating Miss Adams in 2001 when he was 23 and she was 16 .

"The infamous hoarders' house - dubbed Australia's most squalid - is being sold by the NSW Sheriff's Office to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on clearing the mountains of rubbish collected on the property, it has been revealed. It has also emerged that whoever buys the free-standing home at 19 Boonara Avenue in Bondi, just a few hundred metres from the world famous beach - may also have to pay to evict the current owners, who have previously refused to clear up the junk or move out to allow council inspectors inside. Debt collectors, on behalf of Waverley Council, have arranged to sell the home - which remarkably could fetch at least $2 million in the hope of recovering the $180,000 the Bobolas family owes for the clean up costs. Scroll down for video . Liana Bobolas,  pictured here in April sitting beside her piles of trash, is one of three owners being forced to sell the squalid Bondi house . After amassing an enormous debt to the local council, the notorious family  are being forced to sell their garbage-strewn property . Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about $2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family . The new owners will have to apply for to the Supreme Court for a writ of possession to evict them, which can take four weeks, according to The Daily Telegraph. A spokesperson for Justice NSW said 'after the sheriff receives the writ, they give the occupants 30 days to vacate the premises. If they do not vacate willingly, the sheriff has the power to force an eviction.' Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news. 'I can't believe it. We have just bought a house here and moved in on Saturday. That's fantastic for the whole street,' Yael Super told The Telegraph. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house, but otherwise the family will be given the remainder of the profits after the debts have been cleared. The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'. The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement.

Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news the family are being evicted . The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data. Waverley Council have set a date to demolish the garage and remove the piles of garbage that surround the house. The Bobolas have resisted all offers to connect them with support services, and adamantly defended council clean-ups in court. The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard. More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property. With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years.

Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity.

"They may be the symbol of good luck, but black cats have drawn the short straw in one respect: they don't look good in selfies. Today the RSPCA announced a rise in the number of black cats being abandoned by their owners, and attributed it to them not photographing well. A spokesman for the animal welfare charity said that more than 70 per cent of the 1,000 cats in its care were black, and blamed the trend for people taking pictures of themselves with their phones. He said: 'There are a number of reasons for us having so many black cats, including the fact that black animals tend not to photograph as well as other cats with more distinctive markings. Scroll down for video . Selfie #fail? Black cat owner Gabriella Fletcher, 20, says her pet Susie is 'beautiful', but hard to photograph . The RSPCA says 70 per cent of its abandoned cats are black, including this one with assistant David Oliver . Other cats are also easier to tell apart, he said. The spokesman added: 'There is a national problem with rehoming cats of this colour. 'We really are puzzled as to why this still happens but we would urge people to never judge a cat by its colour and look at its personality instead.' The Millwood Cat Rescue Centre in Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, has taken in nine black kittens in the last fortnight. The rescue centre looks after about 300 cats every year and is currently 'full to bursting'. Founder Ronnie McMillen, 71, said: 'We have had a lot of black cats in this year - people don’t like black at the moment. 'Others look at the black cats and then just say ""Oh, have you got anything else?"" 'Ginger males cats are the most popular but I think the black cats are beautiful, and they photograph fine.'

She said: 'It is hard to get a good picture as you can’t really see how beautiful Susie is. 'But it’s very sad that people feel the need to overlook them just because they are black. They are just as special as any other cat. 'I only got Susie recently, she was a rescue cat and the centre said they were being bombarded with black cats. It’s a real shame.'

"Speaking out: Leading fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston . Ed Miliband's plans for a mansion tax are like something out of ‘Soviet Russia’, one of the party’s own peers declared last night. Leading fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston said the policy was unfair because it would not affect people in similar-sized properties in other cities in the UK. The IVF pioneer warned the plan, which levies an annual tax worth thousands of pounds on homes worth more than £2million, could result in homeowners being forced to move out – a prospect he compared to the Marxism inflicted on Russia after the revolution. Asked about the tax in a radio interview, the 74-year-old said he joined the Labour Party ‘because I believed Labour was after fairness’. Lord Winston, who also found fame for presenting BBC documentaries such as Child of Our Time and the Human Body series and lives in a terraced property in Hampstead Garden Suburb, one of the most affluent parts of London, added: ‘My terraced house in London is probably just close to that band. If I had the same identical house on the outskirts of Birmingham, it would be half that amount and I would never pay this kind of tax. That doesn’t seem right to me.’ Asked if he could just move somewhere smaller to avoid the tax, he replied: ‘If you’ve lived in a house for 30 or 40 years I’m not sure government should be forcing you to move out. That then becomes something that last really happened in the Soviet Union after the revolution.’ The Labour policy has already been criticised by several of the party’s own leading candidates to be Mayor of London, including Diane Abbott, Dame Tessa Jowell and Margaret Hodge, while last week Lord Mandelson said it was ‘crude’. Ed Miliband's plans for a mansion tax are like something out of ‘Soviet Russia’, one of the party’s own peers declared last night . The party has said homes worth between £2million and £3million will pay £3,000 a year, but shadow chancellor Ed Balls refused to give details on the levy which would be paid on properties over £3million. A Labour spokesman said the tax ‘would apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the UK’s homes’, adding: ‘When working people have seen their wages fall by £1,600 a year since 2010 it is right to ask those who have the most to make a bigger contribution.’","Leading fertility doctor Professor Robert Winston said policy was unfair .

"No need to be annoyed! Games like Angry Birds (pictured) earned more than their developers as much asthe  film industry's efforts . Apps made as much money as Hollywood took in the US last year by raking in more than $10billion (£6.5 billion). Games such as Angry Birds and the mobile version of Facebook earned the developers behind them more than the efforts of the film industry, even with hits like The Hunger Games. Individual developers now earn more than some Hollywood stars and apps support more jobs in America than Tinseltown. The study showed that total App store revenues since 2008 now stand at $25 billion (£17 billion) with no sign of slowing down. Industry analysts Asymco looked at the figures for apps sold by Apple through its iTunes service last year. It found that the app industry is ‘healthier’ than Hollywood even though last year’s hit films included Guardians of the Galaxy, The Lego Movie and the second Hobbit film. Producers behind huge apps such as Angry Birds, which has been sold more than 12 million times, earned Finnish Developers Rovio Entertainment, now earn more than even the biggest stars like Tom Cruise. Asymco also pointed out that the average app developer who has a medium sized hit would earn more than their Hollywood equivalent, as many actors only earn a few thousand for small roles. Asymco did not reveal its final figure for US box office sales but analysts have put it in the region of $10 billion (£6.5 billion), slightly lower than its app counterpart. In their report they said: ‘This is quite a story. Put another way, in 2014 (Apple) app developers earned more than Hollywood did from box office in the US.’ Asymco said that looking at apps sold on the iTunes store was not the full picture and that its survey did not include revenue from Google’s Android operating system apps. Hungry: Despite hits like the Hunger Games (pictured), app makers made more than Hollywood. Asymco did not reveal its final figure for US box office sales but analysts have put it in the region of $10 billion (£6.5bn) The popular mobile messaging application WhatsApp is now available on your office computer as well as your phone. Sorry Apple: Whatsapp isn't able to make the option available to iPhone users for the moment . The firm launched a much rumoured web version of its service linked to the mobile app - but admitted it would not work with Apple's iPhone. The app, acquired by Facebook last year for nearly $22 billion, unveiled the service today. 'Today, for the first time, millions of you will have the ability to use WhatsApp on your web browser,' it said in a blog post. WhatsApp, which claims some 500 million users, said its Web service will be a 'mirror' and would require an Internet-connected phone to work. The new messaging service currently only works with Google's Chrome browser and will not be available to iPhone users 'due to Apple platform limitations,' according to WhatsApp. 'Unfortunately for now, we will not be able to provide web client to our iOS users due to Apple platform limitations.' Facebook in October completed its buy of WhatsApp in a stock-and-cash deal. Likewise Hollywood makes other money from merchandising and other sources. However, the trend shows how tech is taking over from the silver screen - and will continue to do so. Asymco said that in the first week of January, a fallow time for Hollywood, consumers had already spent $500 million (£333 million) on apps through the iTunes store. The report came as a major Hollywood studio announced that it is cutting the number of films it produces by a third and axing 500 jobs. DreamWorks Animation, which is behind hits like Shrek, said it had to reduce costs so was shedding 18 per cent of its workforce. According to Apple, last year the most popular paid for app for the iPhone was Minecraft, a game which allows users to build their own world from scratch. The most popular free app in 2014 was Facebook’s messenger app, followed by messaging services WhatsApp and Snapchat.","Games like Angry Birds and the mobile version of Facebook earned their developers  more than the efforts of the film industry .

"Split between Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, the 500,000-strong Borana tribe might be numerous but their fascinating customs and religious beliefs are entirely unique. A nomadic people, their lives revolve around finding good grazing for their herds of camels and cattle, which combined, provide everything they need to survive in the striking semi-arid scrub land they inhabit. But while men dominate village life and are in charge of the herds, women play a vital role and are in sole charge of building Borana homes and performing the elaborate dances that signal the birth of a baby. Dressed in her best: A Borana woman wearing traditional garb made from goat skins. The expensive dresses are now kept only for best . Rules: Many of the Borana's rules apply to children, including a prohibition on addressing anyone older than themselves by their first name . With so little water to be had, their beauty routine is an unusual one and involves anointing their locks with ghee (clarified butter) to keep hair smooth and shiny. Girls are given the most striking hairdos and wear the crown of their heads shaved until they marry, at which point the hair is allowed to grow back while the rest is plaited into elaborate designs. But hair isn't the only part of life governed by the Borana's centuries-old laws. The majority of rules apply to children who, for instance, aren't allowed to call anyone older than themselves by their first names. Those names are also governed by tribal law and are inspired by the time of day they were born. 'Boys born in broad daylight are always called Guyo,' explains photographer Eric Lafforgue who took these incredible pictures. 'Some are named after a major event, a ceremony (Jil), a rainy season (Rob) or a dry season (Bon). Others are named after weekdays while a few get odd names such as Jaldes (ape), Funnan (nose), Gufu (tree stump) and Luke (lanky long legs).' Whatever their parents decide to call them, all children are given a place in the social pecking order at birth - and once done, it is rare for it to be changed. Welcome: The birth of a baby of either gender is marked by a traditional women-only dance which welcomes the infant into the world . Hard work: Women are in sole charge of building Borana homes and since they move four times a year, have to work extremely hard . Elaborate: A woman carries milk in an engraved gourd and shows off a bead ring (left). Right: The chief's wife is given special jewellery . Shaved: Girls such as this one have the crowns of their heads shaved until marriage. Afterwards, hair grows back and is plaited . Changing times: Traditionally, the Borana believed in a single god called Wak. Now Islam and Christianity are beginning to make inroads . Moving: Many of the young people are leaving the tribe behind for jobs in town, among them this trio who send money home to their families . Screened: Borana women are not allowed to come face-to-face with their son-in-laws. If they do, both must immediately cover their faces . The luckiest are the sons of village chiefs who are placed in the top grade, daballe, at birth and show their status with long locks that make them resemble girls. As future chiefs themselves, no one is allowed to punish them, even when they misbehave, while their mothers gain an honoured place in society and are frequently asked to bless well-wishers. These women are also given special jewellery to wear usually made from colourfully beaded leather, enlivened on occasion with recycled Coca-Cola caps. Those who aren't married to a chief, although often forced to share a husband, do get some special benefits including being in sole charge of who can and cannot enter their homes - spouses included. 'A wife always decides who will enter in the house,' explains Lafforgue. 'If her husband comes back and finds another man’s spear stuck into the ground outside her house, he cannot go in.' Women are also in sole charge of raising their daughters and usually insist that they become excellent housewives. Men, when they come to choose a wife, will often judge the girl by her mother, which makes getting it right all the more important. Older women are honoured as the keepers of tribal lore, although not all of it makes sense to Western ears. 'Old people are afraid of having their picture taken,' says Lafforgue. 'They believe that when you take their photo, you remove their blood and steal their shadow.' New religion: An increasing number of Borana are becoming Muslim and have adopted Islamic customs such as the headscarf . Respected: Older women are honoured as keepers of village lore while this boy (right) is the son of a chief and can never be punished . Important man: This man is the overseer of one of the Borana's network of wells. It is taboo to fight over water . Chief: The Borana elect a leader every eight years. The 'father of the village' wears a special headdress called a kalacha . Home: Women have the final say on who can enter their homes. If a man finds another man's spear outside his wife's hut, he can't go in . Laborious: Women are tasked with building all the houses, as well as dismantling and rebuilding them when the village moves on . Livelihood: The Borana's cattle and camels are their most precious possessions and are nearly always cared for by men .","The majority of the 500,000-strong Borana tribe live in Kenya but some also live in Ethiopia and Somalia .
Women use clarified butter (ghee) to keep their hair in perfect condition and wear it in elaborate plaits .
Girls have the crown of their heads shaved, with the hair only allowed to grow after they marry .
Other beliefs include the fear that having your photo taken removes some blood and steals your shadow .
They also believe in a single god named Wak, although more are converting to Christianity and Islam ."
"Zaffar Abbas (pictured) orchestrated at least five sham marriages between Eastern Europeans and Indian nationals . The leader of a sham marriage ring who used his immigration expertise to organise the scam was yesterday sentenced to six years behind bars. Zaffar Abbas, 45, from Walsall, orchestrated at least five sham marriages between Eastern Europeans and Indian nationals over a six-month period. One of those involved was a resident of James Turner Street in Birmingham – which featured on last year’s Channel 4 documentary, Benefits Street. Marcella Brotac, who lives on the road, was also jailed for attempting to participate in one of the fake ceremonies. Brotac, 37, from Romania, even posed for photographs with her sham husband Harjeet Singh, 23, in an attempt to convince immigration officials. Under Abbas's scheme, EU passport-holders were paid to marry foreign nationals desperate to stay in the UK. The charge for each wedding, held at Shrewsbury Register office, was up to £12,000. Sentencing yesterday at Northampton Crown Court, Judge Rupert Mayo described Abbas, who is a British national, as ‘clever’ and ‘persuasive’. A court heard that the father-of-three had previously worked as a ‘licensed immigration adviser’ which had given him insider knowledge when planning the marriages. Judge Mayo told Abbas: ‘The offence you committed on at least five occasions was a sham marriage between a person of EU citizenship and a person who did not necessarily live in the UK.’ He later added: ‘You are clever and persuasive but you are also manipulative.’ He told of how Abbas had had put ‘a great deal of planning and coercion’ into the marriages. Mr Mayo also told of how Abbas had carefully planned for his name not to appear in any certificates and had even used a separate address. Marcella Brotac (left) posed for photographs with her sham husband Harjeet Singh (right), in an attempt to convince immigration officials . Beth Crocker, defending, told of how Abbas had ‘struggled hugely’ since being jailed in December and was ‘extremely frightened’ by his new surroundings. She told of how her client had spent the time behind bars studying and completing education qualifications. Abbas, wearing a smart black coat and a pink shirt sobbed as he listened the verdict as it was translated by an interpreter. Abbas was one of seven put behind bars yesterday for their involvement in the marriage ring. Singh, from West Bromwich, had agreed to marry Brotac so that he could stay in Britain after his student visa had expired. Davinder Singh, a Slovakian through marriage, was another key fixer in the ploy . The pair, who met at a registry office for the first time to arrange the fake nuptials, posed for the pictures after they had been arrested. Brotac and Singh had agreed to the pictures after being convinced by Abbas, the court heard. Earlier in the trial, Stephen Thomas, prosecuting told jurors that the photos were a ‘complete sham’, The Birmingham Mail newspaper reported. He told the court: ‘These photos created for the sole purpose of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the immigration authorities that there was a relationship between Harjeet Singh and Marcella Brotac.’ Brotac was sentenced to 18 months behind bars and Singh to 16 months for their involvement in the ploy. Brotac, who speaks no English, was told the news by her Romanian interpreter. She sobbed throughout the sentencing, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief and biting her lip as she waited for a verdict. Registry office staff began to become suspicious of the scheme when they noticed couples could not communicate in the same language. Many also appeared disinterested in the person they were due to marry. Davinder Singh, a Slovakian through marriage was another key fixer in the ploy. He was sentenced to two years and five months yesterday. Singh, 40, from Handsworth on the outskirts of Birmingham, had married off his Slovakian wife, who was pregnant with his child, to his cousin as part of the scheme. Judge Mayo branded Singh’s actions ‘distasteful’ yesterday. Vladimir Gazi (left), 40, from Slovakia, Ivars Mizans (right), 34, from Latvia were also jailed for 16 months . Vladimir Gazi, 40, from Slovakia, Ivars Mizans, 34, from Latvia and Gurpreet Kaur, 25, from India, were also jailed for 16 months yesterday. A court heard of how Kaur had met Abbas and been convinced to marry an EU national because she feared returning to Pakistan. She believed her father would stone her to death after he discovered that she had had a sexual relationship with a man in the village, a court heard. The Home Office hailed the sentences a success last night. Andy Radcliffe from the government department’s criminal investigations unit said: . Gurpreet Kaur, 25, from India, was also jailed for 16 months . ‘Abbas and Singh set up this scam to profit from abusing the marriage system and the UK’s immigration laws but have ended up in prison. ‘These sentences show that sham marriage crime will not be tolerated. Whether you are an organiser or a participant, we will always act when abuse of the immigration system is uncovered and seek to prosecute those involved.’ Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We are building an immigration system which is fair to British citizens and legitimate immigrants, and tough on those who flout the law. ‘These figures send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can cheat our immigration system. Our specialist teams will catch you, and you will be brought to justice. ‘Last year, we intervened in more than 2,400 suspected sham marriages – 85 per cent more than the year before. 'The new Immigration Act is also making it even tougher for fraudsters by extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period – giving officers and registrars longer to investigate suspicious marriages.’ All of those involved in the scam could face deportation apart from British national Abbas. Although Brotac lives on James Turner Street, where Benefits Street is filmed,her barrister yesterday insisted that the Romanian national was a hard worker and had never claimed benefits. Dean Easthope, defending, told of how Brotac had moved to England in 2013. He said: ‘To her credit, she didn’t rely upon benefits.’ He also told of how she carried out ‘back-breaking’ work to pay her bills. Mr Easthope added: ‘She doesn’t really understand what is going on. She doesn’t really have any idea what is going to face her.’ He added: ‘The cultural and language difficulties that she experiences in prison are horrific.’","Zaffar Abbas orchestrated at least five sham marriages over six months .

"This is the terrifying moment a fugitive robber forced a woman into the trunk of her own car at gunpoint, before driving off and withdrawing money from her bank account at several ATMs. The victim, who wished to be identified only as Christin, was captured on surveillance video pulling up to a drive-in ATM at a Wells Fargo bank in Arlington, Texas, in the early hours of January 14. But as she inserted her card to begin a transaction, a man suddenly walked up from behind her black Kia and approached her window. He then crouched down and pointed a pistol at her face. Fearing for her safety, Christin agreed to the robber's instruction for her to hand over the money from her bank account, police said. But after doing so, the man then led her to the back of the car. Unaware: A woman, known only as Christin, is captured on surveillance video waiting beside an ATM at a Wells Fargo bank in Arlington, Texas, on January 14. She is unaware a man is approaching her car from behind . Attack: The man, donning a woolly hat and carrying a cellphone in his left hand, walks up to Christin's window . Armed: He then crouches down and pulls out a pistol with his right hand, before pointing it at the victim's face . Recovering: Fearing for her safety, Christin (pictured speaking to Good Morning America after the attack) agreed to the robber's instruction for her to hand over the money from her bank account, police said . Once there, the suspect dressed in a woolly hat and carrying a cellphone in his other hand, ordered Christin to climb into the vehicle's trunk, before glancing around and slamming the lid shut, it is said. Footage shows the man then walking back to the front of the car and climbing into the driver's seat. As he gets in, he looks up at the surveillance camera and covers his hands with his sleeves. Seconds later, he drives away. The man later traveled to a number of other ATMs, where he used his victim's card to withdraw more cash while she remained in the trunk, it is alleged. He is also believed to have held up another man at gunpoint at a walk-up cash machine during this time, Arlington Police Department told WFAA. Eventually, the man parked the Kia and walked off.

Terrifying: He then glancs around and slams the lid shut, video footage by Arlington Police Department shows . After realizing her attacker had abandoned the car, Christin reportedly pulled on the trunk's emergency lever and jumped out, before running to a nearby convenience store. There, she alerted the police at around 3.40am. Officers have now launched a manhunt for the suspect, who remains on the run, according to ABC News. The Kia was found that morning. Speaking to Good Morning America, Christin described the moment the man had attacked her. 'He was like ""give me the money"", she said. 'After he pulled out his gun, he told me to get in the trunk.' In reference to her escape, she added: 'I thought maybe I had a chance of getting out of here, so I found the unlock for the trunk from the inside. I popped it up.'

"The Islamic State recording showing two Japanese men held hostage by militants may have been filmed in separate locations before being combined into a single video, experts claim. Inconsistencies with the shadows of Haruna Yukawa, fellow captive Kenji Goto and the masked killer known as Jihadi John suggest images of the hostages were recorded separately and then added together for greater effect. Other tell-tale signs include the jumpsuits worn by the two men - they are slightly different shades of orange and don't flutter in the wind at the same time. Scroll down for video . Shadows on the hostages (circled) lie in inconsistent directions, suggesting they may have been filmed in two separate locations with different light sources and the footage then combined . ISIS is well known for its video and imaging production abilities with all propaganda videos it releases having been carefully manufactured and edited. Mr Goto and fellow Japanese national Haruma Yukawa appeared in the video, released earlier this week, in which they were threatened with death unless $200million was paid within 72 hours. In the video, Mr Yukawa and Mr Goto sit kneeling on either side of Jihadi John. But the shadows of the militant, Mr Goto and Mr Yukawa lean in different directions. And perhaps most tellingly, the shadows of the hostages' heads are cast down onto opposite sides of their necks. Both examples indicate there may have been different light sources used for filming the men separately, then adding them together for a more intimidating video. Tsuyoshi Moriyama, an associate professor at Tokyo Polytechnic University and image technology expert, said: 'It's possible that video images taken at different times were combined. 'A very high level of knowledge and skill would be necessary to make such a composite video,' the Washington Post reported, according to Stuff. Shiego Mori-shima, a Waseda University Professor on information-communication engineering, added it was possible that the images were recorded in different places after noting the jumpsuits were different shades of orange and didn't flutter in the wind at the same time. Meanwhile, the mother of Mr Goto has pleaded for his life as the deadline to pay his ransom passed overnight and militants warned the 'countdown has begun'. An ISIS posting appeared online today showing a clock counting down to zero along with gruesome images of other hostages who have been beheaded by ISIS. Mr Goto's mother Junko Ishido choked back tears while telling a packed news conference that her son was not an enemy of the people of Islamic faith and if she could, she would offer her own life to ensure his safe release. Junko Ishido wipes away tears as she pleads for her son's life, as the deadline to pay for his release passed . The Japanese government said it was in an 'extremely severe . situation' while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said saving the men's lives is . paramount but that Japan will not bow to terrorism. The Japanese government considered the deadline to be 5:50am today. 'My son Kenji is not an enemy of the people of the Islamic . faith. I can only pray as a mother for his release,' Mrs Ishido said. 'If I could offer my life I would plead that my son . be released, it would be a small sacrifice on my part. 'He only went to rescue his friend. He has always looked out . for weaker people, he was always helping weaker children than . him,' she added. She said she was astonished to learn from her daughter-in-law that she had a newborn baby, and said the child needed his father. Abe has ordered his government to make every effort to . secure their safe release, setting off a flurry of activity . among Japanese diplomats. The captor in the video, which resembles those showing . previous Islamic State captives who were beheaded, says the ransom demand matches the $200 million in aid that Abe pledged to help countries . fighting Islamist militants. Abe made the pledge during a multi-nation visit to the . Middle East earlier this week. Islamic State militants have . seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, and beheaded several . Western captives. Japan has stressed that its donation is for humanitarian . aid, such as helping refugees, and insisted that it will not bow . to terrorist threats. Mrs Ishido (pictured) said her son was 'not an enemy of the people of the Islamic faith' and said she was praying for his release . 'The government is continuing to work in unison to gather . information and make every efforts for their release,' Chief . Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. 'We are in an extremely severe situation,' Suga said. Asked if Tokyo would pay the ransom, he said: 'There is no . change to our stance that we will not give in to terrorism and . will contribute to the international response to terrorism. As . we make utmost efforts for their swift release, we are . negotiating through all available channels.' Japanese officials have declined to say if they would pay . any ransom, a move that would put Tokyo at odds with close ally . the United States. Prior to the video's release, Japanese diplomats had told . the families of the two captives that the government would not . pay ransom, sources familiar with the matter said. Tokyo's most prominent mosque, the Tokyo Camii and Turkish . Culture Center, posted a statement calling for the prompt . release of the hostages. It said ISIS's actions are 'totally against Islam . and have a serious impact on Muslim communities all over the . world and put Muslims in a precarious position'. Abe's handling of the hostage crisis - he must appear firm . but not callous - will be a big test for the 60-year-old, but he . appears to have few options. Yukawa, aged around 42 and who dreamed of becoming a . military contractor, was captured in August outside the Syrian . city of Aleppo. Yukawa (pictured) dreamed of becoming a military contractor and was captured in August . Mr Goto, 47, a war correspondent with experience in Middle East hot spots, went to Syria in late October to try to help Mr Yukawa . Goto, 47, a war correspondent with experience in . Middle East hot spots, went to Syria in late October to try to . help Yukawa. 'He left a very young baby and left his family and I asked . his wife why he made this decision and she said he had to do . everything in his power to save his friend and acquaintance and . that it was very important to him,' said his mother. Meanwhile, Japan's government considered whether it had the legal basis for a military strike on ISIS militants and concluded it did not, as officials scrambled to seek the release of its two nationals. Japan's pacifist constitution bans its troops from fighting overseas. However, Mr Abe is trying to ease curbs on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or militarily aiding an ally under attack, in a reinterpretation of the constitution that must now be passed into law. Prayers have been offered at Tokyo's largest mosque as the status of the men remains unclear. Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga was asked about the militants' claim that the 'countdown' had begun and said Japan was analysing it. 'The situation remains severe, but we are doing everything we can to win the release of the two Japanese hostages,' Mr Suga said. He added Japan is using every channel it can find, including local tribal chiefs, to try to reach the captors.","Experts suggest latest ISIS video has been doctored by the militants .

"It may be more used to world leaders than beginner readers - but the White House this week played host to a class of schoolkids and the Cat In The Hate thanks to Michelle Obama. The First Lady hosted a reception in the stately East Room of the Presidential residence, and danced, jumped and did the limbo with an audience of 40 pupils from schools around Washington, D.C. As well as bouncing up and down and hopping on one leg, the esteem visitors were also treated to a public rendition of the President's new favorite reading material - a Dr Seuss-style guide to staying healthy as a kid. Scroll down for video . Makeover: Michelle Obama filled the White House with balloon decorations, and invited the Cat In The Hat along to make a point about healthy eating . Party in the East Room: After listening to the First Lady read, the assembled kids got to try out a limbo pole . Instructions: In the above image, the First Lady demonstrates how to brush one's teeth to the audience of 40 children - and warns them they risk decay and cavities should they fail to comply . Before launching into her reading, Mrs Obama revealed that she had looked through the picture book with her husband before he left that day on Marine One - and that Dr Seuss rhymes are a family favorite. However, while most Seuss tales are whimsical romps just meant to delight children, the latest product had the joint purpose of plugging the First Lady's Let's Move initiative to fighting childhood obesity. Entitled Oh, the Things You Can Do That Are Good For You, Mrs Obama's book included government-approved public health advice, such as instructions for kids to exercise for an hour every day, remember to brush their teeth, and eat pumpkin seeds. Working up a sweat: Mrs Obama encouraged the children to run and dance during a 20-minute presentation, which also included a reading from the new Seuss tome . Listening: The versified public health pamphlet included advice for the young children, which Mrs Obama later had them repeat back to her . The First Lady's reading, complete with big pictures and actions from a Cat In The Hat and Thing #1 and Thing #2 brought in for the event, also covered how to sneeze properly and a reminder to wear a helmet when you cycle. One of the points made was Mrs Obama's oft-repeated dictum that half of a meal should consist of fruit and vegetables, which was translated into Seuss rhyming couplets. At one point The First Lady read: 'Now it's time to step up to my rainbow buffet, Filled with colorful foods we should eat every day. 'There are lots to choose from and their power is great - Veggies and fruit should fill half of your plate.' After the rendition - which also included instruction to sleep 10 hours a day - Mrs Obama had the children repeat her lessons back to her, before striking up a demonstration exercise session. Children were told to stand up, jump around and pretend to ride their bicycle through their august surroundings. For a time, the children even struck up a limbo competition. They were later fed healthy snacks mentioned in the book by the White House kitchen. The meeting was tied to the First Lady's public health ambitions - which includes a commitment to eliminating child obesity within a generation.","First lady invited 40 pupils into the White House's stately East Room .

"An angry mother has gone 'on strike' on the streets of North Carolina to protest against her two teenager daughters' 'disrespectful' and 'out of control' behavior. Nassira Muhammad, who is a single mother to the girls, decided to take action when one them reportedly scratched a key against her brand new minivan at their home in Winston-Salem . With conventional discipline methods having previously failed, she created a huge sign reading: 'Mom On Strike!'. Then, she started marching up and down the street with the sign held high. Now, Ms Muhammad has been 'on strike' for a week - and seemingly has no plans to stop just yet. Scroll down for video . 'Mom On Strike!' Nassira Muhammad (pictured), who is a single mother to two teenage daughters, has gone 'on strike' on the streets of North Carolina to protest against the girls' 'disrespectful' and 'out of control' behavior . 'I'm to the point where I'm just so frustrated, so to keep my hands off my kids or to keep me from doing something crazy, I just decided to go on strike,' she told WFMY. 'I walk up and down the sidewalk until my knees hurt, and then I sit down. This is the only solution I can think of other than getting rid of my children,' Ms Muhammad, who opted for nearby Waughtown Street as her picket line, said her daughters have spent years disrespecting her, being rude and never saying thank you for what she does for them. Punishments like time-outs and lectures had failed to alter their behavior, she said. She added that she had even called the police on her daughters after her van was scratched up. But the officers reportedly told her they could not do anything without eyewitnesses, ABC reported. 'My children have everything that they could possibly want and need, but yet still, they are disrespectful,' Ms Muhammad, who apparently started 'striking' last Friday, said. 'Out of control'L Ms Muhammad decided to take action when one the teenagers (both of whom are believed to be pictured above) reportedly scratched a key against her brand new minivan at their home in Winston-Salem . Sign: With conventional discipline methods having previously failed, the mother ceated a huge sign reading: 'Mom On Strike!' (pictured). Then, she started marching up and down the street with the sign held high . 'They are rude. They think that I'm the meanest mom in the world. They think they can survive without me, so I said, ""you know what? That's fine. This mom is going on strike"".' And Ms Muhammad's actions may be having a positive influence on her daughters. Earlier this week, the girls took to Waughtown Street themselves, armed with signs that their aunt had forced them to carry. On the signs were words of thanks to their mother. They read: 'Thank you mom for providing for me, caring for me, and loving me.' However, the pair are yet to make amends of their own accord. Speaking to WFMY, Dr Nannette Funderburk, a Psychotherapist at the Social and Emotional Learning Group in Greensboro, said parents often need a support system to help them out. 'This mom is definitely sending a message,' said Dr Funderburk. 'You need someone to talk to and bounce ideas off of because kids don't come with a manual.' Jill Weber, a psychologist at the American Psychological Association, added that the support system can be in the form of therapists, church groups, support groups and schools, among other things. Making amends? This week, the girls took to the streets themselves, armed with signs (one of which is pictured above) that their aunt had forced them to carry. On the signs were words of thanks to their mother . Protest: Ms Muhammad, who opted for Waughtown Street (pictured) as her picket line, said her daughters have spent years disrespecting her, being rude and never saying thank you for what she does for them . Getting support from others can then empower a mother or father to start setting simple, but firm limits for their offspring, Ms Weber said. 'The important thing is that you start with two to three absolute rules, and then stick by them and the consequences of not following them,' she said. 'I've definitely seen similar situations, and I know with little changes in a family's day-to-day interactions, things can absolutely get better.'","Nassira Muhammad says her daughters have disrespected her for years .

"A couple have been told they face court action after taking their two children out of school during term-time despite being refused permission by one of the establishments. Annette and Michael Putt, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been ordered to appear before magistrates next month after refusing to pay fines of £60 each over their son's unauthorised absence. They had asked permission from each child's school to take son Harrison, 14, and daughter Ruby, 11, out of classes during term-time so that they could go on a five-day family getaway to Wales in June last year. Micheal and Annette Putt, right, face prosecution for failing to pay £60 fines over taking their son Harrison, left, out of school during term time. Their daughter's school allowed Ruby, second left, to go on the trip . Annette and Michael Putt, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been ordered to appear in court next month after taking their son Harrison out of St Bernard's Catholic High School (pictured) without permission . The couple were told by Ruby's school - St Gerard's Catholic Primary in Rotherham - that she could have time out of lessons for the holiday, but Harrison's school - St Bernard's Catholic High - denied the request. Despite the rejection, Mr and Mrs Putt went ahead with the five-day break, travelling to Porthmadog in North Wales. They claim that they cannot go on holiday out of term-time because it is 'too expensive'. Upon their return, they were told that Harrison's school had notified the local authority of his unauthorised absence. In 2013, former Education Secretary Michael Gove ended the right for schools to grant up to 10 days holiday per year for pupils. New guidelines state that children should only be taken out of school during term-time if it is an 'exceptional circumstance'. Government rules state that it is at the discretion of each individual school to authorise or reject absence requests. Under the current system, parents who take their children out of school without permission could face a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. Mr and Mrs Putt wanted to take their children Ruby, left, and Harrison, right on holiday to Wales in June . They had asked permission to take both their son and daughter out of school for a five-day break to Wales but received permission to do so only by Ruby's school, St Gerard's Catholic Primary in Rotherham (pictured) Mr and Mrs Putt now face a court hearing after refusing to pay the £60 fine they were each handed over their son's absence. Mrs Putt, a care worker, said she was 'really upset' about the court action and said they had gone away because the trip was a gift from the children's grandparents. She told The Guardian's Sally Weale: 'I can't actually believe that someone's going to name and shame me in court. 'I'm not a criminal. I haven't hurt anyone. I'm not a bad person. I'm a normal mum, wanting to give our children some family holiday time. 'My little girl's school said it was fine to take her for five days, my son's said no. What was I meant to do? Was I meant to leave my son at home and go on holiday, or not let my little girl go on holiday?' A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council said the decision to fine or prosecute a parent is determined by the central government policy which takes the view that parents shouldn't take their children out of school during term-time in order to raise educational attainment. It is not the first time parents have faced court action for taking their children out of school. Kerry Capper, 25 (pictured), was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last year for keeping her daughter off school for seven days. She said she let cancer-sufferer daughter Libby off school to 'keep an eye on her' Plymouth City Council fined 41-year-old salesman Jason Short (pictured) £120 for taking his seven-year-old daughter Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work . Since the changes were brought in by Mr Gove, more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval. Dozens of parents have been convicted by magistrates' courts after refusing to pay penalty charges of £60 per child, rising to £120 if not paid within 21 days. In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was ordered to pay a £120 penalty fine for keeping her daughter off school for seven days. Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. Michael Gove . As a result of the crackdown on term-time absences imposed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in September 2013, headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days’ holiday a year. Instead, they can allow leave only in ‘exceptional circumstances’ Each parent who ignores a ban faces a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The move was intended to stop families damaging their children’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays. A quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans. But families and headteachers say the rules are applied haphazardly. For example, a struggling school may be stricter because absences are noted during inspections. The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups. Between January and March last year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. She was ordered to pay the fine, but cleared of a criminal act. In another case, a five-year-old girl was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad. Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September. Because of his work commitments as a police officer, Mr Stephenson was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went. In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a £120 fine for taking their three children to the U.S. to attend a family memorial service. Mr Haymore refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £2,500 fine and a jail term. But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the U.S. Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays. Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work. He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine. But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission.

"A cannabis-smoking teenage driver has been jailed for 20 months for killing a schoolgirl friend, 15, and a 55-year-old as he tried to overtake on a dark bend. Daniel Watts, 19, of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was sentenced to 20 months in prison yesterday for killing passenger Shannley Leaver, 15, and driver Ronald Gates, 55, in the head-on crash. Now, the father of the 15-year-old girl has urged young people not to drive 'like idiots' and called for a restriction on the number of passengers young drivers are allowed to carry. Shaun Leaver also criticised the length of the sentence for being too short. Cannabis-smoking teenage driver Daniel Watts has been jailed for killing two in a crash in October 2013 . Passenger Shannley Leaver, 15, was killed following the collision along the A12 at Frostenden, Suffolk . In December, father-to-be Watts admitted causing their deaths by careless driving. The court heard he passed his driving test just 10 months before the fatal collision on October 8 2013. On the day of the collision he decided to go to Ipswich from Great Yarmouth to pick up a car part. Before this journey he had never ventured more than five miles from home in his Citroen Saxo car. He invited Shannley Leaver and two other young people - Brodie Jones and Sam Duffy - to go with him. A witness statement from Brodie Jones revealed they had been smoking cannabis. However, Judge John Devaux said no-one could conclusively prove this had played a part in the crash. Mr Gates was driving southbound with his wife Ann in their Peugeot 106 when Watts, driving on the wrong side of the road, ploughed into their car along the A12 at Frostenden, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, at about 8.30pm. The teenager's car was sent spinning in to the air by the force of the collision and flipped over. Watts was sentenced to 20 months in jail yesterday and also banned from driving for two years . Shannley, who attended Lynn Grove High School in Gorleston, was described by her heartbroken father as 'outgoing, fun-loving and lovely' Mr Gates, of Knodishall, Suffolk, and Shannley both died after suffering multiple injuries, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Watts was airlifted to hospital with a broken foot, shattered pelvis, broken leg and dislocated shoulder. He was treated for five weeks before being allowed home. Mr Gates' wife Ann and the two other passengers in Watts' car also suffered serious injuries. As well as receiving 20 months in prison, Watts was also banned from driving for two years. Simon Gladwell, defending Watts, said he took 'full responsibility' and was 'totally remorseful' for the deaths and injuries he had caused. He said Watts genuinely had no recollection of the collision but a black box in his car for insurance purposes showed he had not been speeding prior to the collision. He said Watts had no previous convictions and his girlfriend was pregnant. Shaun Leaver has urged young people not to drive 'like idiots' and criticised the length of the sentence . Shannley, who attended Lynn Grove High School in Gorleston, was last night described by her heartbroken father as 'outgoing, fun-loving and lovely'. Mr Leaver, of Yarmouth, said there were 'no words to describe the devastating effect' her tragic death had had on their family. Mr Gates’ mother Maureen Gates said that while her son’s death would have a lasting impact on her family, Watts would be released from his sentence after 10 months and could then get on with his life.","Daniel Watts, 19, jailed for 20 months in prison for killing two in crash .

"A mannequin sitting atop a billboard in Des Moines County prompted several 911 calls from people who feared someone was about to take a leap. Sheriff's deputies were first dispatched early Monday to check for a possible suicidal person along U.S. Highway 61 near Sperry, according to The Hawk Eye newspaper. 'It was dark, they couldn't see. They assumed it was someone jumping, but at some point they realized the person was not responding to their commands,' Sheriff Mike Johnstone said. 'One of them pulled out their binoculars and realized it was a mannequin.' Don't jump!: A mannequin sitting atop this billboard in Des Moines County prompted several 911 calls from people who feared someone was about to take a leap . While deputies were investigating the matter, more than a dozen calls poured into the county's dispatch center from concerned passers-by. That prompted Johnstone to talk with the advertiser, an automobile dealer. The wording beneath the mannequin stated, 'I can see Deery Brothers in West Burlington from here.' After hearing from the sheriff, Brad Deery, who owns the dealership, agreed to remove the mannequin as quickly as possible. 'The sheriff didn't tell me to take it down, but when I heard about the 911 calls — I don't want to be tying up a line,' Deery said. 'I'm here to sell cars, not get people hurt.' I'm a mannequin, dummy!: This mannequin fooled concerned Good Samaritans who thought it was a man about to jump from the billboard to his death .","A mannequin sitting atop a billboard in Des Moines County prompted several 911 calls from people who feared someone was about to take a leap .

"The stunning contestants of this year's Miss Universe competition showcased their country in an unusually spectacular fashion- the National Costume segment, where entrants, including our own Miss Australia, wore a series of elaborate costumes to display the unique flavour of their homeland. Australia's entrant into the 63rd annual competition, held at Florida International University in Miami, was 22-year-old Tegan Martin, who wore an outfit inspired by the Aboriginal Dreamtime sunset. Featuring a large multi-coloured semi-circle backdrop to be worn on her back like Victoria's Secret Angel wings, the outfit also included a beaded skirt and strapless crop top in a scorched red earth colour. Scroll down for video . Miss Australia: Tegan Martin wore an outfit inspired by the Aboriginal Dreamtime sunset. It was chosen from among a range of options, including one outfit inspired by the Sydney Opera House and another inspired by Steve Irwin . It was chosen from among a range of options, including one outfit inspired by the Sydney Opera House and another inspired by Steve Irwin. Earlier in the day, she sauntered down the runway for the Swimsuit Competition of the Preliminary Miss Universe Show. Tegan, a model and former hairdresser, is currently studying a Bachelor of Nutritional Medicine, and said that she has hopes of raising awareness of youth mental health issues. She is also part of a youth mentoring program helping schoolgirls struggling with confidence. The Newcastle-born beauty posted a video several days earlier of herself struggling to assemble the elaborate rainbow feature of her costume. The brief Instagram clip sees the puzzled blonde entangled in poles and wires, exclaiming: 'I may be up all night building a tent here'. Tegan, who once worked as a model in Paris, came second in the Miss Universe Australia competition twice before she won on her third and final attempt. The Miss Universe finals will then be held at the FIU Arena on Sunday 25 January, when Venezuelan Miss Universe 2013, Gabriela Isler, will hand over her crown. She's a knockout: Australia's Tegan Martin stunned in the preliminary Miss Universe Swimsuit Competition at Florida International University in Miami . Other contestants brought their nationality's unique flavour to the competition, wearing an elaborate range of costumes spanning from the Buckingham Palace Queen's Guard to the national tree of Venezuela. But while there was no doubt that all of the contestants had gone to extreme lengths to stand out from the crowd, some of the outfits left the audience rather confused as to the link to the woman in question's home country. One lady wore flags from across the entire world, not her own nation, while another appeared to be wearing just a simple ball gown. One contestant that left viewers in no doubt though, was Miss Canada, who came dressed as an ice hockey player, complete with working scoreboard. Miss Great Britain: Grace Levy wore a skimpy version of uniform worn by the Queen's Guard when they are on duty outside Buckingham Palace. She accessorised with a gold choker that bore an imitation of the Royal Insignia . Miss USA: Nia Sanchez came dressed in an elaborate version of the stars and stripes on the American flag. The metre-long white feathers were all hand-stitched onto the silk corset . Miss India: Noyonita Lodh's outfit looked like it could be dangerous if you got too close . Miss France: Camille Cerf wore a chic beret to match a red ribbon tied around the waist of her lace gown . Miss Sri Lanka: Marianne Page, who made her national costume herself. The outfit features intricate beading, jewels and several metres of mirrored material . Miss Canada: Chanel Beckenlehner came dressed as a glamorous ice hockey player, complete with working scoreboard and ice hockey stick. Her hairstyle was a copycat of the country's hockey tournament trophy, The Stanley Cup. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada . Miss Ireland: Lisa Madden wore medieval-looking costume of armour in shades of red. The look was inspired by Celtic warriors . Miss Venezuela: Migbelis Lynette Castellanos came as a glittering version of the Tabebuia chrysantha. It is the national tree of Venezuela as it is native to the country and it's deep yellow resembles the one on the Venezuelan flag . Miss Dominican Republic: Kimberly Castillo. Her costume depicts the Virgen de Altagraci - the Virgin is the patron saint of the Dominican Republic . Miss Portugal: Patricia Da Silva who came dressed in a costume depicting two birds. The Rooster of Barcelos is the fictional national bird of Portugal . Miss Lebanon: Saly Greige. Saly wore the simplest item of clothing for the evening -  a billowing long sherwal, which is the most common and practical garment in rural areas of the country - although covered in this picture, the dress actually features trousers with a low crotch . Miss Russia: Yulia Alipova wore a dress inspired by the Byzantine era and its influence to the Russian culture. The ornate headress was embedded with brocade and emerald and ruby-like stones . Miss Korea: Yoo Yebin wore a Hanbok, which is the south Korean national dress. She also wore a outer layer that featured flags from all over the world as a symbol of unity . Miss Japan: Keiko Tsuji came dress as a Sōjutsu fighter. Sōjutsu meanins ""art of the spear"" and is the Japanese martial art of fighting with a yari (a Japanese spear) Miss Ecuador: Alejandra Argudom wore one of the most revealing outfits of the evening.

"The sale of recreational marijuana was legalized state-wide following a 2012 vote. But now, Colorado's governor, John Hickenlooper, has claimed the landmark move was a bad idea. Speaking on CBNC's 'Squawk Box', the 62-year-old Democrat said: 'If I could've waved a wand the day after the election, I would've reversed the election and said, ""This was a bad idea"".' Gov Hickenlooper, who opposed the 55 per cent 'yes' decision by voters to make marijuana legal, warned  the state still does not fully know what the unintended consequences of the ruling will be. Scroll down for video . Governor: John Hickenlooper (pictured), the governor of Colorado, has claimed that the state's legalization of  the sale of recreational marijuana in January 2014 (following a November 2012 vote) was a bad idea . Legal to sell: Speaking on CBNC's 'Squawk Box', the 62-year-old Democrat said: 'If I could've waved a wand the day after the election, I would've reversed the election and said, ""This was a bad idea""' (file image) 'Can we keep it out of the hands of kids?' he said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. 'All the top neuroscientists say this high-THC marijuana can diminish long-term memory in teenagers.' In January 2014, Colorado became the first state to allow the sale  of cannabis for recreational use to anyone aged 21 or older - via Amendment 64 - following the November 2012 vote. It was later followed by three other states: Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. But speaking at the Davos-based forum - also known as the Davos Annual Meeting - Gov Hickenlooper said: 'You don't want to be the first person to do something like this.' He explained how the state does not have a federal partner in the way that it does with alcohol [the federal bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives] because pot is still illegal federally. For this reason, he warned other US governors to 'wait a couple of years' before legalizing marijuana so they can see how Colorado fares in upcoming months, CNBC reported. Warning: Mr Hickenlooper (pictured, far right), who opposed the 55 per cent 'yes' decision by voters to make marijuana legal, warned the state still does not fully know what the consequences of the ruling might be . Pot-infused products: 'Can we keep it out of the hands of kids?' he said at the World Economic Forum. 'All the top neuroscientists say this high-THC marijuana can diminish long-term memory in teenagers' (file image) And he said that Colorado's legal marijuana business model is susceptible to corruption and fraud because it is based on cash transactions. 'No one wants it to be a cash business,' he said. Marijuana-related calls to poison control centers in Washington and Colorado have spiked since the states began allowing legal sales last year, with an especially troubling increase in calls concerning young children. New year-end data show that the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center received 151 calls for marijuana exposure last year, the first year of retail recreational pot sales. That was up from 88 calls in 2013 and 61 in 2012, the year voters made marijuana legal for adults aged over 21. Calls to the Washington Poison Center for marijuana exposures jumped by more than half, from 158 in 2013 to 246 last year. Public health experts say they are especially concerned about children accidentally eating marijuana edibles. Calls involving children nearly doubled to 48 in Washington involving youngsters aged 12 or under and to 45 in Colorado involving children aged 8 or under. However, he added that a credit union in the state is currently trying to achieve federal approval. Although businesses that sell marijuana in accordance with state laws cannot be targeted by federal officials, many banks are reluctant to finance them because pot is still listed as illegal federally. It comes as the number of children treated annually for accidental pot consumption in Colorado has reached double-digits, according to figures by a U.S. anti-marijuana group. In a report, marijuana legalization foe Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) also said that a drug treatment chain has seen a surge of teens treated for cannabis abuse, . And it pointed to higher-than-average use in the first states to sanction recreational cannabis - Colorado and Washington state - and an increase in burns from butane hash oil production. 'We need a pumping-of-the-brakes on the marijuana industry,' SAM’s president, Kevin Sabet, said in an interview. 'When we have hospitalizations and burns and deaths, we need to stop many of these products from being sold.' According to legalization opponents, Washington and Colorado have been flooded with dangerous pot-infused products, many far stronger than what might have been smoked in the 1960s. Dubious: Gov Hickenlooper, pictured (center) applauding guests during his annual State of the State address last Thursday, said that Colorado's legal marijuana business model is susceptible to corruption and fraud . At least 14 Colorado children, aged three to seven, were sent to hospitals in the first half of 2014 for accidentally ingesting marijuana products, SAM said of state data. This is compared with eight in 2013 and four between 2008 and 2011. In Colorado, teen marijuana abuse treatment at about a dozen Arapahoe House Denver-area facilities increased by 66 percent between 2011 and 2014, SAM cited that group as reporting. Earlier this month, Colorado health officials announced a $4 million Internet, television and radio public-education campaign aimed at exposing the dangers of cannabis-infused products. Use among people aged 18 and older from 2011-2013 in Colorado and Washington has risen about 3 percentage points, from roughly 16 to 19 percent and from 15 to 18 percent, respectively, SAM said, citing federal data. The national average is about 12 percent. The University of Colorado observed 17 cases of marijuana-related burns in 2014 and 11 cases in 2013, largely from botched butane hash oil extractions, with one case each in the three years prior. 'Trying to draw any conclusions with less than one year of data is irresponsible,' pro-cannabis Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert said. He said research on pot has drawn conflicting results and has been limited by the federal ban.","Gov John Hickenlooper claims legalization of marijuana was 'a bad idea'

"Tony Blair made a grovelling apology to Colonel Gaddafi for failing to send the tyrant’s enemies back to Libya to face torture, the Mail can reveal. The then Prime Minister told the dictator he was ‘very disappointed’ Britain’s courts had blocked the deportation of five Libyan dissidents amid fears they would be mistreated. In a fawning letter on official Downing Street-headed paper, he thanked the despot personally for Libya’s ‘excellent co-operation’ in the controversial attempt to return the political exiles into the ruthless regime’s clutches. Tony Blair pictured with Colonel Gaddafi in 2007. A letter seen by the Mail shows the then Prime Minister told the dictator he was 'very disappointed' Britain's courts had blocked the deportation of five Libyan dissidents . It was sent following a period in which Britain colluded with Libya to hand over terror suspects via the CIA’s unlawful rendition programme and MI5 allowed Gaddafi’s spies to carry out covert operations against dissidents on UK soil. British intelligence agents had also allegedly been complicit in a secret policy of ‘torture by proxy’ by providing questions for feared Libyan interrogators to ask detainees. Lawyers acting for the men have claimed in court that information illegally extracted from prisoners in Libya’s torture dungeons was central to the UK’s case for deportation. Number 10’s extraordinary letter will raise fresh questions about the full extent of the Labour Government’s involvement in the abuse of terror suspects – and fuel speculation that responsibility for the scandal went right to Downing Street’s door. Mr Blair has repeatedly insisted he opposes torture and has never condoned its use. He sent the two-page letter, seen by the Mail, on April 26, 2007, the day before judges ruled the five men, all linked to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which claimed responsibility for a failed assassination attempt on Gaddafi in 1996, could not be deported. In a letter on Downing Street-headed paper, Mr Blair thanked the despot personally for Libya’s ‘excellent co-operation’ in the controversial attempt to return the political exiles into the ruthless regime’s clutches . Political protocol dictates the Prime Minister should read the judgement before it was made public. On April 27, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) blocked the deportation saying a Memorandum of Understanding signed by Britain and Libya to safeguard the protection of returning dissidents was worthless. Gaddafi was ‘unpredictable’ and would ignore it, they said. They also expressed concern that a so-called independent board set up to monitor deportees’ treatment was to be run by Gaddafi’s son Saif and, therefore, there was a ‘real risk’ of them being ill-treated, including being beaten, hung from hooks on the wall, shackled and given electric shocks. Mr Blair’s letter of apology began with the handwritten words ‘Dear Mu’ammar’, then continued in type: ‘I trust that you, and your family, are well.’ The letter, sent on official Downing Street-headed paper, was posted following a period in which Britain colluded with Libya to hand over terror suspects via the CIA’s unlawful rendition programme . Report: How the story was covered in yesterday's Daily Mail. Mr Blair has repeatedly insisted he opposes torture and has never condoned its use . Referring to the failed legal bid, he wrote: ‘With regret, I should let you know that the British Government has not been successful in its recent court case here involving deportation to Libya. I am very disappointed at the Court’s decision.’ Mentioning the worryingly close relationship between Britain and Libya, he said: ‘I believe that it is essential that this decision is not allowed to undermine the effective bilateral co-operation which has developed between the United Kingdom and Libya in recent years.’ He added: ‘Finally, I would like to add a personal word of thanks for your assistance in the matter of deportation. That support – and the excellent co-operation of your officials with their British colleagues – is a tribute to the strength of the bilateral relationship which has grown up between the United Kingdom and Libya.’ At the bottom of the letter, which is headed with the Downing Street seal, he hand-wrote: ‘Best wishes, Yours ever, Tony. ‘ . Mr Blair’s (pictured left leaving the Houses of Parliament last week) letter of apology began with the handwritten words ‘Dear Mu’ammar’, then continued in type: ‘I trust that you, and your family, are well' On the same day, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s foreign policy adviser, sent a rueful letter to Ambassador Abdulati Obidi, a key Gaddafi aide, apologising for the ‘very disappointing’ decision. Criticising the court’s assessment of the regime’s brutality, he said: ‘Unfortunately, some material in the judgement will make uncomfortable reading for the Libyan authorities. ‘We regret this very much, not least in the view of the full co-operation you have given us so promptly and consistently on this issue.’ ‘In particular, during the case, lawyers for the men referred to public statements made by the Leader of the Revolution.’ Gaddafi routinely referred to dissidents in exile as ‘stray dogs’. Sir Nigel added: ‘This led unavoidably to debate about the position and role of the leader.’ Last night FRI critics condemned the letter. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s foreign policy adviser, sent a rueful letter to a key Gaddafi aide, apologising for the ‘very disappointing’ decision . Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK’s head of government affairs, said: ‘Our government should never have been trying to deport men back to Gaddafi-run Libya when there was a clear risk they’d end up in one of the country’s torture dungeons. ‘Rather than cosying up to Gaddafi like this, Tony Blair should have held firm to the principle that people should not be bundled onto planes and delivered into the hands of their torturers.’ Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said: ‘This is ghastly. The more revelations that come out about Tony Blair’s premiership, the more distasteful it seems. He seems to have no regard for basic human rights, civil values or morality. ‘How can he live with himself? I am ashamed that the UK could apologise for not sending people to a country where they would almost certainly be imprisoned and tortured.’ Cori Crider, a director at human rights charity Reprieve, said: ’Tony Blair must now urgently explain whether he knew the ‘cooperation’ mentioned in this fawning message involved kidnap, rendition and torture by his government. Thankfully, Britain today is not Gaddafi’s Libya – not even former Prime Ministers are above the law.’ Britain sought to bring Libya, responsible for the Lockerbie bombing and murdering policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, out of the international deep-freeze in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 to help tackle Muslim extremists. In return, Gaddafi hoped intelligence sharing would help him round up and imprison Libyans who were living in exile in the UK. To do this, he played up links between the LIFG and Al Qaeda. In February 2004, Libya wrote to Interpol with a list of 130 dissidents, including the five in Britain. A crackdown began the following month after Mr Blair cosied up to the tyrant as part of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’. Over the next 12 months, British spies sent ‘detailed dossiers’ of questions about the men to Tripoli authorising regime henchmen to put them to detainees allegedly under torture. Following the July 7 bombings in London, which killed 52, the men were arrested and told they would be deported as ‘threats to national security’, even though they were innocent of the atrocity. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker described the revelations as 'ghastly' and added that he is 'ashamed' But after spending nearly two years in detention, immigration judges ruled they could not be deported because they would be ill-treated. A spokesman for Tony Blair said: ‘For the avoidance of doubt, Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture; has always said so publicly and privately; has never condoned its use and – as is shown by internal Government documentation already made public – thinks it is totally unacceptable. ‘He believes the fight against radical Islamism is a fight about values and acting contrary to those values – as in the use of torture – is therefore not just wrong but counter-productive.’","Tony Blair sent letter to Gaddafi on official Downing Street-headed paper .

"Miss Lebanon has today claimed that her rival Miss Israel had been chasing her for days before finally ambushing her in a Miss Universe selfie that sparked outrage in her own country. The photograph which emerged earlier this week sent shockwaves through the home country of Lebanese beauty Saly Greige because the two countries are still officially at war. The selfie, taken in Miami at the Miss Universe pageant, led to Saly being accused of being unpatriotic - but now she is hitting back. Scroll down for video . Controversial: The group selfie was taken by Miss Israel, Doron Matalon, left, forcing Miss Lebanon, Saly Greige, second from left, to publicly apologise . Plot: Saly's agent now claims it was part of a wider conspriacy to embarrass her dating back to November . Her agent claims that Saly had to 'run away' on a number of occasions because she was persistently chased by Israeli Doron Matalon - who was 'desperate' to capture the image. Richard Pharaon claims it was part of a wider plot to embarrass the Lebanese beauty dating back to November in London, when a different Miss World representative for Israel also tried to hunt down a selfie with Miss Lebanon. He said: 'It was 100 per cent deliberate. I can confirm that it was organised and planned since November 2014. 'Miss Israel was trying from the beginning to reach Saly and to have a selfie with her during the 20 days they stayed there. 'They were both sitting together once at the Marriott Hotel and Miss Israel came and asked Saly to have a selfie with her. 'Saly refused, of course, since she's perfectly aware of the conflict with Israel, and the whole situation in Lebanon.' Mr Pharaon claims that Miss Greige, 25, was often forced to run away from Matalon, 21, due to her constant requests for a photograph together. 'Sad': Miss Israel Doron Matalon said in response: 'Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game' Threat: Saly faced calls for her to be stripped of her title after the selfie caused outrage in Lebanon . Pharaon added: 'After trying many times to take a selfie with Miss Lebanon, Miss Israel finally succeeded - without Miss Lebanon's approval, of course. 'Saly was running away from her all the time since she was being chased by her. She stands for her country no matter what.' Saly has claimed that she was having a selfie with Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia when Miss Israel forced her way into the photograph and took the picture - catching them unawares. Pharaon said: 'Miss Israel saw them, and she immediately joined them and took a selfie with them without leaving Miss Lebanon time to react, and she immediately posted the picture on her Instagram account.' Israel and Lebanon are still technically at war but the last significant conflict between the countries was in 2006. Saly reportedly received 3,000 aggressive and negative messages on Facebook, some of which accused her of being racist and criticised her for involving herself in politics. Mr Pharaon said: 'Some people in Lebanon just want to invest in that story to ruin Miss Lebanon's reputation. They accused her of being non-patriotic, not caring and not loving her country. 'Most of the Lebanese people support Saly. They know that she would never intend to pose for a photo with Miss Israel.' A PR representative for Doron refused to comment. Complaint: Saly's agent has filed a complaint to pageant organisers but doesn't expect action to be taken . Saly is from Al- Koura village in the north of Lebanon and has a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering. The 5'7' brunette speaks Arabic, English and French. The Miss Universe website describes the 25-year-old as 'enthusiastic' and 'spontaneous'. Her online bio reads: 'Despite the unstable situation in Lebanon, she is overwhelmed with the continuous hunger of Lebanese citizens for survival, resistance and most importantly success.' Saly's team has made an official complaint to Miss Universe's management board, . Mr Pharaon said: 'Unfortunately, we are sure that it will lead nowhere, since it's a political matter, and we think that they will not interfere in such conflicts.' Her agent also makes it clear there has been no interaction between the two contestants since the selfie was taken. He said: 'They're not friends, they're not roommates, they don't like each other and there's no interaction between them. 'Saly always refused to talk to Miss Israel or be close to her, but Miss Israel was always trying to get hold of her on different occasions and all the time.' But Miss Lebanon and her agent are refusing to let the negative backlash of the unfortunate photograph affect her campaign for the Miss Universe title and reject suggestions that she should withdraw from the competition. Mr Pharaon said: 'Should someone pull out of the competition, it would be Miss Israel. 'Saly is now only focusing on the final prime. Her main purpose is to win. She's working hard and focusing only on the competition, Lebanon and herself. Focus: Her agent told MailOnline: 'Should someone pull out of the competition, it would be Miss Israel... Her main purpose is to win. She's working hard and focusing only on the competition, Lebanon and herself' 'We consider what happened part of a big propaganda, Israel is the enemy, Saly is patriotic, and there's no doubt about that.' On Sunday Miss Israel responded to Saly Greige's claims of being photobombed by saying that the Lebanese beauty's reaction to the photo made her 'sad'. On her Facebook page, Doron wrote: 'It doesn't surprise me, but it still makes me sad.

"A senior California-based lawyer has become a social media star after starring in a music video in which he raps about putting an end to domestic violence and child abuse. Darryl Snider, from Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles, wrote and produced the catchy rap hit Treat All Women With Respect for the video, which was released through his own production company DaddyDaDa Productions. The video itself, despite its dated content and low-budget production, has thus far received just over 350,000 hits on YouTube, turning Mr Snider AKA DaddyDaDa into an unlikely internet celebrity. Scroll down for video . Rap sensation: Darryl Snider AKA DaddyDaDa has turned into an overnight celebrity thanks to his bizarre music video Treat All Women With Respect . Positive message: The California-based lawyer is trying to put an end to domestic violence and child abuse . Clad in a retro-inspired leather jacket and backwards black cap, Mr Snider speaks out to men of all ages through his 'meaningful' rap song, encouraging them to step up to their responsibilities as a father, husband, boyfriend or son. 'Step to the plate and be a man,' he raps. 'Never hit a woman - or abuse a child. It’s just wrong - and illegal too. Someday it will catch up with you.' Mr Snider performs with an enthusiastic back-up band, which includes a drummer, singer, and a keyboard player turned flutist, and dances along to the music with complete confidence, as clips of different couples and families are flashed up on screen to illustrate his song. From a young man who shakes his girlfriend during an argument, to a father worrying about supporting his family, the clips display a variety of different situations in which domestic violence is present. R-E-S-P-E-C-T: The rapper warns that any acts of violence will eventually have dire consequences for the person responsible . Co-stars: The rapper stars in the video alongside a talented band, including this musician who showcases both his keyboard and flute playing abilities . Stay in school: Mr Snider encourages all young people to focus on their education . 'It's just odd': While the video has proved immensely popular on social media, some have questioned its rather bizarre content . Mr Snider also encourages anyone who has been affected by domestic violence or abuse, whether as a victim or an instigator, to try and turn their life around by focusing on their families and their education. 'Men, Women, Kids - take pride and have hope,' he urges. 'You have a bright future - and that’s the real dope. There’s redemption out there - just waiting for you, get an education and work hard too.' Although popular in terms of viewing figures, the video has divided opinion among online critics, some of whom are baffled by its content - and by its star. 'I think this is my cue for leaving the internet for a day or two,' one person commented on the video, while another added: 'You can't argue that this isn't a good message, it's just sorta odd, he's not really rapping just more like talking...' Others, however, have praised the senior citizen for being brave enough to put across such an important message. 'I appreciate that you are putting yourself out there to try to spread a positive message,' Heather Bartels wrote. 'Try to ignore all of the losers who have nothing in their lives better than posting hateful comments; their punishment is having to live their pathetic lives.' Support act: The video also features appearances from a variety of actors - and even a dance troupe . Go straight to jail: The song warns that domestic violence is likely to land you in prison . Fight the power: In the music video, women are seen taking charge and standing up against bullies . One, two, three, four: Mr Snider insists that there should be no more women on the floor . But, while the lawyer-turned-musician is no doubt enjoying his five minutes of fame, he is eager to ensure that the important message in his music video not be forgotten. 'This video was created to help get the message out that it's time to bring an end to domestic violence and sexual assault,' the YouTube description explains. And, having experienced such success with his first hit, Mr Snider is determined to capitalize on his five minutes of fame - and has already launched a Kickstarter page in order to fund the next DaddyDaDa hit. 'DaddyDaDa Productions is starting its second music video titled ""What on earth is happening?""' he writes on the page. 'This new music video will likely be done in positive rap (hip hop) or pop rock and explore current social issues, including further increasing public awareness of the need to stop domestic violence and abuse of women and children. 'The new project will also explore some basic questions about how we think, and how we treat our neighbors and friends in this day and age.' One, two, three four . No more women on the floor .

"How much would you pay for a car which is 18 years old and has been crashed – twice – by its not-so-careful owner? Well, if it’s Rowan Atkinson’s McLaren F1 that you have your eye on, you’ll need an astonishing £8million. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star has decided to part company with the 241mph British supercar which he bought new in 1997 for a then eye-watering £540,000. For sale: Rowan Atkinson poses with his F1 supercar, which was rebuilt by McLaren at a cost of £900,000 . Atkinson, 60, first pranged the three-seater by hitting a Rover Metro, then in 2011 he lost control on a slippery bend and smashed into a tree. That second crash ended in what is thought to be Britain’s highest ever single car insurance payout, with the vehicle costing £900,000 to be rebuilt by McLaren. It also put up his annual insurance to an estimated £60,000. But it seems that the accidents may have actually added to the value of the F1, which is now on the market with London dealer Taylor & Crawley, owned by David Clark, formerly a director at McLaren. Mr Clark said: ‘If I had the choice of buying a 1,000-mile McLaren F1 that has been hidden away or Rowan’s with 41,000 miles, I would take Rowan’s. It has the interesting history and this is what people look for. Prang: Atkinson's car following the 2011 crash. He lost control on a slippery bend and smashed into a tree . His car was destroyed after a crash (pictured) - but he successfully claimed £9,100 for repairs - the highest car insurance payout recorded in Britain . The actor escaped escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, but his vehicle was almost written-off . ‘A lot of cars are indicative of the people who own them, and a lot of serious car collectors own an F1 and that gives it great credibility. Jay Leno has one, Ralph Lauren has more than one.’ He added: ‘It is pretty much a brand-new car too after the work carried out by McLaren. It’s got full tax and MoT and is ready to go.’ Atkinson, who last year split from his wife of 23 years, Sunetra, said he had never seen the car as an investment. ‘I bought it for the quality of the thinking that went into its design, and now it has become a thing of value it is time for it to be enjoyed by someone else,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. Despite the accidents, the value of Atkinson's F1 has continued to soar and he has put it on the market for £8million . The front of the McLaren car was also wrecked in a collision with the rear of a Rover Metro in October 1999 . ‘It’s so quiet, so comfortable that you can use it, and enjoy it, on any journey. Most of the miles I have done in it are journeys you might do in any other car – going to Sainsbury’s or doing the school run. The comedian insisted the car was never bought as an investment and said he chose it because of the quality of the design . ‘What I enjoyed most about it when I first drove it was how lovely it was to drive slowly. To pootle is a pleasure.’ Shortly after buying the carbon-fibre car, Atkinson strapped his two young children into their child seats and they went on a five-hour drive to Cornwall for a holiday. The F1 is the world’s fastest non-turbocharged production car, doing 0-62mph in 3.2 seconds. It does an average 15 miles to the gallon – just six in the worst case – and the engine bay is lined with 25g of gold foil. However, driving it has not always been fun for the comic actor. He almost wrote it off in August 2011 when he veered off a slippery section of the A605 near Peterborough. It hit a tree and burst into flames. Atkinson escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, while most of the back of the F1 was destroyed and the 6.1-litre engine ended up 60ft away. More than a year of specialist repairs at McLaren’s base in Woking, Surrey, was needed to fix it. Mr Clark added: ‘Anyone who wants a wonderful car with a great story, which includes the accidents, then this F1 is a fantastic thing. Apart from the accidents, I think Rowan has enjoyed every minute with the F1 and I think he will have withdrawal when it is gone.’ Atkinson, said to be worth £71million, owns an impressive collection that includes a Honda NSX, a Jaguar Mk7, an Aston Martin DB2, a vintage Ford Falcon, a 1939 BMW 328 and a Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star has decided to part company with the 241mph British supercar which he bought new in 1997 for a then eye-watering £540,000. Above, the actor in character as Mr Bean . The Blackadder star said owning the car has been a 'partnership', pictured with Tony Robinson (left) and Adrian Edmondson (right) The Johnny English actor added to his extensive car collection with a Skoda Superb (pictured) Most cars start to depreciate the moment they leave the showroom, but luxury vehicles tend to increase in value. This is partly because manufacturers tightly control production, meaning there is a limited supply even for the super-rich. McLaren only ever built 64 F1s, all of them in the 1990s. The market value is also boosted by famous collectors adding to the allure of owning one – those with an F1 include Michael Schumacher and Eric Clapton. Atkinson’s F1 will also have jumped in value because it is virtually brand new having been rebuilt after his 2011 crash. The modern equivalent of the F1 is the McLaren P1, which went on sale for £866,000 in 2013 and now fetches up to £1.25million. Only 375 were made. The most expensive road car ever is believed to be a 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4S NART Spider which sold for £16.1million at auction in 2013.","Comedian Rowan Atkinson bought McLaren F1 in 1997 for £540,000 .

"David Eden Fett (pictured) was charged with multiple felonies after allegedly swinging a hatchet at his mother . A Florida man  allegedly threw his 70-year-old mother on the ground, beat her and swung a hatchet so close to her head  she felt the wind whistle across her face - all because she asked him to turn his music down. David Eden Fett, 47, was charged with multiple felonies after police responded to a call on Wednesday evening and found him standing outside a house. Fett, of Gainesville, told Deputy Joel Morris of the Alachua County Sheriff's Office  that his mother was inside the home. When Deputy Morris entered the house with Fett following along behind him, he found the victim wrapped up in a blanket looking 'very afraid'. He reported she repeatedly told him 'don't leave me'. Deputy Morris added the victim was 'shaking uncontrollably' and seemed 'very nervous'. The victim told Deputy Morris that her son was intoxicated, The Gainesville Sun reported. When another deputy removed Fett from the home, the woman told Deputy Morris her son 'became angry' after she asked him to turn down his music and swung a hatchet at her. He then allegedly tossed the hatchet away, threw her to the ground and 'struck her about ten times in the neck, stomach and legs.' She went on to reveal that Fett only left her alone after he sat on her while pinching her nose and covering her mouth. Fett, who was 'speaking irrationally' and having 'a difficult time staying on topic' said his mother was experiencing delusions and that he only swung the hatchet so he could 'get rid of it'. He was charged with aggravated battery on a person 65 years of age or older and domestic battery by strangulation. The ACSO also charged him with displaying a weapon during a felony and committing an act that could cause death.

"Talk about a rager. A fraternity that belongs to the University of Michigan have been forced to apologize to a ski resort after running amock last weekend and causing $50,000 worth of damage to the facility while doing so. The party occurred at the Treetops Resort in Dover Township, near Gaylord, and involved about 120 people spread across 45 rooms. 'I’ve been in this business for 30 years and it’s the worst condition of rooms that I’ve ever seen,' manager Barry Owens told USA Today. Animal house: The extent of the damage done to to the Dover Township resort was so severe the roof tiles collapsed into the hallways . 'There were broken ceiling tiles in the hallway, broken furniture, broken windows. 'There’s carpet that’s going to need to be replaced.” 'The rooms were just a pigsty. 'They caused an excessive amount of damage.' The fraternity at fault was named as Sigma Alpha Mu. Chapter President Joshua Kaplan says his members 'are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior' of some members. Wild: Treetops Resort say many rooms were completely trashed, with the damage about $50,000 . Smashed: The scene looked like someone had taken to many rooms with a hammer, with debris everywhere . Trouble: The resort is considering its options, including pursuing criminal charges against the fraternity . Resort staff said they asked the students to stop, but they didn't, and the extent of the damage is apalling . He told USA Today that his fraternity 'accepts full responsibility' and 'will be working with the management of the resort to pay for all damages and cleaning costs'. 'This behavior is inconsistent with the values, policies, and practices of this organization,' Kaplan said. 'We will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions.' University of Michigan fees are about $29,000 a year. Mr Owens said he has a meeting set up with University officials to discuss what happened at his resort, and pending the outcome of that meeting might pursue criminal action. He added that he has been able to keep place up-an-running, with other, untarnished rooms available because of the size of the resort. Scene: The fraternity at fault was named as Sigma Alpha Mu . UM Spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said in a statement to USA Today that the university “is very disappointed in the behavior of some of our students' and that those responsible will be held accountable. 'We expect full payment for all damages,' Fitzgerald. 'The local Greek chapters are in the process of notifying their national organizations, which could bring their own sanctions. 'We are confident the national organizations will take this seriously and will work through this situation in collaboration with the university.' The college: The cost of attending the University of Michigan is about $29,000 a year .","Party occurred at Treetops Resort in Dover Township, near Gaylord .

"Tax rises and benefit cuts passed by the Coalition have cost the average household £1,127 a year – with the poorest families with children the hardest hit, a new report has revealed. While the richest 10 per cent have lost the most in cash terms, poor parents have lost the most as a percentage of their income, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Middle earners and the very rich have escaped 'remarkably unscathed' from the Government's austerity programme - with those without children actually gaining financially from the changes, largely due to increases in the threshold for paying income tax, said the IFS. The richest 10 per cent have lost the most in cash terms since 2010, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said . But poor parents have lost the most as a percentage of their income, the respected economic think tank said . Pensioners were 'relatively unaffected' on average, as their gains from the 'triple lock' on the state pension were largely offset by the hike in VAT. Labour said the findings were proof of a 'clear betrayal' by David Cameron of his promise to lead the most family-friendly Government ever. Looking at these changes, the poorest households lost around 4 per cent of their incomes, compared with around 3.5 per cent for the next poorest tenth, between 2.5 per cent and zero for middle-income households and a loss of about 2.5 per cent for the richest. The IFS found that families with four or more children lost 6.9 per cent of their income as a result of the tax and benefit changes under study - an average £2,941 - compared with a loss of 4.5 per cent for three-child families, 3.5 per cent for those with two children, 2.6 per cent for those with one and 0.4 per cent for childless households. Non-working lone parents were the worst-hit household type, losing about £1,837 a year from the changes under study, though the IFS said the average loss was skewed upwards by a small number of households affected by measures such as the benefits cap and national caps on local housing allowance rates. Hardest-hit region was Greater London, where households lost an average £1,042, followed by the South East, West Midlands and North West. James Browne, a senior research economist at IFS and co-author of the report said: 'Whichever way you cut it, low-income households with children and the very richest households have lost out significantly from the changes as a percentage of their incomes. 'Increases in the tax-free personal allowance have played an important role in protecting middle-income working-age households meaning that those without children have actually gained overall.' The hardest-hit region  is Greater London, where households have lost an average £1,042 a year, followed by the South East, West Midlands and North West . The Chancellor George Osborne has introduced tax rises and benefit cuts costing the average family more than £1,000 a year . Labour Treasury spokeswoman Cathy Jamieson said: 'This report shows that tax and benefit changes under this Government have left households £1,127 a year worse off on average. 'Families with children have been hit hardest of all by David Cameron's choices - a clear betrayal of his promise to lead the most family-friendly government ever. 'For all the Government's claims, this report shows that they have raised tax by over £13.5 billion a year. And for millions of working people the rise in VAT and cuts to things like tax credits have more than offset changes to the personal allowance. 'The Tories are now promising to cut tax credits again for millions of working families and refusing to rule out another VAT rise to pay for their unfunded promises. It's clear working people can't afford five more years of this Government. 'Labour's economic plan will ensure we earn our way to rising living standards for all and balance the books in a fairer way. We will reverse this Government's £3 billion-a-year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners and help 24 million working people with a lower 10p starting rate of tax.' A Treasury spokeswoman said: 'Today's report from the IFS confirms that the richest have lost the most from the Government's changes to taxes and welfare. 'Treasury analysis has shown throughout the Parliament that the richest 10 per cent of households have made the largest contribution to reducing the deficit. 'The Treasury presents the most complete, rigorous and detailed record of the impact of this Government's policies on households. At the Autumn Statement this confirmed that the richest 20 per cent of households will contribute more to reducing the deficit than the remaining 80 per cent put together. 'Fairness is at the heart of our approach to reducing the deficit. Our analysis shows how our commitment to fairness is not a matter of rhetoric: it is reflected in the policy choices we have made. 'UK income inequality is now lower than when this Government came into office and the recovery is being felt across the country. But the only sustainable way to raise living standards for all is to keep working through the plan that is securing a better future across the country.'","Richest 10% have lost most in cash terms, Institute for Fiscal Studies said .

"The flogging of a Saudi blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for criticising clerics  may be stopped and he could have his jail sentence reduced, it has been claimed. Dr Elham Manea, spokesperson for Raif Badawi's family and a professor at the University of Zurich, said the Saudi ambassador in Germany had told a broadcaster of the development. In a posting on her Facebook page, she wrote: 'Saudi ambassador in Germany informed NDR-TV that flogging will not continue and #RaifBadawi maybe not (sic) have to serve the whole time in prison.' Scroll down for video . Elham Manea's Facebook post claimed the flogging was to be stopped and his 10-year jail sentence reduced . Raif Badawi (pictured) was handed down the sentence after criticising the country's Sunni clerics on his blog . Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone purported to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi was hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch . It comes just a day after the second round of the 31-year-old's flogging, due to take place today, was postponed a second time due to medical concerns. Only a few days ago Saudi Arabia was accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' after it initially delayed the father of three's flogging sentence so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again. Saudi Arabia has come under huge international pressure after Mr Badawi's plight was championed by human rights campaigners. The 31-year-old won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to the hefty jail time, a £177,000 fine and the lashes. His official crime was to insult Islam but supporters say his real offence was to criticise the country's powerful Sunni clerics on his blog. He faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks. If it's true that his prison sentence has been reduced and flogging finished, it will be considered a small victory for his supporters after they made repeated calls for the 'torture' to be unconditionally stopped. Mr Badawi and his wife Ensaf Haidar pictured together while they were both still living in Saudi Arabia .

Mr Badawi's wife has fled to Canada with their children. She says he started a forum that was simply meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me.' UN officials say the flogging breaches international law as a 'cruel and unusual punishment' and the Foreign Office has said it would continue to raise the case.","Raif Badawi is facing 1,000 lashes and 10 years in jail for blog postings .

"Alexandra Aitken has been seen wandering barefoot in the Punjab (above) after reportedly separating from her Sikh 'warrior' partner . The report in a Punjabi newspaper does not mince words. It talks of a ‘crazed’ Englishwoman arousing concerns for her safety in the Sikh holy city of Anandpur Sahib in India. It claims that in the confines of a Sikh temple, she has been seen bathing in sacred pools ‘without clothes’ — which, if true, is an outrageous act in such a conservative, deeply spiritual society — and keeping her underwear near the holy book, akin to sacrilege. Lately, it states, she has been seen wandering around in the streets, bazaars and temples alone, like a ‘crazed person’, and has become the talk of the town. Baba Gurdev Singh Ji, chief executor of the Shaheedi Bagh Sikh temple, is quoted asking for the UK High Commission to take her back and hand her over to her family. ‘If someone misbehaves with this foreign woman,’ he is reported saying, ‘then India will gain a bad reputation.’ The article — which claims the woman was left by her husband — suggests that some locals are worried she could be a British government spy, so bizarre is her behaviour. So who is this woman, the source of such worrying gossip? None other than former socialite Alexandra Aitken, daughter of disgraced former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken and Sikh convert who now goes by the name of Uttrang Kaur Khalsa. The unsubstantiated report, published in November, couldn’t be in starker contrast to the glossy 2010 Hello! magazine spread celebrating the marriage of the former ‘It-girl’, now 34, and Inderjot Singh, a Sikh ‘warrior’ from the Punjab. It was an unlikely union from the start — Alexandra’s life once centred on Mayfair parties, posh boys and polo — and rumours it was in trouble have been rife for months. Last weekend, Alexandra’s father finally confirmed it was over and that the couple, who met at a yoga retreat in the Punjabi holy city of Amritsar, were now ‘detached’ — if, indeed, they were ever legally married. Although they affirmed their commitment to each other in a ceremony in Amritsar attended by 150 holy men and 300 guests, there is doubt that the marriage was ever officially registered. According to a report in the Tribune newspaper last September, the union came under strain when Alexandra did not appear before a magistrate to register the marriage and didn’t attend the funeral of Inderjot’s father. This week, approached by the Mail as she attended a Sikh festival, Alexandra politely declined to comment on her marriage or the report of naked bathing in holy pools (Sikh women usually go in fully clothed). ‘I am really happy that you approached to speak with me, but I do not wish to speak to anyone. Have a nice day,’ she said, before disappearing into the crowd. While the marriage may be over, Alexandra’s passion for her adopted religion remains undimmed. It is thought to be why she remains in Anandpur Sahib, even if her presence appears to cause consternation to other residents of the sleepy ‘Holy City of Bliss’. Here, she is one of the few, if not the only, unattached Western woman in the 16,000 population — such a rarity that police apparently turned up at her lodgings recently to ask why she was there and check all was well. According to a police officer, she was asked to fill out a foreigner’s registration form — to ensure the safety of foreign nationals — on which she listed her status as ‘unmarried’ and named her father as an emergency contact. She then asked to be left alone. Home for the privately educated art school graduate for the past few months has been a £12-a-night room in a guest house, with nothing more than a bed, toilet and TV. Transformation: Alexandra at a London film premiere in 2003 (left) and with Inderjot after their 'marriage' Described by staff as ‘kind-hearted’, she is so environmentally conscious that she asks them ‘not to waste water and electricity’. ‘Madam doesn’t talk much,’ said one. ‘She keeps to herself most of the time, but she would get really angry if someone left the lights on during the day. She would make sure the taps in her room never dripped water.’ According to locals, Alexandra first stayed in Anandpur Sahib last year with her husband, a member of a Sikh order called the Nihang. When she returned six months ago, however, she was alone. For a month she stayed in a dera, or Sikh seminary, before moving into lodgings. Inderdeep Singh, a caretaker at the Keshgarh Sikh temple attended by Alexandra, told us: ‘I was told that her husband was a Nihang and that they had a break-up. ‘So when she came here, I could see she was heartbroken. In this house of God, she found peace. Since then she comes to prayers at the gurdwara (temple) regularly.’ Jonathan Aitken, 72, told the Mail: ‘My daughter is still a very devoted Sikh and I am personally still on good terms with Inderjot. Miss Aitken's father told the Mail she remains a devoted Sikh despite separating from her Indian 'husband' ‘They remain friends, but the marriage is not working in any sense that we would understand, and there is considerable doubt whether it was a lawful marriage ceremony — or so I am told.’ Dismissing reports of her ‘crazed’ behaviour as ‘nonsense’, he said: ‘She likes to maintain her privacy. She doesn’t have a mobile and it’s hard to get hold of her. She tries to stay clear of the world. ‘I’m absolutely confident that she is safe and knows what she is doing. She has lodgings which my ex-wife and I pay the rent for. ‘She was here in Britain until October and has been visited by several people since who have all said that she is safe and happy.’ H e later confirmed: ‘They were not married and are now detached. It was more a colourful, folklore ceremony than a proper one. I think both sides know the marriage is over, if it ever was a marriage.’ Certainly Alexandra’s faith appears to be deeply held. Last month, she posted a new profile picture on Facebook showing herself wearing a Sikh turban. Completely divorced from her old life of London parties — dwarves dressed in Dennis the Menace outfits once served up toffee vodkas for guests at her 22nd birthday bash — Alexandra is devoted to spreading Sikh principles and extols the Punjabi way of living on two websites. The former actress, who once posed naked for GQ magazine, now writes about the benefits of wearing a chunni (long scarf) made of cotton rather than silk because it is ‘cooling and calming for the mind’. Mr Aitken added he remained on good terms with his daughter's former partner . Devoted to charitable work and helping the poor, she has a vision of building schools, hospitals and meditation centres. In 2013, her father revealed that when she returned to Britain to visit she refused to sleep in a bedroom, instead camping in the garden of her aunt, actress Maria Aitken, so she could lie on the earth. ‘It’s all part of being close to the soil,’ said Mr Aitken. ‘I find it very hard to get my head around all this, but I love her dearly.’ Formerly effusive about her ‘noble’ husband and their shared spirituality, Alexandra has kept quiet since their ‘rough patch’ became public knowledge. ‘Many believe, don’t talk unless it improves on silence,’ is all she would say. Asked about her marriage at a Sikh conference in London in 2013, she became defensive and finally replied: ‘God is my true love.’ Perhaps the only clue to what went wrong can be found in a cryptic message posted on the Nihangi website for which she occasionally writes. Under the heading ‘A Biography — Uttrang Kaur Khalsa’ are the simple words: A Lover. The Wife. The Student. The Hopeful Listener. Forgive me. Sat Siri Akal (God is the Ultimate Truth). A family friend said that Alexandra had been wrestling with the fact that, apart from their faith, she and Inderjot had very little in common: she saw herself as a free spirit, in touch with Nature, while he was more traditional and felt that her place was at home with him. ‘There’s a feeling among her friends and family that she rushed into marriage,’ says the friend. Alexandra and Inderjot met in 2009 and it was her love of Kundalini yoga, which is associated with Sikhism, that first drew her to the religion. By then her privileged upbringing had been shattered after her father was jailed for 18 months in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice. She had also discovered that her friend Petrina Khashoggi was, in fact, her half-sister — the result of an affair between Jonathan and Soraya Khashoggi. ‘She couldn’t be more different from the girl who used to walk down Sloane Street,’ said one old friend. ‘She looks unkempt, she doesn’t cut her hair and when she was here she was telling everyone what they should and shouldn’t eat.’ Yet, despite the end of her short-lived marriage, is she happy? Her father certainly believes so. And so does Alexandra.","Indian reports claim Alexandra Aitken has separated from her husband .

"Charged: Christopher Phillips is the man Canadian police arrested this morning in connection to a chemical threat in Nova Scotia . The ex-husband of decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller appeared in court Friday over an investigation into hazardous chemicals in Nova Scotia. Police allege Christopher Burton Phillips, 42, possessed a chemical called osmium tetroxide for a dangerous purpose. The discovery of hazardous chemicals prompted the evacuation of two neighborhoods in Halifax this week and an Ottawa hotel where Phillips was arrested. Royal Canadian Mounted Police refused to identify the suspect who was apprehended at a hotel in Ottowa on Wednesday. However Miller's business manager confirmed the wanted man was her ex-husband Christopher Phillips, an American former biochemical weapons expert. Phillips had been charged with uttering threats against police and possessing a dangerous chemical, and was remanded into custody Friday. He will next appear in court on January 29. The hunt for Phillips began Tuesday after police found large quantities of dangerous chemicals at two Nova Scotia homes connected to his family. His current wife warned police that he was on his way to Ottowa, about a 14 hour drive west, in a van that could possibly be packed with even more hazardous materials. A Canada-wide alert issued Tuesday night stated that the suspect was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues. After Phillips' van was spotted in the parking lot of an Ottowa hotel Tuesday night, the building was evacuated and he was arrested without incident the following morning. A subsequent search found no chemicals at the hotel or in his van. Court documents allege the offenses took place between Dec. 26 and Jan. 21 in a Halifax suburb. Police did not elaborate on the charges. Happier times: U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller and ex-husband Christopher Phillips are pictured on their wedding day in June 1999. Phillips has been charged with threatening police and possession of dangerous chemicals . Dangerous: An arrest warrant was issued for Phillips Wednesday morning after hazardous materials were found at two properties connected to his family in  Nova Scotia, and his wife called police to inform them that he was travelling to Ottowa. Above, a member of the RCMP  explosive disposal unit prepares to enter a residence in Cole Harbour, a Halifax suburb, on Tuesday . Stockpiles: The above cottage in Grand Desert is one of  two homes where authorities found hazardous chemicals. Firefighters and other emergency personnel seen gathered around the building on Wednesday. Authorities would not say what type of chemical was found inside, or how much . Arrested: Phillips was tracked down to a hotel in Ottowa on Tuesday night, and he surrendered to police without incident the following morning - his 42nd birthday. Ambulances and police are shown at the scene on Wednesday . Phillips, a former ophthalmologist, married U.S. Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller in June 1999, three years after she won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics. However, they separated in 2004 and officially divorced in 2006 and Phillips later moved to Canada. 'I'm thankful that the brave men and women of the Ottawa police department and other law enforcement agencies were able to apprehend him and (defuse) the situation without incident,' Miller said in a statement released by her manager, Nick Furris. Miller now works as a motivational speaker. Decorated athlete: Phillips and Miller have been divorced since 2006.

Champion: Miller won two gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia Olympics. Pictured above practicing her floor exercises at the games . Police in Nova Scotia were first alerted to a possible threat Monday night around 9:20pm when they received a call about a suspicious package at a local home. They went on to investigate three homes connected to Phillips in two neighborhoods which were evacuated over the dangerous materials thought to be inside. Of the three buildings searched Tuesday, 'hazardous and volatile' materials were found in two - one home on Lakeridge Crescent owned by Phillips' current wife Gosia Phillips and a cottage on Dyke Road registered to a Marian Sue Phillips of El Reno, Oklahoma. It's unclear the relationship between Marian and the suspect. 'The chemicals are of a nature that we need to employ a chemist to help us identify what type of chemicals that they are,' RCMP Corporal Greg Churcd said of the materials found in the cottage. Police would not elaborate on how many chemicals were found, or what type. However, residents in  the Grand Desert neighborhood of the Dyke Road cottage remained evacuated Wednesday evening. Suiting up: A member of  the RCMP explosive disposal unit prepares to enter a residence in Cole Harbour, a Halifax suburb, on Tuesday. Police evacuated homes within 100 meters of the house after finding a suspicious package . Family connections: Another home registered to Phillips' wife Gosia on Lakeridge Road was found with chemicals as well. Above, the cottage on Dyke Road where 'large quantities' of chemicals were found and a mass evacuation was issued . Leaving: Residents in Cole Harbour flee their homes with a few belongings on Tuesday after reports of a suspicious package at a local home . Do not disturb: Those staying at the Chimo Hotel (pictured above) were told to quietly leave their rooms Tuesday night after it was suspected Phillips might have brought chemicals into the building. No hazardous materials were found, but police were able to apprehend Phillips staying in one of the rooms . Gosia Phillips allegedly told police that her husband was en route to Ottowa in a Chevy cube van, that was feared to be packed with even more dangerous chemicals. Police issued a Canada-wide alert for the van Tuesday night, saying the suspect driver was an ex-military weapons specialist with possible mental health issues and an 'anti-police' attitude. 'Person reported to have mental health issues/PTSD and has issues with law enforcement personnel. Person may have chemicals or hazardous materials in the vehicle,' the report read. It was later revealed that police believed Phillips was carrying the chemicals osmium and osmium tetroxide in his van. The lab chemicals are highly dangerous and can easily penetrate the skin. About a decade ago, the chemicals were feared as a possible terrorist weapon. Around 10pm, an Ottowa police officer spotted a van matching the description in the parking lot of the Chimo Hotel. All of the guests were called and told to quietly evacuate so police could search the building for chemicals and the suspect. Authorities also closed down several roads surrounding the hotel as a precaution. Phillips was apprehended the following morning - his 42nd birthday - without incident from a room on the sixth floor of the hotel. Police finished searching the building and Phillips' van later that afternoon without finding any chemicals. Phillips LinkedIn page shows a diverse academic background with advanced degrees in medicine, law and business. Re-married: Phillips pictured above in a picture posted to Facebook. He is reportedly married to Harvard University-educated a sleep doctor named Gosia Phillips . He studied medicine at the University of Oklahoma and Boston University before pursuing opthamology at the University of Texas. He also has a law degree and MBA from Suffolk University. It has been reported that Phillips was a former biomedical weapons expert for the U.S. Army. However, the U.S. military says they have no record of Phillips, though the records only date back to 1999. His LinkedIn page lists his current job as the manager of Neurology and Sleep Medicine Associates Inc, which was searched Tuesday and found to contain no hazardous materials. His wife Gosia Phillips is equally accomplished. She attended Harvard University and is a specialist in sleep medicine, in addition to teaching medicine at Dalhousie University. Records show that Gosia Phillips changed her name from Malgorzata Ewa Klonowska in February 2010. Before he moved to Canada and married Gosia, Phillips' career appears to have been plagued by complaints of botched surgeries. The Washington State Health Department investigated Phillips over several complaints from former patients at his laser eye care clinic and he eventually agreed not to renew his expired license to practice. And in 2008, Phillips reportedly stopped going to work because of psychiatric issues. According to a documents obtained by the Ottowa Citizen, Phillips was hospitalized between March 3 and March 7, 2008 and March 22 and April 18, 2008 for an unknown psychiatric diagnosis. 'The records from this hospitalization contain diagnoses which would make it very difficult or impossible for (Phillips) to obtain employment as an expert witness,' the documents state. Nova Scotia court records also show that Phillips was charged for uttering threats and possession of a weapon between December 26 and Wednesday.","The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Christopher Phillips, 42, Wednesday morning .

"Broadcasters last night threatened to go ahead with televised election debates with or without David Cameron. The ‘take it or leave it’ offer by BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 came as bosses published revised plans that will now involve the leaders of seven parties. Along with the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and Ukip, TV executives have extended the invitation to the Green Party, the Scottish Nationalist Party and Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. Scroll down for video . Tory leader David Cameron has come under pressure to sign up to debates with Lib Dem Nick Clegg and Labour's Ed Miliband . The new plan also includes (left to right) Ukip's Nigel Farage, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon Green leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood . The PM had thrown scheduling plans into chaos after refusing to take part unless Green leader Natalie Bennett was offered a place at the podium. Her inclusion will now put pressure on Downing Street to agree to the debates – even though ongoing unrest among other smaller and regional parties threatens to scupper the screenings altogether. Broadcasters last night said they had made the changes after reviewing the ‘electoral landscape’ but issued a clear warning that they would ‘empty chair’ any leader who refused to turn up. The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown . A spokesman for the TV companies said: ‘The party leaders will be formally invited to take part in these debates. In the event that any of the invited party leaders decline to participate, debates will take place with the party leaders who accept the invitation.’ The schedule will now feature two debates involving all seven leaders – one on BBC and one on ITV. Channel 4/Sky News . Candidates: David Cameron and Ed Miliband . Host: Jeremy Paxman . BBC . Candidates: David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg . Host: David Dimbleby . ITV .

Candidates: David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood . Host: Julie Etchingham . A third, on Channel 4 and Sky, will be a head-to-head clash between Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband only. The Tories last night said the proposals were ‘being considered as part of the on-going discussions about the debates’. The new format appears less favourable to Mr Miliband, however, who will have to face several other parties that are directly challenging him for votes and seats. Labour immediately insisted he would debate ‘anyone the broadcasters choose to invite’, claiming it was ‘surely now not possible’ for Mr Cameron to oppose participation in the debates. The Lib Dems, who find themselves reduced to minor party status within the new television format, strongly opposed the latest plans. They insisted that Nick Clegg – who triumphed in the debates before the last election in 2010 – deserved to feature in all the screenings because the Lib Dems are in government and want to ‘defend their record’. Ukip leader Nigel Farage also opposed the inclusion of other minor parties. He told ITV News: ‘What is the point of having the four major parties as defined by Ofcom and then Uncle Tom Cobley and all? ‘You can’t have a debate with seven people on the podium. 'And if you’re going to have seven, you’ve got to have the Northern Irish DUP (Democratic Unionist Party). 'They, after all, are the fourth biggest party in Parliament.’ The DUP’s leader, Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, wrote to the broadcasters yesterday describing the new format as ‘unacceptable’. He said: ‘In light of the extension of the debates to smaller and regional parties, the failure of the broadcasters to invite the DUP to participate is inexplicable. ‘The broadcasters’ decision cannot logically or legally be defended.’ Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Peter Robinson said he would be writing to the BBC and ITV demanding an explanation for the exclusion . In a further potential hurdle, Sinn Fein – whose elected MPs do not even attend Parliament – said it would challenge any attempt to exclude it from the debates. A party spokesman said: ‘Sinn Fein will take every opportunity to present and promote its policies and positions.’ George Galloway, the Respect Party’s sole MP, has also demanded his inclusion. The original proposal was for one debate featuring the PM and Ed Miliband, a second including Mr Clegg and a third with the addition of Ukip leader Nigel Farage. The row over the exclusion of the Greens has sparked an apparent surge in support for the party, which saw it pick up several points in the polls and thousands of new members. Leader Miss Bennett described the decision to include her party as ‘groundbreaking’ and the apparent surge in support as a ‘Green Spring’. The group of major broadcasters said that since the initial proposal they had monitored ‘the electoral landscape’ and taken into account polling data and ‘expressions of public support for the debates to go ahead and for a wider range of parties to be included in the debates’. The proposed dates for the debates are April 2, 16 and 30 – with the final clash exactly a week ahead of the General Election poll on May 7.","Broadcasters agree to David Cameron's demand for a role for the Greens .

"Porn star: Lisa Bell, pictured, who made extra money by posting racy photographs of herself online, could face jail time after being convicted . A porn star and her mother stole more than £500,000 from a 91-year-old widow by 'grossly' overcharging her for her care, which they were not qualified to give. Lisa Bell, 30, and her 57-year-old mother Wendy Bell could now face jail time after they were convicted of plotting to defraud Audrey Hammond, who suffers from Parkinson's disease. Wendy Bell and another woman, Amanda Carroll - who pleaded guilty to fraud charges at an earlier hearing - scammed Mrs Hammond after setting out to 'milk' her of every penny they could. They charged up to £121 an hour for round-the-clock care, roping in friends and family to help and taking over Mrs Hammond’s Grade II-listed home in a Yorkshire village. They even ran a burger van business from the property, Bradford Crown Court heard. Computers were bought for staff, carpets were damaged, and expensive cars parked outside. Lisa Bell, from Cullingworth, West Yorkshire, once arrived late for a morning shift in a BMW, still wearing full make-up, a mini-skirt and high heels. Another time she was found sleeping as she sunbathed while on duty, the court heard. She told police that she supplemented her income as a carer by running a private porn website. The site charges visitors more than £20 a month to view racy photos and videos of Lisa Bell either naked or in lingerie. Mrs Hammond’s late husband amassed a ‘considerable fortune’ in his coal merchant business and left her land and fishing rights in the Yorkshire Dales. But the carers siphoned off hundreds of thousands by overcharging, putting in fake petty cash claims and claiming for ‘ghost’ workers. Wendy Bell and Carroll ‘thought they were utterly untouchable’ and used a number of bank accounts for ‘money laundering on a substantial scale’, said prosecutor Stephen Wood. Mr Wood previously told the court the case ‘is all about greed’. He added: ‘These defendants … breached the trust reposed in them to simply milk from that lady over half a million pounds by grossly over-claiming for work. ‘Mrs Hammond was subjected to a cruel and heartless fraud.’ Mrs Hammond was diagnosed with debilitating Parkinson’s some years ago. She gave power of attorney to her solicitor, Myron Handzij, allowing him to write cheques on her behalf. She was initially cared for by her niece Anne Murgatroyd, a retired nurse. Wendy Bell was hired via a care agency to help. Wendy Bell (left today) and another woman, Amanda Carroll, scammed Mrs Hammond after setting out to 'milk' her of every penny they could. Right, Helen Banks was cleared at Bradford Crown Court today . In 2006, Mrs Murgatroyd fell ill and Mrs Hammond hired Bell and the others full-time at £8 an hour, paying them directly to avoid giving the agency a cut. Wendy Bell took a lead role in arranging the cover, the court heard. Mr Handzij was then asked to pay the inflated wages. ‘All requests for payment were met, regrettably it seems without question,’ Mr Wood said. Not one of the carers Wendy Bell recruited was qualified to look after a Parkinson’s patient. Amanda Carroll (pictured) and Wendy Bell charged Mrs Hammond up to £121 an hour for round-the-clock care, which they were not qualified to give . None of them had a contract, were legally registered, had any Criminal Records Bureau checks done or paid tax on their wages. When a qualified carer, Vanessa Ingham, did a shift at the house, she was shocked to find no care plan or medication chart. In one year, Wendy Bell earned £54,600, while Carroll’s £75,600 pay was at a rate of £121 an hour. When police first investigated in September 2012, the group were charging Mrs Hammond £35,000 a month. That fell to £20,000 as soon as an agency took over. Wendy and Lisa Bell, who were both charged with conspiracy to defraud, showed no emotion as the foreman announced the guilty verdicts. Helen Banks, 42, of Riddlesden, West Yorkshire, was cleared at Bradford Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud Mrs Hammond. Judge Colin Burn told Wendy Bell, who was also found guilty of one charge of fraud, that a jail sentence was 'absolutely unavoidable'. He said: 'You have both been convicted by the jury at the end of this lengthy trail of these serious matters. 'Particularly in your case Wendy Bell, by virtue of the amounts involved, a custodial sentence is absolutely unavoidable.' Carroll, 44, of Shipley, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud and one charge of conspiracy to defraud at an earlier hearing. Linda Mynott, 60, Caron Gilbert, 33, and Alice Barker, 59, all from Keighley, West Yorkshire, all admitted conspiracy to defraud. All the defendants will be sentenced at Bradford Crown Court on February 13.","Lisa and Wendy Bell stole more than £500k from widow Audrey Hammond .

"Samantha Cameron's stepfather Viscount Astor has warned of an 'ugly rush' on overseas aid spending . The Government’s overseas aid target is creating an ‘ugly rush’ to spend billions of pounds, Samantha Cameron’s stepfather warned last night. Viscount Astor said a recent report by the National Audit Office, which revealed ministers had to spend an extra £1billion at the end of 2013 to hit the target, underlined the danger of fixing such goals in law. Legislation requiring future governments to continue spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on foreign aid moved a step closer yesterday with a second reading in the House of Lords. But several senior peers spoke out against the move, which required a 30 per cent increase in Britain’s aid budget in 2013 to £11.5billion. Lord Astor, who is married to Mrs Cameron’s mother Annabel, said he supported foreign aid spending, but it was a mistake to enshrine the target in law. The issue should be a ‘matter of policy rather than law’, he added, and the NAO report showed a target could produce an ‘ugly rush’ to spend money at the end of the year in a ‘panic’. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson said the new law was ‘against both the national interest and, ultimately, the interests of people in poor countries’. Labour peer Lord Lipsey said singling out particular items of public expenditure for ‘special treatment’ could only have ‘disastrous’ results. Protecting some programmes would lead to bigger cuts in unprotected areas, he added. ‘This is a mad way to run the public finances.’ Lord Lipsey said the NAO report showed money had been ‘rushed out’ to meet the aid target and led to people doing ‘stupid things’. Former Tory EU Commissioner Lord Tugendhat said he accepted that British aid had an important part to play in tackling global poverty, but it was ‘never a good idea’ to set a target that would be binding. ‘It will deprive government of flexibility to respond to changing circumstances,’ he added. David Cameron (pictured with wife Samantha) adopted the pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on foreign aid before the last election, as part of his drive to ‘detoxify’ the Conservative Party . But former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Fowler backed the Bill, saying it was ‘what I would expect from a civilised and outward-looking country that recognises it has responsibilities to try to help the position of the poorest people in other parts of the world’. David Cameron adopted the pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on foreign aid before the last election, as part of his drive to ‘detoxify’ the Conservative Party. The Lib Dem peer Lord Purvis of Tweed, who introduced the Bill, said the measure was in Britain’s ‘long-term interests’ and would ‘play a major role in securing a long-term level of support for those in the world most in need’.","Viscount Astor is married to Samantha Cameron's mother Annabel .

'Everybody is sexy in their own way and personality is all that matters. You have to have a heart, that's really all it takes to be sexy in my book. 'During my first week of dancing I made $1,000 in one week, so I decided to make a living out of it.' Since then Kat has appeared in clubs all over the U.S. as 'Kat the Midget Stripper' and also dances at birthdays and bachelor parties. While her profession is controversial for some - her family are generally supportive of what she does. Her mother even hand-makes her stripper outfits, which don't come in her size. However, Kat's sister, Renee, is less enthusiastic. Renee said: 'I've been to her shows before and they don't go there to see her, they go there to laugh at her. Support: While her profession is controversial for some - her family are generally supportive of what she does . Happy couple: There is no word on when Kat and Eich will marry . 'This job has taught me to appreciate my body and who I am - I'm so glad I found it,' Kat says of stripping . 'It hurts a lot watching that because that's my baby sister. I wish she would stop but I don't think she will.' But Kat has no plans to leave the stripping business just yet. She says her fiance doesn't mind what she does for a living and could never get her to stop anyway. The brunette concluded: 'I give myself five more years if not longer. 'It just depends on how much the world wants to work my joints on the stage in the next few years. We'll see how long I last. 'This job has taught me to appreciate my body and who I am - I'm so glad I found it.' Whirlwind romance: Kat's fiance Eich is a soldier in the U.S. army and enjoys wrestling in his spare time .

"Tanya Frankum, 23, (pictured) has been jailed for more than four years for tipping a disabled pensioner out of her wheelchair to steal just £20 . A 23-year-old woman has been jailed for more than four years after she tipped a disabled pensioner out of her wheelchair - just to steal £20. Tanya Frankum offered to help Patricia Haskins, 67, when she found herself alone in Worcester city centre on August 26 last year. But instead of playing the Good Samaritan, Frankum wheeled her towards the River Severn close to the cathedral. There she tipped the pensioner - who suffers from a development disability - on to the ground before making off with her handbag and purse. Miss Haskins was later discovered by a member of the public in distress and helpless on the ground and was later treated for injuries to her knees. On Wednesday, Frankum admitted robbery and was jailed for three years and nine months at Worcester Crown Court. She was also imprisoned for an additional six months to run consecutively for an assault on a woman at a hostel in Worcester, for which she had previously been given a community order. Sentencing, Judge Michael Cullum said: 'You deliberately took her the wrong way and, in an absolutely shameful act, tipped that woman out of her wheelchair, robbed her then left her helpless. 'That was a wicked act. That vile abuse was bound to affect the independence of her victim.' He added that Miss Haskins had placed her trust in Frankum to get her home and said there was 'no excuse for such a callous act.' Jason Aris, for the prosecution, said Frankum acted around 10.15pm after offering to help the pensioner, whom she knew. He added: 'Before she could get her bearings, this defendant tipped Miss Haskins on to the ground and took her handbag and her purse, which was attached to Miss Haskins' belt.' Frankum wheeled Miss Haskins towards the River Severn near the Worcester cathedral (pictured) - before tipping over her wheelchair and leaving her stranded on the floor - she suffered injuries to her knees . Frankum admitted robbery and was jailed for three years and nine months at Worcester Crown Court (pictured). She was also imprisoned for a further six months to run consecutively for an assault on a woman . After she was arrested, Frankum claimed the man she was with had robbed Miss Haskins and she had gone to help the pensioner. But the man present at the incident was never charged and has since died, the court heard. Brendan Reedy, defending, admitted it had been a 'nasty and mean' offence to tip someone out of a wheelchair. But he said Frankum, who appeared via video-link from Eastwood Park prison, Gloucestershire, had been living 'back on the streets' and was in an emotional state because her baby had been taken away by social services. After the hearing, a spokesman for West Mercia Police said: 'We are pleased with the result from the Crown Court in this unprovoked crime which was carried out against a vulnerable and defenceless member of the community.'","Tanya Frankum, 23, offered to help wheelchair-bound Patricia Haskins, 67 .

"The death of an 11-year-old aboriginal girl with leukemia who died less than a year after her family allowed her to stop chemotherapy will be investigated by a local coroner. Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, died on Monday after suffering a stroke the day before. Her grief-stricken family blamed her death on the three-month course of chemotherapy she underwent last year for  leukemia, before she chose to stop the treatment. In a statement, they said the young cancer sufferer had been improving with traditional healing methods but the chemotherapy had damaged her body. Scroll down for video . Visions: Cancer-stricken Makayla Sault, who refused chemotherapy, said Jesus came to her and told her she was healed in this YouTube clip made in May. She died on Monday, her family said in a statement . Her parents, pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, told the Two Row Times: 'Makayla was on her way to wellness, bravely fighting toward holistic well-being after the harsh side effects that 12 weeks of chemotherapy inflicted on her body. 'Chemotherapy did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs. This was the cause of the stroke. We continue to support Makayla's choice to leave chemotherapy. 'At this time we request privacy from the media while we mourn this tragic loss. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 and suffered weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer. The grueling weeks of the chemo sent her cancer into remission. However doctors said that in order to rid Makayla of the cancer completely, she needed to undergo two years of treatment which would give her a 75 per cent chance of survival. Makayla's parents allowed their daughter to give up the chemo, a move that prompted doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton where Makayla was being treated to alert children's authorities. The family were investigated by a division of Canada's Children’s Aid Society, who decided to allow them to continue to care for Makayla without requiring the chemotherapy treatments. Makayla stopped chemo after 12 weeks of treatment when she was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January 2014 . The office of the chief coroner in Ontario confirmed there was now an ongoing investigation into Makayla’s death, but a spokesman said it was a routine investigation sparked by the earlier Children’s Aid Society probe. In May, Makayla read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her she was already healed. The Saults took Makayla home, weakened and 10lb lighter, to recover for two weeks after her first treatment. 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore. 'I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla said in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she said. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she added. Also during that time, Makayla said she had a vision of Jesus, flanked by two angels, who told her she was already healed, and not to be afraid. According to Two Row Times, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples asserts that indigenous people have the right to use traditional medicines and health care practices without discrimination. Parents Ken and Sonya Sault said in a statement this week that chemotherapy did irreversible damage to their daughter's heart and major organs .","Makayla Sault, from the New Credit First Nation reserve in Ontario, Canada, suffered a stroke on Sunday and died the following day .

"Patients inject the drug into their stomach before breakfast every day. It works by suppressing appetite. (File image) A diet jab that can help women drop two dress sizes was approved by watchdogs yesterday. Described by doctors as life-changing, liraglutide could be on prescription in months. Slimmers typically lose almost a stone more than they would by simply counting calories and exercising more. Some severely obese patients dropped so much weight they ditched their wheelchairs and walked for the first time in years. Packing almost twice the power of rival drugs, liraglutide also lowers blood pressure, raises good cholesterol and prevents diabetes. It even produces a feel-good factor, making dieting a pleasure. Liraglutide’s maker, Novo Nordisk of Denmark, will apply for it to be prescribed on the NHS after yesterday’s ruling by the European drugs regulator that it is safe and effective. There are fears however that Nice – Britain’s drugs rationing body – will judge it too expensive for routine use. Liraglutide costs from £2.25 a day – roughly double the price of Orlistat, the only other prescription diet drug. Patients inject the drug into their  stomach before breakfast every day. It works by suppressing appetite. Obesity levels have doubled over the past two decades, making the UK the second-fattest nation in Europe. Being obese can knock up to nine years off a lifespan and raises the risk of a host of health problems including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Liraglutide, which will be given the brand name Saxenda, is already used at a lower dose to treat diabetes. Based on a hormone found in the gut, it sends signals to the brain that trick it into feeling full. As a result, people eat 10 per cent less food than normal. In trials, men and women who injected themselves daily lost an average of 19lb in 12 months. This is almost a stone more than they would lose by being on a diet and upping their exercise. And one third shed 23lb – more than a stone and a half. For a 14 stone woman, it would usually mean dropping two dress sizes. The drug which, like insulin, comes in an injectable pen, has such an effect on blood pressure that patients can throw away the drugs they use to keep it under control. Packing almost twice the power of rival drugs, liraglutide also lowers blood pressure, raises good cholesterol and prevents Type 2 diabetes. It even produces a feel-good factor, making dieting a pleasure . Tests have shown that dieters taking liraglutide lose almost twice as much weight as those on Orlistat. Like Orlistat, its prescription is likely to be limited to those who are obese or who are overweight and have another health problem such as high blood pressure. Mike Lean, professor of human nutrition at Glasgow University, said: ‘Liraglutide is absolutely life-changing for many of our most difficult-to-manage patients. Most do well, and some amazingly well. And it is extraordinarily safe, at least over the two to three years for which we have good evidence, with no signals to suggest serious side-effects. ‘The only real downside is that it is jolly expensive.’ The professor has patients who have been left wheelchair-bound by a combination of obesity and illnesses such as muscular dystrophy. They have lost so much weight they have been able to get up and walk. Its prescription is likely to be limited to those who are obese or who are overweight and have another health problem such as high blood pressure . Professor Jason Halford, former president of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, said: ‘It is potentially very exciting. The real benefit of it is that it is targeting appetite. It strengthens the effects of satiety.’ But Professor Iain Broom, director of the Centre for Obesity Research at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, said: ‘I don’t think drugs are ever going to be the answer. ‘Until society changes and the Government’s relationship with the food industry changes and the food industry itself changes, we are not going to get anywhere very fast.’ The European Commission is expected to rubber-stamp the drug’s licence within the next two months, paving the way for it to go on sale. Novo Nordisk says it could be launched in Europe, including the UK, this year. The most common side-effect is nausea, although this usually goes away after a few weeks. It is unclear how long it needs to be taken – but it could be for life.","Liraglutide packs twice the power of rival drugs and lowers blood pressure .

"One Missouri dad was shocked to receive a letter from his daughter's substitute teacher telling him he had packed her a lunch that was too unhealthy. The girl's father Justin Puckett, who is a family doctor, posted the letter, written on orange paper to his Facebook, outraged at the 'Big Brother' approach from the Kirksville Primary School teacher. Annoyed at the implication he and his wife Kylene were not up to the task of caring for their own daughter, Dr. Puckett refused to sign the letter acknowledging he accepted the lunch was not up to scratch. Request declined: Dr. and Mrs Puckett were annoyed to get this letter from the substitute teacher at Kirksville Primary School on Tuesday . Dr. and Mrs Puckett were shocked to receive the letter on Tuesday evening when their daughter, Alia, returned home from school. It read: ''Dr. and Mrs. Puckett, The cafeteria reported to me that Alia's lunch today included four chocolate bars, a bag of marshmallows, Ritz crackers and a pickle. Please see that she packs a proper lunch tomorrow.' The letter then ends with a curt demand - 'Parent signature requested'. The Pucketts wrote back, 'Request declined'. What annoyed Dr. Puckett most about the letter was the judgmental tone it struck, leaving him in no doubt his parenting skills were under question. Ordinary parents: Dr. Justin Puckett and Kylene Puckett were handed the letter to them by their daughter Alia and asked to acknowledge the receipt of the note with their signature. They refused . Family fun: Justin and Kylene are pictured here on a day out to Disney California Adventure with their four children, including Alia, (left) Bad lunch: Alia's lunch on Tuesday did not conform with the dietary standards of the substitute at Kirksville Primary School . Smiling faces: The Puckett children are seen here (Alia is left) and all seem to be pictures of health . 'Unfortunately, the letter didn't have what she had, correctly. She had four pieces of ham, a whole protein meat, she also had some pickles, which we admittedly cheat on pickles every once and awhile as a vegetable, because some fights just aren't worth having,' said Dr. Puckett. 'She also had four marshmallows in a Ziploc bag and then she had three very small pieces of chocolate, of which she ate one for lunch and then she also gave her brother and another friend one at an after school program,' Puckett said to ABC 3. While Dr. Puckett was contacted by the school principal, Tricia Reger on Wednesday and apologized to, he still feels mildly slighted. 'The issue isn't what happened at the Primary School and with my daughter because she is very independent and going to be completely unaffected by this. But what does bother me is that it just seems that we are constantly being inundated with the inability to be parents of our children,' Puckett added according to ABC 3. Apologetic: Principal Tricia Reger phoned Dr. Puckett on Wednesday afternoon to say sorry for the substitute's 'overreach' for demanding the Puckett's pack their daughter a healthier lunch . Puckett told ABC 3 that as the Medical Director of the Complete Family Medicine clinic in Kirksville, he is very aware of what constitutes a healthy lunch. 'I'm responsible for them and for the choices that they make and do whether it's at school or not. 'I have the ultimate responsibility to raise my children and I take that role very, very seriously and so maybe I took it bit more personally that there was some offense that maybe I wasn't doing a good job in that duty, something that is my number one job,' Puckett said to ABC 3. He also said that he accepted the school's apology and that of Kirksville Schools Superintendent Dr. Damon Kizzire, who also released a statement. 'We have as educators been directed to provide healthy and nutritious foods for so long that we had an individual take it upon themselves to send a note home to parents. This will not happen again and I am sorry for any inconvenience.'","Dr. Justin Puckett shocked after letter sent by substitute teacher .

"Authorities say they have completed their analysis of more than 460 pieces of evidence in the case of a woman whose partial remains were found three years after her disappearance, possibly bringing defense attorneys a step closer to seeing how prosecutors have linked their clients to her. Two men, Zachary Adams and Jason Autry, were arrested last spring and charged with murder and kidnapping in the case of Holly Bobo, a nursing student who was 20 when she disappeared from her house in April 2011. In October, John Dylan Adams was charged with raping Bobo. All have pleaded not guilty. No trial has been set and the defendants' lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the charges. The attorneys said they had not received any evidence linking their clients to the crime. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine said Thursday that some hair samples have been sent to the FBI for testing, but the TBI has analyzed all the evidence it has received. Dead: Authorities say they have completed their analysis of more than 460 pieces of evidence in the case of a Holly Bobo whose partial remains were found three years after her 2011 disappearance . Accused: John Dylan Adams, charged with raping Holly Bobo,  is escorted out of a courtroom after a hearing in December . Still, it was unclear when the defense would receive any information. District Attorney Matt Stowe told The Associated Press that they would get the evidence they're requesting 'at some point.' At the time of Bobo's disappearance, her brother told police he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her into the woods near her home in Parsons, located about 110 miles east of Memphis. Last September, more than three years later, authorities said two men searching for ginseng found Bobo's skull in a wooded area not far away. Bobo's disappearance and the subsequent lengthy search attracted national attention as authorities distributed posters with her photograph throughout the South. Prosecutors have not said whether they plan to seek the death penalty. Hearings scheduled for this month have been postponed to an undetermined future date. Jennifer Lynn Thompson, Adams' attorney, says state prosecutors have not even told her who found Bobo's remains or where they were found. Charged with murder: Jason Autry smiles during a hearing in Decaturville, Tennessee in December . 'I do not understand what is happening,' Thompson said. 'I have never before been involved in a case where there is no information about why my client was charged.' In the motion to dismiss, Thompson and Fletcher Long, Autry's lawyer, asked the judge to force prosecutors to produce 'all dental record analysis and forensic studies' performed on the skull. Adams has been in jail since March and Autry has been in jail since April. At a court hearing Dec. 17, Decatur County Circuit Judge Creed McGinley expressed concern that prosecutors had not yet provided key evidence to defense attorneys. He ordered the state to begin turning it over by Dec. 24. Thompson says the state missed that deadline. Seeking Justice: Authorities hope to use some of the 460 pieces of evidence to find Holly Bobo's true killer . Then, TBI Director Mark Gwyn — who has said the Bobo investigation has been the most exhaustive and expensive in agency history — announced he was suspending all work on the case after District Attorney Matt Stowe accused TBI agents of misconduct. Stowe took office Sept. 1 after defeating District Attorney Hansel McCadams, who had indicted Adams and Autry. The dispute was only resolved after Stowe stepped down from the case and Jennifer Nichols, a Shelby County attorney who was Stowe's co-counsel on the case and who had worked with death-penalty cases, was appointed as a special prosecutor. She is the third prosecutor in the case, which Stowe said is unusual. He said the fact that multiple prosecutors have been involved, plus the complex nature of the case, have contributed to the delays. 'We're talking about terabytes and terabytes of information,' he said. Attorney Steve Farese, who represents the Bobo family, said the recent developments in the case are 'different' than in other cases, and he acknowledged that the family is concerned with how the case is going. 'But they understand that this is a tedious process and they want to make sure everyone has their t's crossed and their i's dotted and to get this thing done right,' Farese said. Later, Farese added: 'No one should lose focus that this is about justice.'

"Dame Angela Watkinson has received two tickets to the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in London every year since 2011 from JTI . A Tory MP who tried to stop the introduction of plain cigarette packets has received £5,000 in Chelsea Flower Show tickets from a leading tobacco firm, it has emerged. Dame Angela Watkinson has received two tickets to the Royal Horticultural Society show every year since 2011, at a total cost of £4,984. Earlier this week, the Tory MP said she would not vote in favour of plain packaging despite being a life-long non-smoker. Speaking at the House of Commons' debate over plans to strip tobacco packaging of branding, the 73-year-old said: 'There can't be anyone in this country, young or old, who does not know about the health risks of tobacco. 'Nobody smokes in ignorance.' The MP for Hornchurch and Upminster received tickets to the London flower show from tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut and Camel cigarettes. Deborah Arnott, of Action on Smoking and Health, said Dame Angela was probably 'well worth' her invitation to the London horticultural event. She told the Daily Mirror: 'I am sure the tobacco industry thought Dame Angela was well worth a free invitation since she was the only MP prepared to stand up in the House of Commons to argue against standardised packaging.' Dame Angela's office said that other MPs had also accepted tickets to the flower show and said she had made her interests on the tobacco matter 'quite clear' in debates. Last July, the MailOnline revealed how a total of nine Tory MPs had accepted free tickets to the horticultural show, and opera performances, from JTI. The Commons register of members’ interests revealed that seven Conservative MPs and one Labour MP accepted tickets for two to the Chelsea Flower Show from JTI in May 2013. The Tories include Dame Angela, were Nigel Adams, Oliver Colville, Edward Garnier, Mark Pritchard, Laurence Robertson, Alec Shelbrooke, while the Labour MP was Lindsay Hoyle. Scroll down for video . The Government has announced plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes that includes grisly warnings about the dangers of smoking. However, Dame Angela has said she will vote against plain packets . At the time. the MPs gave differing figures for the supposed value of the tickets, varying from £1,133 to £1,260. Mr Adams received Chelsea tickets on two successive days – May 22 and 23 – costing £1,188 and £1,050 plus VAT. A further four MPs – two Conservative and two Labour – took tickets for last year's Glyndebourne opera festival at a country house in West Sussex. These were Christopher Chope and Bob Walter, both Tories; and Jim Dowd and Gerald Kaufman, both Labour. The listed value for the tickets for two to see the opera Ariadne on Naxos vary from £1,278 to £1,534. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was also treated to more than £1,000 worth of hospitality at the Chelsea Flower Show by JTI in 2011, it was revealed. He has also warned there are concerns over the plans to remove branding from tobacco products, suggesting it could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes, depriving the Treasury of revenue. JTI tried and failed to overturn a ban on the display of tobacco in shops introduced by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. All gifts accepted by the MPs were declared and allowed under parliamentary rules. The 73-year-old has been given two tickets every year since 2011 to the London flower show (pictured) by cigarette giant Japan Tobacco International, which makes Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut and Camel cigarettes . Earlier this week, the Tory MP said she would not vote in favour of plain packaging despite being a life-long non-smoker. Pictured: A themed garden exhibit on display during last year's Chelsea Flower Show in London . It comes after Mr Hammond opened up a Cabinet split in the House of Commons on Wednesday by questioning government plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. He said there were concerns the scheme could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes, depriving the Treasury of revenue. His comments came a day after David Cameron finally threw his weight behind laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings. MPs will have a free vote on the plans before the election but are expected to back them, with the law expected to come into force next year. But Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 5 Live the issue was complex, and he would look 'very carefully' at the evidence before deciding how to vote. 'It's a complex issue because experiments have happened around the world,' he said. 'It's very important to look at the evidence of those experiments and see what the evidence shows. 'Also some concerns have been expressed about whether it's going to make the counterfeiting of cigarettes easier and increasing trade, which deprives us of a lot of revenue.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was treated to more than £1,000 worth of hospitality at the Chelsea Flower Show by Japan Tobacco International in 2011. All gifts were declared and are allowed under parliament rules . A packet of 20 cigarettes costs £8.47 on average, of which £6.49 is tax. Medical experts say non-smokers, and younger children in particular, are likely to find plain packaging less appealing. But right-wing Tory backbenchers see it as a 'nanny state' measure, and others are concerned it would lead to job losses. One law firm said plain cigarette packaging could be the thin end of the wedge, with alcohol, chocolate and fizzy drinks targeted next. Tom Scourfield, head of intellectual property at CMS, said: 'This is a first foray into depriving proprietary rights to perfectly legal products to discourage their consumption.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the plan was ineffectual and 'counter to freedom, the basic building block of prosperity'. Liberal Democrat communities minister Stephen Williams admitted there was division within the Government over plain packaging. MailOnline has contacted representatives of Dame Angela and Mr Hammond for further comment.","Dame Angela Watkinson has received £5,000 in Chelsea Flower Tickets .

"It was supposed to be a fun family meal out with a Happy Meal treat for their four-year-old daughter. But Neil and Nikki Sanders had their evening in McDonald's soured when they discovered what looked like a worm hanging out of the Chicken McNugget they had purchased. Emily, four, had turned down the Happy Meal even before seeing the wriggly surprise, so it was left to her mother to take the first bite from the McNugget. Nikki Sanders, 30, went to take a bite from a Chicken McNugget in her daughter's Happy Meal when she found what looked like a worm hanging out the bottom of it . Neil and Nikki Sanders had taken their four-year-old daughter to the McDonald's in Tamworth and bought a Happy Meal, which had a worm or maggot in one of the Chicken McNuggets . But she felt sick when she found the foreign body in her daughter's Happy Meal from the McDonald's in Ventura Park, in Tamworth. Mrs Sanders, 30, a canteen worker from Atherstone, told the Birmingham Mail: 'I'm very fussy about what I eat and when I saw what was in the McNugget I went white. 'I'm just thankful Emily decided she didn't want her Happy Meal. 'One good thing has come out of this, though. It's turned me off processed meat. I'm eating a lot healthier now.' Mrs Sanders, a canteen worker, said the unfortunate experience had turned her off processed food . Her husband added: 'It looks like a worm, but I can't swear it's one until tests have been carried out. 'Whatever it is, it shouldn't be in there.' The 39-year-old vehicle testing engineer took the McNugget to a staff member, who allegedly told him: 'We'll sort you out with something.' He replied saying: 'I don't want a voucher. I want an explanation.' He has since handed the item to the store for tests. The couple had purchased the Happy Meal for their daughter Emily, four, from this McDonald's restaurant in the Ventura Retail Park, in Tamworth . McDonalds told MailOnline an investigation is currently underway. A spokesman said: 'We are sorry for Mr Sanders' experience when visiting our restaurant.

"A 70-year-old man wrongly convicted of the 1976 stabbing deaths of a mother and daughter has been released. Joseph Sledge was convicted of two counts of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for the slayings of 74-year-old Josephine Davis and her 57-year-old daughter, Aileen. On Friday, after serving nearly four decades behind bars, Sledge was found innocent by a three-judge panel in Whiteville, North Carolina. Walking out of the courtroom he said he was looking forward to sleeping in a real bed and maybe swimming in a pool. Scroll down for video . Freed: Joseph Sledge (pictured left on Friday and right in 1976) has been absolved of murder after 40 years . The panel heard from a DNA expert, who said none of the evidence collected in the case — hair, DNA and fingerprints — belonged to Sledge. A key jailhouse informant had also recanted his story, saying authorities promised him leniency in his own case for his trial testimony against Sledge. A district attorney who was not originally involved apologized to Sledge and promised to reopen the investigation. 'The system has made a mistake,' district attorney Jon David said. After the judges' decision was announced, Sledge was still for a moment, then hugged his lawyer and family members. Soon after, he walked out of the Columbus County Detention Center, spoke to reporters and got in a car with family members. They were headed to Savannah, Georgia, where Sledge was set to live with one of his brothers. Asked what he was looking forward to doing, he replied: 'Going home. Relaxing. Sleeping in a real bed.

"United Airlines is scrambling to alert the hundreds of passengers who shared two planes with the first Ebola patient on U.S. soil. Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national, arrived in the U.S. at Washington Dulles International Airport on United Flight 951 on September 20, the airline revealed today. He then boarded United Flight 822 to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. U.S. officials had previously refused to provide details of his itinerary, claiming none of his fellow passengers were at risk because he was not showing symptoms at that time. Scroll down for video . Thomas Eric Duncan flew from Liberia to Brussels and then into Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport - with a connection in between . Unfriendly skies: Thomas Eric Duncan was able to board a plane to the U.S. and land in Dallas after having come in close contact with at least one person who died of Ebola . United Airlines released the details of Duncan's journey on Wednesday night. He left September 19 from Monrovia, Liberia, and flew to Brussels. From Brussels, he caught a United Airlines flight to the U.S. The revelation that Duncan entered the United States on one side of the nation then boarded a domestic flight to Texas shows just how quickly the disease can spread if infected patients are not stopped at the border. The New York Times reports that Duncan helped care for a woman who later died of the disease just days before his journey. Had a customs official asked him about his contact with Ebola patients, he could have been flagged as being at high risk for infection. Still, public health officials say the chances of an outbreak in the United States are low. The United States has sanitation and medical care that far exceeds that found in the affected West African nations, which are among the poorest in the world. Currently, patients are checked for fever - the first sign of a possible infection - before they are allowed to board flights leaving West African nations. However, once travelers gets past examiners in Liberia, Sierra Leon or Guinea, there are few barriers to them moving across the world. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the agency's examiners at airports and other ports of entry are trained to spot and identify people potentially infected with Ebola before they enter the country. It's a long way to Texas: Thomas Duncan flew from Liberia to Belgium to Washington, D.C., before finally arriving in Dallas on September 20 . However, a spokeswoman could provide no information about how the agency was changing its rules to prevent more Ebola infected fliers from coming into the U.S. Airlines for America, the industry trade group, on Wednesday U.S. airlines are in regular contact with the Centers for Disease Control and other government agencies about helping to prevent the spread of Ebola. 'A4A members that fly to affected countries remain in steady contact with government agencies and health officials, and have procedures in place to monitor and quickly respond to potential health concerns,' spokeswoman Victoria Day said. Stocks in major U.S. air carriers fell as much as nearly . 4 percent on Wednesday over fears that the spread of the worst . known Ebola outbreak beyond West Africa would make more . customers fearful of traveling. 'People are nervous about (the first case of Ebola detected . in the United States) and what it means,' said Michael Derchin, . an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC. Still, Derchin said that the market had overreacted. 'I would be surprised if there's any impact on travel,' he . said. JetBlue Airways and American Airlines said . they were closely following guidelines from the U.S. Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Airlines for America, the industry trade group, is also . coordinating with the CDC on any government action related to . Ebola concerns, JetBlue spokesman Morgan Johnston said. 'We follow the guidelines (put) in place by the CDC . specifically for airlines, and we work with our crews to protect . the health of our customers and employees,' American Airlines . spokesman Josh Freed said. The CDC is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection . (CBP) to identify potential victims and warn other travelers of . the health threat. 'CBP personnel receive training in illness recognition,' said agency spokeswoman Jennifer Evanitsky. If they identify . someone believed to be infected, they will seek medical . evaluation from CDC and local health officials. Customs officials will wear protective equipment such as . gloves and surgical masks to ensure their safety when . interacting with ill travelers, she added. Customs and Border personnel also will hand out flyers in . airports encouraging people to watch their health for 21 days . and listing steps to follow should they become sick, according . to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. Airlines will also remind their customers to follow CDC . guidelines regarding travel when ill, Johnston said. JetBlue shares fell 3.4 percent to $10.26, while American .

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, the Mayor of London urged the Government to supply more sophisticated weaponry to the fighters, who are battling ISIS in northern Iraq. He said: 'They are incredibly pro-British. These guys really are in the front line. The Peshmerga are the guys who are taking on the terrorists. 'I was watching some footage of a huge battle where they were using a lot of German-made equipment to take out about 17 suicide bomb vehicles. 'You wonder what it is that is preventing us from giving them that kind of weaponry ourselves. 'I think the nervousness is that the Government hasn't worked out in its own mind whether it wants to see an independent sovereign Kurdistan.

"'Cameron and Farrage' shared a hug after appearing in court for stealing from the NHS . This is the moment 'Cameron and Farrage' shared a hug after appearing in court - for stealing from the NHS. The people involved in the happy coalition, sealed with a kiss and cuddle, were not political leaders - but criminal couple Naomi Cameron and Nicholas Farrage who had both just avoided being sent to jail. Their offences were all committed at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth in Devon where they stole cash from patients, staff, and the hospital. Cameron, 24, was given community service after admitting one charge of theft, while Farrage, 28, who admitted three counts of theft, had his sentencing adjourned. The hearing at Plymouth Crown Court almost descended into farce when one of the defendants was asked to confirm his name was 'Nigel Farage'. He then had to say he was not Nigel Farage - but Nicholas Farrage. The judge then stepped in to say: 'I would just like to remind you all that we are not dealing with the leader of UKIP today.' The duo, who are thought to be engaged, both stood in the dock while details of their crimes were read out. Alistair Verheijen, prosecuting, said: 'The offences were committed in November last year at Derriford Hospital and the complainants were staff, patients and the hospital itself.' Cameron admitted stealing a handbag and contents worth £250 from a patient. Mr Verheijen said: 'The elderly victim had gone out for the walk and left her bag by her bed where she thought it would be safe. 'She was only gone for a matter of minutes but Cameron came into the ward saying she was looking for her nan. 'She then took the opportunity to steal the handbag.' CCTV was shown to Cameron who accepted she was the person on it and had stolen the bag. She had been taking methadone and could not remember committing the offence but had no other reason to be in the hospital. Defending Cameron, Ali Rafati said she had turned into an addict after being involved in a violent relationship. The people involved in the happy coalition, sealed with a kiss and cuddle, were in fact criminal couple Naomi Cameron (left) and Nicholas Farrage (right) who had both just avoided being sent to jail . Farrage (pictured) stole items from a ward sister and a doctor that were in areas of the hospital not open to the public . On the day in question, she had taken valium on top of her methadone. He said: 'She was acting like a complete wild woman, very different to how you see her now. She is stable and sober and looking forward to getting her life back on track.' She was sentenced to 30 hours unpaid work and must pay £250 compensation. Farrage was guilty of three counts of theft during the same incident. He stole items from a ward sister and a doctor that were in areas of the hospital not open to the public. He also stole a laptop that belonged to the hospital. Defending Farrage, Deni Mathews said he had returned to drug abuse to carry out this incident after an 'unprecedented spell of employment and break-in offending.' 'He accepts he has had opportunities in the past but he is motivated more now than he ever was.' His sentencing was adjourned until February 20 for probation reports and drug assessment.","'Cameron and Farrage' both appear in court - but not the political leaders .

"Greater Manchester Police are hunting this man is searching for this man in connection with the attack on the pregnant woman on January 17 . Police are hunting a criminal who broke the leg of a pregnant woman during a 'terrifying' attempted robbery. The attacker pounced on the 27-year-old victim as she left a newsagent in the Moston area of Manchester at 12.40pm on January 17. The man threw the victim to the ground, breaking her leg, while attempting to steal her handbag during the daylight assault. Detectives from Greater Manchester Police investigating the case have said it was 'pure luck' that the unborn baby was not harmed. The man shook the terrified woman violently as she lay on the ground and shouted in her face in a foreign language that she could not identify. The attacker unsuccessfully tried to steal the woman's car before fleeing the scene which is just over two miles north of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. The woman screamed, told the attacker that she was pregnant and even opened her handbag to show the man that she did not have any valuables, cash or a mobile phone in her bag. The criminal dragged the woman on the ground by the strap of the handbag before fleeing empty-handed. The woman was taken to hospital where she was assessed by medics. Fortunately, the baby was not harmed although the woman was extremely shaken. She told officers: 'The whole incident seemed to last a long time but in reality would only have been about five minutes. He was very close to me when he was grabbing and shaking me and standing right in front of me. 'When it was happening I was very concerned about the safety of my unborn baby and for myself. It was quite terrifying when he was grabbing and shaking me. I didn't know what he was going to do or what he wanted as I couldn't understand him. 'I feel in shock and very anxious about it. It is going to change my behaviour and going about Moston when I'm by myself or with my children. It's even more worrying that it happened during daylight hours.' The man pounced on his victim outside this shop in the Moston area of Manchester on January 17 . The attack happened on Hodge Street in the Moston area of Greater Manchester at 12.40pm on January 17 . The woman was interviewed by specialist officers from Greater Manchester Police who constructed an artist's impression of the man. He is described as a black male who is 5ft 10 tall, stocky and with a round face. He was a distinctive scar on the left side of his face and was clean shaven. He was wearing a black zip-up hooded top with white strings and light blue jeans. Detective Constable Saj Sardar said: 'The victim impact statement this woman has written describes just how harrowing her ordeal was. Her only thought was to protect her unborn baby and she was naturally terrified something would happen to injure her and her unborn child. 'Thankfully, though this is purely by luck, it does not appear the unborn baby has been harmed but that does not detract from just how frightened this young woman was.'

"It's the financial event that sees the biggest names in world banking overrun  the tiny Alpine town of Davos each year. But while the World Economic Forum is famous for its financiers and politicians, this year has seen a sprinkling of royal stardust as well. Among the royals to visit the event, which closes today, are King Phillippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, the glamorous Queen Rania of Jordan and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway. Scroll down for video . First arrival: Jordan's glamorous Queen Rania was among the first of the royal contingent to arrive . First to arrive was 44-year-old Queen Rania, who regularly attends the event and last year made a speech on the subject of boosting employment. A board member at the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), the Kuwait-born royal has long taken an interest in microfinance initiatives. The royal, who has been tweeting updates from the Forum over the past few days, took a break from this morning to comment on the death of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. 'Arab and Muslim nations grieve loss of HM King Abdullah,' she wrote. 'Our condolences to the Saudi people for HM's sad passing. May he rest in peace.' But although one of the most prominent, Rania isn't the only royal to hobnob with financiers in Davos this week. On her way: Queen Mathilde of the Belgians arrived in Davos by private plane . Taking an interest: She and her husband King Philippe of the Belgians heard the opening panel discussions . Veteran: Mathilde, 42, is a World Economic Forum veteran and has been attending the event since 2007 . Relaxed: The Belgian royals also met Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the Forum . One of the most headline-grabbing arrivals was made by King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, who arrived by private jet on Wednesday as the event swung into top gear. The couple, who have been on the throne of Belgium since 2013, stayed for just two days but took part in the opening panel discussions before flying home. 42-year-old Mathilde is no stranger to Davos, having attended each year since 2007, and looked at ease while meeting dignitaries, including German financier Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum. Other royals to attend include Prince Andrew, who hosted a reception on behalf of his entrepreneurship charity, Pitch@Palace, last night. Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and his wife Mette-Marit were among the last royals to arrive, flying into Davos yesterday. Attendees: Crown Prince Haakon and his wife Mette-Marit (pictured in Oslo last week) also attended . Expected: Spain's Queen Letizia is expected to arrive at the event before it comes to a close . Busy: Letizia and husband King Felipe have had a busy week and have completed several visits in Spain . The 41-year-old prince sits on the board of the affiliated Forum of Young Global Leaders and, with his 41-year-old wife, has taken part in a number of meetings. According to the Norwegian Royal Court, Haakon and Mette-Marit hope to 'bring themselves up to date on a range of current issues'. The final set of royals to arrive at the Alpine town are Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia, both of whom are due to arrive today. Both of the Spanish royals have already had a busy week, with a reception for foreign ambassadors at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid and the opening of an art gallery already under their collective belt. Passionate: Emma Watson, 24, spoke out on the topic of women's rights during the Forum . She made headlines when she spoke out about women's rights during an impassioned speech made to the UN General Assembly last September. Now Emma Watson has repeated the trick - this time in front of politicians and financiers assembled at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Sitting beside UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the 24-year-old spoke passionately about the HeForShe IMPACT initiative, which she is has championed and which aims to empower women across the world. 'The groundswell of response we have received in support for HeForShe tells us we are tapping into what the world wants: to be a part of change,' she said. 'Now we have to channel that energy into purposeful action. The pilot initiative provides that framework. 'Next we need all country leadership, as well as that of hundreds of universities and corporations to follow HeForShe's IMPACT 10x10x10 so as to bring an end to the persisting inequalities faced by women and girls globally.' World leaders to have signalled their support for the initiative include Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and Sweden's new Prime Minister, Stefan Lofven.","Royals from all over the world have descended on Davos .

"Jennifer Kesse went missing nine years ago - and police hope that a newly-released, age-progressed photograph might bring to light fresh information in the suspected abduction. On the morning of January 24, 2006, Miss Kesse, then 24, was reported missing when she failed to show up for work at Central Florida Investments in Orlando. Her Chevy Malibu car was later found a mile away from her newly-purchased condo at the Mosaic At Millenia subdivision. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Kesse (pictured left) before her disappearance in Orland, Florida, in 2006. Pictured right, how Miss Kesse may look today . Police released this grainy image in 2007 of an individual near the scene of Miss Kesse's disappearance but it produced no leads . According to a website set up by her family, the 24-year-old had just spent a long weekend in St Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands with her boyfriend and a group of friends. Her family said it was completely out of character for Jennifer not to call if she was going to be late for work. Jennifer and her boyfriend, who lived several hours away in south Florida, would call each other on the drive to work each morning. The day before she disappeared, Jennifer had left her boyfriend's home to drive to work in Ocoee, Florida. That evening, she left her office around 6pm and wished her boss a good evening. She chatted to her parents, brother, boyfriend and some friends on the phone at home that evening. The last person to speak to Jennifer was her boyfriend, in a call shortly before 10pm on the Monday night. The next morning, when her boyfriend called her office, he was told that Jennifer had not arrived. Her employer then alerted her family, who could not reach her at her home or on her cellphone. Police were informed within two hours. The family went to their daughter's new condo and said it appeared 'normal' - clean and with everything in place. She had slept in her bed, taken a shower (as indicated by a wet towel and shower) and left out clothes on the bed. Jennifer appeared to have disappeared after leaving her home around 7.30am. Her car was found on Thursday, January 26 at a condo complex around a mile down the road from where she lived. Surveillance footage later revealed a suspect pulling into a parking space in her car, waiting around 30 seconds, climbing out and walking away. Despite more than a thousand tips, police have not been able to work out what happened to the missing woman. In 2007, police released grainy surveillance footage of the suspect who had been driving her car. It was not clear if the person was a man or a woman and no information came from the tape. Miss Kesse, 24, vanished in 2006 after leaving her home to go to work. Despite multiple appeals, few details have been found about her disappearance . Five years later, police gathered a panel of experts to review the case but no new information came to light. An age-progressed photo of the missing woman was released by police this week, completed by a police forensic artist, to show what she might look like today. 'We ask for the public's help in circulating this photo via social media in hopes of finding Jennifer and returning her to her family,' police said. The missing woman's parents, Joyce and Drew Kesse, have never given up searching for her and continually update their website Findjenniferkesse.com and Facebook page. For months after their daughter disappeared, the desperate parents stood at a busy intersection at rush hour and waved signs about Jennifer, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Her parents told Fox this week: 'We've embraced the hope that right now, nine years later, nothing definitively proves that Jennifer has been murdered. Nothing indicates that she is alive. 'If you are parents in our shoes, you are going to hope that she is the next miracle.' Jennifer Kesse is 5'8' and weighed 125lb when she went missing. She had sandy blonde, shoulder-length hair and has green eyes. The Orlando Police Department asked anyone with information on Jennifer’s whereabouts or details of what happened to her to call Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS.

"A man who strangled his elderly neighbour before hiding her body under a wheelbarrow after she rejected his sexual advances has been found guilty of murder. Patrick Curran, 38, killed widow Joan Roddam, 74, because he was obsessed with 'granny porn' - sexually explicit images of elderly women. Curran, of Delabole, Cornwall, had a 'raised libido' when he went to the home of the pensioner, who was a friend of his mother. Patrick Curran (left), 38, killed widow Joan Roddam (right), 74, because he was obsessed with 'granny porn' - sexually explicit images of elderly women . But when she rejected his advances he killed her and buried her body under a wheelbarrow and a blanket in a field behind her house. Pornographic material, depicting women in their 70s or older having sex with men in their 20s, was found on a computer seized from Curran's home two years later. He has now been convicted, at Truro Crown Court, of murdering Mrs Roddam on November 8, 2003. The loner was arrested after a cold case review last year led to a DNA breakthrough. Curran refused to attend any of the proceedings and wouldn't even leave his cell - so he was not represented in court. He will be sentenced at a later date. Judge Graham Cottle told the jury: 'I told you the truth from the very start because I did not want you to think this man had run away. Curran buried Mrs Roddam's body under a wheelbarrow and a blanket in a field behind her house in Delabole, Cornwall . 'He is still in Exeter prison, on a daily basis he has been given the opportunity to come here but on every day he has declined that opportunity. We have done what we can to engage him in this process.' The trial heard that DNA from a bloodstain on the blanket used to cover Mrs Roddam was 'one billion times' more likely to belong to Curran than another man. The jury was also told the motive of his visit was likely to be strong sexual interest in older woman that saw him visit 151 'granny porn' websites on his computer and download more than 100 images of semi-naked women aged 60 to 80. Simon Laws QC, prosecuting, previously said Curran was hoping for sex when he visited Mrs Roddam, who lived alone with three cats. Mr Laws told the jury: 'Here is a dead woman of an age group that he found sexually attractive, covered by a blanket that had his DNA on it. 'He can only say that all of this has happened by chance, that it is all nothing but sheer bad luck. 'The prosecution say to you, simply nobody could be so unfortunate.' The prosecution said Curran also burnt significant items including jeans and a hard drive to remove any trace he was there. Curran's father had rung emergency services in the run up to the killing because he was concerned about how 'distressed' his son was. One of the three doctors who examined Curran, then 27, told the jury that at the time he was 'concerned' about Curran's mental wellbeing. He will be sentenced at Truro Crown Court on January 27. Aine Rendell, the great niece of Joan Roddam, made a statement on behalf of the family. She said: 'We still find it difficult even after all these years to come to terms with the fact that Joan was murdered by somebody that she knew and trusted. 'Patrick is the son of Margaret Curran who cared for Frank, Joan's husband, before he died. 'Margaret remained a friend of Joan's after Frank's death and it has been hard for us to accept why somebody so close to Joan could have killed her. 'During the trial we have heard details about Joan's death that have shocked us. Joan did not deserve to die in these circumstances. Mrs Roddam's killer was finally arrested after a cold case review last year led to a DNA breakthrough . 'We cannot understand why Patrick Curran did not come to court to defend himself and face us as a family. 'We are glad that finally today justice has been served.' Following the verdict, the Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Stuart Ellis said: 'The murder of Joan Roddam occurred some 11 years ago. 'Since that time her family and the community in which she lived has had to deal with this tragedy and all its consequences. 'I hope that the conviction of Patrick Curran now, will in some way bring comfort and reassurance to all those who have been affected.'","Patrick Curran murdered Joan Roddam at her home in Delabole, Cornwall .

"From the Jersey Devil to the Mothman, the US is filled with fictional creatures that have come to life in the nation's imagination. Now one artist has decided to draw these cryptids by hand, revealing the beasts that are feared the most in each state. 'The map is a bit of a declaration of optimism and wonderment as to what might be possible on planet Earth,' artist Mark Adams told Dailymail.com. Scroll down for video . The map, created by artist Mark Adams, reveals the imaginary beasts that are feared the most in each state. 'It is a bit of a declaration of optimism and wonderment as to what might be possible on planet Earth,' he told Dailymail.com . Big Bird, for instance, has become notorious in Texas where witnesses have reported seeing an ape faced, winged beast with blood-red eyes. Reports of the creature hit their peak in the early months of 1976 after a local radio station offered a reward for the beast's capture. Neighbouring state, Louisiana, is famous for the Honey Island Swap Monster. The creature is 7ft (2 metres) tall, with grey hair, yellow eyes and a foul stench. Native Americans call this creature 'Letiche', and legendary tale suggests the beast came about following a train wreck in the area in the early 20th century. While Bigfoot (left) is more famous in Washington, last year a large footprint unlike one from a human was in the woods in Mississippi. The right image shows the Fouke Monster, which is most feared in Arkansas . Louisiana, is famous for the Honey Island Swap Monster (left), while the Jersey Devil (right) is most feared in New Jersey . Mothman is a moth-like creature reportedly seen in the Point Pleasant area of West Virginia from 15 November 1966 to 15 December 1967. Some ufologists, paranormal authors, and cryptozoologists believe that Mothman was an alien, a supernatural manifestation, or an unknown cryptid. The Native Americans had stories of giant terrible birds called. These thunderbirds could easily swoop down and carry away a man. In their depictions, they look similar to the descriptions of Mothman. On November 12, 1966, five men claimed to see a man-like figure fly low from the trees over their heads while digging in a grave. This is often identified as the first known sighting of what became known as the Mothman. A travelling circus was on the train, and from it a group of chimpanzees escaped and interbred with the local alligator population, according to the tale. 'I personally found myself drawn more to the carnivores and predatory cats, beasts like Shunka Warakin and the Ozark Howler,' said the Philadelphia-based artist. 'Creatures that likely exist in other less-hostile parts of the world, but for some reason are considered to be too far out to survive in North America.' Perhaps the most famous of all the legendary beasts in the US is Bigfoot - a large hairy ape man that is alleged by some to live in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. While Bigfoot is more famous in Washington, last year a large footprint unlike one from a human was in the woods in Mississippi - raising suggestions that the creature it belongs to is Bigfoot. The large print was found by Peyton Lassiter in Vicksburg on August 12 - nine months after another local man, David Childers, saw a large grey figure running through a wooded area nearby. Other monsters in the map include the Mothman in West Virginia, the Jersey devil in New Jersey, the Beast of Busco in Indiana and the Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swap in South Carolina. 'I love to think that there could be a cougar roaming the mountains of rural Arkansas, or a dire wolf wreaking havoc on the plains of Montana,' said Mr Adams. 'This world is an incredibly diverse place full of mystery and magic, and I for one like to think opposable thumbs and the ability to 'reason' doesn't immediately entitle us to a sense of certainty that we've got it all figured.'

"Global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880, according to US scientists. But as well as the increase of the planet’s average temperature, climatologists are particularly concerned about melting sea ice in the Arctic. Now a time-lapse animation has been created to show how fast the world's oldest ice is vanishing. Scroll down for video . Climatologists are particularly concerned about melting sea ice in the Arctic and have created a time-lapse animation  to show how fast old ice is vanishing. This still shows old ice (in white) and ice under a year old (in blue) in 1987, since when amounts have declined . Made by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the annimation is based on Arctic sea ice data that has been collected over the last 27 years. Each winter, sea ice expands to fill the Arctic Ocean basin, peaking in volume in March. Every summer, the ice pack shrinks and is at its smallest in September. The ice that survives one summer melt or more becomes thicker and is more likely to survive over a longer period of time. Each winter, sea ice expands to fill the Arctic Ocean basin and every summer, the ice pack shrinks. The ice that survives one summer melt or more becomes thicker and is likely to survive over a longer period of time (shown in ever lighter colours in this image). The oldest ice - over nine years in age - is shown in white here . The animation also shows how the Arctic sea ice moves continually and escapes the Arctic Ocean via the Fram Strait, east of Greenland (pictured) Scientists at Nasa and the NOAA have both claimed that global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880. Temperatures across the world averaged 0.8°C (1.4°F) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years. The Met Office has also announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the UK in records dating back to 1910. Since 1880, Earth’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 0.8°C (1.4°F) over the 20th century average, which Nasa’s scientists said is a trend that’s largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet’s atmosphere. The majority of that warming has occurred in the past three decades, they claim. Gavin Schmidt, Director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) in New York, said: ‘While the ranking of individual years can be affected by chaotic weather patterns, the long-term trends are attributable to drivers of climate change that right now are dominated by human emissions of greenhouse gases. But since the 1980s the amount of old, hardy ice, known as perennial or multiyear ice, has declined. The animation charts the vanishing of this ice from 1987 to November 2014. The dark blue areas in the video depicts first year ice that formed in the most recent winter, while the oldest ice, which is older than nine years old, is shown in white. Dark grey areas indicate open water. By showing how the colours – the types of ice – change in the region, the animation emphasises how quickly the Arctic is changing as the planet warms up. It also shows how the Arctic sea ice moves continually and escapes the Arctic Ocean via the Fram Strait, east of Greenland. Ice lost through the Strait used to be replaced by ice growth in the Beaufort Gyre, northeast of Alaska, where perennial ice used to last for years. But this changed at the beginning of the 21st century when warmer waters made it less likely that ice would survive its passage though the south of the gyre. From 2008 onwards, the oldest ice has diminished to a narrow band along the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and in 2012, the ice melt broke all previous records. After that worrying year, the melt was less severe in 2013 and 2014. Data collected in March 2014 revealed that first year ice decreased from 78 to 69 per cent in 2014, suggesting that a portion of Arctic ice survived the 2013 melt, with the amount of second-year ice increasing from eight to 14 per cent. From 2008 onwards, the oldest ice diminished to a narrow band along the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and in 2012, the ice melt broke all previous records. This screenshot from the animation showing peak 2014 pack levels, shows how little perennial ice there is . Fourth year ice also increased in quantity from just over seven to 10.2 per cent. Overall, the amount of perennial sea ice recorded last spring was enough to meet the approximate 1981-2010 median. However, experts worry that the increase was a blip and that the long-term trend will continue to be downward. This is because in the 1980s, ice four years and older make up a quarter of the ice pack and as of March 2014, this was just 10 per cent. Ice over seven years old has also become increasingly rare. Conservationists are concerned that polar bears (stock image) may one day become extinct because sea ice is melting earlier each year. This makes it difficult for the bears to hunt, mate and raise their young .","Researchers from the Washington-based National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration made the animation, based on data from 1987 to 2014 .

"One of the largest asteroids in the solar system, Vesta, has evidence of 'recent' water flowing on it, according to Nasa. Images taken by the Dawn spacecraft, currently on its way to the dwarf planet Ceres, have revealed gulleys on the proto-planet that are just a few hundred million years old. It indicates objects such as smaller than planets are able to have liquids on their surface - and suggests water may exist in more places than we thought in the universe. Nasa scientists in California have revealed images showing 'recent' flowing water on the surface of Vesta. This image shows Cornelia Crater on the large asteroid Vesta. On the right is an inset image showing an example of curved gullies, indicated by the short white arrows, and a fan-shaped deposit, indicated by long white arrows . Revealed by Nasa scientists in California, the images were taken when Dawn visited Vesta from 2011 to 2013 before departing for Ceres. Previously, asteroids like Vesta had been thought to be completely dry and incapable of having water because of their lower temperature and low pressure. But gulleys found on the walls of one of the craters on Vesta suggest that is anything but the case. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is an object that independently orbits the sun, has enough mass to be nearly spherical and has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. This last point is why Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet status, which is defined as being an object similar to a planet, but it has not cleared its orbit. Pluto orbits in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of the solar system, where many other objects similar or bigger to it in size exist. One of those is Eris, which along with Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Ceres make up the five dwarf planets in the solar system we know of to date. An asteroid, meanwhile, is a large chunk of rock that orbits the sun but is not massive enough to have formed into a spherical shape. Some objects have a dual designation: Ceres, for example, is sometimes referred to as both a dwarf planet and an asteroid, as it is part of the asteroid belt. Vesta, sometimes referred to as a protoplanet, is the most massive asteroid in the solar system, if Ceres is not counted, while another asteroid called Pallas is thought to be very slightly bigger than Vesta in size. 'Nobody expected to find evidence of water on Vesta. The surface is very cold and there is no atmosphere, so any water on the surface evaporates,' said Jennifer Scully, a postgraduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 'However, Vesta is proving to be a very interesting and complex planetary body.' According to the scientists, the water appears to have flown down the gulleys a few hundred millions years ago, a short period of time compared to Vesta's overall age of 4.6 billion years. The gullies left behind fan-shaped deposits after evaporation, seen in the image. They are fairly narrow, on average about 100 feet (30 metres) wide. The average length of the gullies is a little over half a mile (900 meters). Cornelia Crater, with a width of 9 miles (15 kilometers), contains some of the best examples of the curved gullies and fan-shaped deposits. However, Dr Scyull noted that it was unlikely Vesta had rivers like Earth, but rather localised areas of liquid. 'We're not suggesting that there was a river-like flow of water. We're suggesting a process similar to debris flows, where a small amount of water mobilizes the sandy and rocky particles into a flow,' she said. But they ruled out the chance that the gullies were formed simply by the movement of dry material, as they share characteristics with debris flows from liquids on Earth and Mars. The images were taken when Dawn visited Vesta from 2011 to 2013 (illustration shown). Dawn is now approaching the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It will be captured into orbit around Ceres on 6 March 2015 . This colourful composite image, revealed back in December 2013, shows the flow of material inside and outside a crater called Aelia on the giant asteroid Vesta. To the naked eye, these structures would not be seen. But here, they stand out in blue and red. The crater has a diameter of 2.7 miles (4.3 kilometers) The leading theory to explain the source of the curved gullies is that Vesta has small, localised patches of ice in its subsurface. No one knows the origin of this ice, but one possibility is that ice-rich bodies, such as comets, left part of their ice deep in the subsurface following impact. A later impact would form a crater and heat up some of the ice patches, releasing water onto the walls of the crater. Laboratory experiments performed at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, indicate that there could be enough time for curved gullies to form on Vesta before all of the water evaporated. 'The sandy and rocky particles in the flow help to slow the rate of evaporation,' Ms Scully said. Vesta, pictured, is the most massive asteroid in the solar system, if Ceres is not counted, while another asteroid called Pallas is thought to be very slightly bigger than Vesta in size . The study has broad implications for planetary science. 'These results, and many others from the Dawn mission, show that Vesta is home to many processes that were previously thought to be exclusive to planets,' said UCLA's Christopher Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission. 'We look forward to uncovering even more insights and mysteries when Dawn studies Ceres.' Dawn is currently in the spotlight because it is approaching the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It will be captured into orbit around Ceres on 6 March 2015, when it will hopefully reveal many interesting features on the surface.","Nasa scientists in California have revealed images showing 'recent' flowing water on the surface of Vesta .

"Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's famous rose inking covering the whole of her behind has been voted the worst celebrity tattoo. The X Factor judge beat her Girls Aloud bandmate Sarah Harding in a new poll of 1,000 people after fans described the £12,000 flower design as 'naff'. Harding came second in the top 10 worst A-list tattoos for the huge phoenix inked on her back with the message: 'Don't Be Bitter - Glitter.' Scroll down for video . Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's large rose inking which is thought to have cost the singer £12,000 has been voted the worst celebrity tattoo ever . Cheryl's tattoo was done by artist Nikko Hurtado (pictured with Cheryl left)  who said that the piece took hours and hours to complete - she showed the tattoo off whilst performing on stage in tight leggings (right) In third place was the American actress Hayden Panettiere who was ridiculed over her tattoo saying 'Vivere senza rimipanti' which is meant to say 'To Live Without Regrets' in Italian. The Heroes actress - who recently gave birth to her first child actress - misspelled the phrase, adding an extra 'i' to the last word. Fourth place in the poll went to David Beckham for the incorrect spelling of his wife Victoria's name in Sanskrit. The footballer's tattoo, when translated, says 'Vihctoria'. Fifth place went to Katie Price who got a new tattoo to cross out the first name of her former husband Pete Andre following their split in 2009, leaving an ugly looking black mess on her arm. Sarah Harding came in just after her Girls Aloud bandmate Cheryl on the worst tattoo list for getting 'Don't be bitter - glitter,' tattooed on her back .

They divorced in 2003 and Angelina has since had the tattoo removed. 9 Tulisa Contostavlos for her cringeworthy 'Lucky You' message just above her bikini line. 10 One Direction's Louis Tomlinson for his 'Cup of Tea' design in tribute to the boy band's hit, Little Things . The sixth least popular tattoo was One Direction star Zayn Malik's tribute to his Little Mix star fiance Perrie Edwards. When Zayn got the comic book style tat he reportedly spent the whole time chatting about Perrie who he has been dating officially since April 2012. Seventh place on the list of offensive inkings was Melanie Griffith for her Antonio tattoo - her embarrassing tribute to her now ex-husband Antonio Banderas. And it seems Melanie is pretty embarrassed about the situation herself. After their split she was seen rocking a humerous bandage over the tattoo with her own name scrawled on it. Angelina Jolie came in eighth place for making the same mistake as Griffith. She has now had the tattoo dedicated to her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton removed. In ninth place was former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos for the 'Lucky You' message just above her bikini line. Many fans were horrified when they first spotted the singer's tattoo, she also has 'Female Boss,' on her right arm. Tenth place and perhaps the least offensive of all the tattoos went to Louis Tomlinson of One Direction for his 'Cup of Tea' design in tribute to the boy band's hit, Little Things. The poll was carried out by Premier Laser Clinic, Britain's leading tattoo removal centres - somewhere our celebrities may like to remember. Katie Price, who stars in the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother decided the best way to get rid of her tattoo tribute to her husband Peter Andre was to draw a big cross over it .

A spokesman for the clinic advised our stars to: 'Think before you ink - that should be engraved on the brain of everyone before they even contemplate having a tattoo, particularly if it is dedicated to a romantic partner.' Here's looking at you, Zayn. And you should be particularly careful if you're planning an elaborate design like Cheryl. Tulisa's 'Lucky You' tattoo has been voted the ninth worst celebrity inking . One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, left, has made it onto the top 10 thanks to his cup of tea design, right . 'Technology has improved to such an extent that pretty much any embarrassing tattoo can be removed and barely leave a trace of the former artwork,' they said. 'Obviously some tattoos are easier to get off that others. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's floral design is said to have taken 14 hours to create and would take several months to remove.' The clinic also quizzed fans on what their favourite celebrity tattoos were and from David Beckham to Harry Styles these are the celebrities that come up trumps... 1. Fans loved Victoria Beckham's Hebrew design down her upper spine that says: 'I am my love's and my love is mine, who browses among the lilies.' 2.

"A funeral home in Arkansas has been shut down after dozens of bodies were found decomposing in over-stacked coolers with some left out in the open. Inspector Leslie Stokes, who visited Arkansas Funeral Care in Jacksonville  last week, said she found one corpse 'half covered in a bed sheet that was saturated in bodily fluids.' When she returned the next day, the body was still there, 'half wrapped in a soiled sheet, unrefrigerated,' she wrote in a report obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Arkansas Funeral Care in Jacksonville, Arkansas, has been shut down after dozens of bodies were found decomposing in over-stacked coolers with some left out in the open - her video footage captures the scene . Stokes also reported seeing what she believed to be blood smeared on the walls of the prep room and cremation ashes mixed with garbage in a trash container. The Arkansas Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors suspended the licenses of the funeral home and its manager, LeRoy Wood, during an emergency hearing Wednesday. The company - which charges up to $2,710 for burials - has been in business since 2006. A woman who answered the funeral home's phone Friday said she couldn't take a message for Wood asking for a comment on the incident. In a statement to the board Wood denied allegations, stating: 'We have the utmost respect, care and reverence for everyone's loved one we are privileged to serve.' The company - which charges up to $2,710 for burials - has been in business since 2006. Wood has not been charged with breaking any laws, and authorities have not said if they are considering action. In total, 31 bodies were removed from the funeral home. They were transported to the state crime lab or Pulaski County's coroner's office. Board staff members spent much of Thursday notifying the families of the deceased where the bodies had been taken so they could arrange to have the transferred to other funeral homes. The board began investigating the funeral home after a former employee informed it in a January 12 letter that the business showed a 'blatant disregard for the dead.' The investigation is ongoing.","Arkansas Funeral Care in Jacksonville has been in business since 2006 .

Safe and sound: The 45-year-old actor put a protective arm around his little son while chatting on his cell phone . Edward, 45, and Shauna, 40, a Canadian film producer who has worked frequently with Judd Apatow on comedies such as Knocked Up, Superbad and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, quietly got engaged back in 2011 following a six-year courtship. In April 2013 it was revealed they had celebrated the birth of a child, but they wouldn’t even comment if the baby was a boy or girl . The pair now live quietly in Manhattan where they have been spotted cooing over their son. In October, Edward was seen beaming as took the toddler to the park.

He was given the task as punishment for leading the Titans in their battle with the Olympian for control of the heavens. As a baby name, it was one of the fast-rising names on the 2013 list, coming from no-where into the top 800 - and undoubtedly has the connotation of giving the baby great strength. Actress Anne Heche was one of the first to make this audacious choice. In November 2009, she welcomed  baby boy Atlas Heche Tupper with boyfriend James Tupper. Although he's known for playing tough characters, Edward was happy to show off his softer side during a day out with his baby son. The actor, whose film credits include Fight Club and American History X, was even dressed in similar t-shirt, jeans and caps to Atlas. The talented actor, known for his complicated movie roles, will walk down the red carpet at the Oscars on Sunday, February 22, to join co-stars Michael Keaton and Emma Stone as Birdman has been feted with nine nominations.

Tough guy no more: Although he is known for playing tough characters, Edward Norton was happy to show off his softer side during a day out with his baby son and his wife in Malibu in January 2014 . Announcing the arrival of Atlas, Us Weekly reported that the actor couldn't be more thrilled. 'Ed is really excited for fatherhood,' a source told the magazine. 'He helped pick out a stroller for the baby.' Despite not publicly announcing their baby's name, the game was given away when Shauna took her son to an event in Malibu last April.

"Four 11-year-olds jumped out of a car belonging to one of their mothers after it became clear she was driving while drunk on Tuesday night. The terrified kids, two boys and two girls, had been on a day out in Gainesville, Florida, under the supervision of the mother of one of the boys, Angela Renee Woodworth of Interlachen, when she became so drunk that her driving was impaired. After the car hit the pole and a mirror was broken off  at about 8:30 p.m., the four children fled to a nearby Steak ‘n Shake restaurant where they alerted diners, who called the police. Angela Woodworth, 45, was arrested on Tuesday in Gainesville after her son and three friends realised she was drunk, jumped out of her car and fled into a restaurant after she began swerving across the road . ‘One of the boys told me his mom, they just left Ruby Tuesday, and his mom was really drunk and swerving all over the road,"" Josh Kramer, who was dining at the restaurant, told WJXT. 'When they came to a stop, the kids jumped out of the car and ran into the restaurant.’ Kramer called 911. While he was on the phone to the 911 dispatcher, Woodworth entered the restaurant and began to scream at the children, ordering them toget back in the car. ‘The kids took off running around the restaurant. She started following them around the restaurant.' 'I finally got them back up front and told them to stay on the sidewalk, police would be here in a second and they didn't need to be scared. I was helping them out,’ said Kramer. When a police officer arrived the children ran to him. The Steak n' Shake in Gainesville, Florida, where the four kids sought refuge, and where diners called police. Woodworth was found to be intoxicated as well as in possession of a small quantity of marijuana . Woodworth’s son told police that they had visited a park, a Chinese restaurant, had been bowling, and had gone to the mall. He also told police that his mother had drunk two pitchers of beer at the bowling alley and had a margarita at a branch of Ruby Tuesday at the mall. The other children gave the same account of events. Police discovered from charge receipts that Woodworth had consumed four drinks at Ruby Tuesday while the children roamed the mall unsupervised. It was when they left the mall that Woodworth began to swerve all over the road. Gainesville Police Department officer Ben Tobias described the scene: ‘They were not in a parking space, so we could only assume that her driving was so bad at that point that she couldn't even make it into the parking space.’ ‘We are very glad that the children were not hurt.’ Woodworth refused to cooperate with officers, and showed signs of severe impairment, including slurred speech. Upon searching the vehicle police found 2 grams of marijuana and a pipe under the driver’s seat. She was subsequently arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana, and four counts of child neglect, according to the Gainesville Police Department. Officers notified the Department of Children and Families. Woodworth’s son was taken to stay with relatives and his three friends were returned to their parents.","The two boys and two girls, all 11, were on a day out when the mother of one of the boys became intoxicated .

"A new poll of New Hampshire voters shows Mitt Romney with a commanding lead over his potential Republican presidential challengers. Romney was far and away Republican voters and right leaning independents' first choice in the all-important primary state in NH1's latest survey. Nearly a third of respondents said they'd support Romney, the former governor of neighboring state Massachusetts, if their state's primary, slated for February of 2016, were held now. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Still the one: A majority of Republican voters and right-leaning independents in New Hampshire would pick Mitt Romney all over again if he ran for president in 2016, as he's suggested he might . Romney indicated earlier this month that he may seek the Republican nomination again next year after repeatedly telling reporters throughout the fall that another presidential campaign was off the table. His about-face has turned the race upside down and could present a problem for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who shares the same base of donors and campaign hands as establishment-backed Romney. The two men met yesterday in Utah, where Romney has a home, for a previously planned meeting. It's unclear from aides' description of the get together what, if any, agreement the former governors came to about the 2016 race. 'Governor Bush enjoyed visiting with Governor Romney today in Salt Lake,' Bush's spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the New York Times, but wouldn't say more. 'Every interaction I’ve observed between them has been positive and friendly,' former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, a Romney ally, told the Times. I'm 'very confident it was a gentlemanly conversation.' If the both Romney and Bush proceed with presidential campaigns, their relationship will likely become a whole lot less 'gentlemanly.' To clinch the nomination, the like-minded politicians must be able to differentiate themselves for voters. Last time around: Jeb Bush (left) campaigned for Romney in 2012 but the two might go head-to-head in 2016 . So far Romney, with his high name ID left over from the last presidential contest, is winning the battle. Bush garnered less than half the support of Romney in the New Hampshire poll, taking just 11 percent of the vote. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker were tied at eight percent, coming in just ahead of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Rand Paul, whom each attracted seven percent of likely primary voters. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was the favorite of just five percent of respondents and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida were voters' last choices at four and three percent, respectively.","New Hampshire primary is 13 months away but former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has the upper hand .

"Lawyers for the alleged teenage ‘sex slave’ who says she slept with Prince Andrew are trying to serve papers on him via the British Embassy. They claim the duke last week refused to accept a letter asking him to testify on oath about the allegations made by Virginia Roberts. In a bid to try again, Miss Roberts’ lawyer said yesterday: ‘We are attempting delivery through the British Embassy in Washington.’ The development came the day after Andrew spoke publicly to deny that he had sex with Miss Roberts. Prince Andrew seen leaving his luxury chalet in Klosters, Switzerland, where he is attending the  World Economic Forum in Davos . In an unprecedented move, the duke used a televised speech in Davos to ‘reaffirm’ Buckingham Palace’s emphatic denials that he had ever had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with his accuser. Reading from carefully scripted notes, the prince said: 'Firstly I think I must, and want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks. 'And I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.' He added: 'My focus is on my work and this evening's reception allows me to tell you about just a couple of the initiatives that I have founded and am passionate about.' The Duke looked sombre as he left his £13million ski chalet in Klosters, Switzerland, today and is expected to make another appearance at the forum. The lurid accusations have overshadowed his trip to the World Economic Forum, where he was a key speaker. He looked sombre as he left his luxury £22,000-a-week ski chalet in Klosters, Switzerland today . Miss Roberts alleges Andrew abused her on three occasions in 2001 when she was 17 – in London, New York and at an orgy with other girls in the Caribbean. The extraordinary letter sent to the duke by her lawyers states: ‘This is a formal request to interview you under oath... at a time and place of your choosing.’ But they say couriers FedEx returned the letter because it was ‘refused’ by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. It remains to be seen whether the British Embassy in Washington would accept any letter sent on behalf of Miss Roberts. When asked about the possibility last night, a spokesman for the Foreign Office sighed and said he had no information. Legal experts also say the duke runs the risk of being ambushed with a subpoena next time he visits the US. If he were handed disposition papers, he would in theory be obliged to attend a court hearing or face the threat of jail. Whether he has diplomatic or royal immunity has never been tested in international law. Prince Andrew spoke for the first time last night to deny the sex accusations, at the World Economic Forum . Virginia Roberts (right) has claimed that she was forced by  financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, pictured together in early 2001 . The damaging claims emerged at the start of the month when Miss Roberts lodged papers with a US court as part of a legal battle against Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire convicted paedophile. In the papers, she claimed Epstein not only abused her from the age of 15 but had also ‘procured’ her for several of his ‘powerful’ friends, including Andrew. Buckingham Palace has issued two strong denials on Andrew’s behalf.Weeks of damaging claims about his alleged relationship with Miss Roberts were sparked at the beginning of the month when her lawyers lodged papers with a US court as part of a legal battle against Epstein. In the papers, she claimed that Epstein had not only repeatedly abused her from the age of 15 but had also 'procured' her for several of his 'powerful' friends, including Andrew. Miss Roberts alleges she and the royal had sex when she was aged around 17, still a minor under US law in some states. Buckingham Palace has issued two strong denials on Andrew's behalf, which state that not only is there is no foundation in the allegations but that he never had any sexual contact or relationship with his accuser. Epstein has also called Miss Roberts a liar. Then on Wednesday papers were filed in a Florida court revealing that Miss Roberts's lawyers have written to Andrew asking him to testify on oath about the nature of their relationship. Sources at last night's Davos party said you 'could have heard a pin drop' as the prince started to speak, with some describing it as an 'awkward quiet'. Courtiers said it had not been an 'easy or comfortable' decision for the prince to speak publicly about such a personal issue. But after long conversations with senior aides and legal advisers, he concluded that the continuing allegations were so damaging he had no choice but to confront them. The packed reception at the five-star Belvedere Hotel was held amid tight security. It is a big annual draw at Davos, and this year attracted the likes of disgraced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, BT boss Gavin Patterson, BP's Bob Dudley, Mark Bolland of Marks & Spencer and former trade secretary Lord Mandelson. Miss Roberts's lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his 'voluntary cooperation in answering questions about his sexual interactions' with her - but it was not accepted . Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, accompanied by his wife Cherie, was also there, however he was said to have left before the prince took to his feet. Many of the prince's supporters greeted him warmly. John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said Prince Andrew was right to turn up to Davos and host the reception. 'He has always been a big advocate of British business,' he said. Another male friend was seen to put his hand supportively on his shoulder for a few moments, prompting a smiling Andrew to shake him by the hand. The prince, dressed in a smart suit but with trainers on due to the slippery conditions outside, left in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover 15 minutes after the event ended at 8pm local time. Sources said the prince is paying for the cost of the trip himself. Pages from a detailed document filed in Florida by Virginia Roberts included this photo to show how young she was at the time of the allegations . Virginia Roberts included four photos of herself in the new court filing to illustrate her connection to the places in New Mexico mentioned in the court documents . It is not known whether Prince Andrew is covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law. However, the prince may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy. Diplomatic immunity protects foreign diplomats from legal action in the country where they work. Extradition lawyer Karen Todner said the prince could be formally asked to give evidence 'only in criminal proceedings'. If he refused to co-operate, he could in theory be banned from entering America. The letter offered to interview the prince, pictured on a skiing holiday on January 4 after the initial allegations were revealed, under oath. But her lawyers said the letter had been 'refused by the recipient' In new documents, Miss Roberts (left) also launched a stinging attack on the Duke's (right) denials of her allegations. She claims they had sex when she was 17 . Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (right). The two are pictured together in Central Park, in New York . Smiling coyly for the camera in a simple white blouse, this is Virginia Roberts around the time she has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her. The photograph was taken by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the man she says turned her into a 'sex slave' and procured her for the Queen's son. Photos: Virginia pictured aged 17 (left), in a picture taken by Epstein, and aged 15 (right). These pictures are two of five photos included in Miss Roberts's new legal submission . The snapshot is one of five photos included in Miss Roberts's new legal submission to show how young she looked. 'I was approximately 17 at the time,' she said. She adds: 'I visited and travelled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of 2002. 'I had sex with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex with.' She said she included the photos to 'illustrate my connection to these places'.

"This is the dramatic moment a group of fishermen were rescued from freezing waters seconds before their boat sank. Five of the crew from Irish vessel, the Iuda Naofa, can be seen scrambling on the upturned stern of the boat after it got into trouble about 48 miles north of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on Monday. Large waves crashed into the sinking ship, sending four of the stranded crew into the sea, as the last fisherman managed to escape just moments before it completely submerged. Crew members from the Iuda Naofa got into trouble while fishing north of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland . Footage captured by the Scottish Coastguard shows the dramatic moment the five crew members were rescued as their ship sank below them . The Scottish Coastguard sent a rescue helicopter to the scene after they had tried to use a salvage pump to clear water from the boat - but it was soon swamped and started to sink. A winch line had been connected between the helicopter and the boat but it had to be released as the vessel went down to prevent the helicopter being pulled down with it. Two men got to another nearby vessel, the Star of Hope, in a rescue raft while the other three men were airlifted to the Western Isles hospital, where they were treated for mild hypothermia. It took just 35 seconds for the boat to go under - where is now lies at the at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Deckhand, Micheál Ó Conghaíle, was on board with his father when they started to get into trouble and has told of how he clung to the 63-year-old as they waited to be rescued. 'We started fishing about 8pm Monday night about 30 miles Northwest of [North] Rona,' explained the 32-year-old from Inis Mor, Galway. It took just 35 seconds for the boat to go under - where is now lies at the at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean . Close call: The last fisherman managed to escape just moments before it completely submerged (pictured) A winch line had been connected between the helicopter and the boat but it had to be released as the vessel went down to prevent the helicopter being pulled down with it . 'After we took the fish aboard we were taking in water. It's not unusual for wooden fishing boats. 'We were minding the pumps but the water got the better of the pumps in the end. We could see we couldn't win the battle so we called the coastguard.' After lowering another pump the coastguard decided it was time to winch the crew to safely and told them gather at the stern. Mr Ó Conghaíle continued: 'The coastguard said from the moment all five of us were on the stern it took just 35 seconds to go down. 'She went over. I heard a pop of the life raft coming up and two of the crew climbed on. 'She didn't hit me - I knew I wasn't caught but I was in the water and there was a bit of rope tangled. I pulled that off. I was frightened she might pull me down with her. 'When I was in the water and holding onto dad I saw a seagull eating a fish. He was picking at something and I was looking at him thinking ""This is just a normal day for you"".' Two men got to another nearby vessel, the Star of Hope, in a rescue raft while the other three men were airlifted to the Western Isles hospital, where they were treated for mild hypothermia . Deckhand Micheál Ó Conghaíle has described how he clung to his 63-year-old father Mairtín in the freezing cold waters as they waited to be rescued . Mr Ó Conghaíle, father Mairtín, 63, and another deckhand were winched onto the helicopter one by one. They were taken to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis and treated for mild hypothermia and cared for by the Stornoway Fishermen's Mission. Praising the efforts of the Coastguard Mr Ó Conghaíle said: 'We are eternally grateful for them rescuing us. The Fishermen's Mission were amazing. They couldn't do enough for us.' The terrifying experience has not put him off fishing and he added that he will return to the sea when the weather conditions improve. Earlier this month, eight crew were lost when a Cypriot-registered ship sunk off the north of Scotland. The Cemfjord, a cement carrier, capsized in stormy conditions on January 2 while attempting to make its way through the Pentland Firth. No trace of the seven Polish nationals and one Filipino on board the vessel has been found despite searches. A church service was held in their memory in Wick, Caithness, at the weekend with candles lit for each of the crew members and their families.","Crew members from the Iuda Naofa got into trouble off the Isle of Lewis .

"A couple is suing a hospital over the death of their new-born girl Chloe, after a planned home birth went tragically wrong. Parents Emma Kilby and Paul Gent, from Melbourne, say they're lodging the legal action over her death  because 'we just don’t want this to happen to anyone else'. They say the publicly-funded home option, which they insist was offered to them by Sunshine Hospital, was the reason the birth went wrong. Chloe died almost 11 days later. Emma Kilby and Paul Gent are taking legal action over the home birth of the baby Chloe . The couple claim in a statement regarding the writ lodged in court, that the home birth program offered by Sunshine Hospital 'failed us' Court documents show that Ms Kilby's waters broke at 12.15am on January 26, 2012, and after calling the hospital they were told the originally assigned midwife was not available and another was on the way. The baby was born at about 12.50am with no midwife present. That's when, they say, Chloe's colour had them concerned something was wrong. The couple says they received a text message from the hospital with a phone number for the midwife, which they allege was wrong. It's further claimed that the midwife arrived at 1.25am, by then the documents state, Chloe was not breathing. She died on February 5. 'There are really basic things that could have been done to make a difference, that mean that Chloe would be alive. That program failed us,' they said. 'Mostly it was about communication. 'Giving us the right phone number for a start and being on the phone and asking more questions about how the baby was, what she was doing, instead of hanging up and leaving us on our own. 'That is what should have happened. They knew the midwife would take an extended time to arrive and should have advised us or called an ambulance. 'It wasn’t as if we were demanding a home birth at all costs.' They say that at about the 20 week mark, the possibility of a home birth was raised with them by the hospital. Ms Kilby and Mr Gent say after the trauma of a quick labour which led to their oldest daughter being born in the back of ambulance, they decided to move back to Melbourne and within close proximity of a hospital. 'It wasn’t as if we were demanding a home birth at all costs,' said Ms Kilby and Mr Gent. Their lawyer told Daily Mail Australia 'these people are not ideologically tied to home birth, by any stretch' Their lawyer Emily Hart of Maurice Blackburn confirmed the action against Western Health had been lodged. 'They wanted to make it (the birth) as seamless as possible, so if they did have a quick labour, they were close to a hospital,' she said. Ms Hart added that the couple, who have three other children, did enter into conversation with hospital officials immediately after their daughter's death but were not happy with the explanations they received. 'They had a meeting with the hospital soon after Chloe passed away and had to try pretty hard to get it but they weren't satisfied with the answers they received,' Ms Hart added. 'Their primary focus is to make sure it doesn't happen to another family. There are not many of these home birth situations, so it's certainly a unique set of facts. 'These people are not ideologically tied to home birth, by any stretch.' Ms Hart explained that the legal action was based on several factors, the allegation the hospital provided them with the wrong phone contact for the midwife assigned to them, that not enough questions were asked about Chloe's health in the moments after the birth. They were further concerned over how long it took for the midwife to arrive at their home. 'We did what we were told to do and we did everything that was asked of us, we went to all our antenatal appointments. There were shortcomings in that service,' the couple added. Western Health officials told Daily Mail Australia they would be making no comment.

GIRL POWER: 'America has had enough of seeing that...sign on the Oval Office door saying, ""No Girls Allowed,"" ' Palin said . NOM NOM NOM: Palin made the comments while serving wild boar chili to the Salvation Army in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday. She was hosting an episode of Sportsman Channel program Hunt.Fish.Feed . ABC News caught up with Palin while she was serving wild boar chili to the homeless at a Las Vegas, Nevada, Salvation Army for an episode of Sportsman Channel program Hunt.Fish.Feed. She's also in the midst of promoting her hunting show, Amazing Alaska, about to begin its second season. Palin said the GOP needs to nominate a candidate 'who can take on Hillary' and 'show the nation what it is going to take to get the country back on the right track.' 'Because we can't afford status quo,' the former Alaska governor said in a clip of the interview released by ABC this afternoon. 'Status quo lately has been Latin for, ""We're getting screwed,' and status quo has got to go.' The Republican nominee out to be someone can 'turn things around, someone who will, in some respects, I don’t know, maybe be considered a bit avant garde, to the establishment anyway, because this next person has got to realize this is war, this is war for our hunters’ future,' she said at another point in the interview, according to ABC. Asked about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's candidacy and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Palin snarked, 'I can’t wait for new energy.' Moments later asserting that the GOP primary 'had better be a competition and not a coronation.' Palin, the 2008 vice presidential nominee, said she doesn't 'have to be' the Republican candidate for president but she's 'happy to drive that competition, because competition will make everyone better and produce more and be more candid regarding their solutions they will offer this country. 'I am very interested in that competitive process and, again, not necessarily me.'

'I want the absolute best because America deserves the best, in terms of leadership, getting this country on the right track,' she continued. She ultimately concluded 'it would be nice' to have a woman president, though, 'and it will be nice to see women jump into the ring.' Voicing her support for female candidates in December, Palin told Extra TV, 'I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot.'","'When you know that there is opportunity to do all you can to put yourself forward in the name of offering service, anybody would be interested'

"The resurgent Green Party does not want an endorsement from celebrity activist Russell Brand, party sources have revealed. There had been mounting speculation that the comedian-turned-anarchist – who has worked with leaders of the Left-wing environmental party in recent years – would be unveiled as the ‘Green Nigel Farage’. But senior party sources claimed they didn’t need an answer to the charismatic Ukip leader. The resurgent Green Party does not want an endorsement from celebrity activist Russell Brand, party sources have revealed . One said that if such an offer were to be made to Mr Brand, it should be declined because his ‘controversial’ reputation would be ‘toxic’ to some potential voters. ‘It might seem like a good idea for two or three days but I suspect it would quickly turn into a nightmare,’ the source added. Last year Green leader Natalie Bennett joined Mr Brand to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in London. He has also worked with Green MP Caroline Lucas, to get the Commons to debate drug policy. But Ms Bennett said last month that the party did not need ‘big personalities’ to be a success at the ballot box. She insisted it wanted to concentrate on serious issues and not be led by a person who ‘tosses their hair around and waves a pint’. Two separate polls this week confirmed a dramatic surge in support for the Greens. A YouGov poll showed them securing 10 per cent of the vote, with Labour support at its lowest since 2010. The Greens were on 9 per cent in a survey of voting intentions by ICM – a rise of four per cent in just one month. That is the party’s highest rating for two decades. Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: 'I do not recognise the sentiment in these quotes. One said that if such an offer were to be made to Mr Brand, it should be declined because his ‘controversial’ reputation would be ‘toxic’ to some potential voters . 'I've worked closely with Russell to promote a more evidence-based, effective and humane approach to drugs policy and appreciate all he has done to put the issue on the political agenda. He has effectively rattled the cage of Parliament and it is right that he has - MPs need to do far more to regain people's trust and confidence.' A party spokesman added that it and Mr Brand 'both believe there is a positive alternative to austerity economics and recognise that the politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past'. Australian-born Miss Bennett has taken the Greens to new heights since Miss Lucas, previously the most high profile figure in the party, stepped down from the role in 2012. Polling suggests Labour and the Lib Dems risk being engulfed by a 'Green Tide' which pollsters could cost Ed Miliband up to 17 seats at the election. The Greens appear to be doing particularly well among students and other younger voters, as well as peeling off some of the disaffected ex-Lib Dems who switched to Labour when their former party entered coalition with the Conservatives. There are growing fears among Labour MPs that the Greens - who have now been invited to take part in leaders' TV debates - could disrupt Mr Miliband's alleged '35 per cent strategy' of winning power with Labour's core vote plus another five or six per cent coming from disillusioned former Lib Dems. Ben Page, head of polling firm Ipsos Mori, said a Green vote share of nine per cent could cost Labour seventeen seats, which most of which would be won by the Tories. He said a Green tide in crucial university cities and towns could pose ‘a real problem for Labour’. Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party, once joined Mr Brand to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in London. The party has seen a huge rush of membership applications in recent weeks after David Cameron refused to take part in TV debates unless the Greens were excluded. The PM said it was not fair to include some minor parties like Ukip and the Lib Dems but not others. The Greens say their party rolls now approach 48,000, giving it more members than Ukip who have around 42,000 and the Liberal Democrats on some 45,000. Membership numbers have doubled in the past 12 months. Miss Bennett said this week that the party was targeting 12 seats in May. But she told BBC Newsnight it was possible that given the growth in support in recent weeks it could do even better. The Greens support radical policies including slashing funding for roads, ditching the Trident nuclear defence system and a raft of taxes on the wealthy – which appeal to disaffected left wing voters. The last time the Greens threatened the political establishment was in 1989 when they secured 2.2 million votes in European parliamentary elections. Last week Mr Miliband made a direct pitch to Green voters vowing to build more wind farms and saying that environmental issues were 'at the heart' of his beliefs.","Russell Brand has worked with leaders of the party in recent years .

"President Barack Obama jets off to India in the wee hours of Saturday morning, in the hope of making progress on climate change negotiations and national security talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The visit is largely ceremonial, though, timed to coincide with Republic Day festivities, which mark the day in 1950 when the country's Constitution took effect. But global warming is on the agenda, along with other issues including India's intensifying disputes with Pakistan. The president will not visit Pakistan, unlike on his previous visit. He and the first lady plan to be back in Washington, D.C. early on Wednesday so he can partcipate in a farewell ceremony for outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. America's military draw-down in Afghanistan and ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran will also be on the menu in India. 'From the time the president took office, he's made increasing U.S. engagement with India a top foreign policy priority, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications Ben Rhodes told reporters on Thursday. But the world's two largest democracies have seen deep tensions in recent years. Indian artist Jagjot Singh Rubal gives final touches on a painting of US President Barack Obama in Amritsar, India, Friday, Jan. 23, 2015 . So the White House was caught off guard when Modi invited Obama to be the first American president to attend the Republic Day events. Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit India twice while in office. 'It took us by some surprise,' said Rhodes. 'There's a great affinity between the United States and India and our people, but there's also a history that is complicated and that would have made it seem highly unlikely that a U.S. president would be sitting with India's leaders at their Republic Day ceremony.' After some internal deliberations, the White House accepted Modi's offer. The president and first lady Michelle Obama arrive in New Delhi early Sunday, local time, for a three-day visit that includes a fresh round of bilateral meetings, an economic summit with U.S. and Indian business leaders and a visit to the famed Taj Mahal. The city of Agra, where the monument is located, has mobilized 600 people to clean streets, round up stray dogs and clear cows from the streets. Authorities have ordered a lockdown around the complex. 'There are a lot of spit stains and such that need to be washed away. The streets need to be spick and span,' said India's former chief archaeologist KK Mohammed, who has guided world leaders around the white marbled mausoleum. 'You cannot have a VVVIP of the world come to the Taj Mahal and let him see that,' Mohammed told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The president's visit is expected to be heavy on symbolism and lighter on substantive advances. Indian political commentator Ashok Malik said expectations for concrete deliverables during the visit are 'below the standards usually set by U.S. presidents when they travel across the world for a three-day visit.' Still, U.S. and Indian officials appear to agree that even a symbolic show of solidarity between the leaders would be a sign of progress after recent difficulties. While military cooperation and U.S. defense sales have grown, Washington has been frustrated by India's failure to open up to more foreign investment and to address complaints alleging intellectual property violations. In Sept. 2014, Obama met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House. . Obama arrives in New Delhi on Sunday and will be the first American president to attend India's annual Republic Day festivities . India's liability legislation has also prevented U.S. companies from capitalizing on a landmark civil nuclear agreement between the two countries in 2008. Relations hit a new low in 2013 when India's deputy consul general, Devyani Khobragade, was arrested and strip-searched in New York over allegations that she lied on visa forms to bring her maid to the U.S. while paying the woman a pittance. The official's treatment caused outrage in New Delhi, and India retaliated against U.S. diplomats. For Modi, hosting Obama at the Republic Day parade caps off a year of high-profile diplomatic maneuvers by a leader who was once shunned by the international community and even denied a U.S. visa in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official. The visit ties in neatly with Modi's election promise that he would turn around Asia's third-largest economy. And it could send a message to Pakistan and China – India's closest neighbors and rivals – that Modi has a powerful ally in the United States. 'Modi has used the invitation as a way of signaling that the United States really looms large in his calculations for where he want to take India,' said Ashley Tellis, a senior associate at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. U.S. officials say they hope the improving relationship between Obama and Modi will have payoffs in the policy arena. The White House plans to push India on climate change, particularly after reaching a sweeping agreement with China on limiting carbon emissions. The president will also be accompanied on his trip by several U.S. business leaders in hopes of forging new partnerships with India. The centerpiece of Obama's visit will be Monday's celebrations, which are partly a Soviet-style display of India's military hardware and partly a Macy's Thanksgiving Day-type parade with floats from across the country highlighting India's cultural diversity. The parade, once a huge attraction, has lost much of its sheen for India's elite over the past decade. But it continues to draw tens of thousands of visitors eager to view the spectacle at least once in their lifetimes.

"The Phoenix-based company that publishes the long-running SkyMall in-flight catalogue has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a US court. Xhibit Corp and its subsidiaries, including SkyMall LLC, are seeking to sell off their assets in a sale to be supervised by the US Bankruptcy Court in Arizona, the Wall Street Journal reports. In court papers obtained by the newspaper, Scott Wiley, the company’s chief financial officer and acting chief executive, said the magazine has become a victim of increased competition and changing times. The parent company of the SkyMall in-flight catalogue has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . SkyMall claims the futuristic-looking iGrow Hair Rejuvenation Laser gives users a thicker, fuller head of hair . He said fewer people are browsing the in-flight catalogue with the increased use of electronic devices on planes. Available on many US flights, the in-flight catalogue is facing greater competition for sales and passengers’ attention now that more airlines are providing wifi access, he added. SkyMall is celebrating its silver anniversary this year, declaring itself a retailer of ’25 years of cool stuff’. One of SkyMall's top sellers is Orbitwheels, which combines elements of skateboarding and inline skating . The quarterly publication is known for its quirky products – from travel accessories and exercise equipment to garden gnomes and cat toys. According to its website, SkyMall’s top-selling items include a barbecue spatula with a built-in torch, a computer mouse shaped like a car, sofa dog beds, and a T-shirt reading ‘Of course I’m right.

"Osram’s Classic Eco Superstar bulb carries the word ‘eco’ – will consume ten times more energy than the latest LED technology, researchers say . Households are being misled over light bulbs that are branded as ‘eco’ but can burn out in a matter of weeks, campaigners claim. Philips and Osram, two of the biggest manufacturers, are using the term on halogen bulbs that can use ten times more energy than the latest technology. Consumer groups say the products are being ‘greenwashed’ and are fooling the public into thinking they are getting an environmentally-friendly light source that can cut family bills. Yesterday campaigners threatened legal action as one firm claimed that eco actually stood for ‘economy’ – a reference to price rather than the bulb’s ability to save on power. Halogen bulbs, which cost around £1.50 each, are among the least energy-efficient bulbs widely available today and have been surpassed by technologies including LEDs and compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs – some of which will burn ten times less energy. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with LEDs – which can cost around £7 – will save a family £40 a year in electricity bills. Yet Philips’s EcoClassic bulb and Osram’s Classic Eco Superstar bulb both carry the word ‘eco’ – even though each has an energy efficiency grade of C or D – the lowest being E. They will last just 2,000 hours and consume ten times more energy than the latest LED technology, researchers say. Campaign group Coolproducts is now calling for the ‘eco’ label to be restricted to products which are truly efficient and said it is considering legal action against the companies. EU law prevents firms using the phrase ‘energy-saving lamp’ when marketing halogens, but does not rule out using the term ‘eco’. Campaign group Coolproducts is now calling for the ‘eco’ label to be restricted to products which are truly efficient and said it is considering legal action against the companies . Stephane Arditi of Coolproducts said: ‘Halogens are only eco in comparison to incandescent bulbs that Philips and Osram know were phased out years ago, yet this packaging is modern. ‘Whether greenwash or consumer manipulation, the effect is the same – people think they are getting energy savers when in fact they are buying the worst bulbs on the market. ‘They would be far better off buying LEDs or CFL bulbs from forward-thinking retailers.’ Halogen bulbs were the most efficient type available when they were invented in the 1960s. But since filament technology was phased out in the last few years, halogen bulbs can no longer be classed as energy efficient, say campaigners. Halogen bulbs were the most efficient type available when they were invented in the 1960s. Since filament technology was phased out in the last few years, halogen bulbs can no longer be classed as energy efficient, say campaigners . Osram yesterday admitted its eco branding was a reference to its cheapness compared to newer technologies. A spokesman for the German-based firm said: ‘ECO is an abbreviation for ECOnomy as well as for ECOlogy. ‘Unlike CFL bulbs and LED lamps, halogen lamps can be disposed of in household waste as they do not contain electronic components and from a health perspective do not emit electronic magnetic fields.’ Philips said shoppers are given enough information on packaging to make an informed decision. A spokesman pointed out that halogen bulbs would still save more money than traditional incandescent filament bulbs – which are still in some stores because any stocks held at the time of the phase-out in 2011 are allowed to be sold. The spokesman added: ‘Our packaging contains information so that consumers can make an informed decision when purchasing a Philips light bulb, especially the energy label, which allows consumers to easily compare one product to another and makes very clear what the energy consumption of the bulb is.’ Richard Black, of think-tank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ‘This will disappoint Britons who’ve invested in these bulbs believing that they were saving money and doing something to reduce climate change. ‘Both Philips and Osram have made impressive-sounding statements regarding their commitment to tackling climate change, and this news is likely to make some people question how serious the companies are.’","Halogen light bulbs  branded as ‘eco’ can burn out in a matter of weeks .

"Target for thieves: Jars of Manuka honey are being protected with security tags in some Tesco stores . When you’re at the supermarket check-out, you invariably have to wait while the assistant wrestles the security tag off certain items. A bottle of gin? Only to be expected. A packet of razors? Safety first. A jar of honey? Erm … . But that’s exactly what some Tesco customers will encounter the next time they try to buy a jar of Manuka honey, which retails at more than £20 and is the latest health food craze. The manager at one Tesco store has decided to lock the jars in plastic security boxes because they are proving so tempting to thieves. The boxes set off an alarm if they are taken out of the shop. The honey, highly prized for its antibacterial properties, joins an increasingly long list of items security tagged to stop unlikely middle-class shoplifters walking off with them. They include organic chickens, Christmas turkeys and even some kinds of expensive cheese. Tough economic conditions mean some middle-class shoppers are turning to theft to maintain their standard of living, experts say. Tesco has given its store managers the freedom to choose which products it puts in the security boxes, based on which are stolen most frequently. A manager at the Newmarket Road store in Cambridge, one of the most affluent cities in the country, has decided to use the boxes to protect its stock of Manuka honey. Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, calculates that shop theft by customers and staff adds up to £4.9billion a year in the UK. ‘Manuka honey is so expensive,’ he said. ‘The fact is that you have people with expensive tastes but not necessarily the money in their pockets to pay for them. 'The problems with the economy, society, politicians and the banking industry have led many people to say “it’s alright to steal. I’ve got to look after myself because everyone is looking after themselves”.’ He added: ‘In the past someone might have been offered knock-off DVDs in a pub, but it is a little difficult to think of someone doing the same with a jar of honey. ‘That said, where you have an expensive product like this there is always an opportunity to sell it on through street markets and  car boot sales.’ Security: Tesco has given its store managers the freedom to choose which products it puts in the security boxes, based on which are stolen most frequently . Retail security experts Checkpoint Systems have highlighted the emergence of middle-class thieves. A spokesman said: ‘You might have a good income and lifestyle and want to maintain it. There is no typical shoplifter any more. It’s a broad profile across age, ethnic group, gender and income bands.’ Manuka honey has been promoted by the likes of tennis player Novak Djokovic and singer Katie Melua. It is extremely expensive, due to high demand and the fact that relatively small quantities are produced each year. Such is demand that manufacturers sometimes mix it with common honey to produce cheaper, mass market versions. The unique honey has been shown to have antibacterial effects. Advocates claim it maintains health and can combat skin problems and allergies.","Tesco allows store managers freedom to tag items that are stolen most often .

"One picture shows a cluster of indistinct circles. Another shows a delighted couple and the smiling healthy baby that they thought they may never have. And it was the first IVF image that finally gave Laura Lawrence and her husband Richard hope that they would one day be able to appear in a picture like the second. It is the same baby in each – the first taken at three days after conception and showing a group of just eight cells, the second now that their daughter Matilda is eight months old. Laura and Richard Lawrence were able to watch baby Matilda (now eight-months-old) develop in the womb from just three days after she was conceived via IVF technology . Usually expectant parents cannot see their growing baby until the 12-week scan, at which point it is around 2in long with its head, limbs and body visible. But incredibly, thanks to the revolutionary introduction of time-lapse photography in IVF treatment, Mrs Lawrence, 39, and her 50-year-old husband were given a first glimpse of Matilda before she was even implanted in the womb. The technology, which is only available in a handful of clinics, works by taking a picture every five to ten minutes so doctors can monitor how quickly the embryo develops from one crucial stage to another within the first few days of its life. It means only the most successful embryos are implanted and has been credited with doubling the success rate of IVF pregnancies. Mrs Lawrence, who suffered from severe endometriosis and ovarian cysts, received help from the EmbryoScope technology as part of her £6,000 IVF treatment at the Hewitt Fertility Centre in Knutsford, Cheshire. But, even with its aid, she only had a 23 per cent chance of having a baby. Without it, her chances were negligible. Matilda was born in May last year by caesarean section weighing 8lb 12oz. Mrs Lawrence, a British Airways cabin crew member, said: ‘She is my absolute miracle. Looking at that picture, you can’t believe that blob swimming around would turn into a beautiful girl. ‘Very few people can see that sort of image, so early on, but it gives you that extra little bit of confidence. First appearance: In a petri dish, the cells that would become Matilda just a few days after she was conceived . Growing: A scan of the baby at 32 weeks. The couple said watching their baby develop from earlier gave them 'an extra bit of confidence' that she would be born healthy . The couple struggled to conceive naturally for two years before resorting to private IVF treatment . ‘It was so exciting but nerve-wracking at the same time. You are just hoping it is going to work.’ Because medical writer Mr Lawrence already has two sons, aged 17 and 11, the couple, from Macclesfield in Cheshire, who met in 2010 and married last year, were not entitled to IVF treatment on the NHS. After trying to conceive naturally for two years they resorted to private treatment. Mrs Lawrence added: ‘I cannot believe I have this little girl who is so full of life. ‘I look at my beautiful girl and I just think I’m the luckiest person.’ The EmbryoScope takes images of the embryo in a petri dish so doctors can analyse its viability without having to disturb it. Time-lapse technology in IVF is a relatively new concept, with the world’s first baby conceived using Eeva-assisted (Early Embryo Viability Assessment) IVF born in Liverpool in May 2013. Studies have shown it can reduce the risk of miscarriage by over a third. The Hewitt Fertility Centre now offers it to all couples having IVF treatment. Lead clinician Dr Rafet Gazvani said: ‘Time-lapse technology has revolutionised the management of IVF and increased our success rates significantly.’","Laura and Richard Lawrence conceived their daughter Matilda via IVF .

"Yankees general manager Brian Cashman allegedly hacked into his mistress's emails and ordered her mother to have her committed in a desperate bid to keep their affair secret. Cashman, who was married at the time, accessed Louise Meanwell's messages 28 times over three days in 2012 after she threatened to expose him, court papers delivered to Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday allege. He found her mother's number in the contact book and warned her to keep Meanwell quiet, the suit continues. The case, reported by the New York Post, is the latest in a bitter legal feud between Cashman and Meanwell - who also goes by the last name Neathaway - that has spanned two years. Dispute: Yankees manager Brian Cashman (left) is accused of threatening to have Louise Meanwell (right) put in a mental facility after she 'threatened to go public' with their alleged affair in 2012 . 'Threats': Cashman allegedly called Louise's mother Caroline Meanwell telling her to keep her daughter quiet . British native Meanwell, 39, claims she had a 10-month affair with Cashman, 47, and that he promised to divorce his wife to be with her. However, the court papers say, it transpired he was also seeing another mistress and had no plans to leave Mary Bresnan, his wife of 17 years. Meanwell began sending dozens of texts and emails a day warning she planned to expose their liaison, she claims. In response, Cashman allegedly hacked Meanwell's emails and found her mother's contact details. A suit filed by Meanwell's mother Caroline in January last year accused Cashman of using scare tactics to force her into helping them. The suit claims he told her that the only three options left for her daughter were that, 'She will be committed, she will be arrested' or 'she will commit suicide and end up dead.' Cashman's attorney Eric Creizman, it continues, put the emphasis on 'and end up dead' as an ominous warning so that Meanwell would cooperate with them. Days later, on January 31, 2012, Meanwell filed a computer trespass complaint claiming a foreign IP address had accessed her email 28 times, the Post reports. 'No plans to divorce': Cashman, who has now separated from wife of 17 years Mary, allegedly promised Meanwell he would file for divorce to be with her. She claims she discovered he had another mistress . 'The intent of Cashman's call to Meanwell's mother was an attempt to silence and or discredit Meanwell, to wit Cashman in concert with others attempted to induce Meanwell's mother to assist in having Meanwell falsely committed to a psychiatric facility,' court papers read by the Post say. 'Cashman's desire to have Meanwell committed was to cover up his (Cashman's) marital infidelities,' the suit alleges. 'When Meanwell's mother asked Cashman how he (Cashman) obtained this private cell phone number, Cashman indicated that he (Cashman) had obtained the phone number from one of Meanwell's e-mails that he had hacked into.' During the alleged affair, Meanwell was having trouble in the family court system after losing custody of her daughter, according to a suit she filed last year. Battle: Louise Meanwell, who also goes by the last name Neathaway, was charged with stalking in 2012 . On a drunken night together at the 36-year-old's apartment, Cashman bragged to her that he could use his power as Yankee's manager to help her, the suit said. 'One evening Cashman, after several glasses of wine, nuzzled up to Louise on her rooftop and in a seductive manner, whispered in her ear...that the Yankees control the universe and that he controls the Yankees and that he would help her custody battle.' Meanwell dropped the suit due to administrative reasons last year, before refiling her claims this year. Meanwell was charged with stalking, extorting $6,000 from Cashman and attempting to extort $15,000 from Cashman on February 1, 2012. She denies the charges.","Louise Meanwell, 39, claims Brian Cashman hacked her emails 28 times after she 'found out he had another mistress' and she threatened to go public .

"A series of stunning images have been released showing Rosetta’s comet in unprecedented detail, revealing cracks on the surface, evidence of ice, steep cliffs and more. The snaps of 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko accompanied yesterday’s release of several scientific papers detailing new discoveries and observations of the comet. Scientists around will continue poring through data from Rosetta as the comet prepares to make its closest approach to the sun in August this year, when it is expected to become considerably more active than it is now. Scroll down for video . US and European scientists have revealed amazing new images of comet 67P Churyumov/Gerasimenko. Shown here is the boulder-strewn, smooth Hapi region in Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko’s neck, with the Hathor cliff face to the right . The pictures were analysed by various US and European scientists, revealing previously unknown characteristics of the comet. Yesterday the shape, evolution and lifespan of comet 67P-Churyumov/Gerasimenko were revealed in a series of groundbreaking papers in the journal Science. Using data from Rosetta, scientists revealed that the comet’s interior is ‘fluffy’. Among the other discoveries they found that the comet's neck may have been 'eaten away' over time, rather than being the result of two smaller bodies merging together. From the data, Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior. He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.' Many of the images were returned by the Osiris (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System) camera on the Rosetta spacecraft, which has imaged 70 percent of the comet’s surface to date. The remaining 30 per cent will remain unseen and shrouded in darkness until the comet makes its closest approach to the sun in August. ‘Rosetta is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit, learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and, over longer timescales, how its activity increases, how its surface may evolve, and how it interacts with the solar wind,’ said Esa Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor. ‘We have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet, but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution.’ From the images and data, five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined: dust-covered; brittle materials with pits and circular structures; large-scale depressions; smooth terrains; and more ‘rock-like’ surfaces. Much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust, as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time. This dust is also thought to be insulating the comet, based on data from the Microwave Instrument on the Rosetta Orbiter (Miro). This could play a key role in helping to protect ice thought to exist below the surface. Small patches of ice have even been spotted on the surface. Here, a section of the smaller of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko’s two lobes is seen through Rosetta’s narrow-angle camera from a distance of about five miles (8km) to the surface on 14 October 2014 . This is a summary of properties of the comet, as determined by Rosetta’s instruments during the first few months of its comet encounter. The full range of values are presented and discussed in a series of papers published in the 23 January 2015 issue of the journal Science . Shown is an active pit detected in the Seth region of the comet. This is an Osiris narrow-angle camera image acquired on 28 August 2014 at a distance of 37 miles (60km) from the comet. The image resolution is 3.3 feet (one metre) per pixel . Surface textures on the border of the broad, smooth region in Imhotep, on the large lobe of the comet, are seen here . On a larger scale, the images also revealed the huge exposed cliff walls on the comet, which are covered in randomly oriented fractures. Their formation is likely due to the rapid heating-cooling cycles experience by the comet’s 12.4-hour ‘day’, during which different parts of the surface are subjected to sunlight. One prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft (500m) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet, running between its two larger lobes at either end. Steep regions of the exposed cliff faces have also revealed features known as ‘goosebumps’, small lumpy areas, but their origin is not yet known. Are these icy alcoves? The colour composite on the left shows material 20 per cent brighter and bluer than the surrounding area (at A and B), which may be evidence of exposed ice. On the right, bright, highly reflective metre-sized boulders (C) and fracturing (D) are seen . This Osiris image was acquired on 22 November 2014 from a distance of 19 miles (30km) from the comet. The image resolution is 9.2ft (2.8 metres) per pixel. The nucleus is deliberately overexposed in order to reveal the faint jets of activity . This Osiris narrow-angle camera image shows part of a large fracture running across Comet 67P’s neck, in particular where it has left Hapi and is extending into Anuket. In this orientation, the Seth region is at the uppermost left and Hapi in the lower left . The biggest question remaining about the comet, though, is how it formed. Two predominant theories remain: either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘sticking’ together, forming a single comet, or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple. The latter theory is supported by the observation of numerous jets ejecting material from the comet’s neck. Images from the cameras have shown an increase in the amount of dust flowing away from the comet in the past six months. The comet has also been producing increasing amounts of water from ice melting on its surface, from 0.3 litres per second in early June 2014 to 1.2 litres per second by late August. As the comet approaches the sun, Rosetta scientists are expecting to see more ‘outgassing’ from the surface as the temperature increases. This close-up shows a curious surface texture nicknamed ‘goosebumps’. The characteristic scale of all the bumps seen on the comet is approximately ten feet (three metres), extending over regions greater than 330ft (100m). They are seen on very steep slopes and on exposed cliff faces, but their formation mechanism is yet to be explained .

"Anti-terror police made more than 160 Syria-related arrests in the UK last year - a six-fold increase on 2013. A total of 165 arrests were made by police officers across the country for offences including terrorist financing, commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and attending a terrorist training camp, Scotland Yard said. This compares to 25 Syria-related arrests the previous year. The announcement comes as UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon paints a worsening picture of the war in Syria, citing indiscriminate government bombing and opposition shelling, high civilian casualties and deteriorating humanitarian conditions. Scroll down for video . Islamic State: A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, is passing through Parliament . The total number of arrests for terrorist offences in 2014 was 327, a 32 per cent increase compared to the previous year. Helen Ball, senior national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing, said: 'Last year's arrest figures demonstrate a considerable increase in volume, range and pace of counter-terrorism activity in the UK. 'We have been running exceptionally high numbers of investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for many years. 'Several attack plots have been disrupted, of various sophistication, from individuals planning to carry out lone attacks to more complex conspiracies, the majority seemingly directed by or inspired by terrorism overseas. 'The partnership between police and MI5 is very effective, and we are experiencing very strong support from the communities. 'We will continue with this vital work to protect and work with the UK public to combat terrorism in all its forms.' Worsening picture: In his monthly report to the UN Security Council made public today, Ban Ki-moon paints a worsening picture of the war in Syria . In his monthly report to the UN Security Council made public today, the secretary-general said the use of roadside and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices increased and more than 21 suicide operations were reported in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Daraa in December. He said fighters from Islamic State reportedly incurred heavy casualties in intensified fighting with Kurdish forces last month, and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front reportedly continued to attract additional fighters and resources, particularly in Idlib and Daraa. Mashudur Choudhury, the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria to join ISIS . The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe last August against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Syria and Iraq to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'. Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in the wake of the rise of ISIS, which has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and attracted thousands of foreign jihadists to its cause, including more than 500 Britons. A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, is passing through Parliament. In December, father-of-two Mashudur Choudhury, 31, who was the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria to join ISIS, was jailed for four years. He was the only one of a group of six young men from Portsmouth to have returned after joining the brutal terror group. All but one of those who stayed has since been killed in the fighting - but Choudhury was apparently sent back after failing the selection process. He was found guilty in May of preparing acts of terrorism.","Number of Syria-related arrests last year was a six-fold increase on 2013 .

"Jason Lucas Revis, 33, of Oveido, Florida, was found guilty of molesting a 10-year-old girl . A US Army staff sergeant has been found guilty of molesting a 10-year-old girl, whose mother stabbed him when she witnessed the abuse. Jason Lucas Revis, 33, of Oveido, Florida, was convicted of of lewd and lascivious molestation, after he made the girl touch him inappropriately in September 2011. Jurors deliberated for less than four hours before finding Revis guilty last night. He is set to be sentenced on Monday. The court heard Revis was stabbed three times in the arm by the victim's mother after she walked in on him molesting her daughter. But Assistant State Attorney Dave Whateley said the defendant never sought any treatment for his injuries. He also convinced the victim and her mother to keep the incident quiet for more than two years. But Revis was arrested in February after the child confided in a friend and the child's mother notified authorities. The victim's mother told jurors in Spanish that she stabbed Revis 'once or twice', reported the Orlando Sentinel. She said: 'I thought since I was defending my daughter, I would not get in trouble.' She explained did not report the abuse when it occurred because her daughter refused to talk about it. The girl, now 13, told the court that the defendant had called her into his bedroom in September 2011 - but she was not sure on what day. She said he had told her to touch him in an inappropriate manner - and she did what he asked. But defense attorney Tony Dodds suggested that she had made up the story and asked if she had reported the incident to anyone in the two years after she said it happened. He asked: 'It never happened, did it?' Dodds asked. She replied: 'It did happen.' The girl added that her mother had then walked in on them and witnessed what was going on. Jurors deliberated for less than four hours before finding Revis guilty last night.

"The 55-year-old grandfather has been sentenced to 200 years for impregnating his 11-year-old granddaughter . A grandfather has been sentenced to 200 years in prison for impregnating his 11-year-old granddaughter and sexually assaulting the girl's younger sister. District Judge Jeffrey Langton sentenced the 55-year-old Stevensville man on Wednesday to 100 years each on two counts of incest. The judge said that he seemed 'to lack any semblance of a conscience'. The man, who is married according to public records, has not been identified to avoid identifying the victims. The man was arrested in June after the 11-year-old girl was found to be 32 weeks pregnant. She had gone to the doctor with cramping and claimed to have had sex with a 14-year-old boy at a county fair, whose name she did not know. However, medical staff noted that the term of the pregnancy and girl's suggested date of conception were out by three months. During a later interview, the girl then admitted that her grandfather had told her to make the story up. The 11-year-old said she did not know she was pregnant until informed by a doctor 'because she didn't know what pregnant felt like'. On July 1 last year, the nine-year-old girl told her biological mother that she witnessed the pedophile come into the girl's bedroom and assault her sister with his hands and mouth. During a forensic interview, she gave a detailed account of the oral sex, The Missoulian reported. The younger girl also told investigators that he had sexually assaulted her by 'kissing her privates', then telling her it was a secret she had to keep. The 11-year-old victim gave birth in August. The grandfather was the guardian of both girls. Judge Jeffrey Langton sentenced the grandfather to 200 years in prison for sexually abusing his young granddaughters at Ravalli County District court (pictured) The man pleaded guilty in November and bowed his head as he briefly apologized before his sentencing. He would have to serve 50 years in prison before being eligible for parole, at the age of 105. The pedophile had been charged two decades ago with lewd conduct with a minor and forced sexual penetration in a different state. The sheriff's office is still investigating claims that he sexually assaulted other girls, one as young as three.","The 55-year-old Stevensville man was jailed on Wednesday to 100 years each on two counts of incest .

"A female dominatrix has revealed all about her extreme behaviour to two therapists investigating Britain's sexual taboos. Rubikin, 32, from London, allows men to indulge in a number of fetishes which they would normally never admit to for fear of judgement. She explains: 'Feminine domination is where you are chastising men and disciplining them. It's quite an embarrassing, taboo subject to go down that road so they come to specialist services - to women like myself.' Scroll down for video . Rubikin, 32, from London, works as a dominatrix and men seek her services for various fetishes . Rubikin discovered childhood traumas contributed to her desire to abuse men in her adult sex life . Rubikin explains how some men want to indulge in baby role play or bondage while others want to be treated with disrespect and scorn. She explains: 'I might have them cleaning or lock them away in a cupboard and not let them out till they've paid me money, it's all designed to belittle them.' Most shocking of all, Rubikin will even agree to tie up and 'rape' her clients - having consensual sex while role playing an attack. Rubikin admitted she gets perverse pleasure from being mean and abusive to her willing 'victims'. She agreed to undergo regression therapy with Lisa Palmer and Nicolas Aujula to get to the root of her unusual sexual behaviour. The pair are researching the nation's sexual taboos to understand why people are compelled to behave in such a way. Rubikin said some of her clients want to be locked in a cupboard and she won't let them out till they pay her . The dominatrix shares her story with therapists Lisa Palmer, left, and Nicolas Aujula, right, in a bid to get to the root of her unusual sexual behaviour . Nicolas, 29, from London, uses hypnotherapy and regression to help people understand why their childhood - and, he believes, past lives - can cause them to commit acts that others find shocking and sickening and that are sometimes even illegal. He says his treatments can unlock memories and emotions from the sub-conscious that people were not consciously aware of. In Rubikin's case, he said: 'Her childhood has played a huge role in explaining her dominatrix behaviour.' During treatment, which was recorded by film maker Ros Owino, Rubikin reveals to Nicolas memories she has tried to forget concerning incidents when she was abused in her youth. She recalls how she was just seven when a boy her age with learning difficulties tried to have sex with her. In another memory, she recalls being touched inappropriately by a 68-year-old GP. Rubikin explains to Lisa how belittling men as a dominatrix makes her feel powerful . When she has past life regression, she sees herself as a strong and dominant male in the 1700s. Rubikin admits that her past experiences have led her to want to be dominant and in control and she has channelled this in her sexual activity. She said: 'Once I got into this job, I realised fem domination was taking me into that sexual side of my desire that I always wanted. 'I was abused by men for a long time so it makes me feel good, I can abuse them back and attack what I felt for years.' Dating coach Lisa said she and Nicolas were keen to help people like Rubikin who often don't have anyone to talk to about their taboo activities. As a result of her sessions with Lisa and Nicolas, Rubikin said she feels better about her life and her past. The 32-year-old says she feels happier and more confidence following her sessions with Lisa and Nicolas . She said: 'Since October when I came for the session, I've noticed it has instilled a lot of confidence within myself. I feel at ease and empowered to speak out more openly about who I am, I'm no longer willing to shy away from society. 'Also it has helped my body image issues, I've managed to lose half my body weight, around 5 stone since then, which I feel was connected with emotions I was carrying. I have clarity of who I am and no longer seek validation.' She added: 'It has not changed my sexual behaviour as such but instead of seeing lots of men I'm just seeing the one. I'm still indulging in my dominatrix acts but with just one man. It's an unconventional relationship.' Lisa and Nicolas said of their work with her: 'To be honest nothing could have prepared us for meeting Rubikin, who is amazing - warm, open, funny, shocked by nothing and generally has a larger than life personality. Which is incredible considering what Rubikin has been through as we found out through our session. Lisa and Nicolas have been shocked by some of the stories they have heard as they investigate taboos . 'We feel as thought the session has shed light of where she has come from, as that shapes who she is today. It all makes sense to us. We feel that dealing with old emotions would help her be more content with herself, find clarity and just be a peace.' Lisa and Nicolas began meeting people in early 2014 with sexual behaviours that were considered taboo, unacceptable or illegal - like zoophilia (arousal through inflicting pain on or seeing animals in pain), necrophilia (sexual attraction or intercourse with a corpse) and incest. More than 60 people (mostly men) were willing to share their behaviour and background story with the pair. Lisa, 41, from Kent, said: 'There must be a underlying reason to why people perform certain extreme forced or consensual sexual activities that deepened my interest in understanding taboos better. 'I guess I'm lucky that I had a good upbringing and was never exposed to such things however I do feel childhood experiences and even porn plays a role as it can put ideas into people's mind and influence them. As a dating coach who deals with relationships everyday, I was keen to explore extreme behaviors and work with Nicolas.' Nicolas added: 'As a therapist, I've heard it all but these extreme sexual revelations were at times truly stomach churning as they don't conform to acceptable behaviour. 'Just when I thought I had heard it all something else would come along to pull the rug under my feet. The most shocking story was of brother-sister incest who were adopted at birth and met later in life, it really challenged my ability to stay neutral. I was keen to understand the 'whys' to these behaviours, that understanding childhood/adolescent experiences became a focal point of our journey.' Tackling another taboo: Earlier this week, Lisa appeared on This Morning to demonstrate a 'vagina facial' Lisa said the investigations are deepening her understanding of human behaviour and she hopes it allows people with perverse inclinations to change their behaviour if it is harming themselves or others or breaking the law. It's not just sexual taboos that Lisa is currently investigating. She also caused a stir this week when she appeared on This Morning to reveal her recipe for a 'vagina facial'. She revealed how a lotion she has developed using Vitamin E cream, honey, egg white and coconut oil can make women look and feel younger below when applied regularly. Three brave women agreed to try the treatment live on the ITV show.","Rubikin, 32, from London, allows men to indulge in a number of fetishes .

"A Beaver Scout group has been hit by allegations of an affair between its married leader and one of the women who volunteers there after her partner made claims on the group's webpage. Software developer Billy Fagan, 36, posted a message on the website of Stonywood Scouts, in Aberdeen, yesterday, accusing partner Catherine Mcneice, 35, of being unfaithful. In the message, which he described as 'whisky-infused', he claimed Miss McNiece, who he has at least one child with, had been sleeping with scout leader Gareme Lornie, 48. Billy Fagan, 36 (left), used the website of the Stonywood Scouts, based near Aberdeen, to post a  message claiming partner Catherine Mcneice, 35 (right), was having an affair with leader Gareme Lornie, 48 . In the message Mr Fagan claims Miss Mcneice had been exchanging flirtatious texts with married Mr Lornie (pictured) since last summer . The letter was entitled 'Leaders in Love' and had a sub heading, which read 'two of our leaders scouting each other out (wink, wink).' He wrote: 'Yes, our Beavers leader Catherine and our Scout leader Graeme have recently found a liking for each other’s attentions. And who can blame them! 'Following their regular nights together at scouts and all their camping adventures they've decided to take their love into the digital age with a series of texts showing their involvement. 'Over the past eight months  they've shared numerous flirtatious texts.' Mr Fagan went on to claim that the text messages began last summer, adding that Mr Lornie's wife had also been unaware they were writing to one another. He then offered to make the conversations available 'upon request', before adding: 'Billy, Catherine's partner and writer of this whisky-infused post, wishes them all the best for a long and happy life together. In the message, entitled 'Leaders in Love' with the second headling 'Two of our leaders scouting each other out (wink wink), Mr Fagan describes himself as 'whisky-infused' Mr Fagan was unavailable to comment on the message, but has since posted on Facebook telling his friends: 'All is fine here thanks guys. My good pal Glen (Livet) is sorting the day out fabulously' 'Obviously this affair should not be allowed to affect the running of the Stoneywood Scouts and indeed, it's being kept well under wraps.' In the final part of the message he wrote that Scouts had been given a 'seedy' reputation in the press recently, likely referring to recent allegations of sexual abuse within the movement. But, he wrote, the alleged affair should not be treated 'as a reflection of scouting as a whole'. He stated: 'I have never known anyone involved in scouts, as a scout themselves or as a leader, who has not gotten a whole lot of value out of being part of the movement. 'Everyone speaks highly of the organisation, the commitment of the volunteers and the integrity of the leaders to ensure it's a safe and appropriate part of your children's upbringings.' When contacted about the claims yesterday, Miss Mcneice and Mr Lornie both refused to comment. Mr Lornie (left) has been married to wife Kay for 27 years, who said the message 'did not come as a surprise'. Miss Mcneice is not married to Mr Fagan, but the pair have at least one child together, a daughter, eight . At Mr Lornie's home his wife of 27 years Kay, 55, answered the door. She said Billy’s post 'did not come as a surprise', but declined to say more according to the Daily Record. Mr Fagan, who has an eight-year-old daughter with Miss McNeice, also refused to say more, but posted on Facebook, telling friends: 'All is fine here thanks guys. My good pal Glen (Livet) is sorting the day out fabulously.' A Scouts spokeswoman said: 'Scouts Scotland was made aware of a posting on a local Scout Group's website that caused offence and immediate steps were taken to ensure that the inappropriate posting was removed. 'The circumstances are being investigated in order to determine what further actions may be required.'","Billy Fagan, 36, accused partner of having affair with Scout leader online .

"Wolf Hall, the £7m  BBC blockbuster starring Damian Lewis and Mark Rylance, has already become the TV event of the year, exposing the skullduggery and political intrigue at the heart of the Tudor Court. And now a historic west London bakery has given a fascinating new insight into the story behind the love affair that triggered the Reformation - revealing it was a simple custard tart that captivated the king's attention rather than Anne Boleyn's own charms. Newens Tea House in Kew, west London, started baking Anne's  delicate pastry Maids of Honour tarts in 1850 and still uses the 500-year-old recipe discovered in the 16th-century by Henry VIII. The Maids of Honour tarts are baked using a 500-year-old recipe discovered in the 16th century by Henry VIII . Wolf Hall stars Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Claire Foy as his ill-fated second wife Anne Boleyn . It's said the King, then still married to Spanish wife Catherine of Aragon, was introduced to the delicacy by Anne Boleyn. Anne, who was then the queen's lady-in-waiting, was sharing a plate of the tarts  in the grounds of Hampton Court Palace with her maids of honour. The King was so taken by the simple pastry tart, which is made using rennet, he ordered the recipe - and Anne's Maid of Honour who baked them - to be locked up at Hampton Court. They were released only to produce the Maids of Honour tarts for the king and his court. The tea house is now bracing itself for a spike in visitors following the success of Wolf Hall. Dean Martin, who bought the business from the Newens family five years ago, said: 'We're already doubling our production of Maids of Honour because we're expecting a big rise in visitors after the success of Wolf Hall. 'Ours are the original Maids of Honour tarts, baked using the exact recipe that drew Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn 500 years ago and we're honoured to be a part of an iconic relationship that changed the course of English history.' Newens Tea House in Kew, west London has been serving the historic Tudor tarts since 1850 . TV chef Jamie Oliver visited the Kew bakery last year as part of his Channel 4 Friday Night Feasts series, to see if modern methods could improve the 500-year-old recipe - the verdict was that he couldn't .

Newens Tea House has just opened a franchise in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . The bakery has just opened its first franchise 6,000 miles away Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to target the booming market for classically English products in south east Asia. It was the first time in 500 years the Maids of Honour tarts had been baked outside the UK in history. The adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Booker-prize winning novel Wolf Hall charts the rise of Thomas Cromwell from blacksmith’s son and former mercenary to one of the King’s most senior and trusted advisors. The Maids of Honour tart recipe remained a Court secret for 200 years until it was leaked by a palace cook to a John Billet, a baker in nearby Richmond, west London, in the mid-18th century, who began producing the delicacies for wealthy customers. By 1850, John Newens, a former apprentice Billet's bakery, had opened his own baking business, bringing with him the secret recipe he had been taught. The original Maids of Honour recipe was passed down through the generations and the Maids of Honour continue to be baked by Newens at their Kew tea shop to this day.

"A new phone app calculates how many cows a South African bride-to-be is worth. The 'Lobola Calculator ' - Lobola means bride price, or dowry - calculates a woman's marital value and then determines what she is worth based on the dowry averages in different South African provinces, which vary. In Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, the average Lobola is 12 cows, or £893. A new phone app calculates how many cows a South African bride-to-be is worth based on her personal and physical attributes and the average dowry paid in provinces across the continent . The app was created as a way for giving men a 'ballpark figure' on what they will need to pay their bride-to-be's family, but was also said to be 'great for a laugh with friends' The app requests the users age, height, weight and waist size and asks them to rate their attractiveness on a scale of 'not at all' to 'really hot'. But the calculations aren't simply based on physical attributes, the app also bases its calculations on a woman's educational qualifications, their job and whether they have been married before or have children. Developer Robert Matsaneng describes the app as 'great for getting a ballpark figure if you're planning on proposing soon, great for breaking the ice on a date lol, great for a laugh with friends.' A disclaimer on a website for the app says the Lobola Calculator is 'just for entertainment and is not intended to replace the true culture and protocols of lobola'.

"A group of fired McDonald's workers claim supervisors repeatedly complained that 'there were too many black people in the store'. They are suing the fast-food giant in the United States for alleged racial discrimination and sexual harassment after they were fired from several restaurants in Virginia. According to the civil rights complaint filed on Thursday, workers at franchised restaurants in the southern state of Virginia were allegedly 'subjected to rampant racial and sexual harassment, committed by the restaurants' highest-ranking supervisors.' A group of former McDonald's workers is suing the fast-food giant in the United States for alleged racial discrimination and sexual harassment after they were fired from restaurants in Virginia . The lawsuit has potentially broad implications because it contends that McDonald's is responsible for the well-being of workers at all its restaurants, even if they are franchises. The plaintiffs - of which, nine are black and one is Hispanic - allege they were fired because the restaurant, operated by a company called Soweva, wanted to 'reduce the number of African-American employees and hire more white employees'. The lawsuit continues: 'Soweva's supervisors were blunt, telling employees that it was ""too dark"" in the restaurants, and that they were going to hire different workers because they ""need to get the ghetto out of the store"".'

They were eventually found sleeping in one of the trucks in the parking lot of a Florida IHOP late on Saturday night and taken into custody. Speaking from jail this week, Hayes explained that the night before they vanished, they had been at a party with the girl's mother, who does not have custody of her. Afterwards, they stayed at Hayes' home and the next morning they awoke to calls saying the police were looking for the girl because she should not have been with her mother, he said. Defiant: In jailhouse interviews (right) Hayes has claimed that he thought his girlfriend was 18, not 13 . Girlfriend: He had been dating the girl for about three months before they went on the run together on January 4. Her identity is being concealed because Hayes has been charged with a sex offense and she is a minor . 'She said ""I'm not going home, I hate it at home"",' he recalled, NBC reported. 'She said, ""I'm going to run."" I was like, ""I can't let you go by yourself so I'm gonna go with you"". So I went with her.' He added that the girl's father did not have to call police because he knew she was with him. Her father has denied any suggestion that she was abused at the home. The girl's mother also appeared in Grayson County District Court on Thursday on a charge of custodial interference for picking up the girl on January 3. She is being held on $50,000 bail. In previous jailhouse interviews, Hayes has claimed he did not know the girl - whom he had been dating for three months - was just 18 until she was reported missing. 'I asked her how old she was and she said she was 18 for the longest time,' he told WMBB-TV. 'I kept asking her old she was. She kept telling me 18 almost 19. She told me she had a truck, had a license, all that good stuff.' 'Crime spree': The duo led police on a chase across six states until they were caught last weekend. Here, they are pictured in a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina, where they allegedly cashed stolen checks . Stopped: They were eventually found sleeping in a stolen truck in an IHOP parking lot in Florida on Sunday . At one point in their relationship, she even told him she had been pregnant, he said. 'We were fighting and arguing again and she said, ""by the way I had a miscarriage, I just didn't know how to tell you"",' he said. 'And I said, ""all you had to do was just tell me something"".' The duo fled from their small Kentucky town the day before Dalton's charges in a separate burglary case was scheduled to go before a grand jury. He was facing five to ten years in jail after being charged with second-degree burglary - and he said he wanted to show his girlfriend the sea before being locked up, friends told DailyMail.com.

"As rock ’n’ roll neighbours they are already embroiled in an inharmonious war of words but now Robbie Williams has upped the ante in his feud with Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page. The former Take That star has submitted further planning proposals for his new home, which include building a huge basement complete with swimming pool. His first submission to modernise the £17.5million property is the subject of a strongly-worded complaint by Page. As the Mail reported last week, the veteran guitarist, 71, claims the works could damage the surrounding mansions in Holland Park, West London. Scroll down for video . Robbie Williams's latest plans include a huge basement complete with a swimming pool, right . Undoubtedly he will be raging at the new plans, which will entail many weeks – if not months – of heavy drilling and excavation work if approved by council officials. In his submission, Williams says he is trying to turn the 46-room house into a modern family home. The singer lives in the building with his wife Ayda Field, 35, and their two children, daughter Theodora Rose, two, and three-month-old son Charlton Valentine. The Grade II-listed Victorian property last belonged to film director Michael Winner, who died in 2013. Nearby is Tower House, Page’s Grade I property, which was saved from demolition in the 1960s following a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh. Williams, 40, submitted his initial plans last month, which include a car park in the garden, a new recording studio and lift, partly filling in a swimming pool and adding a window. He said the building works would last for nine months. Williams wants to make a number of alterations to his £17.5million mansion (left) in Holland Park, west London - but Jimmy Page who lives in a turreted home nearby (right) objects to the changes . Page (right) - the guitarist for Led Zeppelin - fears the building work may impact on his own property . But father of five Page, who has lived in Tower House for four decades and considers it one of the most important buildings in the borough, has sent an official complaint to Kensington and Chelsea Council. In a stern letter, he stated the window would overlook the side of his home and thus have ‘significant impact on the amenity of the house and its garden’. He was also ‘extremely concerned’ the works would create an eyesore in the area and that the vibrations caused by them could damage surrounding properties, including his own. The famous pair have lived next door to each other for more than a year but have fallen out over the plans . Williams bought the house - which is the former home of Michael Winner - with his wife Ayda Field in 2013 . Page - pictured (left) recently with his girlfriend Scarlett Sabet, 25, and (right) in Led Zeppelin's 1970s heyday - says Williams' home is Grade II listed and its exterior should be treated as 'sacrosanct' And he insisted that the Grade II status of Williams’s home should mean its exterior is ‘sacrosanct’ and protected from change. But Williams has refused to be cowed and this week submitted more plans. These would see a ‘like for like’ rebuilding of a first-floor balcony and a 3,600sq ft basement tunnelled out under his back garden. The enormous extension would be more than four times the average size of a new-build home in England and Wales. Page, who is dating aspiring actress Scarlett Sabet, 25, has not yet commented on the latest plans. But in his original letter he wrote: ‘I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the wellbeing of this important heritage asset.’ The council is expected to make its decision on the initial plans next month. Williams and Page declined to comment. The house's main bedroom, pictured during the time the late Michael Winner lived at the property .

"A leading climate change scientist had been banned from driving for two years after she got drunk and drove at an oncoming police car while on her way to a New Year's Eve wedding. Lecturer Dr Cath Waller, an ecologist  who has spend eight weeks in a tent in the Antarctic wilderness, got behind the wheel while three-times over the drink-drive limit, the court heard. Police, who were forced to swerve when she drove them 'at speed', pulled her over and said she was too drunk to stand and had to 'cling' to the passenger door of her Vauxhall Astra. She then told officers: 'I have been stupid. I have had a drink and I should not have done it', the court heard. Banned: Lecturer Dr Cath Waller, an ecologist who who has spend eight weeks in a tent in the Antarctic wilderness, cannot drive for two years after she got behind the wheel while three-times over the limit . Dr Waller of Scarborough, admitted drink-driving at Scarborough Magistrates' Court, but in mitigation said she had been struggling with depression after the break-up of her marriage. She was banned from the roads for 24 months with her licence revoked and placed on curfew for 16 weeks. But her plea to take a group of students on a research field trip to Scotland in March was ignored by magistrates. The court heard she was more than three times the drink drive limit when she set off to attend a friend's wedding in a Yorkshire village on New Year's Eve. Evidence: Police pulled her over and said she was too drunk to stand and had to 'cling' to the passenger door of her Vauxhall Astra . She was spotted driving her Vauxhall Astra 'at speed' in the middle of the road by the officers coming the other way. The 49-year-old global warming expert made no attempt to get back onto her side of the road, Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard. Prosecutor Catherine Turnbull said: 'The officers were driving and noticed the Vauxhall Astra ahead. It was driving at speed in the middle of the road. 'The police officer driver had to take action and drove close to the kerb to avoid the vehicle hitting them. They followed the Astra along the road. It speeded up and slowed down and was weaving across the road.' The patrol car crew then pulled over Waller who 'looked tired and was speaking slowly' and they told her to get out. Ms Turnbull continued: 'She was unable to stand alone and was clinging to the passenger door to support herself.' She then told the officers: 'I have been stupid. I have had a drink and I should not have done it. I was going to friend's wedding but turned around when I realised I could not do so.' Waller, a lecturer at the Scarborough campus of Hull University, had been stopped only a short distance from her home at 9.20pm on New Year's Eve. A breath test revealed 109 microgrammes of alcohol - 'just over three times' the legal limit of 35, . Caroline Wyatt, defending, said: 'She was held over night and released the following morning - quite a daunting experience. 'She is thoroughly ashamed to find herself before the court and has now lost her good name.' Ms Wyatt said Waller had planned to spend New Year's Eve alone and had been drinking from the afternoon into the evening. Incident: The academic was spotted driving her Vauxhall Astra 'at speed' in the middle of the road by police officers coming the other way . A colleague was getting married on New Year's Eve and wanted Waller to come. At first, she said 'no' because she had been drinking - but then changed her mind for reasons she 'could not explain'. Ms Wyatt said that Waller had already realised 'it was a foolish thing to do' and has already turned around before she was stopped on Deepdale Avenue, Scarborough. 'She is a lecturer at the university. They are fully aware of what has happened and are fully supportive of her,' Ms Wyatt continued. Pleas: The court heard the university wanted Waller to take a students on a field trip to Scotland in March - but magistrates rejected their request . 'She is managing to hold onto her employment and there is no suggestion of any wrong-doing at work in respect of alcohol. 'There is no suggestion she will lose her employment. I have to accept there are aggravating features, especially the level of the reading.' Waller made a name for herself as a woman scientist who did not flinch at spending eight weeks living on the Polar wilderness in a tent. But Ms Wyatt said Waller had suffered depression following her marriage break up. She was trying to patch things up with her estranged husband and spending a lot of time at his address in her home town of Keighley, West Yorkshire. The court heard the university wanted Waller to take a students on a field trip to Scotland in March. But presiding magistrates Pam MacFie said: 'We are not making any dispensation for the time set aside for your trip.' Waller did her PhD with the British Antarctic Survey. Her doctoral research investigated the ecology of the Antarctic intertidal zone, the animals that live there and the adaptations they have developed in order to survive in the face of climate change. She has made several further trips to Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands where she spends upto eight weeks at a time in a tent. She spent three years as a lecturer in Ecology at Brighton University before moving to Scarborough in March 2010 to take up a post as a lecturer in Marine Biology.","Ecologist Dr Cath Waller was three-times over the drink-drive limit .

"A mother has released harrowing pictures of her 18-year-old son in a coma after he was violently kicked in the head by a thug during a brawl. Marco Baccellini, 18, from Leicester nearly died after he was violently kicked in the head by Ryan Gallagher, 17, as he lay defenceless on the ground. A court has heard thug Gallagher was egged on by friends who filmed the 'horrific' attack on a mobile phone and could be heard repeatedly saying: 'Bang him, Ryan.' Marco Baccellini almost died after he was violently kicked in the head by Ryan Gallagher as he lay defenceless on the ground. His mother has chosen to release these harrowing pictures of Marco in a coma . Gallagher was yesterday sentenced to four year's detention at Leicester Crown Court. Speaking outside court following the sentencing, Mr Baccellini's mother Joanne Greenwood said 'there are no winners here.' The court heard after the attack Mr Baccellini underwent two life-saving operations for bleeding on his brain and was put into a coma for days. He was in intensive care and then a high dependency unit for several weeks at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. Ms Greenwood, 36, from Leicester, said: 'There are no winners here, and lessons have to be learnt by young men not to let petty arguments fester into extreme violence.' She added: 'Although my son almost died, he is now on a long road to recovery. 'I also feel for the defendants' parents, as they're suffering too.' Ryan Gallagher (pictured left) was sentenced to four year's detention at Leicester Crown Court yesterday for the brutal attack which left Mr Baccellini in a coma. Ben Hayes (right) admitted aiding and abetting Gallagher . Gallagher, from Leicester, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on the evening of September 18 last year. Ben Hayes, 17, from Leicester, admitted aiding and abetting Gallagher. He was sentenced to eight months' detention and training order without parole. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court there was a long-running dispute between slightly-built Mr Baccellini and Gallagher, who was physically  bigger and stronger. Two weeks before the brawl they had a fight, where Mr Baccellini came off worse. A re-match was then arranged at a local basketball court. Mr Baccellini was urged to take part by a friend he was staying with - and who the prosecution said had a 'moral responsibility' for what happened. Mr Baccellini, who had been drinking and taken MCat, ignored his girlfriend's pleas not to go. Mr Murphy said: 'There were about 10 people aged 16 to 20 years and two smaller children, aged seven or eight, at the scene.' The court heard Mr Baccellini rushed at Gallagher, who grabbed him in a head-lock, punched him and threw him to the ground, causing 'an audible crack'. At the same time Hayes shouted words of encouragement to Gallagher and insulted Mr Baccellini, who lay inert on the ground visibly bleeding from a head wound. Mr Baccellini was encouraged to get up and while he was still dazed his friend urged him to continue. Gallagher then punched Mr Baccellini and as he lay bleeding, kicked him in the head. No-one at the scene called an ambulance until staff from a local Co-op shop intervened and rang 999. After the attack Mr Baccellini underwent two life-saving operations for bleeding on his brain and was put into a coma for days. He was placed in intensive care and then a high dependency unit for several weeks . 'Horrific' footage of the incident was later sent by Hayes to three friends and was later seen by Mr Baccellini's mother. Some of the defendants' relatives chose not to see the footage when it was played in court. The court heard that neither defendant had previous convictions and their families, although 'shocked' by their actions, were in court to support their sons. Carl Gaskell, mitigating for Gallagher, said: 'It was at first a consensual fight but I don't dispute it developed into something more serious. 'He's remorseful and ashamed.' Andrew Fryman, for Hayes, said: 'He now realises it was wrong and has shown remorse for the victim. 'If he could turn the clock back he would have left his mobile phone in his pocket and encouraged Gallagher to walk away.' Judge Robert Brown told Gallagher and Hayes in sentencing: 'Gallagher, you were much bigger than the victim and you knew he was no match for you. 'You bullied him and even when he was defenceless your attack continued. 'It's been described as brutal and I agree. 'I've viewed the footage of the attack. 'Both of you hung your heads in shame (in the dock) at what you'd done. 'Gallagher, you threw him to the ground and punched him. 'He managed to get to his feet when he was semi-conscious. 'After a short time you continued the attack and punched him. Leicester Crown Court (pictured) where Judge Robert Brown sentenced Gallagher and Hayes yesterday . 'When he was on the floor you kicked him to the head, when he was unconscious or semi-conscious - either way he was unable to defend himself. 'There were two separate areas of bleeding to his brain and his injuries were life threatening, along with a punctured lung. 'It's difficult for the doctors to know whether he will make a complete recovery, not least due to further complications of further injury to his head two months later, which has nothing to do with you, although the injuries you caused made him more susceptible.' The judge lifted a court order banning the juvenile defendants from being named 'in the public interest.' Mr Baccellini, now 19, suffered seizures during his recovery and his prognosis remains uncertain. Leicester Crown Court heard two months after the attack by Gallagher, Mr Baccellini suffered another head injury - either by a fall or another assault unconnected with the defendants. Mr Baccellini, who has no memory of the second incident, is currently in hospital recovering. His grandmother, Elaine Greenwood, 52,told the Leicester Mercury that his progress was 'slow' and the incident has had a 'devastating effect'. She said: 'Marco’s progress is slow, he couldn’t even send a text message the other day as his arm was so weak.'","Marco Baccellini almost died after being kicked in head by Ryan Gallagher .

"The Queen is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of  King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the age of 90. Her Majesty, who is 88, was born on April 21, 1926 and has reigned through more than five decades, celebrating her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. She took the throne at the age of 25. But despite being the oldest monarch in the world - she is only the second longest-reigning. King Rama IX of Thailand has served for 68 years whereas the Queen's reign is just under 63 years. Scroll down for video . The Queen is now the oldest monarch in the world after the death of King of Saudi Arabia Abdullah at the age of 90 (pictured together in 2007) King Abdullah died in hospital last night aged 90 and was immediately replaced by his brother Prince Salman, 79.

King Abdullah was one of the 37 sons of King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, who created the modern state of Saudi Arabia in 1932. His brother Prince Salman, 79, is already king but there were concerns last night that, despite the swift succession, the news would send shockwaves across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is already facing uncertainty over the recent dip in global oil prices and the rise of terror group Islamic State in neighbouring Iraq. The price of crude oil rose by two per cent on the world markets after the king’s death was announced. The Prime Minister has paid tribute to his work for peace in the region. Friends:  Prince Charles and King Abdullah were personal friends. The Prince of Wales  is expected to attend his funeral today .

"A San Francisco man is one race away from completing seven marathons in seven days on seven continents. Tim Durbin is the only American competing in the World Marathon Challenge that started last Saturday Jan. 17 and ends in Sydney on Friday. So far, the 31-year-old has run six marathons, each 26.2 miles, through snow, rain and jetlag in Antarctica, Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco and Dubai. 'In the last 48 hours I've slept less than 9 hours and ran three marathons,' he said in an email earlier this week. Seven: Tim Durbin, 31, (photographed) is one race away from completing seven marathons in seven days on seven continents as part of the World Marathon Challenge . Ten Year Challenge: Durbin's effort to complete this challenge is part of a bigger plan: The 10 Year Challenge, this is Durbin's effort to travel 24,901 miles -- the distance around the world . He said most of his sleep has been on the airplanes between cities with a few hours spent in hotels following the races. He did have one full night of rest after running in Chile and before heading to Miami. Durbin added that the biggest challenge has been the quick turn-around times. 'Twice we have done two marathons in 24 hours. Sleep deprivation will likely be a factor going forward,' he said. So far, the Morocco marathon was the toughest. He started running in Marrakech less than 7 hours after he completed the race in Spain. Durbin is averaging about 5½ hours for each 26.2-mile marathons. Complete: To complete the seven-day challenge, the participants must run the 26.2 mile distances at Union Glacier, Antarctica; Punta Arenas, Chile; Miami, Florida; Madrid, Spain; Marrakech, Morocco; Dubai; United Arab Emirates; and Sydney, Australia . One More To Go: So far, the 31-year-old has run six marathons, each 26.2 miles, through snow, rain and jetlag in Antarctica, Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco and Dubai . The race in Morocco took nearly six hours. Durbin spent roughly $37,000 to participate with 11 others, who are from Brazil, India, Great Britain, Hong Kong, France, Finland and Australia. The World Marathon Challenge is part of a bigger challenge that Durbin started two years ago. In 2013, he started logging his miles for walking, running, cross country skiing and swimming in order to complete the distance around the equator — 24,901 miles before 2022. 'I am just trying to prove to myself that an average person can do what most others think is impossible,' he said. 'It's a mental challenge as much as it is physical.' The challenge, beginning in Antarctica, allots the participants only about 170 hours to complete the grueling world marathon, according to the World Marathon Challenge website. Enjoying A Drink: Here, Durbin enjoys a drink after completing one of the seven marathons . Journey: Durbin has completed a little more than 30 percent of his 24,901-mile journey, traveling 7,492 miles . To complete the seven-day challenge, the participants must run the  26.2 mile distances at Union Glacier, Antarctica;  Punta Arenas, Chile; Miami, Florida; Madrid, Spain;  Marrakech, Morocco; Dubai; United Arab Emirates; and Sydney, Australia. Durbin's effort to complete this challenge is part of a bigger plan. In February 2012, Durbin began, what he calls, 'The 10 Year Challenge,' according to Durbin's blog 24901 Experiences. Durbin describes the challenge as his goal to walk, run, ski, or swim 24,901 miles from 2013 to 2022. Durbin wrote: '24,901 miles is the distance around the equator. I chose this distance because I wanted to run/walk the distance around the world.' So far, Durbin has completed a little more than 30 percent of his journey, traveling 7,492 miles, according to his blog.

"American Sniper has shattered box office records and expectations - raking in more than $110 million in four weeks - but that success is going to affect the murder trial of Chris Kyle's accused killer, according to attorneys in the case. Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh will face court on February 11, two years after he allegedly shot Kyle dead at a Texas firing range  as he battled Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Routh is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. While the shooting of Kyle does not feature in American Sniper, with the war drama coming to a close with footage of his funeral, Routh's attorneys the scope of the film - from the amount of people seeing it in cinemas, to the press it is receiving and Oscar nominations - will affect the outcome of the jury. Scroll down for video . Charged with murder: Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh will face court on February 11, charged with shooting dead 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle at a Texas firing range two years ago . Shot dead: Kyle was reportedly helping Routh deal with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . 'The film will be an issue,' Routh's attorney, J. Warren St. John, told People magazine. 'I think any case with significant publicity has an issue with picking a jury. I've had them in the past, and anything that has significant national attention makes it hard to pick a jury.' Jurors are picked on their impartiality, and the hope they know nothing about the case they about to hear and deliver a verdict. In 2013, a judge issued the gag order preventing attorneys and family members and others from talking to the media, predicting widespread media coverage. Routh's attorneys also lost a bid to have the trial moved out of Texas, where people are particularly passionate about Kyle's story, being his home state. The people's favorite: American Sniper recently won an overwhelming majority  to win the Best Picture Oscar . 'Mr. Kyle is a hero in many people's eyes,' George Parnham, a Houston criminal defense attorney not associated with the case, told People. 'Due to the fact that this movie has gained intense public attention, it's doubtful that a fair jury can be selected anywhere.' On February 2, 2013,  Routh, 26, shot dead Kyle, 38, and Kyle's friend, father-of-one, Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range near Chalk Mountain, Texas. Kyle had been trying to help Routh deal with his PTSD and had taken him to target practice. American Sniper is based on Kyle's autobiography of the same name. The controversy and acclaim the picture has received cannot be measured or denied. The Clint Eastwood-directed blasted into first place with a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office, which was a record for a January opening. Controversy: Clint Eastwood's biopic of the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (left) has sparked furious debate . 'The movie has become a cultural phenomenon,' Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., said of the film's  success . 'It tore apart the record book and not by a little. By an enormous amount.' It has been nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper. But the film -- on its first weekend in wide release -- also triggered a heated online debate about patriotism, with documentary filmmaker Michael Moore claiming it hero-worships Kyle, while Sarah Palin said leftists were ""not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots."" 'God bless our troops, especially our snipers,' the former Alaska governor and one-time vice-presidential nominee, a darling of the rightwing Tea Party movement, wrote on her Facebook page.","Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh will face court on February 11 .

"Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . Hollywood actors continue to fire Twitter salvos at each other over actor Seth Rogen’s controversial tweet about movie American Sniper, based on Navy SEAL Chris Kyle’s experiences in Iraq. He wrote that the movie reminded him of a Nazi propaganda film about a sniper that appeared in Quentin Tarantino’s acclaimed Inglorious Basterds. Such is the furore surrounding the tweet that he felt obliged to further clarify his comments with another tweet underlining that he has nothing against war veterans and was not comparing the movie to Nazi propaganda. Now Alec Baldwin has leapt to the defence of the Neighbors actor, after Dean Cain weighed in with a tweet claiming that he had no right to make the comment in the original tweet because he’d never fought in a war. Cain, known for his role as Superman, wrote: ‘Seth... I like your films, but right now, I wanna kick your ass. Chris is an American Hero. Period. Go to war. Then we'll talk.’ However, Baldwin retorted: ‘Did @RealDeanCain threaten Seth Rogen? And isn't that the same kind of troubled thinking that got Chris Kyle killed?’ The Clint Eastwood film is a profile of Kyle, who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. While critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the U.S. military. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War. Rogen has now also sought to calm the Twitter storm down with another explanation of his tweet sent on January 19 that referenced the Nazi sniper. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. Scroll down for video . Alec Baldwin (left) defended Seth Rogen after Dean Cain (right) accused the Neighbors actor of having no right to tweet his remarks about American Sniper because he'd never been to war . This is what I really meant: Seth Rogen went online to clarify the difference between 'kinda reminded me' and a direct comparison. He used apples and oranges as an example . ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do (I've already publicly explained that I enjoyed American Sniper) and also implied that I somehow have something against Chris Kyle and veterans in general, neither of which are true in the least. ‘My grandfather was a veteran. My comment about the movie was not meant to have any political implications. Any political meaning was ascribed to my comment by news commentary. I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ This follows an earlier attempt at clarification. Rogen insisted on that occasion as well that he wasn't comparing American Sniper with the parody vignette in Inglorious Basterds, but was saying that one reminded him of the other. He tweeted: ‘Apples remind me of oranges. Can't compare them though.' Rogen, 32, then threw in a small dig at the media, accusing the press of blowing his opinions 'out of proportion'. The Interview star wrote that he is happy to keep the fires burning on the controversy. Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride. One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . True story: American Sniper is based on Chris Kyle's memoir, which was written before his tragic death in February 2013 at a shooting range . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's (left) movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper (right) American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills. The film, based on Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' American Sniper,  directed by Clint Eastwood, raked in $105.3million during its opening weekend in America.","Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper .

"A company in Florida has applied to trademark the words 'Je Suis Charlie' to use on clothes, footwear, bags, crockery and babygrows. Latin American Trading Group has tabled a bid to own the phrase, contending that 'no other person has the right to use the mark in commerce.' The slogan, first tweeted by French artist Joachim Roncin, became a rallying cry in support of free speech after 12 people were shot dead at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7 . Scroll down for video . Private property? A U.S. trading firm has applied to own the phrase 'Je Suis Charlie' to print on products . It is believed the magazine was targeted after printing a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad. Minutes after the news broke, Roncin tweeted a picture that he had fashioned - conflating the Charlie Hebdo logo with the phrase used in the French version of Where's Waldo. The white-and-gray image rapidly spread around the world, and within 24 hours it had been used in songs, on posters and on even a Simpsons cartoon. The first Charlie Hebdo edition after the massacre pictured a tearful Prophet Muhammad holding a sign that read 'Je Suis Charlie'. And once the magazine's website went back online, after a brief hiatus, the strapline read: 'Je Suis Charlie'. Latin American Trading Group, registered to a two-bedroom apartment in Aventura, near Miami, filed the $975 application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office just nine days after the massacre at the hands of brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. It outlines three classes of goods they plan to use the slogan for. Support: Helen Mirren (left) and the Clooneys (right) bore the phrase at the Golden Globes days after . The products would include clothing, footwear, bowls, dishes, salt and pepper shakers, lunch boxes, coasters, wallets and briefcases, according to The Smoking Gun. Though it is believed to be the first U.S. application, it comes after hundreds around the world. France’s Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle (INPI) has already turned down at least 124 trademarks applications from French firms - two of which planned to print the phrase on weapons. Other applications have come from an Australian fashion designer and a Belgian businessman wanting to put the words on beer bottles and Christmas baubles. 'Frankly, I'm really hurt by everything that has happened with people wanting to make money out of it. Especially because it profoundly devalues the meaning of the slogan,' Roncin told AFP. How it started: It was first designed and tweeted by French artist Joachim Roncin then went around the globe . Products: This 12"" action figure, available online for $139, is being sold to promote press freedom. All profits will go to Charlie Hebdo and the non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders . Since the attack, which sent shockwaves around the world, people have been seen sporting t-shirts, badges, and wristbands with the phrase. Melanie Griffiths stepped out on Friday wearing a 'Je Suis Charlie' t-shirt. Amal Clooney proudly pinned a 'Je Suis Charlie' badge to her clutch bag at the Golden Globes. And this week, an action figure was created to fund Reporters Without Borders and went on sale online for $139.

"A South Florida couple who operated a 'butt implant' practice out of their own home have been found guilty for practicing health care without a license. Samela Hernandez, 55, and Pedro Hernandez, 59, received a two year sentence of house arrest, with permission to work from the Miami-Dade Circuit Court. The married couple were arrested in December 2012 after a botched enhancement procedure on a exotic dancer that left her permanently disfigured. Illegal: Samela Hernandez and Pedro Hernandez have been found guilty of practicing health care without a license out of their South Florida home . Not a hospital: The Hernandez's performed hundreds of illegal and dangerous butt implants out of their Hialeah home . Authorities in Florida said the pair would inject dangerous silicone cement into the backsides of their mostly female customers - who usually went overseas for the controversial and dangerous cosmetic treatment. However, the couple's lawyer, Robert Perez, told the Miami Herald that despite a lack of medical qualifications, the Hernandez's were skilled practicioners of butt implants. 'Of the hundreds of patients, only one person came forward to complain,' said their lawyer, Robert Perez. 'Everyone else was satisfied with their posteriors.' Samela Hernandez had previously worked in Colombia, where butt implants are common and authorities in Florida said she would use a cocktail of sealant and silicone for the buttock boost. Hearing: Oneal Ron Morris (pictured, center, in court on Friday) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat, at Florida homes . Transgender: In addition to multiple counts of practicing medicine without a license with serious bodily injury, Morris (pictured) is also facing a manslaughter charge after one of her 'patients' died following surgery . She denied this and said the silicon-based solution she used was legal in Colombia but banned in America. When the couple were arrested, detectives in Hialeah found syringes, Lidocaine, plus swaps and other medical equipment. There were two other women inside the house at the time who told police they were at the Hernandez's for treatment. The exotic dancer who made the complaint to police said that when she developed infections and open sores, the couple injected, 'more solution into the void area of her buttocks to 'fill in' the gaps between the welts'. In recent years, Florida has become a center for illegal silicone based buttock enhancements.

"300 vials of a new Ebola vaccine will arrive in Liberia today, to form part of the largest trial into the efficacy of the experimental drug . The first batch of an experimental Ebola vaccine has been shipped to West Africa, destined to help protect 30,000 people in Liberia. The shipment, of an initial 300 vials of the vaccine, marks the first to arrive in one of the three countries worst affected by the Ebola epidemic. The drug will form the basis of the first large-scale vaccine trial, with healthcare workers on the front line treating Ebola patients, among the first to receive the drug. It comes as the World Health Organisation said this week, the epidemic is showing signs of waning. But after ravaging three West African nations and spreading fear from Dallas to Madrid, it has hammered home the message that the world needs a better detective system for emerging diseases. Researchers hope to enrol up to 30,000 people to take part in the trial, a third of whom will get the vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline. The drug is currently being tested in five small phase one safety trials in Britain, the US, Switzerland and Mali and involving around 200 volunteers. Moncef Slaoui, GSKs global vaccines chief, said: 'The initial phase I data are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing, which will involve the vaccination of thousands of volunteers, including front line healthcare workers.' The drug uses a type of chimpanzee cold virus to deliver safe genetic material from the Zaire strain of Ebola, the strain responsible for the unprecedented epidemic in West Africa. Data so far show 'an acceptable safety profile' including in a West African population and across a range of dose levels, GSK said, adding it had now selected the most appropriate dosage for the Liberia trial. The World Health Organisation  yesterday said  the Ebola outbreak in West Africa appears to be waning but cautioned against complacency in an epidemic that has seen 21,724 cases reported in nine countries since it started in Guinea a year ago. Some 8,641 people have died, according to WHO data. Mr Slaoui stressed that GSK's shot, like other candidates from a NewLink Genetics and Merck collaboration, and from Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic, is still in development and can't be deployed unless and until it proves safe and effective. 'Any potential future use in mass vaccination campaigns will depend on whether the WHO, regulators and other stakeholders are satisfied ... and how quickly large quantities ... can be made,' he said. Professor Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, hailed the move as an 'important step' in the fight against Ebola. He said: 'In order to show that a vaccine works you have to perform phase III trials in those people most at risk from the infection. 'Make no mistake, this isn't an easy task; there are huge logistical hurdles to overcome. Scroll down for video . It comes as the World Health Organisation said the epidemic, which has ravaged Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, is showing signs of waning . 'Ebola virus infection has decimated what was an already under-resourced Liberian healthcare infrastructure, making delivery a tricky thing to achieve. 'These vaccines also need cold storage, which isn't always easy to guarantee. Also, recruitment to the trials will require a huge effort in social engagement and education.' Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, who is helping fund the new vaccine, added: 'This week we've heard encouraging news from West Africa, indicating that we may at last have reached a turning point in what has been the worst Ebola outbreak in history. 'The unprecedented speed at which the vaccine preparation has progressed would not have been possible without sheer determination and global partnership between national governments, funders, researchers and pharma companies, and agencies on the ground who have worked tirelessly to get this crisis under control.' Experts and politicians gathering at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos have focused on the epidemic, noting the risk posed by pandemic threats such as deadly strains of flu and drug-resistant superbugs. WHO director general Margaret Chan, said: 'Viruses do not need visas to get across borders.' She admitted the international response to future epidemics must be better co-ordinated. Her own organisation has been criticised for failing to move faster to tackle Ebola and has acknowledged that it lacked the staff and tools to fight the epidemic adequately early on. 'The whole world needs a new early-warning system for these diseases,' said Alpha Conde, the president of Guinea - where Ebola went undetected for three months in early 2014.","300 doses of the GlaxoSmithKline drug are set to arrive in Liberia today .

"Father-of-one Stefan Noyce, 29, passed out in the middle of the road after a night out and was run over, an inquest heard . A council worker downed so many shots of Sambuca and Jagermeister he passed out in the middle of the road and was run over, an inquest heard. Father-of-one Stefan Noyce, 29, was four-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit and in a state of 'extreme drunkenness' when he walked into a carriageway and lay down after a night out. Moments later motorist Chelcie Hunt, 18, struck the drunk pub-goer in her Mazda 121 on an unlit stretch of road in Wareham, Dorset, causing him fatal head injuries. She said she did not see the victim as he was wearing dark clothes and thought her car had hit an animal in the road on the night of June 15 last year . 'I was driving along and then when I got to the dark bit, where there are no lights in the road, I felt like I had gone over something,' she told a hearing at Bournemouth Coroner's Court. 'I just thought I had hit an animal or something.' The keen fisherman who had taken part in a TV series, Ocean Heroes, was described him as being in 'high spirits' by witnesses who saw him drinking shots at the Antelope Inn and Black Bear pub in Wareham. He was found lying on a pavement in Wareham at around 12.15am in an 'intoxicated and unconscious state', but he refused offers for a taxi. Witnesses watched him walk towards the nearby village of Stoborough, where he was staying the night with his grandmother, and lost sight of him as he entered the unlit portion of the road. The fatal collision happened 10 minutes later on the B3075 linking Stoborough to Wareham and Miss was found to have been within the 30mph speed limit. Police investigations showed Mr Noyce, who had a 10-year-old son, Blake, would only have been illuminated by the car headlights for one second before the collision. The keen fisherman who had taken part in a TV series, Ocean Heroes, was described him as being in 'high spirits' by witnesses who saw him drinking in the pub before the incident, pictured on a boat in Norway . He was described as a 'perfect gentleman' by his mother and leaves behind a 10-year-old son . Forensic pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said Mr Noyce's fatal head injuries suggested he was lying on the ground when he was hit and the 328mg of alcohol in his blood would have left him in a state of 'extreme drunkenness'. Richard Middleton, the assistant coroner for Dorset, said Mr Noyce's dark clothes and the unlit road may have been additional factors in his death. He said he was satisfied Miss Hunt had been driving carefully and was not speeding and ruled that Mr Noyce died 'as a result of a very tragic collision'. Mr Noyce's mother Paula Haden, who lives at Bovington, said: 'To me he was perfect. I am so proud of Stefan. I want the world to know what a lovely boy he was. 'He was just such a real gentleman. I was amazed at how many hearts he touched.' Before the accident he had worked for Dorset Waste Partnership and spent hours gardening for neighbours. He was hailed a hero as a teenager when he helped save the life of an elderly woman drowning in the River Frome. He had fished in Norway and worked for Dorset Waste Partnership before the incident in June lat year, pictured during filming for Ocean Heroes .

"An Orthodox Jewish mother, who has battled for years to obtain a religious divorce from her husband, wept on the stand in court on Thursday as she accused him of rape and abuse. Rivky Stein, 25, took the stand at Brooklyn Supreme Court, New York, as she claimed she has been unable to move forward with her life because her estranged husband, Yoel Weiss, 33, refused to give her a 'get' - a divorce under Orthodox Jewish law. Ms Stein testified that after she married Weiss at the age of 18, he raped her, punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant and locked her outside the home in the freezing cold. Rivky Stein (pictured right) leaves Brooklyn Supreme Court with her attorney on Wednesday after her civil divorce proceedings. Ms Stein testified before the court about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her huband, Yoel Weiss . She also told the court that her husband starved her and their two young children. The civil case which began this week will determine the custody of the couple's children, child support payments and alimony for Ms Stein. Yoel Weiss, at court on Wednesday, was reprimanded by the judge as he laughed when his ex-wife testified about being raped and beaten . Ms Stein's attorney Michael Stutman, head of the family practice at Mishcon de Reya, said: 'We are fighting for our clients right to raise her children, not live in fear and find the happiness that she deserves.' In an interview with Daily Mail Online last June, Ms Stein described the years of physical torture and mind games she said she had endured in her fight to free herself as an 'Agunah' - chained wife - from the bonds of their religious marriage. Rivky claimed on her wedding night as a naive teenager that Weiss, the ‘charming and spiritual’ man she believed she had married, was a violent and malevolent force who took pleasure in watching her suffer. 'The night of the wedding, he made it clear that he owned me and that night he forced himself on me,' she testified before the court on Thursday. 'I didn’t even know what happened. I felt stuck. I had nowhere to go back to', The New York Post reported. Ms Stein has spoken out about her struggle to be freed from her marriage in a deeply religious world where women often have little control and powerful rabbis have the final say. She testified this week that she had approached rabbis about the physical abuse by her husband, adding: 'I would ask them what I should do and if I had permission to call the police. 'They told me that I can’t. They wouldn’t give me permission to.' Weiss laughed as his estranged wife testified on Thursday, the Post reported, prompting harsh words from Judge Esther Morgenstern. Judge Morgenstern had trouble getting her own get from her ex-husband in the late 1980s when she was 27 years old, according to reports. The judge has put pressure on Weiss to give his former wife the get. Receiving a get will allow Ms Stein to remarry in the Jewish faith. During proceedings, Weiss' attorney said there was no proof of abuse. But Ms Stein told a very different story during a lengthy interview last June. She spoke from a cramped, basement apartment with five locks on the door that she had been forced to move into with her children to escape her marriage. Ms Stein, pictured with her two children, has demanded that her husband to free herself as an 'Agunah' - chained wife - from the bonds of their religious marriage . She said the marriage was one of fear and control with Weiss monitoring her every move, she claimed. She said: ‘I didn’t have anywhere to go back to. He had cut me off from my family and my friends. He monitored my phone. Everything was controlled, I couldn’t reach out to family and I was also ashamed. And I was scared what he would do. ‘So I thought, that’s it, I’m screwed, this is what I have to deal with now. And that all started from the beginning.’ She told Daily Mail Online: ‘If I ever wanted to leave the house, I had to ask him permission. I had to say where, when, exactly what time I would be back. If I was to go out, it would be with a family member of his. ‘Once my children came, if I went out, he usually held one of my children or both of them as an assurance that I would come back. Everything was extremely monitored and controlled. ‘The punishments were all the time. He locked me into rooms until he decided I could come out. Constant emotional and sexual abuse. Everything was to exert his control over me.' It wasn't until the summer of 2012 that Rivky found a window of opportunity for her and her two young children to flee. She obtained an order of protection from the court - an order which Weiss has violated and been arrested for five times. Weiss claims the complaints filed by Rivky were false. He says he was never jailed. He told MailOnline that he is prepared to give Ms Stein her get but that she was unwilling to settle on child custody issues or drop her order of protection. 'She's the mother of my children,' Weiss told MailOnline. 'But she's willing to fabricate anything. If something took place, I'd be in jail.' Rivky Stein, pictured in June 2014, is desperate to be granted her 'get'  - a divorce in the Orthodox Jewish faith - from her estranged husband. She told Daily Mail Online last year that she had suffered years of torture and mind games at his hands .","Rivky Stein, 25, took the stand at Brooklyn Supreme Court in New York on Thursday as she fights to have her estranged husband grant her a 'get'

"A 35-year-old former teacher accused of having sex with three male students cried in court on Thursday as she pleaded not guilty to the charges. Brianne Altice became emotional as she entered the courtroom in Farmington, Utah on Thursday afternoon dressed in a black-and-white striped jail jumpsuit - a stark contrast to the tight black pencil skirt, red shirt and sky-high heels she wore to her preliminary hearing last week. The former high school English teacher has been charged with 14 felonies, including rape, sodomy and sex abuse, stemming from the sexual relationships she allegedly had with the three teenagers. Last week, one of the boys testified that he had sex with Altice at least three times while she was free on bail in connection with charges from the other two cases. Scroll down for video . Regrets? Brianne Altice, 35, became emotional as she entered the courtroom in Farmington, Utah on Thursday, where she pleaded not guilty to having sexual relationships with three of her students . Upset: The former high school English teacher faces life behind bars if she is convicted of the 14 felonies . A judge agreed to hold her without bail after Deputy Davis County Attorney Susan Hunt argued argued that she had a 'willingness to continue to commit felony sexual offenses while on bail'. But while authorities and many members of the Davis County community are eager to put Altice away for years, she has an unlikely cheerleader: one of her alleged victims. The man, now 18, testified against his former teacher on Thursday despite being 'very unhappy' about doing so, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. 'It's ridiculous,' he said. 'She doesn't deserve to be here.' He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that December while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. What a difference a week makes: Last week, Altice was in court for a preliminary hearing - but a judge agreed she should be held without bail after it emerged that she had sex with one of the students while out on bail . Denial: The teacher, pictured on January 15, has denied sexual relationships with the boys - but one was able to describe her home in detail and recalled tattoos she has on her body, police said . One of the teenage boys, now 18, told a court in September how he was just 17 when he became involved with Altice between April and June of 2013, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. He said it began with kissing between class periods and eventually graduated to sexual intercourse. When asked to describe his relationship, the teen boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits'. Altice's attorney, Edward Brass, has said in court his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' Prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. In deep: Altice, pictured in court in February 2014, told investigators that she had sex with a 16-year-old boy - but later her attorney said she had been intimidated into confessing by male officers . Arrest: She was first taken into custody in 2013 but now remains in jail without bond . But Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' No trial dates have yet been set but she faces up to life in prison if convicted.","Brianne Altice 'had sex with three teenage students - and even when she was on bail, she had sex with one of the boys at least three more times'

"Adorable seven-month-old Grace has beaten more than 180,000 other little ones to become the new Gerber Baby. Resting her head on her hands and sporting a cute smile, perhaps it's unsurprising this was the winning photo in baby food brand Gerber's 5th Annual Be Our Baby Photo Search. Grace and her parents, from East Petersburg, Pennsylvania, will now receive $50,000, one year of Gerber Baby Food, and the opportunity to appear in a Gerber ad as official 2015 'spokesbaby'. Gerber announced its newest star and winning entry in the 5th annual Gerber Be Our Baby Photo Search 2014 as Grace from East Petersburg, Pennsylvania (pictured) Explaining how she captured the winning photograph, Grace's mother Gabrielle said: 'The photo that won was taken only five photos from when I started taking pictures of her that day. 'She must have taken her hands out of her mouth and posed them like that for a split second because I didn't even realize how cute she was posing until after I was completely done taking pictures and looking back at what I had just taken,' added Gabrielle in a press release, who has asked Gerber to keep family’s last name out of the press because of privacy concerns. Cassie Savage, Marketing Specialist at Gerber added: 'While many of the entry photos this year met our criteria, Grace's captivating charm stole the judges' hearts. The Gerber Photo Search is celebrating its fifth year with this sweet new face!' The annual photo competition for find the new face of Gerber has been running for around five years, but for more than eight decades the baby food  featured the same iconic sketch on all its products. Ann Turner Cook, now 87, became the first Gerber model in 1928, and her trademarked portrait has appeared on millions of jars, cartons and tubs of the baby food over the years. The Gerber logo for more than eight decades (pictured) was a sketch of Ann Turner Cook until the brand launched a photo contest five years ago to select the new face of the baby food company . Ann Turner Cook was just a few months old in 1928 when a charcoal sketch of her (pictured held by Mrs Cook) was selected in a contest to represent Gerber baby food . Mother-of-four, Mrs Cook, who lives in Tampa, Florida, got her modeling start in 1927, when family friend and artist Dorothy Hope Smith asked her mother if she could use Ann as a model. And just like this year's search winner, the charcoal sketch of Ann was entered into, and won, a nationwide contest. She became the first Gerber baby in 1928, and three years later the U.S. company decided to trademark her portrait. It has been used on every Gerber product ever since. However it wasn't until 1978 that her identity was revealed, and guesses ranged from from movie stars Humphrey Bogart and Elizabeth Taylor to former Senator Bob Dole. Retired English teacher and mystery novelist, Mrs Cook said she felt very proud to have been known worldwide as the Gerber baby. 'I always had that expression with my mouth hanging open,' she told CBS News. 'Kind of a quizzical expression. 'I can't think of anything nicer than to be a symbol for babies. And that's what I think I became.'","Grace from East Petersburg, Pennsylvania, was crowned the 2015 Gerber Baby .

"Earlier this week US confectionery giant Hershey's declared legal war on its British counterpart for allegedly making their goods too similar to those favoured by American consumers. If successful, the bid would strip British specialist stores such as Tea & Sympathy and Myers Of Keswick, in New York's West Village, of one of their key selling points. It comes years after rumours swirled of an attempted takeover of the British go-to brand Cadbury by Hershey's owner Kraft Foods. American favourite: US confectioners Hershey's have launched a legal bid to remove Cadbury's products . Best of British: Fans of the Cadbury's Dairy Milk in America complained, saying they preferred the UK treat to home-grown alternatives . The two companies quietly reached a deal in 1988 allowing the production of Dairy Milk and other British treats with slight tweaks to recipes and packaging. In recent weeks British consumers have also protested at alleged plans of Cadbury's US owners to change the Creme Egg recipe. Mondelez changed the recipe for the sweet fondant-filled snack so that the shell is made from a 'standard, traditional Cadbury milk chocolate' instead of the popular Cadbury Dairy Milk. Critics also complained over plans to remove one of the eggs from the standard pack of six. But while Hershey's claims allege harmful similarities between the two, subtle discrepancies between the two recipes mean the American and British chocolates are in fact markedly different. With British standards requiring products to contain at least 20 per cent cocoa solids to be categorised as chocolate, its regarded as more delicious across the world. US: 10 per cent cocoa solids . Britain: 20 per cent cocoa solids . US: South American beans . Britain: West African beans . US: Some goods contain the additive PGPR used as cheaper cocoa butter alternative . Generally, ingredients found in American chocolate bars are cheaper than those in British counterparts. Indeed when news of Hershey's legal threat broke, US natives were quick to jump to the defence of Creme Eggs and Toffee Crisps. 'I'm a proud American but I hate Hershey's and have loved Cadbury's since I was a kid,' one Twitter user said, while another described the home-grown alternative as 'pure garbage'. Many chalk the more bitter taste of Hershey's down to food industry rules which mean only 10 per cent of its famous kisses need to be of pure cocoa solids for it to be considered chocolate. While only 11 per cent of Hershey's bars is made of cocoa, it makes up almost a quarter of a bar of Dairy Milk. Another reason for varying tastes is the source of each's beans. Most companies keep their recipes closely under wraps, though it's understood American confectioners prefer South American beans while the British tend to opt for those grown in West Africa. A fundamental difference in taste stems from where cocoa beans are sourced, with British brands opting for West African produce while US companies pluck from the fields of South America .","British standards require that at least a fifth of sweet is cocoa solids .
In America however, only 10 per cent of ingredient is needed in treats .
Geographical differences in cocoa beans contributes to taste differences .

"Thug: Gareth Williams, 31, was jailed for knocking out a grandfather in front of his family at an Elvis festival in south Wales . A steroid-using thug was jailed today for knocking a grandfather unconscious in front of his family  at an Elvis Presley festival. Gareth Williams, who has previous convictions for assault, wounding and arson, felled Terrence Niblett, 66, with a single punch at the international event in Porthcawl, South Wales. Mr Niblett, who has been left deeply traumatised by the assault, had been enjoying a day out with his wife, son and grandchildren. As the group prepared to watch a performance in a pub, the music fan was saving seats for his son and daughter-in-law when two women asked if they could have them. When Mr Niblett refused, burly bodybuilder Williams appeared - wearing a T-shirt with the word 'LETHAL' printed on the back - and struck the older man in the face, knocking him unconscious. Mr Niblett claims he has been crippled by fear and anxiety since the incident - which took place at the Hi Tide pub in Porthcawl. In a statement read in court, he said: 'I thought I was in a place where I was safe and I have felt frightened and nervous since of anybody I don't know who comes close to me. 'I am an honest man who has never been in trouble and I cannot understand why a person would assault someone for no reason. 'It will affect me for the rest of my life'. Cardiff Crown Court was told Williams was a steroid user who drinks, takes Class A drugs and has previous convictions for assault, weapon possession, arson, burglary and wounding. Describing the shocking incident, prosecutor John Warren said: 'Without warning [Williams] punched Mr Niblett, knocking him off his feet, to the floor. 'The next thing he recalls is coming round and being treated by St John Ambulance staff. Williams, of Maesteg, south Wales, pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm at Cardiff Crown Court, above, and was sentenced to 34 weeks behind bars . 'He was taken to hospital where three stitches were put in the wound on his face'. Williams, 31, of Maesteg, South Wales, pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm. Owen Williams, defending, said that Williams regretted his actions after sobering up and claimed his client wants to change. Judge Philip Richards warned Williams he would 'end up killing someone if he didn't change his ways' - and sentenced him to 34 weeks prison in the prison. Judge Richards said: 'He has learned nothing from his past offences and if he doesn't stop he will end up killing somebody.

"Drug smugglers are turning 'trusted travelers' into unwitting mules by placing containers with powerful magnets under their cars in Mexico and then recovering the illegal cargo far from the view of border authorities in the United States. One motorist spotted the containers while pumping gas after crossing into Southern California on Jan. 12 and thought it might be a bomb. His call to police prompted an emergency response at the Chevron station, and then a shocker: 13.2 pounds of heroin were pulled from under the vehicle, according to a U.S. law enforcement official. San Diego police said the drugs were packed inside six magnetized cylinders. Border patrol: SENTRI users are being targeted by drug smugglers who place magnetized boxes under the cars of unsuspecting drivers (2005 file photo) The driver had just used a 'trusted traveler' lane at the San Ysidro border crossing, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because some details of the case have not been made public. Authorities have learned of at least three similar incidents in San Diego since then, all involving drivers enrolled in the enormously popular SENTRI program, which stands for Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection. There were 12.6 million SENTRI vehicle crossings in fiscal 2013, more than double the 5.9 million four years earlier. The program enables hundreds of thousands of people who pass extensive background checks to whiz past inspectors with less scrutiny. Signing up can reduce rush-hour wait times from more than two hours to less than 15 minutes at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest crossing, where SENTRI users represented 40 percent of the 4.5 million vehicle crossings in fiscal 2013, the Government Accountability Office found. But like other prescreening programs, there's a potential downside: the traveler can become a target, and such cases can be tricky for investigators when people caught with drugs claim they were planted. Using magnets under cars isn't new, but this string of cases is unusual. The main targets are people who park for hours in Mexico before returning to the U.S., authorities say. Smugglers track their movements on both sides of the border, figuring out their travel patterns and where they park. It takes only seconds to attach and remove the magnetized containers when no one is looking. 'It's a concern for everyone, not as big a concern for me because I'm careful,' said Aldo Vereo, a SENTRI user and office assistant at the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency who parks in a garage when home in Tijuana and varies his routes. 'People should be worried because they go straight home and straight to work.' 'Trusted travelers' were issued windshield decals for years, but they are no longer needed to identify vehicles approaching the inspection booths. New stickers haven't been issued since 2013, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency says existing stickers can be removed. Many haven't heeded the call, which can make them a target. The Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce in San Diego told newsletter readers last week that decals should go. 'It's basically demonstrating that you are a SENTRI user,' said Alejandra Mier y Teran, the chamber's executive director. 'Criminals are savvy, and they know they are part of a program where they are not checked as much.' CBP says frequent crossers also should vary their travel routines and keep a closer eye on their cars. There have been 29 cases of motorists unwittingly carrying drugs under their cars in the San Diego area since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified the trend in July 2011, including six drivers who made it past inspectors, said spokeswoman Lauren Mack. Any driver who suspects something's amiss under their car should immediately report it, to better show their innocence, authorities say. Officer Matthew Tortorella, a San Diego police spokesman, said ""it would be inappropriate"" to make public more details about the Jan. 12 seizure, and CBP spokeswoman Jacqueline Wasiluk also declined to comment, calling it a local police investigation. There have been three seizures since, all involving SENTRI drivers who were not charged: . —On Jan. 13, inspectors at the Otay Mesa border crossing found 35 pounds of marijuana in seven packages attached by powerful magnets to the bottom of a 2010 Kia Forte. —On Tuesday, a driver alerted an inspector at Otay Mesa to a package under a 2010 Nissan Murano, and 8 pounds of methamphetamine were found in three packages underneath. —On Wednesday, a dog at San Ysidro alerted inspectors to a 2000 Toyota Corolla with 18 pounds of marijuana underneath. That driver was enrolled in SENTRI but using a regular lane. Pete Flores, CBP's San Diego field office director, acknowledged that it's unusual to have so many cases in fewer than two weeks. 'It's a cat-and-mouse game,' Flores said. 'Each change they make prompts a change from law enforcement, which in turn prompts them to again change their tactics.'

"There was anger and disbelief yesterday that flags were lowered to half mast over Buckingham Palace, Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament to mark the death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia – despite his country’s shameful record on human rights. David Cameron, Barack Obama and Tony Blair were among those who made gushing tributes to the authoritarian and hugely powerful monarch of the world’s biggest oil producing country. Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Charles would join Mr Cameron in flying to Saudi Arabia today to pay their condolences personally alongside a host of world leaders. Scroll down for video . Flags were flown at half mast across Westminster yesterday following the death of the authoritarian ruler of Saudi Arabia King Abdullah - including at Buckingham Palace . The Union Flag was also flown at half-mast over Downing Street - as David Cameron joined Prince Charles flying to Saudi Arabia . But the decision to lower flags to half mast over public buildings – also including Westminster Abbey – triggered a bitter backlash with widespread criticism that the monarch, who died aged 90, had done little to stop the regular public beheadings and floggings handed out by the authorities. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson condemned the decision to fly flags at half mast as ‘a steaming pile of nonsense’. She added that it was a ‘stupid act on its own and a stupid precedent to set’. Author Tom Holland wrote: ‘Hooray for British hypocrisy! Flags at 1/2-mast in Whitehall 4 the king of a country that lashes bloggers & executes converts 2 Christianity.’ And BBC presenter Andrew Neil tweeted: ‘Westminster Abbey flying half mast flag for dead King of Saudi Arabia, where Christianity is banned and possessing a Bible illegal.’ The flag at the Houses of Parliament, London, flies at half mast as a mark of respect for King Abdullah . The flag at the Westminster Abbey was also lowered following the Government order issued this morning . Abdullah, who died on Thursday night of pneumonia, oversaw limited reforms in the conservative kingdom where women are still banned from driving, voting and even leaving the house without a male chaperone. All citizens are unable to vote except in municipal elections, public beheading by sword remains a feature of the judicial system while political parties are banned and homosexuality is punished by death. Saudi Arabia runs one of the world's strictest criminal justice regimes. Its punishments include: . Blasphemy: Death . Drinking alcohol: Lashes . Adultery: Death by stoning . Stealing: Amputation of right hand . Banditry: Ampuation of hand and foot . Murder: Death . However, the order came from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport yesterday for government buildings to lower flags as a mark of respect for the king. The move was condemned as a ‘serious blunder’ by Ukip MP Douglas Carswell. Referring to the civil service as Sir Humphrey – the mandarin from television comedy Yes Minister – he said: ‘On the day that Sir Humphrey lowers the Union Jack in Whitehall to mark the passing of the Saudi monarch, I wonder how many public executions there are going to be in Saudi Arabia? ‘Why are we doing this? I think Sir Humphrey has seriously blundered.’ Tom Copley, Labour London Assembly member, tweeted: ‘Disgusting that flags are being flown at half mast for the death of an autocrat. If anything we should double the length of the flagpoles.’ The director of Amnesty International UK, Kate Allen, said: ‘No one is flying flags for the scores of people Saudi Arabia executes each year after unfair trials.’ A criminal gets a public flogging by two officials in Saudi Arabia in rare public footage of Saudi Arabia's brutal criminal justice system . Westminster Abbey said they were flying their flag over Westminster Abbey at half mast out of 'respect' despite the fact that converting to Christianity in Saudi Arabia carries a capital punishment . Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson attacked the decision to ask for flags to be flown at half mast . The reaction to the King's death sparked a furious response. Former MP Louise Mensch said it was 'unacceptable' Prince Charles is flying to Saudi Arabia to pay his respects to the late king (pictured in 2007), who ruled his country according to strict Islamic traditions . Saudi Arabia, which last year is reported to have carried out 87 beheadings, has attracted further outrage after the first public flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, 31, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and ten years in jail for highlighting the kingdom’s harsh laws on dissent. A video taken by a policeman last week of four colleagues dragging a woman down the street of Mecca and taking three attempts to behead her with a sword highlighted the crude brutality of the ruling regime’s justice system. Downing Street and other Whitehall departments - along with Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace - were among prominent landmarks to put Union Flags at half mast after a request was sent out by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Officials said it was a matter of protocol and that the formal request had been made by the Palace. The Queen's tribute to the Saudi King is in stark contrast to the reluctance to fly the Union Flag at half mast  after the death of Princess Diana in 1997. She eventually broke with protocol to lower the flag on the day of the funeral - a week after the Princess's death. A notice issued on department's website said: 'It is with great regret that we learn of the death of the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, King of Saudi Arabia. 'It is requested that all flags be half-masted from 8am today until 8pm this evening. 'Any other UK national flags flown alongside the Union Flag when it is at half-mast should also be at half-mast. If a flag of a foreign nation is normally flown on the same stand as the Union Flag, it should be removed. 'Local authorities are not bound by this request but may wish to follow it for guidance. Devolved administrations are responsible for issuing instructions for the flying of the Union Flag on buildings in their estate and others as necessary.' In one of the most horrific cases during King Abdullah’s reign, 15 schoolgirls died after religious police stopped them leaving a burning building because they were not in Islamic dress. The senior Labour MP Ann Clwyd questioned why Britain was paying tribute to a leader with an ‘appalling’ human rights record. Former Conservative MP Louise Mensch asked: ‘When will we stop the goddamm cultural relativism and say NO IT’S NOT OK to whip women, stop them voting, working, having custody rights?’ After the death of Princess Diana in 1997, there was a public outcry because no flag was flying over Buckingham Palace – let alone one at half mast. The reason was because the Royal Standard was the only flag traditionally allowed to fly, and only when the sovereign was present. The Queen was at Balmoral. The Queen responded to the outcry by ordering the Union Flag to fly at half mast on the day of Diana’s funeral. Since then, the protocol has been for the Union Flag to fly when the Queen is not in residence, as an alternative to her standard. The union flag is at half mast upon times of national mourning. Supporters of King Abdullah, who is succeeded by his 79-year-old half-brother Salman, claim that the absolute ruler followed a difficult path maintaining good relations with the West – Saudi Arabia is a key ally in the war on terror as well as an important business partner for the UK – while putting into place mild reforms. Mr Cameron said the king ‘will be remembered for his long years of service to the Kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths’. Former prime minister Mr Blair said: ‘He was loved by his people and will be deeply missed. I knew him well and admired him greatly. Despite the turmoil of events in the region around him, he remained a stable and sound ally, was a patient and skilful moderniser.’ The Queen – now the world’s oldest monarch – said the king ‘will be long remembered by all who work for peace and understanding’. Mr Obama praised the king’s ‘steadfast and passionate belief in the importance of the US-Saudi relationship’. Tens of thousands gathered in the capital and Mecca as King Abdullah was buried in an unmarked grave, in keeping with Muslim traditions. Saudi Arabia is a key customer of the British arms industry and an export centre for more than 6,000 UK companies. The annual value of trade to Britain is in the billions, with 200 on-going joint ventures alone worth a total of £11.5billion. To the UK arms industry, Saudi Arabia is a key target. In 1985, the controversial Al-Yamamah weapons agreement deal was signed – marking Britain’s biggest arms contract, worth £40billion. The deal to sell fighter jets was the subject of a fraud investigation that was halted by the government amid warnings it would damage relations with the Saudis. UK companies involved in the country include Shell, GlaxoSmithKline, BAE Systems, Rolls Royce and Marks & Spencer. In turn, Saudi Arabia has an estimated £62billion invested the UK economy. More than 34,000 Saudis live here. Tony Blair sparked an angry reaction after taking to Twitter to praise the late king's death - claiming he was 'loved by his people' Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia presents  Tony Blair with the highest of Saudi honours in 1998, the order of King Abdul Aziz ribbon in 10 Downing Street . Former journalist Martin Bright, who went to work for the former Prime Minister, said Mr Blair's response highlighted why he had to leave .","Tributes paid by world leaders after 90-year-old King Abdullah's death .

"The highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Cuba in more than three decades said Friday that two days of talks on re-establishing full diplomatic relations had left her with no sense of whether the new U.S. policy of engagement would achieve its goal of generating reforms that benefit the Cuban people. The Obama administration says the goal of its Cuban policy remains the same: creating more freedoms for ordinary Cubans. Cuban diplomats said throughout the negotiations in Havana that the U.S. needs to abandon hopes of using closer relations to foment change on the island. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson told reporters Friday that the talks had left her with no clearer idea of whether Obama's new policy has good prospects of success. 'It's very hard to say exactly how this will work,' Jacobson said. 'We think that we need to make decisions in our own interest and take decision that are to going to empower the Cuban people but  the verdict on whether that succeeds is still to be made.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NOT WORKING: Assistant Secretary of State of the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson isn't sure her team can eliminate obstacles to normalized ties with Havana because the communist nation refuses to move toward democracy . NOT CHANGING: 'Cuba has never responded to pressure,' Havana's top negotiator , Ministry of Foreign Relations General Director for the United States Josefina Vidal, said . The United States and Cuba both reported progress toward restoring diplomatic ties after a half-century of estrangement. But it wasn't immediately clear whether the human rights issue, which has previously blocked closer U.S.-Cuban relations, would pose a threat to the new diplomatic process. 'Cuba has never responded to pressure,' Josefina Vidal, the country's top diplomat for U.S. affairs, told reporters Thursday night. The comments by Jacobson and Vidal lay bare the pressures each side faces at home – the U.S., from Republican leaders in Congress and powerful Cuban-American groups, and Cuba, from hardliners deeply concerned that rapprochement could undermine the communist system founded by Fidel Castro. Earlier in the week, Jacobson hailed the talks as 'positive and productive,' focusing on the mechanics of converting interest sections into full-fledged embassies headed by ambassadors. But she also spoke of 'profound differences' separating the two governments and said embassies by themselves would not mean normalized ties. Along with human rights, Cuba outlined other obstacles in the relationship. Vidal demanded that Cuba be taken off the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. However, she praised Obama for easing the U.S. trade embargo and urging the U.S. Congress to lift it entirely. 'It was a first meeting. This is a process,' Vidal said. In the next weeks, she said, the U.S. and Cuba will schedule a second round of talks, which may or may not be the time to finalize an agreement. Issues on Thursday's agenda included ending caps on staff, limits on diplomats' movements and, in the case of the U.S. building, removing guard posts and other Cuban structures along the perimeter. Earlier, the two countries disputed whether human rights had even been discussed at all. Jacobson said the U.S. raised it in the morning meeting; Vidal said it had not come up. Gustavo Machin, Cuba's deputy chief of North American affairs, later said the delegations spent time in an afternoon session discussing U.S. human rights problems – a reference to recent police killings of black men in Missouri and New York. NOT ORDINARY: A journalist records a video with a tablet of Gustavo Machin, Cuba's deputy chief of North American affairs, during the history talks . NOT EASY: American negotiators including Roberta Jacobson, flanked by Jeffrey DeLaurentis, second left, chief of mission at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Edward Alex Lee, second right, are butting heads with their Cuban counterparts . Cuban state media said the Cuban delegation also complained about the detention of prisoners at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay. A U.S. official said the difference in Jacobson's statements was unintentional and that the English version – that the U.S 'pressed the Cuban government for improved human rights conditions, including freedom of expression' – reflected the delegation's position. The U.S. and Cuba also talked about human trafficking, environmental protection, American rules to allow greater telecommunications exports to Cuba and how to coordinate responses to oil spills or Ebola outbreaks. The need for at least one future round of talks could set back U.S. hopes of reopening the embassies before April's Summit of the Americas, which Obama and Castro are expected to attend. Still, after so many years of mutual suspicion, each side stressed the importance of the collegial atmosphere in Havana that included long working lunches and a dinner together.","Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson says 'it's very hard to say exactly how this will work'

"Chewing gum has been found to remove harmful bacteria from mouths, according to a study. Researchers found that just a single piece of chewing gum can remove 100 million bacteria - 10 per cent of the microbial load in saliva - in ten minutes. And they say that gum can be just as effective as flossing - although they each targets different areas of the mouth. Scroll down for video . Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands studied the effectiveness of chewing gum (stock image shown). They found in 10 minutes it removed 100 million bacteria from the mouth. But if chewed for a long time it could release bacteria back into the gums . The study, which appeared in the journal Plos One, was led by researchers from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. They found that the gum was most effective in the first 30 seconds of chewing, and after that it would become less effective in trapping bacteria on a sliding scale. Also, they note that only gum that did not contain sugar was useful; if it did contain sugar, it could ‘feed’ oral bacteria. Last year a chewing gum company  created an art installation featuring identical twins to find out what impression chewing gum makes on the public. For the Almost Identical exhibition, Beldent put the siblings together inside the Buenos Aires Museum of Contemporary Art and asked one to chew a stick of gum while the other maintained a neutral expression. When 481 visitors were asked a series of questions about the twins, 73 per cent preferred the gum chewers. In one of their experiments, known numbers of bacteria were finger-chewed into the mouths of participants, and they were then asked to chew gum for 10 minutes. The researchers found that about 100 million bacteria were detected on each piece of chewed gum, with the number increasing as chewing time increased. ‘Trapped bacteria were clearly visualised in chewed gum using scanning-electron-microscopy,’ they wrote in their paper. They used two unnamed brands of spearming gum in their study. Chewing one piece of gum could remove about 10 per cent of the oral microbial load in saliva. They note, however, that continuously chewing gum can ultimately release some of the absorbed bacteria back into the mouth. The researchers say chewing gum can be as effective as flossing (stock image shown) - although each targets different areas of the mouth. They hope their research could be used to make specialist chewing gum to absorb specific disease-related bacteria in the future . ’Continued chewing changes the structure of the gums, decreasing the hardness of the gum due to uptake of salivary components and release of water soluble components,’ they write. ‘This presumably affects the adhesion of bacteria to the gum, causing a release of initially trapped, more weakly adhering bacteria from the gum. ‘Such a change in composition of trapped bacteria is supported by the observation that the diversity of species trapped in chewed gum increases with chewing time.’ The researchers add that their research could be used to develop gum that selectively removes specific disease-related bacteria from mouths.","Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands studied the effectiveness of chewing gum .

"Lawmakers in Michigan and Texas want their states to join Arizona and require high school seniors to pass a written civics test before they can graduate. The questions would be drawn from the same test legal immigrants must take before they can become U.S. citizens. Some of the material is comparatively easy for anyone who's seen Saturday Night Live – 'What is the name of the President of the United States?' – while others could be tricky for 18-year-olds who get their news from Facebook. For instance: 'In what year was the U.S. Constitution written?' Hint: It's not 1776. SCROLL DOWN TO TAKE THE TEST . EPIC MISSION: Michigan state representative Peter Lucido wants high school seniors to put off graduation until they can score a 60 on a basic civics test . EPIC FAIL: State representative Bill Zedler wants the bill made law in Texas, but he doesn't know when World War II started . History: This man wrote the Declaration of Independence. Can you name him? Michigan state Rep. Peter Lucido and Texas state Rep. Bill Zedler, both Republicans, have legislation in the works to tell boards of education statewide to insert the tests of basic American facts into school curricula. Flunk it, and high school students will have to study and try again. A 60 per cent score is required for a passing grade – the same target used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 'We require immigrants to have a basic understanding and appreciation for American civics,' Lucido said in a statement on Friday, first reported by Mlive.com. 'Why should the threshold be any different for citizens who are lucky enough to be born in the United States?' Perhaps surprisingly, the Michigan Association of Secondary School Principals opposes the idea, saying students already have enough standardized tests to study for as they exit high school. 'We also have a long-standing position that high school content standards need to be focused on career and college readiness,' said the group's assistant director for government relations, Robert Kefgen. Before he became U.S. President, Dwight D. Eisenhower was a military general. But which war did he fight in? Laguna Beach in California is on the U.S. west coast. But is this ocean the Atlantic, the Pacific, or the Arctic? QUICK: Do you know which of these men is the Chief Justice of the United States? And what's his name? Lucido, who won his first election in November, could file his bill as soon as Tuesday, when Michigan's general assembly is seated for the year. Zedler has already introduced his bill in Texas. 'When you start having students graduate from high school who don’t know where we got our independence from and that kind of stuff, I think it’s a little frightening,' he told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He said he hasn't taken the test himself, but 'I think I would do pretty well.' 'I know the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. I know World War II was started Dec. 7, 1941. I know what the Civil War was fought over.' Actually, World War II started in September 1939, and regional skirmishes that led to it began even earlier. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but the U.S. didn't enter the conflict until the following day. New legislation: On Thursday, Arizona governor, Doug Ducey (pictured, left, on Friday) signed new legislation requiring all high school students in the state to pass the US citizenship test on civics before they can graduate . Arizona already has a similar law, signed on January 15 by Gov. Doug Ducey. It's a project of the Arizona-based Joe Foss Institute, which is circulating model legislation in all 50 states. The group wants the idea adopted nationwide by 2017, and says as many as 15 state legislatures could float proposals this year alone.

"A pregnant woman caught short on the school run was refused permission to use the toilet in a police station because officers said they were not 'a public service'. Kerry Belton, who is six months pregnant with her first child, was on her way to collect her younger sister from school when she entered Felixstowe Police Station in Suffolk. The 23-year-old asked staff if she could use the facilities, but was curtly told she was not allowed as the station was 'not a public service'. Kerry Belton, 23, was caught short for time when she ran into Felixstowe Police Station to use the toilets. But the woman, who is six months pregnant, was told the toilets they 'were not a public service' After pleading with the employee behind the desk that she was pregnant, Miss Belton claims she was told: 'No buts,' and that she should walk into town. Eventually staff relented and allowed her through with an officer accompanying her. She has now lodged a formal complaint with the station after being left 'humiliated' by the incident. 'I ran in and said ""can I please use your toilet"",' Miss Belton said. 'He said ""we’re not for public convenience, we’re not a public service"" and I started to say ""but I’m pregnant"" then he cut me off and said ""no buts"". “They told me I could walk into the town but being pregnant and having to walk that far, I wouldn't have made it. 'He eventually agreed but he was very blunt and made me feel very uncomfortable. If he was polite I wouldn't have minded as much.' After being allowed to use the bathroom, Miss Belton said the officer pointed towards the door and told her: 'That's the way out.' The mother-to-be said was left 'humiliated' by the incident and has lodged a formal complaint with the station . Miss Belton is six months pregnant with her first child. When she told officers she would not be able to walk into town in time to make the toilet, she was allegedly told: 'No buts' 'He said they weren't a public service but they are the police. I thought they were supposed to be a public service,' the 23-year-old added. Miss Belton was with her father, Nigel, at the time. The 46-year-old said he was 'disgusted' by the treatment his daughter received. 'I am disgusted really. It is supposed to be a public service, I can’t believe he said that. 'I felt bad because I sent her in and she was humiliated. 'She is huge and there is no mistaking that she is pregnant.' Police are investigating the incident after Miss Belton lodged a formal complaint. A spokesman declined to comment on their experience, but added: 'We aim to provide everyone with a polite and professional service and we would encourage anyone who is unhappy with the service provided by Suffolk Constabulary to contact us so we can investigate further. 'Police stations are operational buildings and as such it’s important that both police officers and staff are mindful of security and because of this the facilities are not available for public use.'

"A rescue dog has stunned her new owner after giving birth to 14 Doberman puppies, setting a new British record in the process. Keela the two-year-old Doberman was only thought to be carrying five or six pups when she was examined by vets, but ended up giving birth to a monster brood. Zara Hayes, 42, who runs the Yappy Ever After dog centre paid £450 for two-year-old Doberman Keela after noticing an online advert saying the animal was 'possibly pregnant'. She was worried that the dog would be exploited by its new owners for profit, as Doberman puppies can sell for £1,000, so she put her up for adoption instead. Scroll down for video . Keela the Doberman set a new British record for the largest litter when she gave birth to 14 puppies on the rather fitting date of December 14 - beating the previous record of 13 . Zara Hayes, 42, paid £450 for Keela after seeing an advert for her online saying she was 'possibly pregnant'. Ms Hayes was concerned the dog would be exploited for profit, so put her up for adoption instead . Assistant pub manager Cat Davis, 33, agreed to take Keela on after vets said she was pregnant with six or seven pups, and was stunned when the monster brood popped out . Cat Davis, 33, from Cardiff, agreed to take care of Keela in October last year after being told she was carrying six pups, slightly less than the average litter of eight, according to the Kennel Club. But on the rather fitting night of December 14, Keela gave birth to 14 puppies which have now taken over her house, eating a 5kg bag of dog food per day. Following the mammoth birth, Ms Davis (left) is panning to permanently adopt Keela (centre) from rescue home owner Ms Hayes (right) They spend most of their time huddled together in a basket in the corner of her kitchen for warmth, and are so close they all sleep together in one big pile. Ms Davis, an assistant manager at a pub, said: 'We couldn’t believe it when 14 came out, and on December 14 as well, it was a weird coincidence. 'They have taken over my house and my life, there isn’t much space left that isn’t taken up by dogs. 'But it is worth it to make sure they are kept safe and sent to loving homes rather than being exploited. 'They all have their own personalities but they are live wires and bundles of energy. The pups are so close they all sleep together in a big puppy heap. They are adorable. 'We are lucky people are donating food because they are going through a bag a day and they certainly let you know when they’re hungry. 'I am glad we have found loving homes for them all but I will definitely miss them when they leave next month.' The puppies, who all weigh 3-4kg, are being rehomed by Yappy Ever After for their standard minimum adoption fee of £250. They have already been snapped up by owners who will be coming to collect them a few days after they have their injections on February 9. One of the puppies is even going to a home as far away in Germany, while the other 13 are off to new families across Britain. The dogs were known by numbers at first but have now been given names by their new owners which are - Odin, Kaiser, Zeus, Boudicca, Oscar, Boo, Kayla, Wilson, Shadow, Stan, Zeus, Patience, Dylan and Blake. Ms Davis said her home has now been overrun by the dogs, who are eating a 5kg bag of dog food per day . All 14 pups have now found news homes after being donated to Ms Hayes' rescue centre for the standard fee of £250 each, and one is even being sent to Germany . Ms Davis says one of the puppies wasn't breathing when it was born, but now they are all fighting fit, and will leave her on February 9 after having their injections . Zara, who runs Yappy Ever After dog rescue from Arnold, Notts., watched the birth live as Cat sent her pictures and videos as it happened. She added: 'I got Keela because my thought was that someone could make a lot of money from the puppies with very little effort. 'I was worried about her not being of use to anyone after giving birth. I am just overwhelmed with the number of puppies to be honest, there were a lot of tears. 'It was a bit of touch and go with the last one because she wasn’t breathing, but they are all fighting strong now. 'We couldn’t believe it when it got to six and then more came out and it kept going up  until 14. According to the Kennel Club the usual litter size for a Doberman is between eight and nine puppies. Keela had been expected to deliver six, but ended up giving birth to 14 . 'We have seen that another Doberman had 13 but I am planning to contact Guinness World Records because we think this must be a record.' Yappy Ever After volunteer Vicky Day, 26, from Arnold, added: 'I was getting regular updates throughout the night as and when the puppies were born so none of us could sleep. 'By the time the 12th one was out I thought it was madness. Fourteen is amazing - I wish I could have been there. Most of all I am pleased they are all healthy and are all going to good homes.' New mum Keela - who will be neutured so she can’t be exploited in the future - is now going to be adopted by fosterer Cat after the puppies have been rehomed.","Zara Hayes, 42, saw advert for 'possibly pregnant' Doberman online .

"A second American citizen has now become infected with the deadly Ebola virus as the worst outbreak ever of the terrifying and grisly disease rages through four West African nations. Nancy Writebol, an American working for a charity organization in Liberia has tested positive for the virus officials announced Sunday. While her condition was not released. Writebol is undoubtedly fighting for her life against the virus, which kills 90 percent of those infected. Scroll dowmn for video . Contagion: Christian missionary Nancy Writebol (seen here with her husband David) has become the second U.S. citizen infected with deadly Ebola in the midst of the worst outbreak of the virus ever in Africa . Outbreak:: Writebol and her husband are not healthcare personnel, but have spent the last 15 years working in disease and poverty-stricken third world countries . So too is American doctor Kent Brantly, the 33-year-old medical director for charity group Samaritan's Purse whose been working in Liberia since October. Writebol had been working with Ebola victims in the Liberian capital of Monrovia for the groups Serving In Mission and Samaritan's Purse when she became infected, NBC News reports. Writebol and her husband David are not medical personnel, but rather Christian missionaries with 15 years experience serving disease and poverty-stricken third world nations. Originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, the couple raised two sons before moving overseas, first to Ecuador and Zambia before moving to Liberia. Dr. Kent Brantly, meanwhile, was being treated in Monrovia over the weekend for the dreaded disease, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse. 'We are hopeful, but he is certainly not out of the woods yet,' she said. Early treatment improves a patient's chances of survival and Strickland said Brantly recognized his own symptoms and began receiving care immediately. The highly contagious virus is one of the most deadly diseases in the world. The World Health Organization said the outbreak is the largest ever recorded, killing more than 670 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone since it began earlier this year. More than 1,000 others have been infected by the virus, which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims. The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks. Health workers are at serious risk of contracting the disease, which spreads through contact with bodily fluids. Unprecedented: The outbreak has spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and has now killed a man in far more densely populated Nigeria. The outbreak is the deadliest ever of the terrifying disease as the death toll crept past 700 . Deadly errors: Dr. Kent Brantly of Samaritan's Purse relief organization is shown wearing protective clothing as he works with Ebola patients in Liberia. Brantly is also being treated after somehow becoming infected with the virus. While the protective suits keep infectious fluids out, relief workers do often become victims . Another victim: Dr Kent Brantly, pictured with his wife and children who were with him in Africa until recently, but who officials don't believe have the virus . Photos of Brantly working in Liberia show him in white coveralls made of a synthetic material that he wore for hours a day while treating Ebola patients. There is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever and sore throat and escalates to vomiting, diarrhea and internal and external bleeding. The WHO says the disease is not contagious until a person begins to show symptoms. Brantly's wife and children had been living with him in Liberia but flew home to the U.S. about a week ago, before the doctor started showing any signs of illness, Strickland said. Stable: 33-year-old Brantly, left, was receiving intensive medical care in a Monrovia hospital and was in stable condition, according to a spokeswoman for the aid group, Melissa Strickland . 'They have absolutely shown no symptoms,' she said. A woman who identified herself as Brantly's mother said the family was declining immediate comment when reached by phone in Indiana late Saturday. Brantly is a graduate of Indiana University School of Medicine and went to Liberia as part of a two-year fellowship with Samaritan's Purse, shortly after he completed his residency in family medicine at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. 'The caliber of a person like that who says, `I'm going Africa, I'm going to where people need me the most,' it really speaks to you,' Robert Earley, president and CEO of JPS Health Network, said Sunday. 'It speaks to your heart.' Dr. Samuel . Brisbane on Sunday became the first Liberian doctor to die in an . outbreak the World Health Organization says. A Ugandan doctor working in . the country died earlier this month. Brisbane, . who once served as a medical adviser to former Liberian President . Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine . unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F. Kennedy Memorial . Medical Center in Monrovia. After . falling ill with Ebola, he was taken to a treatment center on the . outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an . assistant health minister. As . the death toll continues to rise in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, a . fourth African country was alerted over the weekend to their own case . of Ebola: the far more densely populated nation of Nigeria. Terrifying: A Liberian infected with Ebola terrified the highly-populated Nigerian capital of Lagos when he managed to fly there before becoming seriously ill by the time they landed and dying in the city, becoming the first Ebola death in Nigeria . The current outbreak of Ebola has spread to at least four countries in West Africa since the start of the year. So far, it has claimed 672 victims, and infected 1,093. Countries affected include Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. The disease spreads through contact with blood, body fluids or contact with tissue from infected people or animals. It has only a 10 percent survival rate. Civil servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20 after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his sister, who had also succumbed to the disease. His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country. Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said: ‘If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be cause for concern. ‘Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.’ Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers – but doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Symptoms include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280. Nigerian . health authorities raced to stop the spread of Ebola on Saturday after a . man sick with one of the world's deadliest diseases brought it by plane . to Lagos, Africa's largest city with 21 million people. The . fact that the traveler from Liberia could board an international flight . also raised new fears that other passengers could take the disease . beyond Africa due to weak inspection of passengers and the fact Ebola's . symptoms are similar to other diseases. Nigerian . officials say a Liberian man died of Ebola in a Lagos hospital Friday . after arriving in the country on Tuesday. It is the first case of Ebola . to be confirmed in Nigeria since the current outbreak began in West . Africa earlier this year. Nigerian . Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said all ports of entry in the country . are now on 'red alert' and health officials are investigating all . people who had contact with the deceased.","Nancy Writebol was working in Liberia for a charity when she caught the terrifying disease .

"Today show hosts Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer and Al Roker confessed to having had 'sexy dreams about their co-anchors' while playing a game 'Never Have I Ever' live on-air during this morning's show. Savannah, 43, looked particularly shame-faced as she held up her 'I have' sign in response to 57-year-old Matt's probing question, which was posed as part of the confessional party game. Ironically however, the mother-of-one was furious when Carson Daly, Willie Geist and Today show special correspondent Ryan Seacrest denied ever having had inappropriate dreams about their fellow hosts, saying: 'I'm actually offended at this, on behalf of every woman on this cast. Scroll down for video . Red-faced: Savannah Guthrie, 43, looked particularly embarrassed when she made her confession . Question time: Savannah, Matt Lauer and Al Roker all confessed to having had inappropriate dreams about their co-hosts during an on-air game of 'Never Have I Ever' 'Really, never?' 'Not yet,' Carson replied, grinning, before adding: 'Maybe tonight. If you keep yelling at me like that, maybe.' Moving on to his next question, Matt inquired as to whether any of the panelists had used their celebrity status in order to avoid being given a speeding ticket. Ryan, 40, Al, 60, and Matt all confessed to having flashed their famous faces in the hopes of avoiding a ticket, with Ryan revealing that he was actually driving close friend and X Factor judge Simon Cowell's car at the time. 'Strangely enough I happened to be driving Simon Cowell's car at the time, it's a longer story but... I have. 'I was borrowing it.' Outrage: The mother-of-one was furious at Carson Daly and Willie Geist after they revealed that they had never had a sexy dream about their female co-stars . Sharing is caring: Both Matt (L) and Al (R) were more than happy to admit that they have seen each other naked 'several times' Fun and games: The team all agreed to be 'completely honest' while playing the party game . Moving swiftly on, the questions returned to more crude subject matters, with Matt asking the panel: 'Never have I ever been drunk on the air?' The father-of-three grinned proudly while holding up his own 'I have' sign, before being joined by Willie and Carson, who declared: 'I love it, I love the honesty.' But the TV hosts declined the opportunity to share any further details about their past indiscretions, with Matt simply stating: 'It was a long night.' Clearly happy to move on to the fourth, and final, question of the game, Matt quickly asked: 'Never have I ever seen someone on this panel naked?' While the majority of the panel happily held up their 'I have never' signs, both Matt and Al confessed to having seen the other person naked, with Matt admitting he'd seen Al without his clothes on 'several times', while Al added: 'We weren't even at work!' The team's decision to play the embarrassing game live on-air came after they saw TV host Ellen DeGeneres challenge the cast of upcoming comedy movie Mortdecai to reveal some secrets about themselves during her show. Celebrity status: During the game, Ryan Seacrest (far right) admitted to having used his famous face in order to avoid getting a ticket . Inspiration: The Today show team decided to play the confessional game, after seeing Ellen DeGeneres and the cast of Mortdecai playing it on Ellen's show . Gwyneth Paltrow, Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany all embraced the game with great enthusiasm, with Johnny, 51, volunteering that he has had a romantic rendezvous aboard an airplane, and Gwyneth, 42, admitting that she's enjoyed a similar Mile High Club experience in her past. The self-styled lifestyle guru took the game one step further, also confessing that she has 'sexted' in the past as well. Ellen began by asking the trio: 'Never have I ever been to a nude beach?' While both Gwyneth and Ellen claimed that they hadn't, Johnny and Paul admitted that they had both doffed their clothes to stroll naked on the sand. Ellen's next question was even more interesting: 'All right, never have I ever been arrested?' Gwyneth immediately proffered her 'I have never' paddle, while Paul quickly put up 'I have'. Johnny took a few more minutes to consider, before also admitted that he had as the audience cheered in support.","The team decided to air their version of the party game after seeing TV host Ellen DeGeneres playing it with Gwyneth Paltrow and Johnny Depp .

"The United States has pulled . more staff out of its embassy in Yemen, U.S. officials said on . Thursday as Washington scrambled to cope with the collapse of a . government that had been a key ally in the fight against al . Qaeda. The scaling down of its presence in Yemen is the first sign . that the latest turmoil there will affect U.S operations in a . country that President Barack Obama hailed just four months ago . as a model for 'successful' counter-terrorism partnerships. The U.S. diplomatic contingent in Sanaa was drawn down due . to the deteriorating security situation in the Yemeni capital, . the officials said. They insisted there were no plans to close . the embassy, which could been seen as erosion of U.S. resolve in . counter-terrorism operations in the volatile Arab country. Going home: The State Department is reducing the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen following the government's collapse to Shi'ite rebels this week. The embassy in Sanaa pictured above in September 2008 . However, current and former U.S. officials say the chaos . engulfing Yemen has already threatened the administration's . strategy against a powerful local al Qaeda branch. Out of office: Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi resigned on Thursday, leading the U.S. to remove some staff at the embassy in Sanaa. Hadi pictured above at the United Nations in September 2012 . Word of the withdrawal of more U.S. personnel came on the . day that Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi stepped down, . throwing the country deeper into chaos days after Iran-backed . Houthi rebels battled their way into his presidential palace. The crisis marks another setback for U.S. Middle East policy . when Obama is already struggling with unsteady partners in a . campaign against Islamic State militants who have seized swathes . of Iraq and Syria. At the same time, Washington seeks to limit . Iranian influence in the region. The Obama administration was caught off guard by the . resignation of Hadi, who had backed American strikes against al . Qaeda militants. During Obama's six years in office, U.S. drones . have killed hundreds of militants but also dozens of civilians . in Yemen, which has stoked public anger in the country. 'We are still assessing the implications,' White House . spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One. The State Department had already reduced staff at the . embassy in recent months to essential personnel, mostly related . to security matters, as the fighters from the Shi'ite Houthi . minority seized control of the capital. 'While the Embassy remains open and is continuing to . operate, we may continue to re-align resources based on the . situation on the ground,' a senior State Department official . told Reuters. 'We will continue to operate as normal, albeit . with reduced staff.' U.S. officials had hoped that Hadi's announcement on . Wednesday that he was ready to make concessions to the Houthi . movement would calm the situation but that prospect fell apart . just a day later. New powerbrokers: Yemen's presidential palace was overtaken by rebel Houthi fighters this week, who represent the country's minority Islamic Shi'ite sect. Shi'ite-majoirty Iran is believed to be arming the Houthis. A group of Houthi fighters pictured above patrolling a street in Sanaa on January 21 . Washington is concerned that the chaos in Yemen could create . conditions that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) will . exploit to strengthen its base of support there and use the . country to plot attacks on Western interests. AQAP claimed . responsibility for deadly attacks in Paris early this month. The events in Yemen will 'absolutely' limit U.S. drone . strikes and counter-terrorism operations in the country in the . short-term, a former senior U.S. official said. The official . added that if the Houthis end up in full control of the . government they will demand a halt to the drone campaign. 'They hate al Qaeda,' said the official, referring to the . Houthis. 'But they also hate the United States.' Some U.S. officials believe that while the Houthis are . determined to wield more power in Yemen the movement may not . want to assume responsibility for actually governing the . divided, impoverished country. But overall the Obama administration appears to have few . contacts with the Houthis and remains concerned that their . emergence as the country's main powerbrokers will mean greater . influence for Shi'ite Iran in Yemen's affairs, a prospect that . also worries neighboring Sunni power Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials say Iran has backed the Houthi rebellion with . financial and political support and that shipments of Iranian . weapons have also been found destined for the group. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services . Committee and a frequent Obama critic, said events in Yemen . reflected misguided U.S. policy and called for a full evacuation . of the embassy there. Obama's earlier hailing of Yemen as a . counter-terrorism success, he added, showed the president 'is . either delusional or misinformed.' The crisis poses another major challenge to Obama's efforts . to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A U.S. official said Washington had no intention of . repatriating any of the nearly four dozen Yemeni detainees . already approved for transfer from the internationally condemned . jail while the security situation remains unstable in Yemen. Obama lifted an moratorium on sending Yemenis home nearly . two years ago and has no plans to reinstate it, the official . said. But he has yet to send a single Yemeni home from .

"A quarter of Britons are said to have some kind of fear of flying, from absolute terror to simply feeling uncomfortable on board a plane. Recent air accidents, from the AirAsia Flight QZ8501 crash on December 28 off the coast of Borneo, killing 162, to the twin Malaysia Airlines tragedies in 2014, which killed 537 in total, have done nothing to reassure nervous fliers. From discussion about the roles storms play in accidents to theories about turbulence and landing plane sin high winds, there is a lot of misinformation that can needlessly worry travellers. So Captain Dave Thomas, British Airways’ Head of Flight Technical and Training, has explained what really happens behind some of the most common myths involved in flying. 'Flying has always had a bit of mystique to it,' Thomas told MailOnline. 'A lot of these fears stem from a lack of knowledge.' Scroll down for video . Is the turbulence from storm cells actually dangerous? Not according to flight expert, Captain Dave Thomas . When bad weather hits, it's in the pilot's best interest to keep the plane on the ground and wait it out . MYTH 1: Whenever a pilot spots rough weather, the best option is to fly over the storm . While we often hear about pilots quickly manoeuvring up and out of a storm cell, it turns out that 'flying over the storm' isn't always an option. 'It really depends on the type of weather buildup you get,' Thomas explains. 'You can get storm clouds that continue on above 40,000 feet, so it may not be an option to go over those.' 'Without a doubt, storms are best avoided, so a pilot's first reaction will always be to fly over it - if possible - or fly around it.' Many theories about the AirAsia crash on December 28 involved the stormy weather the plane was experiencing off the coast of Borneo . MYTH 2: All thunderstorms are the same (and planes must fly over them) Not at all! 'In the UK, we experience very different storm systems than those near the Alps or over North or South America,' he says. 'Generally buildups in the UK are less severe.' 'Different areas and different airports have different characteristics, and often what causes turbulence low to the ground will be topographical features. 'If we're going to an area of the world that's more prone to large thunderstorms, we're aware of it and certainly looking for it. 'The other benefit you’ve got is that the air traffic controllers in those areas are very much used to the weather conditions,' he adds. 'It's common to them.' When a pilot does encounter a storm, take comfort in the fact that he or she's spent hours practicing for it . Another common misconception is that planes can be 'dragged down' by wind - but Thomas (left) disagrees . MYTH 3: Planes can be 'dragged down' by wind . While it may be common to read about a plane experiencing such phenomenon, there's far more to it. 'It's a vivid description, but what it really is is a changing of wind speeds and directions,' Thomas explains. 'That sort of terminology is used because of the feeling you get in your stomach, but think of it more like being on a ship in the ocean. 'It's just a change in wind conditions, whereas what you really want is a consistent wind.' Pilots are just as well-trained to handle weather-related issues as they are to handle mechanical issues . MYTH 4: Turbulence is dangerous . Patrick Smith, an active airline pilot and author, suggests that turbulence 'is far and away the number one concern of nervous flyers'. However, in his Ask The Pilot blog, Mr Smith says pilots consider incidents of rough air to be nothing more than 'a comfort and convenience issue, not a safety issue per se. Annoying, but not dangerous'. But there is unfortunate news for nervous flyers out there - turbulence actually comes in several forms - with some much easier to detect than others. You're not alone! Research shows that around 25 per cent of people have at least some fear of flying. But don't worry, British Airways also offers a Flying With Confidence course for all you nervous flyers out there. The one-day course runs throughout the year at Heathrow, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Glasgow, Dubai and New York airports. British Airways' pilots and cabin crew do a presentation in the morning, followed by a talk by a psychologist in the afternoon. The day concludes with nervous passengers taking a flight on a British Airways aircraft and applying their newly-acquired skills. More than 45,000 people have attended over the past 28 years - and the course has a 98 per cent success rate. For more information, click here. 'Storm turbulence and wind shear are the major weather-related factors, but there is another sort of turbulence that is regularly experienced called clear air turbulence, Thomas says. 'It's less easy to detect - in daylight, it's not visible - so we tend to employ different methods there. 'It's generally about forecasts, like the MET forecast predictions, and one of the first elements of training is to understand and interpret weather radars. 'There are also pilot reports,' he adds. 'Before a pilot goes flying, they'll look at a briefing pack and that will warn of any potential areas where they may encounter clear air turbulence. 'And then when you're flying, air traffic control becomes the means of letting you know if other aircraft in the area have experienced anything.' Captain Smith adds: 'During turbulence, the pilots are not fighting the controls. 'Planes are designed with what we call positive stability, meaning that when nudged from their original point in space, by their nature they wish to return there. 'The best way of handling rough air is to effectively ride it out, hands-off. (Some autopilots have a turbulence mode that desensitizes the system, to avoid over-controlling.) 'It can be uncomfortable, but the jet is not going to flip upside down.' Some airports require different approaches when a plane comes in for landing. Pictured here: London City . MYTH 5: Some airports are very dangerous for take-offs and landings . Different airports have different characteristics and so, can present different concerns - including tactics for approach and takeoff - but no airport should be problematic or any pilot that's been properly trained. 'Training is common across the board,' Thomas tells us. 'So, what you would do in the event of encountering anything is the same.' 'I started my British Airways flying career around the Highlands of Scotland, so I spent a lot of time in fairly windy conditions up there, which is quite a regular occurrence. 'Aberdeen has a big hill just off to the west of the airport and sometimes you get wind off of that that can make the approach quite bumpy. 'We have training that's specific to the airfield that pilots go to and we have a manual that all pilots have that they can consult. 'If I was going to Aberdeen, tomorrow, for example, and not familiar, we have training material that explains quite a lot of details, including what the wind conditions are like and if you're more likely to experience turbulence in one particular approach to one particular runway.' 'We spend a lot of time training our pilots - not just in skill, but there's also a huge amount of knowledge, which equally applies to weather-related issues as it does to things like mechanical engineering issues.'","British Airways' Head of Flight Technical and Training answers all FAQ .

The notebook contains Turing's complex mathematical and computer science notations. It is believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript known to exist, the auctioneer said. It dates from 1942, when Turing was trying to break the seemingly unbreakable code with his team of cryptanalysts at Britain's World War II code and cypher school Bletchley Park. In one entry Turing writes about a complex calculus notation. 'The Leibniz notation I find extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once! It certainly implies that some relation between x and y has been laid down eg, y=x2+3x ...' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. The notebook dates from 1942, when Turing was trying to break the seemingly unbreakable code with his team of cryptanalysts at Britain's World War II code and cypher school Bletchley Park . Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing' remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' The Imitation Game, which also stars Keira Knightley, is based on Hodges' book Alan Turing: The Enigma. Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to 'cure' his homosexuality. Bonhams said the seller wished to remain anonymous. Part of the proceeds will be donated to charity. The notebook includes Turing's notes about complex calculus notation and was left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy .

"They might have recently announced the end of their relationship but that hasn't prevented Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton from remaining close friends. Just this week the pair, who famously never married, were spotted out and about in London enjoying a day out with their two children, Billy and Nell. The former couple were seen chatting amicably, looking completely happy in each other's company as they walked through the city's streets. Scroll down for video . Still friends: Helena and Tim were seen strolling through the streets of London earlier this week . But they're not the only ones who have managed to keep a friendship alive despite the painful end of a long term relationship. Indeed, Helena and Tim are simply the latest in a long line of celebrity couples who, despite splitting up, have remained friends. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin are still on good terms, despite consciously uncoupling, while David Arquette and Courtney Cox still spend plenty of time together. So how do they pull it off? Relationship experts say that celebrities find it easier because they aren't under the same pressure as the rest of us, although that is by no means the whole story. 'The financial element is a part of why some celebrity couples can remain friends. They have less pressure in terms of childcare, money and housing,' comments dating expert Laura Yates. High five: Tim high fives his son Billy as the family walk through North West London . 'When it comes to finances, this is often where arguments and animosity can occur when couples split up. 'A-list couples don't really have these financial challenges to contend with so that part of the process can be handled more easily.' Another part of the equation is the desire to avoid unwanted media attention created by an acrimonious break-up. 'If there are children involved, they'll likely want to protect them from this,' adds Yates. 'When you're in the public eye and your split and feuds are all over the papers, it can be tough to handle.' HELENA BONHAM-CARTER AND TIM BURTON . Actress Helena and director Tim announced their split just before Christmas but revealed that they had actually been separated for some time. A spokesperson for the pair said they had 'separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children.' The couple had famously lived in two separate houses next door to one another with Helena telling the Guardian in 2010: 'It really is a great idea. 'You never have to compromise emotionally or feel invaded. He always visits, which is really touching. He's always coming over.' The pair - who met when director Tim worked with Helena on the Planet of the Apes in 2001 - were seen earlier this week enjoying a day out with their children in London. There for Flynn: Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom continue to spend time with son Flynn as a family . MIRANDA KERR AND ORLANDO BLOOM . Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr and actor Orlando Bloom announced their split in October 2013 but they've since been seen together several times since and remain good friends. The main reason for their continuing closeness is their son Flynn, four, with whom the former couple are regularly seen pounding the pavements in New York. Speaking after their relationship ended, the model told Harper's Bazaar: 'We're really close, we're going to be a family forever and we both really do love each other. 'We have genuine love and respect for each other. We're very connected and I feel grateful for that. 'We created something beautiful together and we both remind ourselves how lucky we are to have that. And yeah, it's good. He's a great dad. I'm lucky.' So close are the divorcees, not even Orlando's infamous dust-up with Justin Bieber this summer, which sparked rumours of an affair between the popstar and Miranda, has kept them apart.

Reese and Ryan were one of America's cutest couples until they split in 2007 after seven years of marriage and two children: Ava and Deacon. Ryan has said he believes he and Reese, 'have done a really good job at keeping things peaceable and completely focused on,' their children. Reese, meanwhile, has admitted that they were perhaps too young to have been so committed: 'I was so, so young. I was, like, ridiculously young. 'I learnt a lot, though. It was an excellent opportunity for me to really find out what it means to be a partner and to be in a marriage and it’s not anything that I thought it was.' If you want to stay friends with your ex, relationship expert and author of The Dating Game Jo Hemmings says there are several things to consider. Top of the list is your feelings for them but you also need to consider why you want to be friends and whether you can handle not having sex with them. Here are her top tips... 1. Consideration for each others' feelings during the break-up is one of the most important things you can do to try and stay friends afterwards. A relationship that ends in recriminations and hostility is far less likely to succeed friendship-wise post splitting up. 2. Don't think about having sex with your ex. However close you may have become since your relationship ended, this is likely to complicate things. 3. Allow your ex-partner to be angry for a while, especially if you were the one to initiate the break. It's a necessary and healthy part of getting through the process. 4. Give each other space. Breaking up and still hanging out together all the time and seeing mutual friends as if you were still a couple may give your ex-partner false hope of a reconciliation. 5. However hurt you feel, don't be tempted to place all the blame for the split on your partner. A little soul-searching and letting yourself shoulder some of the responsibility, however difficult that seems at first, is important for both of you to be able to move on as friends.

Actress Halle and model Gabriel, who are parents to a daughter named Nahla, were at the centre of one of the most acrimonious splits in celebrity history in 2010. After the pair, who dated for five years, broke up Halle moved on, eventually marrying French actor, Olivier Martinez. But when the new couple tried to move to his native France things turned nasty. Gabriel blocked the move and ended up in a nasty punch up with Olivier. Not such good friends: Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen, Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubrey and Kati Holmes and Tom Cruise failed to stay friends when they split . Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen . Actress Denise's divorce from a then drug addicted Sheen was particularly nasty. The pair, who have two children together, broke up in 2005 amid rumours of his breakdown. Things took a turn for the worse when Charlie branded Denise: 'A sad, jobless pig who is sad and talentless and sad and jobless and evil and a bad mom.' In response, she obtained a restraining order preventing him from coming near her, her home and car, and their two daughters, except during supervised visits. Happily for the girls, the pair have since patched things up. Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise . When Katie Holmes announced she was to divorce Tom Cruise in 2012 after six years of marriage it came as no surprise. It was widely thought that the pair had clashed over Tom's involvement in the controversial religion, Scientology - something the actor later confirmed. The pair have not been seen together since with Katie taking full custody of their daughter Suri, now eight.","Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton have remained close friends .

"As well as fame and fortune, Harry Styles, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Ryan Gosling all have something else in common; they're among the most lusted-after celebrities in the world. But imagine if Harry hadn't landed a place in One Direction, Cheryl had been booted off Popstars The Rivals and Ryan hadn't secured a spot in The Mickey Mouse Club, what would they be doing - and look like - now? A group of visual artists have mocked up images of some of the globe's most famous and good-looking stars to see what they'd  look like if they hadn't found fame - and the team of hair stylists, make-up artists, plastic surgeons and fashion consultants that come with the package. One group of visual artists have mocked up images of some of the globe's most famous stars, including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, and what they imagine they'd look like if they hadn't found fame and stylists . The design team created some concept images using existing pictures of a selection of Hollywood celebrities showing what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world. Writing on their blog, the team at VoucherCodesPro.co.uk write: 'Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of fashion and beauty help at your fingertips? 'No wonder the A-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the Hollywood elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red carpet. 'This got us thinking, what would some of the biggest celebrities look like if they hadn’t become famous? Would they even still look recognisable without the teams of hair stylists, make-up artists, plastic surgeons and fashion consultants?'. Harry Styles looks nothing like the luscious-locked teen heartthrob the globe's women lust over . Ryan Gosling has been treated to a makeunder and is a far cry from the heartthrob we know and love . Cheryl, 31, is barely recognisable without her glossy hair, picture-perfect make-up and dazzling veneers. The style she sports in her mocked up image isn't too dissimilar from how she dressed when she first found fame as a teenager from Newcastle with Girls Aloud. Wearing a hot pink jacket, gold hooped earrings and slicked back hair, Cheryl's look is a far cry from the glamorous high-end style she's made her own on this year's X Factor. Harry Styles, meanwhile, looks nothing like the luscious-locked teen heartthrob the globe's women lust over. With his unkempt hair, acne and bushy stubble, Harry probably wouldn't get a second look in the street. With her wild hair and fresh-faced look, Katie Price is a far cry from her glamorous self, right . Ed Sheeran has remained very down-to-earth since finding fame, which is reflected in his mocked up image . Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Gosling, who stole the hearts of the world's women thanks to his turn in The Notebook, has also been treated to a makeunder. With slightly ginger hair, sweaty, gaunt skin and a wife beater on, Ryan looks nothing like hopeless romantic Noah Calhoun from the hit movie. Laidback Ed Sheeran, who seems fairly aloof about his appearance (unlike his friend Harry Styles), doesn't look that different from the way he looks in real life. In her image, Katie Price, who is currently starring on Celebrity Big Brother, has wild curly locks and a far more natural look to the one that's propelled her to fame. The same team also famously gave Kim Kardashian a makeunder. With her dark rimmed spectacles, blotchy skin and bushy brows, the star is virtually unrecognisable. The design last year gave Kim Kardashian the 'unfamous makeunder' - and the results are startling . Rihanna looks fresh-faced and innocent in the design team's 'non famous' version of the singe . Sharon Osbourne, who has admitted to having plastic surgery, looks much older with her grey hair and winkles . The design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his perfect teeth .","A-list stars treated to makeunder by design team .

"A fatal police shooting was captured on an Oklahoma officer's bodycam and reveals the stark split second decision he made. Muskogee police officer Chansey McMillin killed Terence D. Walker on Saturday when the 21-year-old ran away after being confronted outside a wedding. Officer McMillin gave chase after Walker bolted when frisked outside the church and fired five times as Walker turned to face him momentarily - armed with a gun, according to McMillin. Scroll Down for Video . Show me your hands: Officer McMillin approaches Terence Walker outside the Old Agency Baptist Church on Saturday . Flash point: Walker breaks free from Officer McMillin in a flash and begins to flee the parking lot after being frisked . Fatal decision: Walker appears to drop something while running and without really breaking stride bends to pick it up - but faces Officer McMillin while he does so . Gunfire: Officer McMillin shoots at Walker five times and strikes him three times in the neck and the abdomen and kills him. The 21-year-old then falls into the ditch to his right . The shocking incident took only one minute to unfold from the time that McMillin arrived at the Old Agency Baptist Church to its fatal conclusion. Repeat: Saturday's incident was the second time in six months that Officer McMillin has shot a member of the public while in the line of duty . McMillin had responded to a call that Walker had threatened an ex-girlfriend during the day allegedly telling her he 'had a bullet with her name on it'. The bodycam shows that McMillin walks towards Walker in the parking lot and asks him to produce both his hands, which Walker does. Officer McMillin then puts Walker's hands behind his body and begins to frisk him, asking him if there is anything he should be worried about. McMillin also asks Walker why he is shaking and then suddenly, Walker breaks free and flees. Giving chase, McMillin is heard to immediately shout, 'Drop the gun, I am running', and then the camera shows Walker lose his balance and appear to drop something. He stoops while still moving to pick it up and seems to face McMillin for a split second. At that point the officer fires his weapon five times and Walker falls to the ground. According to Tulsa World, even in slow motion speed it is unclear if Walker ever really faces the officer, or if he was merely checking to see where he was. Regardless, Walker was struck three times and fell into a ditch on the side of the road. By this point, only one minute and seven seconds have expired on the bodycam after McMillin exited his car to approach Walker. Pleas: The pastor of the Old Agency Baptist Church rushes to beg Officer McMillin to allow him to check on the body. McMillin refuses . 'I was in a bad spot,' McMillin told a backup officer who arrived four minutes and forty seconds into the video. Since the shooting, Sgt. Mike Mahan has told Tulsa World that McMillin feared for the safety of civilians behind him and traffic if Walker fired on the run. In the harrowing aftermath of the shooting, it is already clear that Walker has been killed and the church's pastor rushes up to McMillin to ask him if he can check on the 21-year-old. McMillin refuses to allow him to do this and when his backup arrives, which numbers at least 10 other officers, one of them retrieves what he says is a loaded gun from Walker's awkwardly crumpled body. In the confused minutes after the shooting, the same pastor arrives to tell McMillan's colleagues the officer had 'followed procedures and he did everything right'. Fatal: The mangled and crumpled body of Walker is examined by officers for a weapon. They eventually find one . McMillin then approaches the trunk of a squad car and rests his head on it, clearly shaken while a colleague pats him on the back and consoles him. 'Why'd he have to do that?' McMillan is heard to ask. According to Sgt. Mahan, 'A female witness said that he had tried to hand her a gun, but she wouldn't take it. When officers began to pat Walker down, they felt the gun, and he started to run away.' McMillan is told that he needs to go back to the station, presumably to complete a debriefing and asks when he can turn the camera off. An ambulance arrives on the scene almost nine minutes after the incident began and eight minutes after Walker was shot. Response: As Officer McMillin is driven away from the scene an ambulance arrives - almost eight minutes after Walker was shot . The first officer on the scene other than McMillin arrived one minute and 19 seconds after Walker was shot. McMillin is one of 60 Muskogee Police officers using bodycams as their use across the country increases following the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August. The shooting came two days before Martin Luther King Jr. Day and McMillin is currently on paid administrative leave. It has emerged that this is the second shooting he has been involved with in the space of six months. In July, McMillin was cleared when he opened fire on a man who had attacked another with a knife and had begun to stab himself. When the man moved on McMillin he opened fire. The man survived and Muskogee Police Chief Rex Eskridge said that his officer should be commended for his non-lethal use of force.","Officer Chansey McMillin shot dead Terence Walker on Saturday .

Parts of the country will bask in a balmy 9C but not before icy showers sweep in from Scotland across central and south-east England this evening with lows of -1C. The milder weather towards the second half of the weekend will bring an end to a bitterly cold week, where temperatures plummeted as low as -13C and large parts saw a layer of snow. Freezing: Frost covers the countryside near Malmesbury in Wiltshire this morning as Britain woke up to one of the coldest days this winter .

"A greater number of people exposed to the Ebola virus than the four publicly identified patients have been evacuated to the United States. Dent Thompson, vice president of Phoenix Air Group, a private company contracted by the State Department to transport the patients back to the U.S. says many more people who had an 'exposure event' have been flown from West Africa by his company. Dr Kent Brantly, a medical missionary to Liberia, was the first Ebola patient returned to the U.S. for treatment, followed by Nancy Writebol, also a missionary, Dr Rick Sacra who is currently being treated in Nebraska and a fourth, as yet unidentified doctor.

President Barack Obama is pledging more U.S. assistance to help contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The White House says the president made the pledge in a telephone conversation Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Obama has said previously that the deadly outbreak is a U.S. national security priority and that the American military will help set up isolation units and equipment in West Africa and provide security for public health workers. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has also pledged $50 million, on top of $10 million it has already committed, to support the emergency response to the outbreak in West Africa.

"A newlywed who gushed about her marriage on Facebook has been charged with murdering her husband a week after shooting him seven times. Ashley Hunter, 27, is now on suicide watch in jail in Warren County, Missouri after apparently jumping out of a car and running in front of an ambulance as she made her way to the jail. On January 15, she called 911 just before 8pm and when sheriff's deputies arrived at her home in St Louis, they found her husband, 29-year-old Nicholas Hunter, dead on their living room floor. He had been shot seven times, police said. Killed: Nicholas Hunter, pictured left just over a week before his death, was found dead in his home in St Louis on January 15. After a week-long investigation, his wife Ashley, right, has been charged with his murder . Mrs Hunter told deputies she and her husband had got into a physical altercation so she shot him, while two children, ages five and seven, were at the home. The children are now in the care of a relatives and Mrs Hunter was taken to hospital for evaluation. She was then taken to the Warren County jail on Friday but was released later that day pending the outcome of the investigation. But after further investigations, police said that evidence gathered at the scene and in an autopsy contradicted her story, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Court documents say the couple had been arguing before she went upstairs, retrieved a gun and then shot him in the chest. No further details were made available. His death came just 11 days after she gushed about her husband on Facebook. The couple married less than a year ago, Sheriff Kevin Harrison told the Warren County Record.

'Our love grows more and more everyday. We have our own fairytale and a marriage built around God. I love this man!!' On Thursday, she was charged with first-degree murder and criminal action, and her bail was set at $1 million. She was being driven to the jail to answer to the charges when the car pulled over near the scene of a car crash on I-70, the Warren County Record reported. Mrs Hunter jumped out of the car and ran in front of an ambulance, according to police. She was not seriously injured but was taken to hospital. She is now at the Warren County Jail. Her husband's obituary says he was the father to a seven-year-old girl and three-year-old boy, and he was a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

"Fort Hood did not have a system in place that could have anticipated a deadly rampage last April that left four soldiers dead and 16 wounded, according to a U.S. Army report released Friday. There were no clear warnings that Spc. Ivan Lopez would go on a two-block shooting spree before killing himself on April 2, the report released Friday concluded. It also said Lopez's supervisors would have had difficulty recognizing any personal problems leading up to the attack. Problems undetected: An Army report found Ivan Lopez was suffering from PTSD but supervisors did not deem him 'likely' to commit violence . The report also found that no single factor prompted the incident, despite Army investigators' previous findings that Lopez had been in an argument after being denied leave. Investigators have said the 34-year-old Iraq War veteran was undergoing treatment for depression and anxiety while being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, but was not considered 'likely' to commit violence. He had recently lost two family members, faced financial difficulties and was denied leave to travel to his native Puerto Rico, investigators noted in April. Rampage: Lopez killed four people and injured 16 in a mass shooting last April at Fort Hood . Risk assessment at Fort Hood relies on self-reporting, the report said, adding that that Lopez could sometimes be 'misleading or deceptive.' Recommendations in the report included exploring whether soldiers should register privately owned weapons with their commanders. The Army previously said it was logistically impossible to stop and search all 80,000 people who work on the sprawling base every day.","Spc Ivan Lopez killed four people and injured 16 in shooting last April .

"Usually burglars like to work quickly and in darkness to prevent them from being caught red-handed. However, a pair of cheeky crooks took a far more relaxed  approach when breaking into a residency in China. They plonked themselves on the sofa and flicked on the homeowner's TV, helping themselves to delicious snacks while they were at it. Unfortunately for these foolish home invaders, they were immediately arrested after being spotted on a remote surveillance camera. The man of the house, 32-year-old Chung Chang, was at work when he randomly decided to check his security gear on account of a 'sixth-sense'. He watched absolutely stunned as two men casually wandered around his living room in the city of Linyi in eastern China's Shandong province, enjoying all the facilities on offer. The nerve of them! A pair of burglars sat on the sofa to snack and watch TV while invading a residency in China . 'When I saw these two men in my flat I was very confused,' Chung says. 'At first I thought they might be friends of my son, but when I called him he said he wasn't at home. 'My wife was away on a business trip so I knew they weren't her friends. 'Then I saw them putting on white gloves and looking through my things and I realised they were burglars. 'And they had the cheek to watch my TV and eat my crisps too!' Chung then called the police who went straight to the block of flats and knocked on the door. 'Sixth sense' - Fortunately the flat owner decided to check his security cam from work and spotted the intruders wandering around his living room . A police spokesman said: 'When officers arrived the men inside were clearly very surprised. 'We heard lots of swearing coming from the other side of the door and then it went quiet. 'The two men were found hiding under the owner's bed after police and club wielding security guards went inside. 'At first they said the flat was theirs, but when we asked them why they had been under the bed they realised the game was up and confessed.' The convicts, who had previously shared a jail cell and had only just been released, now face up to five years. Busted! The police were immediately called and the men were found hiding in the bedroom before they were taken away in handcuffs .","Chinese worker checks home security camera and sees flat being burgled by two men .

"Widow Randi Lane, 69, was fleeced out of £20,000 of her life savings by a string of mail scams . A grandmother told how she was fleeced out of £20,000 of her life savings by a string of mail scams. Widow Randi Lane's name was found on a 'sucker list' used by fraudsters after a raid on a distribution house from where the letters are sent. But before the discovery she had lost tens of thousands of pounds replying to scam letters from lotteries and so-called clairvoyants. The trusting grandmother-of-two said she feels like she has been taken for a fool by the 'terrible' scammers who have deliberately targeted her with up to 20 letters a day. The former nanny, 69, said: 'I must have spent thousands of pounds - it was money I was saving for holidays and for my grandchildren. 'I would have loved to travel or go on a cruise - but because of these scammers I haven't been able to do any of that. 'The letters are so cleverly worded and addressed directly to you. They are so believable. 'They obviously think I am an easy target and used that to their advantage, and then they tell others and they send letters too. 'I have always thought of myself as a business minded person, as I have worked all of my life, and I have never thought of myself as stupid but I must have been to fall for it.' Mrs Lane - who moved to England from Norway almost 50 years ago - began receiving the abundance of mail when she moved into her current home St Annes, Lancashire, in 2006. And over the nine years since she has forked out as much as £20,000 - paying between £20 and £40 a time to supposed mediums and lottery schemes promising prizes of millions of pounds. Mrs Lane's was one of dozens of names found on a 'suckers list' when the National Scam Hub raided a distribution house from where scam mail would be sent. Trading Standards bosses said the case was an example of con artists using cleverly-worded letters to groom people into handing over their hard-earned cash. The widow, whose name was found on a suckers list, receives up to 20 scam letters each day . A spokesperson from Trading Standards said: 'Mrs Lane was highlighted to us as being on what they call a 'sucker list'. 'Unfortunately, particularly with elderly, vulnerable people they can be taken in and it can open up the flood gates. 'These people are effectively groomed. A more sinister development is a clairvoyant saying they can see a big money win. Surprise, surprise, the victim then gets a letter from the lottery. 'And they personalise letters using their first names - it's a very vindictive way of earning a living.' The 69-year-old used to reply to every letter she received but after being contacted by Trading Standards she has stopped this . But despite stopping replying to the letters last year, the grandmother still gets up to half a dozen letters every day as well as several phone calls. She said: 'These people normally target people who are elderly or alone or don't get out much. They take advantage of vulnerable people - it is terrible. 'But if I can stop just one person from doing what I have done, and stop more people from being hoodwinked, I am willing to share my story.'","Widow Randi Lane has been fleeced out of £20,000 by mail scammers .

"He lived a life of solitude on the streets for more than ten years. Now, five months after the homeless man known only as Andy died, police have shared pictures of his faded tattoos in a last ditch attempt at identifying him. Detectives are pleading for anyone related to the ‘gentle giant’, who spent a decade living by a riverside bench in Pyrmont in Sydney’s inner west, to come forward so that he can receive a proper burial. In the photos released by Sydney City police, a tattoo of a viking is shown on his right shoulder. On his left shoulder a demon sits with the words ‘death to the world’ and ‘search and destroy’. Another blurry inking on his fingers spells out the word ‘hate’. In the photos released by Sydney City police, a tattoo of a Viking is shown on Andy's right shoulder . This was Andy's favourite spot - Jacksons Landing, the northern tip of Pyrmont which is in Sydney's inner-city suburb . Crime manager with Sydney City LAC, John Maricic told Daily Mail Australia that police have not received any new information about Andy so far. Officers are not even certain that his real name is Andy. A month after Andy, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, died from a heart attack on August 28 nearly 200 locals paid their respects at his memorial service. The man of few words slept in front of Raine and Horne's real estate agency in Pyrmont but spent his days on a bench in Jacksons Landing - the northern tip of the inner-city surburb - overlooking Sydney Harbour. On Andy's left shoulder a demon sits with the words ‘death to the world’ The 'gentle giant' also had the words ‘search and destroy’ tattooed on his left shoulder . The community felt a sense of loss when Andy died from a suspected heart attack about a month ago . Principal of Raine and Horne Pyrmont, John Ellis, helped fund the service which was held near Andy's bench. 'It was the obvious thing to do - he's human too,' Mr Ellis told Daily Mail Australia. 'He didn't bother the staff at all because he was polite and very respectful. He didn't ask for anything and didn't say much. 'He was a homeless person but he didn't act like one. He never drank, never smoked and just liked to keep to himself and draw in his notepad. He was a gentle giant. 'He didn't make much eye contact and he was quite shy.' After he died locals announced plans to place a plaque at his bench in his honour while a basket hung from a nearby tree where residents have left behind their tributes. They include children's drawings of Andy enjoying the views of the harbour from his bench. Mr Ellis said Andy had been sleeping outside the Raine and Horne office for about seven years while other locals speculated that he'd lived in the area for more than a decade. Reverend Robin Davies, of Mustard Seed Uniting Church in Ultimo, said there was a huge sense of loss in the community when Andy died. Children left their drawings of Andy at the very place he spent most of his days - his bench overlooking Sydney Harbour . A shadow painted on the bench by residents so they can remember where Andy used to sit every day . A memorial service, also organised by residents, was held near Andy's bench in September . 'There was a great outpouring of grief for Andy because he was part of our community,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'So the memorial service was an opportunity for the locals to express their thoughts. 'I guess some people even felt guilty because he was so young.' Reverend Davies said it is believed that Andy was from Queensland. 'But some people reckon he's lived in the area for 15 years,' she said. 'He seemed to feel at home and quite secure here. He was just quite happy with what he had and people respected and admired him for that. The community accepted him just as he was.' Andy's body remains at a morgue, waiting to be claimed by a relative. If nobody comes forward, Reverend Davies said the community is willing to cremate him and scatter his ashes into the water in front of his favourite bench. But Crime Manager Maricic told the Daily Telegraph that decision on how Andy would be buried will be decided by the coroner if no family members come forward. ‘If nothing further comes to light once the coroner makes his findings he will then determine what course of action will take place in terms of a destitute burial,’ he said. Nearly 200 locals paid their respects to the homeless man, who's identity remains a mystery but is believed to be from Queensland . Some say Andy, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, lived in the area for more than a decade .

"Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox has been banned from the roads for a year after admitting drink-driving. The 81-year-old, who plays Rita Tanner in the ITV soap, entered a guilty plea at Crewe Magistrates' Court today. Knox was sitting in the passenger seat when her daughter, Maxine Ashcroft, 56, was stopped by police in Knutsford, Cheshire, on March 10 last year. Police arrested Ashcroft, and when Knox drove to the police station to collect her, she was arrested for the same offence. Barbara Knox, 81 (left), was arrested for drink driving in Cheshire last year after going to a police station to collect daughter Maxine Ashcroft, 56 (right), who had been arrested for the same offence an hour earlier . A sample of blood was taken which gave an alcohol reading of 85 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood - the legal limit is 80. The actress, represented by solicitor Nick 'Mr Loophole' Freeman, had previously denied the offence last April and was due to go on trial next month. It was said on her behalf today that she 'bitterly regrets' the incident. Knox, of Mere, Cheshire, was a passenger in Jaguar driven by daughter Maxine Ashcroft, 56, last year as pair were heading home from family gathering in Alderly Edge, Greater Manchester. Police were called by a concerned fellow driver, and Ashcroft was arrested for drink driving. Ashcroft was found to be nearly three times the legal limit when she gave a breathalyser reading at Middlewich police station. Knox was given a lift home buy officers who noticed that she had also been drinking, but later came to collect her daughter from the station. When she arrived, police gave her 'stern advice' not to climb back into her car, but she was seen moments later reversing out of a parking space in a nearby supermarket. Knox was a passenger in daughter Maxine Ashcroft's car when the pair were stopped in Cheshire. Ashcroft was arrested for drink driving, and when Knox went to collect her, she was arrested for the same offence . Knox, who plays Rita Tanner on the soap, has been banned from driving for a year and fined at total of £4,750 after admitting drink driving on March 10 last year . She only made it a short distance before police stopped her and also arrested her for drink driving. At a previous hearing last year, it was said by Mr Freeman that Knox claimed she was “physically manhandled” by officers before she was charged. She was said to be in “a highly emotionally charged state” when she was taken into custody. Last year, as Knox continued to maintain her innocence, District Judge Bridget Knight told the court: 'This is actually a very simple case being made very complicated and expensive.' In relation to the 'manhandling' claim, she added: 'It’s all by the by ... I’m not here for tittle tattle, it may be of interest to some but it’s not relevant to the case.' Today, after Knox relented, her lawyer  said the actress was 'the author of her own misfortune'. As well as being banned from driving for a year, Knox was ordered to pay a £3,000 fine, and £1,750 in court costs. Ashcroft, from Lechlade, Gloucestershire, also pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned from driving for two years. A spokesman for the soap said it was 'a private and personal matter'. The news comes just four days after fellow Coronation Street actress Anne Kirkbridge passed away after battling breast cancer. Knox was pictured with fellow stars William Roache and Anthony Cotton sitting in the front row of the National Television Awards two days ago. Mr Roache paid an emotional tribute to his 'soulmate' Anne at the awards, moving his fellow stars, including Knox, to tears. Knox sits between fellow  actors William Roache (left) and Anthony Cotton (right) at the NTA awards, which took place just two days after Anne Kirkbridge - who played Deidre Barlow - passed away .","Barbara Knox, 81, who plays Rita Tanner, banned from roads for a year .

"A high-powered real-estate mogul who owns numerous properties in Brooklyn, leased a house in Philadelphia to his mistress in exchange for sex, claims his wife in an explosive new lawsuit. Grace Chang Venner claims husband Stuart Venner had originally put her name on the 40-year lease for the three-storey rowhouse, but changed it last January to that of his mistress Panadda Pratomtang . The agreement allows her to live in the house for $1 per month until the year 2053 'in return for her providing prostitution services to Board Member, (Stuart) Venner,' the lawsuit alleges. Grace Chang Venner claims husband Stuart Venner leased out this three-storey house in Philadelphia to his mistress Panadda Pratomtang in exchange for sex . Pratomtang first had a lease agreement for a year beginning in August 2012 - just after Venner bought the property for $900,000, reports the Philadelphia Daily News. But in January 2014, the agreement was amended to the highly unusual 40-year lease. Grace Chang Venner only found out after she was added last March as a manager of 421 Pine LLC, the real-estate business created by her husband for the Society Hill rowhouse, according to the suit. 'The lease agreement is not based on actual consideration, but rather on sex for rent,' the lawsuit says. 'This is prostitution pursuant to Pennsylvania law and an illegal contract.' Stuart Venner, who was pictured on New York Social Diary attending a formal dinner at the luxury Doubles club in the Sherry Netherland, New York, with his wife in 2013, told the Daily News he was unaware of the lawsuit and called the allegations 'ridiculous.' Stuart Venner said he was unaware of the lawsuit and called the allegations 'ridiculous.' Above, Venner is pictured (far right) with his wife (center) and another guest at an event at a luxury New York club in 2013 . The lawsuit asks that the lease agreement be to voided, stating that Pratomtang committed fraud when she 'knowingly concealed the true nature of her agreement with Stuart Venner... when she knew or should have known that [her] conduct was illegal and would have materially altered the lease, rendering it illegal.' The suit also seeks attorney's fees and punitive damages for the wife.","Grace Chang Venner claims husband leased out a three-storey house in Philadelphia to his mistress Panadda Pratomtang in exchange for sex .

"He may have been blind for 20 years, but a pair of electronic glasses has enabled a US veteran to see again. Mark Cornell shed a tear when he saw faces clearly, describing the experience as 'eye-opening' and poignantly telling his friend Yvonne that she was 'pretty'. The  Buffalo-born veteran, who served in the US Air Force for 18 years before he lost his sight, is the President of the US Blinded Veterans Association. Scroll down for video . Buffalo-born veteran Mark Cornell (pictured) was able to see clearly for the first time in 20 years, using electronic glasses by eSight, which beam video images into the eyes . Cornell lost much of his sight as the result of a rare reaction to Lyme’s Disease caused by a tick bite that went unnoticed. He was left with very blurry vision and is unable to see details, but after putting on a pair of eSight smart spectacles, could see his friend’s faces clearly. The technology consists of a headset, hidden prescription lens frame and a hand-held controller. The headset includes a live camera that sends a video stream to the controller. The technology consists of a prescription lens frame and headset (pictured), which includes a camera to beam a live video screen to a hand-held controller, where the images are enhanced and sent back to the headset, and can be seen by a wearer on two LED screens . The former combat aerial photographer and audio visual production specialist shed a tear at getting his sight back (pictured), telling his friend Tom, who he has known for years without seeing what he looks like, that he’s a ‘good looking guy’ The eSight glasses are designed for legally blind people with some low vision. The technology consists of a headset, hidden prescription lens frame and a hand-held controller. The headset includes a live camera that sends a video stream to the controller. Using algorithms and selected settings such as colour and contrast, the controller customises the video in order to make images easier for people with low vision to see. The enhanced video signal is then transmitted back to the headset and displayed on LED screens in front of the wearer's eyes. The controller can be used to zoom in on details up to 14 times their original size, which means that wearers can see a far-away object such as a clock on a wall, or read a newspaper up close. The contrast control makes a room seem darker or lighter, to make it easier for people to distinguish objects from their surroundings.

But tea and coffee is not restricted, according to The Moscow Times. The restrictions came into effect on January 1. An overview of the law on the regional legislative assembly's website states stores will have to ask for identification when selling certain soft drinks to young people. In addition to the outright ban on sales of carbonated caffeine drinks to minors, the law also prohibits their sale in 'children's, educational and medical institutions, as well as cultural and sports centers.' Yevgeny Korotkov, chair of the parliament's committee on economic policy and property, said the ban has been put in place to protect the health of minors. He said: 'We received an expert opinion on the effects of these drinks on the body of children and adolescents, and they have a very negative impact.'

"A mysterious white spot glowing on the surface of Ceres has baffled scientists, who are closing in on the dwarf planet. The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images of the icy world as the Dawn probe prepares itself for a rendezvous on March 6. While Nasa has not provided an explanation, scientists suggest it may be a frozen pool of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflects light. Scroll down for video . The 'alien' mark can be clearly seen in the latest images the icy world as the Dawn probe hurtles its way towards a rendezvous on March 6 . 'We can confirm that it is something on Ceres that reflects more sunlight, but what that is remains a mystery,' Marc Rayman, mission director and chief engineer for the Dawn mission, told Space.com . Over the next weeks, Dawn will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world, leading up to the spacecraft's capture into orbit around Ceres. 'We know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet Ceres. Now, Dawn is ready to change that,' Rayman added. This most recent images from Dawn showing the white blotch were taken January 13 at a distance of 238,000 miles (383,000 km). While these latest images from Dawn aren’t quite as sharp as Hubble’s images from January 2004, Nasa says they will be very soon, and could help resolve the mystery. As the Dawn spacecraft closes in on Ceres, new images have emerged showing the solar system's largest asteroid at 27 pixels across - three times better than the images taken in early December. This GIF shows bright and dark features . This is a raw image, taken January 13, 2015. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second . On the left is a processed image, taken January 13. It hints at craters on the surface of Ceres. Dawn's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles (383,000km) from Ceres. On the right, is a zoomed-in raw image . The dwarf planet is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' said  Rayman. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.' The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. The image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before Dawn's arrival. On December 1, Ceres was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration . Dawn has orbited one member of the main asteroid belt, Vesta, and is now heading to explore a second new world, dwarf planet Ceres .","Alien mark can be clearly seen in the latest images Ceres as the Dawn probe prepares to enter its orbit .

It has taken 4,100 Chinese workers to build the resort. The government hopes that Baha Mar will turn the Bahamas into a world-class gaming destination. Explaining the delay in opening, Robert Sands, a senior vice president for Baha Mar Ltd said the project has been ‘quite complex’ and Baha Mar wants to be sure it can ‘offer the complete luxury product’ when it opens. Mr Sands added: ‘Our state-of-the-art casino will match what you would find in Las Vegas, Macao or Singapore.’ Rooms in the hotels feature 48-inch flat screen televisions, Nespresso coffee machines make and full or step-out balconies .","The Baha Mar resort includes four luxury hotels and a sprawling casino .

"It's just two-by-two metres, has no windows or power and is made of weatherboard, but it'll still cost you $100,000. Bathing Box 34, at Shire Hall Beach in Mornington, Victoria does however come painted in the Australian flag, so it's the perfect purchase for the national day on Monday. While it might be simple, estate agent Geoff Luff told Daily Mail Australia that hadn't stopped 20 potential buyers making inquiries and inspecting it. 'It's just a bare box with a regular stud wall and weatherboard that has got some stuff on the side for storing beach equipment,' Mr Luff said. Bathing Box 34, at Shire Hall Beach in Victoria has been put on the market for $100,000 . The beach box is two-by-two metres with no windows or power and is made of weatherboards . 'It has been on the market now for about six months and it has had some interest this summer. 'There have probably been about 20 inquiries from people who have had a look, but they're mostly looking for something bigger.' Mr Luff said there were similar boxes scattered across the peninsula from St Kilda in Melbourne's south-east to the wealthy suburb of Portsea, and that Bathing Box 34 was by no means one of the more pricey options. 'We've got another one at Shire Hall Beach for $155,000 and there are some down in Mount Martha for $250,000,' he said.

'A lot of them have a 99-year lease and a lot of them were handed down through the family; they're very, very popular.' Bathing boxes were originally simple structures built to house swimmers and beach equipment in Victoria, but over the decades they've become one of the nation's iconic structures. The current owners of the $100,000 box, painted it during Christmas last year and Mr Luff admitted that there had been numerous photos of it taken by passer-bys ever since. 'They've had it for a while and they did it up about two years ago,' he said of its current owners. 'But they don't get as much use for it anymore because their children are a bit older. It has been a good investment for them.'

"As the first day of school for the year edges nearer, a teacher and education expert has revealed his top tips for parents who want to make the transition from holidays to day one more bearable for everyone. Ciaran Smyth from yourtutor.com.au told Daily Mail Australia that a routine, an appropriate place to study and the occasional surprise note in a lunch box, can make all the difference to a new start. 'Talk to your child about routines and then get them into one as soon as possible. The best way for a student to adapt is to have a routine,' Mr Smyth said. Scroll down for video . Teacher and education expert Ciaran Smyth, has revealed his top tips for making the transition from holidays to day one of school more bearable . For high school students, he recommends creating a routine, picking a perfect study space and the occasional positive note in the lunch-box . 'I recommend encouraging your teen to spend the first 30 minutes to an hour after they arrive home from school doing something they enjoy – be it sport, video games, the gym or TV. This allows them to relax and disconnect from school. Then, spend a solid hour or two on homework or study before dinner.' High School . Kindergarten . Mr Smyth also suggested that parents buy the tools their children would need for school as early as possible to encourage organisation, but also allow them to pick certain details where possible to make them feel like they have a choice in their experience. 'Prepare resources in advance and contact the school to find out what you need,' he said. 'You can make the return exciting by letting them pick their own things like contact for their books or certain pens and pencils. 'If they've got a backpack and they want to decorate it- I remember I used to get a felt-tip pen and draw all over my bag - if that's what they need to do to personalise their stuff, let them do that to personalise their experience.' Finding the perfect study space that has plenty of natural light and isn't isolated from the rest of the house can ensure that study time is not torture for teens. A room with easy access to snacks and water, but free of television and computer screens is perfect according to Mr Smyth, who recommends mixing things up by using the kitchen bench (where parents are usually available to answer any questions) or even the balcony or backyard during good weather. 'Despite what most people believe, your home's traditional study room is not the best space for your child to complete their school work,' Mr Smyth said. He also recommends taking advantage of extra learning resources like local libraries and school tutoring groups as well as encouraging children to join social clubs or sports groups to make friends that can be a great source of support during stressful academic periods. He warned parents of new kindergarten pupils to make their goodbyes quick and unemotional and label everything . Pictured here with his own son Matthew, who starts school next year, Mr Smyth said: 'The number of parents who drop of their kids and go to the car for a quick cry is immense, but try not to cry at the gate because your kids will get upset as well' If it's their first day at a new school or even just the beginning of high school, Mr Smyth said that parents should never underestimate the old fashioned note in a lunch-box. 'You'll perk up their day and if they need it, it's there for them,' he said. Parents of new students avoid taking their 'first day' photos at the school to avoid nervousness . For parents who will see their toddlers take on their first ever day at school, Mr Smyth suggested that rather than clinging to their child and saying goodbye in four different ways, parents should opt for a quick and unemotional farewell. 'The best way is to make a fuss free exit, simply drop your child off, say a quick hello to the teacher and some of the students and make your getaway,' he said. 'Bring a bag of tissues, but not for the student. The amount of parents who drop of their kids and go to the car for a quick cry is immense, but try not to cry at the gate because your kids will get upset as well. 'I also recommend not sitting outside the school afterwards for 'just in case' reasons; if you're needed, the teachers will call'. First-day photographs should be taken at home according to Mr Smyth who says that: 'although it can be super cute to get photos of your child in their classroom (and on the school oval, in front of the school sign and with the teacher, head teacher and principal), it can often distract other children, draw unwanted attention to your own child and make them even more nervous about their big first day.' His final piece of advice for parents of new students is to label everything, from lunch-boxes to underpants and even show and tell items. 'Unless you're happy to fork out for a new school wardrobe every week, you should write your child's name of every item they take with them,' Mr Smyth said.","Teacher and education expert Ciaran Smyth, has revealed his top tips for making the transition from holidays to education more bearable .

"A single mother has been told she cannot take her eight-year-old  to a father-daughter dance - because organizers want to keep the event 'authentic'. Shawna Steeves was asked by daughter Meghan to be her date for the  event at Southwest Elementary School in Lawson, Missouri, as the youngster considers her to be both her mother and father. The 30-year-old, who recently moved to the area to be closer to her family, said she would be honored to accompany Meghan, but checked with the school first to make sure she could attend. Single mother: Shawna Steeves was asked by her daughter Meghan (both pictured) to be her date to the event at Southwest Elementary in Lawson, Missouri. The 30-year-old said she would be honored .

They told Miss Steeves that any other male figure - including uncles or grandparents - were more than welcome to attend.  But Meghan insists she wants her mother there. The mom was left devastated, having already bought her daughter a black and white dress with a purple sash - Meghan's favorite color. She told FoxK4: 'If you’re going to have that and you’re going to tell someone to bring their father figure, why not me? I’m just as good. 'I would love to find a substitute so she could go. I have. She ultimately turns around and says, ""you’re my mom and you’re my dad"" and I would love to go with you .

Our goal is to keep this special event authentic. 'We offer many other events that are family oriented.

"Mother-of-one Della Callagher died in 2012 of food poisoning after eating a reheated Christmas dinner . A pub chef and his manager have both been jailed and the company has been fined £1.5 million after a reheated Christmas dinner left mother dead and dozens seriously ill. Mehmet Kaya and Ann-Marie McSweeney, the chef and manager of the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex, were jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court for 12 months and 18 months respectively for perverting the course of justice. Mitchells and Butlers, the chain which owned the pub, was fined £1.5 million after being found guilty of placing unsafe food on the market. Della Callagher died and 32 others fell ill after eating the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch on Christmas day 2012. Today manager Anne-Marie McSweeney, 40, was jailed for 18 months and head chef Mehmet Kaya, 37, for 12 months for perverting the course of justice by falsifying records. And pub chain Mitchells and Butlers was fined £1.5million pounds for having 'manifestly inadequate' food safety measures in place. The company was fined the huge amount so it recognises the 'seriousness of the offence' and so its management and shareholders recognise the need to 'operate within the law,' the judge said. It was found guilty of placing unsafe food on the market by a jury at the end of last year. Mrs Callagher, 46, became unwell on Boxing Day and her devastated husband told the court how his wife began shaking and her eyes rolled back into her head. Guests paid £39.95 for a meal which had been cooked the day before and re-heated on Christmas day. The diners developed a type of potentially fatal form of food poisoning called Clostridium perfringens after a turkey breast was not prepared properly. After the outbreak landlady McSweeney and Kaya disposed of all the waste food, preventing health inspectors from taking samples. They also forged kitchen records. They were both found guilty of perverting the course of justice for falsifying food safety records. Pub chain Mitchells and Butlers was found guilty of placing unsafe food, namely turkey meat, on the market by not ensuring food hygiene rules were followed. Fining the company, Judge Alastair Hammerton at Snaresbrook Crown Court, said: 'The company had become aware of the risks [prior to the incident] of cooking, cooling, and re-heating, turkeys but had took manifestly inadequate steps in addressing that risk.' Landlady Anne-Marie McSweeney and chef Mehmet Kaya were jailed for 18 months and 12 months each . He added: 'The company is a substantial concern, with a turnover of £1.96billion and a pre-tax profit in the region of £125million. 'In these circumstances, my judgement is that fine should be £1.5m. This figure is of a level that recognises the seriousness of the offence, taking into the company's means. 'It brings home to business management and shareholders the need to operate within the law.' He added: 'They was a systematic failure in record-keeping at the Railway Hotel.' Addressing Kaya and McSweeney, the judge said: 'Following the discovery of the food poisoning outbreak on December 26, Mrs McSweeney and Mr Kaya, you both embarked upon the fabrication of the kitchen's due diligence logs. 'I am satisfied that you, Mrs McSweeney, were in charge of the process and caused Mr Kaya to get involved.' Two victim impact statements were read to the court, from Mrs Callagher's husband John and her father Daniel O'Leary. Mitchells and Butlers, owner of the Railway Hotel, Hornchurch, Essex, pictured, were fined £1.5 milllion . Mr Callagher struggled to control his emotions as his statement was read out by the prosecutor Andrew Campbell-Tiech: 'When Della was killed our lives fell apart, Della's passing was completely avoidable and all three defendants appear to have little, or no, indications what their actions have caused.' It added: 'Life will never be the same, my daughter Nancy, will now grow-up without Della by her side, and that is simply unforgivable.' Mr O'Leary added: 'I've lost my zest for life.' During the trial Mrs Callagher's husband John, who was also struck down by the food bug, described his wife's death as 'horrific.' Mr Callagher, 53, said: 'I was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on. The vomiting and diarrhoea wouldn't stop. Della was a very private person. It was horrific to see what was going on.' He took his wife to A&E but her condition deteriorated on Boxing Day. 'She got far, far, far, worse. It was horrific. 'Something changed. I felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled, as if she was having a cardiac arrest.' She was rushed to Queen's Hospital, Romford and pronounced dead at 8.15am on December 27. McSweeney, who worked for the company for 24 years, and Kaya were both cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market. The pub were ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120, and Kaya and McSweeney were each ordered to pay £100. The court heard that the cost of the trial to the public purse was £273,000. However, the court has yet to decide if, or how much, of that sum will be paid by the pub chain. The court heard that on Christmas Day 2012 the pub put on a lunch for 128 customers. But turkey meat prepared the day before was not cooled properly after it was cooked, and then was not adequately reheated before it was served to guests. Diners were left with food poisoning and two days later Mrs Callagher died. The court was told that food safety records had not been filled in, and so McSweeney, of Hornchurch, Essex, who had worked at the hotel for 24 years, concocted a plan for her and Kaya to falsify them. The pair 'covered their own backs' by retrospectively filling out false due diligence logs over the cooking, cooling and reheating of the meat before environmental health inspectors could carry out an investigation. Prosecuting, Andrew Campbell-Tiech QC told the court it was 'highly likely that other food-related records were fabricated'. Mr Campbell-Tiech told the court that, although records prior to that December were unavailable, 'the inference is that for many, many months record-keeping and policies diverged'. He added: 'Ms McSweeney was clearly in charge of the process of fabrication and caused a number of others to be involved in it, including members of staff and her family.' Interviews with staff were not disclosed, and nor were records such as stock transfer logs which may have shown where the turkey came from. The pair were acquitted at the trial of a charge of placing unsafe food on the market, of which the Ember pub's owner Mitchells & Butlers was found guilty. Speaking after the hearing, Osman Dervish, Havering Council's Cabinet member for regulatory services, said: 'Our condolences go out to the Callagher family, who have been in court throughout the trial. 'We hope that this morning's result will act as an impetus for all food providers, both local and across the country, to ensure that their food hygiene regimes are thorough and robust.' David Travers, for Mitchells and Butlers said: 'this case was a tragedy, it's beyond argument that the incident had terrible consequences and the company deeply, deeply regrets it.' He added: 'The tragic death of Ms Callagher is an aggravating feature, if the company had been following procedure, the staff could have been more effectively reminded of how to cook, cool and reheat the turkey.' Janick Fielding, for McSweeney, said: 'She was at all times very sorry for what happened and her remorse which was clearly there for all to see was real. He added: 'It wasn't falsification prompted by any realisation that they had committed any specific error but a realisation that the form filling that had been required of them by their company had not been done.' He said that since the incident, McSweeney has lost both her job and also her home because she lived at the Railway Hotel. She has been living with her family on benefits, and Mr Fielding said she has no hope of getting a job in the catering industry again. He said: 'It's sad that someone of her capabilities should be laid so low.' Nigel Sangster, for Kaya, said: 'it was clear from the evidence that he was put under pressure to fill in these logs and he was told what to put - when he fabricated these records it's not because he was aware of what had happened or was aware of the death, it was because records that should have been had not been filled in.' Judge Alistair Hammerton said: 'The essence of this offence is that the company was aware of the risks relating to the cooking, cooling and reheating of turkey meat, and the weekly bulletin was a wholly ineffective way of alerting staff to these risks and disseminating information.' Sentencing McSweeney to 18 months imprisonment, he said: 'You knew of the death of Mrs Callagher, and persisted with your cover-up.' Jailing Kaya for 12 months he said: 'You also knew of the death of Mrs Callagher but you too persisted in the cover-up, I accept that there are mitigating factors. 'First of all you were in a subordinate position and were directed by Ms McSweeney to embark upon a course of conduct that left you in a difficult position.' McSweeney, from Hornchurch, Essex, was cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market but found guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice. She was also cleared of obstructing a police officer. Kaya, from Purfleet, Essex, was cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market but convicted of perverting the course of justice.","Guests paid £39.95 for Christmas dinner at the Railway Hotel, Hornchurch .

"Stephen Waddington, 53, died from carbon monoxide poisoning after it was believed he used three disposable barbecues to cook his dinner in the living room of his Barnsley home. A man died from carbon monoxide poisoning after it was believed he used three disposable barbecues to cook dinner in his living room. Stephen Waddington was found slumped next to the grills and his half eaten meal by police who forced their way into his home. The two officers who made the grim discovery required hospital treatment after being overcome by the toxic fumes. An inquest into the 53-year-old's death, that concluded he died as a result of an accident, heard that he had been out with his brother, Andrew, on June 21 last year. 'When I left him  he spoke of his intention to have a barbecue and some beers,' he said in a statement read to the Sheffield hearing. 'He liked to have a good drink. I spoke to him on the phone at about 5pm and could tell he'd had a drink.' The following day, Mr Waddington's niece went to his terraced home in Barnsley, south Yorkshire, and raised the alarm because she could smell gas. When officers arrived they broke down the door and discovered the middle aged man. Police constable Matthew Wood said they discovered Mr Waddington surrounded by three used disposable barbecues. 'The smell got worse inside the property, it was constant,' said the officer. 'I didn't think anything of it. I was taken to hospital. We weren't in the house very long, only about a minute.' No evidence of suspicious activity or third party involvement was found. The court heard that unemployed Mr Waddington had become depressed after a motorcycle accident left him with his left leg in a wire cage for five years. But his brother Andrew, added: 'Prior to his death he was happy and there were no issues, his life was getting better and better.' A post mortem examination concluded that Mr Waddington died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. A coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental into Mr Waddington's death. Pictured: Tune Street in Barnsley, where he was found dead . Toxicology tests found that the level of alcohol in his system would have put him twice over the drink drive limit. Assistant coroner Louise Slater recorded a conclusion of accidental death. She said: 'I'm completely satisfied that Mr Waddington died as a result of a tragic accident. You were a very close family, I can see that. Please pass on my condolences to your family. 'If there are any lessons to be learned it's how dangerous it can be to have these small portable barbecues in small places.' After the hearing, Mr Waddington's brother said: 'Stephen will be greatly missed by a lot of people.'","Stephen Waddington, 53, was found dead at his home in June last year .

"A grieving relative has been blocked her from cremating her aunt in a cardboard coffin by penpushers because it is 'too dangerous.' Marianne Stevens, 73, ordered a brightly coloured, cardboard coffin painted with flowers for her 'favourite' aunt who died of brain cancer aged 90. But she was left stunned after bureaucrats at Eastbourne Borough Council, East Sussex, told her that the eco-friendly coffins were banned from the crematorium. Marianne Stevens, pictured right, had planned to have her aunt Mary Pilz, pictured left, cremated in a cardboard coffin painted with flowers . The grandmother-of-three has been left feeling that she has failed her beloved aunt, Mary Pilz, who cared greatly about the environment. Marianne, who is arranging the February 5 funeral from her home in Australia as she is fighting her own battle with breast cancer, reluctantly is having her auntie cremated in a wooden box. 'I ordered a beautiful floral cardboard coffin only to be told that the council won't allow it,' she said. Penpushers at Eastbourne Council have banned cardboard coffins from their crematorium over safety concerns . 'How appalling that a wooden coffin has to be used for a cremation whereas a cardboard one is more ecologically sound. 'I just can't understand why they would think that cardboard is dangerous. 'I thought a lovely, floral cardboard coffin would be super for my aunt, who loved colour and flowers, but sadly I am having to order a plain ordinary wooden one. I am very upset about it. Enviornmentally conscious Mary Pilz, 90, died after a battle with brain cancer . 'This was the last act I was going to do for my aunt and I fell I have failed her.' The floral cardboard coffin is thought to be similar to the one Coronation Street character Hayley Cropper was buried in on the beloved ITV soap. A spokesman for the council explained that the borough outlawed the eco-friendly boxes after carrying out a 'risk assessment'. He said: 'The differences in structure and cremating properties of paper product coffins led to a risk assessment being carried out. 'During the cremation process, paper-based materials handle and combust differently to other products. 'Fly ash and residue can also interfere with out emission treatment and monitoring systems, which are in place to ensure we meet stringent emission limit laid down by the Department for Environment, Flood and Rural Affairs. 'As a result, and to ensure continued safe operation of the facility, the council took the decision not to accept paper product coffins for cremation.' But if a relative is looking for an eco-friendly alternative, then bamboo boxes can be used, he added. Cardboard coffins were once seen  as a flimsy, cheap option that lacked dignity. But in the last few years, as environmental awareness has grown, more and more people are turning to the relatively inexpensive casket as eco-friendly and modern alternative. A quarter of people, who took part in a Royal Mail survey, said they would go for a more eco friendly cardboard coffin. They can be bought for as little as £60 and can come in a huge range of colours and designs. They can also be personalised and can be turned into anything from planes. guitars and even skips. Most standard cardboard coffins can hold a person of around 23 stone in weight, but many companies can supply stronger ones if necessary. Cardboard coffins are also bio-degradable and are said to be suitable for burials and cremations.","Marianne Stevens, 73, ordered a cardboard coffin for her dead aunt .

"Bernie Madoff has said that knowing the pain he inflicted on thousands through his Ponzi scheme is 'nothing' compared to the pain he feels over losing both of his sons. In 2010, the fraudster's oldest son Mark killed himself, aged 46, on the second anniversary of his father's arrest for operating the largest financial fraud in history. And last September, his remaining son, Andrew, passed away, aged 48, after battling cancer. 'As difficult as it is for me to live with the pain I have inflicted on so many, there is nothing to compare with the degree of pain I endure with the loss of my son's Mark and Andy,' the 76-year-old wrote in an email from prison to NBC News. Self pity: Bernie Madoff, pictured in January 2009, has written a letter from prison saying that knowing his victims' pain is nothing compared to the pain he feels over losing his two sons, who never forgave him . 'I live with the knowledge that they never forgave me for betraying their love and trust. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. But neither was ever criminally charged - and neither ever forgave him. 'As much as I tried to reach out to them in an attempt to explain the circumstances that caused my betrayal they could not find it possible to forgive me. I do understand their unwillingness,' he wrote. 'The fact that I was trying to protect our family by sheltering them from any knowledge or involvement in my wrong doing still fails to allow me to forgive myself.' He said that even though his sons were never charged in his scheme, they were the target for 'baseless and vindictive comments' and he is now committed to clearing their names.

Scene: A police officers points to the third floor New York City apartment where Mark Madoff's body was found after he hanged himself in 2010. He took his life as his two-year-old son slept in the room next door . Madoff sent NBC an email in response to claims his sons knew about his Ponzi scheme. Excerpts are below: . 'As difficult as it is for me to live with the pain I have inflicted on so many, there is nothing to compare with the degree of pain I endure with the loss of my son's Mark and Andy. I live with the knowledge that they never forgave me for betraying their love and trust. 'As much as I tried to reach out to them in an attempt to explain the circumstances that caused my betrayal they could not find it possible to forgive me. I do understand their unwillingness. 'The fact that I was trying to protect our family by sheltering them from any knowledge or involvement in my wrong doing still fails to allow me to forgive myself. 'What is still my most important goal is to do everything in my power to protect their legacy, Although neither of my son's were ever charged with anything. They were subjected to the completely false and slanderous claims and remarks of the Trustee and the media vindictive comments of the above parties.' He insisted that the men, who both worked in different departments in his company, knew nothing of his scam and pointed out that civil lawsuits against his sons had been dismissed. Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008, following his billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009 and is serving an 150-year sentence. The massive scheme was exposed after he told his sons about it and they contacted the FBI. Andrew told People magazine last year that turning his father in was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'. Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door. Speaking on the Today show in 2011, his mother Ruth Madoff revealed that the last time she had seen her son Mark alive was the evening her husband had revealed the scheme. 'I'll never get over that,' she said. 'I blame Bernie. It's the worst thing that can happen.' Andrew Madoff, who first fought mantle cell lymphoma in 2003 and was diagnosed with the disease again in October 2012, also blamed his father. In an interview last year, he said the stress of living with his father's arrest led to the relapse. Together: After Madoff, right, told his sons about his scheme, they called the FBI and turned him in . Unforgivable: Andrew Madoff, pictured on the Today show with his fiance Catherine Hooper, left, and mother Ruth Madoff, right, said he would never forgive his father - not even on his death bed . 'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew told People magazine in April 2013. 'And it's killing me slowly.' Although he reconciled with his mother, Ruth, shortly before his second diagnosis, he always said that he had no interest in having contact with his father. 'Even on my deathbed, I will never forgive him for what he did,' he told People magazine. 'He's already dead to me.'

"Violent extremists killing children and others in Iraq, Syria, Nigeria and other parts of the world may cite Islam as a justification, but the West should be careful about calling them Islamic radicals, Secretary of State John Kerry told an audience of opinion leaders Friday at the World Economic Forum. In a speech calling for a global effort against violent extremism, Kerry said it would be a mistake to link Islam to criminal conduct rooted in alienation, poverty, thrill-seeking and other factors. 'We have to keep our heads,' Kerry said, according to the Associate Press. 'The biggest error we could make would be to blame Muslims for crimes...that their faith utterly rejects,' he added. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaks during a session of the 45th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, WEF, in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday. Kerry said the West should be careful about calling violent extremists Islamic radicals. 'The biggest error we could make would be to blame Muslims for crimes...that their faith utterly rejects,' he said . U.S. President Barack Obama, right, and British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 16. Cameron repeatedly referred to radicalized Islam as a 'poisonous' ideology, but Obama wouldn't imply that religion was a motivating factor of terrorists . 'We will certainly not defeat our foes by vilifying potential partners,' the top U.S. diplomat said. 'We may very well fuel the very fires that we want to put out.' Kerry's comments highlighted a division between the U.S. and its closest allies, including French President Francois Hollande, whom Kerry memorably pressured into an awkward hug last week as a show of solidarity with the people of Paris after terrorists attacked Charlie Hebdo's headquarters. Hollande told the same audience earlier Friday that Islamic extremism is a problem that must be opposed. On Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond stood next to Kerry and urged the defeat of what he called 'the scourge of violent Islamist extremism.' The Obama administration has come under criticism for its unwillingness to differentiate between Islamic extremism and other forms of extremist violence. Earlier this week, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran, said it was a 'bipartisan concern' that Obama and his top aides don't use the term 'Islamic extremism.' President Barack Obama pointedly refused to call ISIS terrorists Muslims last Friday at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Standing just a few feet away, Cameron warned of a global 'Islamist extremist terrorist threat,' condemning the perversion of Islam in the strongest possible terms three times and using the word 'poisonous' to describe the radicalized ideology five times. Obama would not refer to the religion of ISIS militants during the White House news conference but at one point called them 'fanatics.' The U.S. president said the world must 'lift up those voices that represent the vast majority of the Muslim world' and push a counter narrative as 'aggressively and as nimbly as the messages coming' from the radicals. Kerry is pictured here bowing to someone after his speech. Kerry told opinion leaders attending the forum, 'We will certainly not defeat our foes by vilifying potential partners. Adding. 'We may very well fuel the very fires that we want to put out' Obama also suggested that the U.S. had an 'advantage' over countries like Britain when it comes to fighting terrorism because 'our Muslim populations, they feel themselves to be Americans.' 'There is this incredible process of immigration and assimilation that is part of our tradition. That is probably our greatest strength,' he said. Earlier in the week Obama's spokesman said that the world should just call the radicals fighting with ISIS what they are: terrorists. 'These terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion,' White House press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 'But based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions, those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with Islam.' Earnest said the fact that the 'majority of victims of terror attacks' are Muslim 'is a pretty clear indication that this is not a matter of the world being at war with Islam.' 'The world and the United States...is at war with these individuals, these violent extremists who carry out these acts of terror and try to justify it by invoking this religion.' he stated. He later said ISIS members were trying to 'invoke their own distorted deviant view of Islam to try to justify' their actions. 'And I think that is completely illegitimate. And what we should do is we should call it what it is. And it’s an act of terror, and it’s one that we roundly condemn.'","U.S. Secretary of State was speaking to an audience of opinion leaders at the World Economic Forum .

"Four years ago, polygamist leader Warren Jeffs was sentenced to life in jail for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered his wives. Despite this, he still appears to be running the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS cult, and instructing his flock with letters and phone calls from behind bars. Women and girls wearing prairie dresses can still be seen around town, pumping gas and driving tractors. They often run and hide when they see outsiders. Men drive trucks with windows tinted so dark you cannot tell who is inside. Scroll down for video . The cities of Hildale, Utah (pictured), and Colorado City, Arizona, are split between those loyal to Jeffs and defectors . Still there are signs that the community he once led on the border between Utah and Arizona is now divided - between those who remain loyal to Jeffs and those who wish to embrace the outside world. The town of Hildale, which located in Utah, along with sister city Colorado City in Arizona, has seen some of its residents welcome modern society. An elementary school, closed for 13 years, has reopened. As well, a mammoth, two-story edifice, encircled by a 15-foot wall of special white cement compound that members built for Jeffs, is being converted into a bed and breakfast. Young girls, in a playground in Colorado City, can be seen in prairie dresses and wearing their hair up . Jeffs' former bodyguard, Willie Jessop, who for years defended the FLDS, is converting the former compound, which has dozens of rooms with turquoise carpets, just as Jeffs liked. Warren Jeffs, pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom in 2006, still runs his polygamous sect from prison . In defiance of some of Jeffs' rules, he flies the American flag, keeps the gate open and has torn down part of the wall - all meant as clear signals that there is life after Jeffs. 'To have it exposed that the leader was engaged in such horrific, immoral acts was a really dark place not only for me and my family but the entire community,' said Jessop, who left the cult in 2011. 'That's why you see such a fractured situation as people try to come to grips with what he's in prison for. It's easier for people to put it under religious persecution than the reality of why he's actually in there.' The group is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism. Unlike most Mormons, members of FLDS believe polygamy will bring exaltation in heaven. Loyalists consider Jeffs a prophet who speaks for God and can do no wrong. Jeffs has been in jail in Utah or Texas continually since 2006 but is believed to still rule the FLDS. One of his brothers, Lyle Jeffs, is thought to ensure his commandments are carried out and his followers are roughly estimated to be about 6,000. Loyalists believe Jeffs is a victim of religious persecution. Pictured, a girl runs past a street sign in Hildale . The community is split between Jeffs' followers and defectors who wish to embrace modern society. Pictured, girls stand in a playground in Colorado City . The Hildale and Colorado City town councils are believed to be filled with Jeffs loyalists. Doran Jessop, a member of the FLDS and the Hildale City Council, said Jeffs is in prison for advocating the principles of Christ. Asked about the sexual assault convictions, he said if Jeffs has 'done anything like that, it was directed toward the Lord.' Doran Jessop, a member of the  FLDS, and the Hildale City Council,  says Warren Jeffs is in prison for advocating the principles of Christ . Water Canyon School Principal Darin Thomas looks at a note from his students posted on his office door in Hildale, Utah. The Washington County School District reopened the town's public school in 2014 . Ron Rohbock and his wife, Geri, stand in their home in Hildale, Utah. Mr Rohbock, a former member of the  FLDS, was kicked out in 2002 . The 190 pupils at the Hildale public school are only a fraction of the town's estimated 1,200 school-aged children as many sect members still follow Jeffs' edict to not to send their children to class. But homes in the community which used to be controlled by a FLDS trust have been in the hands of government officials since 2005. Around the corner from Jeffs former compound stand abandoned houses where the state recently evicted Jeffs followers who refused to pay $100-a-month occupancy fees. About 24 families are now receiving deeds to their homes - a first for a community where nearly all the houses have belonged to sect leaders since 1942. Katie Cox was one of people recently given deeds to their houses. Cox, a long-time resident and member of the community's housing board, said sect leaders have been moving people from home to home for years. The deeds are 'a symbol of freedom. It's a symbol that we are part of this United States,' said Cox, wearing modern clothes and listening to Frank Sinatra croon a Christmas song. 'For so long, it seemed like we had our own little Soviet Union here.' Ms Cox, her husband, another wife and 21 combined children moved to the area in the late 1960s. Like many polygamous families who settled here, the Coxes fled Salt Lake City out of fear of prosecution under Utah's bigamy law. Echoing a common sentiment among defectors, she remembers a quaint little community during the 1970s and early 1980s. Willie Jessop, the former spokesman and bodyguard for the sect, stands on the steps of a compound built for Jeffs in Hildale, Utah . The compound built for Jeffs was turned into a bed and breakfast by Willie Jessop, his former bodyguard . In defiance of Jeffs' rules, Willie now flies the US flag, keeps the gate open and has torn down part of the wall . By the time Jeffs and his father decided to move from the Salt Lake City area to the Utah-Arizona border, the Coxes had left the sect. Jeffs took over after his father suffered a stroke and soon began ousting men from the sect. Many were told they had broken church rules and were forced to leave their families, homes and belongings behind. So many young men have been forced out that they came to be known as the 'Lost Boys.' Their wives and children were reassigned. Recently, in a series of lawsuits and court filings, federal and state officials have accused the towns of denying housing and municipal services to residents who live outside the sect and using the police to enforce discrimination. A jury in Arizona recently ruled in favor of one family who sued over a denied water hookup. The couple is set to receive about $3million as a part of a settlement. A civil rights lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department is pending. Katie Cox, a longtime Hildale resident, was one of 24 people recently given the deeds to their houses . At a  town hall meeting, organized by the Arizona attorney general in Colorado City, sheriff's deputies instructed people to call specific dispatch numbers, instead of 911, to ensure they get help from county authorities rather than town police who they say have a duty to FLDS leaders. Attorneys for the towns have denied any wrongdoing and say there is no basis for the accusation. Ron Rohbock was kicked out in 2002, despite having worked alongside Jeffs at the sect's school in the Salt Lake City area as vice principal. The general contractor said he purchased $2million in supplies with his own line of credit to fix up homes in preparation for the massive move of people from Salt Lake to the Utah-Arizona border. After he was ousted, he had to file for bankruptcy and contemplated suicide. He eventually married a harpist in Las Vegas and traveled the world with her before she died. His new wife, a former therapist from Las Vegas, has helped him finally deal with the trauma he endured. The couple recently returned to Hildale to buy a large house Mr Rohbock and his sons helped build. The couple is fixing it up and hope to sell it. They don't plan to stay. 'I continually blamed myself and thought I was going to go to hell because they tell you that's exactly what's going to happen,' Mr Rohbock said. 'But I can tell you: This is hell. It can't get worse this. If this is heaven, you don't want anything to do with it.' Hildale, Utah, sits at the base of Red Rock Cliff mountains, with its sister city, Colorado City, Arizona, in the foreground . But Mrs Cox said: 'This is a nice place to live if you don't have somebody with their thumb on you telling you what you have to do,' And more changes lie ahead. The public school plans to put a gymnasium in a giant building once used by the sect as a storehouse. School officials want to field high school volleyball and basketball teams, with the hope that sports will convince more families to send their children to school. More evictions of FLDS houses and businesses are scheduled and the new board may begin redistributing houses. But nobody believes the Jeffs group will vanish anytime soon, if ever. Doran Jessop was recently evicted after failing to pay occupancy fees on his house. He has no home or plan but remains a loyal follower of Jeffs. 'I don't know whether we are going to start living in tents or what we're going to do,' he said. 'Whatever it takes.'","Jeffs was jailed for life in 2010 for assaulting girls he considered his wives .

"A tourist resort in Tuscany could start using drones to assist lifeguards within the next two months, according to reports in Italy. Bosses at Forte dei Marmi, a beach resort popular with the rich and famous, want to introduce the technology as a way of transporting life jackets and communicating with distressed swimmers from the shore. They say that the drones are likely to be quicker and more efficient at providing life jackets to swimmers than people. Bosses at Forte dei Marmi, a Tuscan beach resort popular with the rich and famous, want to introduce drone technology as a way of transporting life jackets and communicating with distressed swimmers from the shore . Forte dei Marmi has been a popular holiday destination for wealthy holidaymakers since the 1960s. The population of the town, around 7,700, nearly triples during the summer, because of the hundreds of tourist who come mainly from Florence, Milan, Germany, and Russia. Among the area’s most famous residents is designer Giorgio Armani, who built his first holiday home there in the 1980s. Roberto Santini, who owns the exclusive Piero beachclub, said he is in favour of introducing the technology, which is said to have been developed by an Iranian manufacturer. ‘We don’t want to replace the traditional lifeguards,’ Santini told local newspaper Versilia Today. Forte dei Marmi has been a popular holiday destination for wealthy holidaymakers since the 1960s. The concept of introducing drones has the backing of the mayor of the town's mayor, Umberto Buratti . ‘They’ve always been indispensable, but we want to give them more support. We are confident that in a couple of months we will be able to use the drones.’ Stefano Russo, of Italdron – which makes drones used for aerial images and data collection – says civilian drones in Italy are currently mostly used by photographers and surveyors. ‘It is a very new topic for people,’ he says. ‘The media is always talking about drones being good for things like delivering pizza. ‘I think it’s possible to use drones for life-guarding, but it’s more like experimentation than real-world usage.’ The  drone is touted as being capable of communicating via a loudspeaker. The concept has the backing of the mayor of Forte dei Marmi, Umberto Buratti, though he also emphasised concerns about safety. ‘It is necessary that this new application meets all the safety requirements and is run by people who are adequately prepared,’ he said. Among the area’s most famous residents is designer Giorgio Armani, who built his first holiday home there in the 1980s . Drones used by unauthorised people would be confiscated, he added. The machines, also called unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, are currently used in war-zones and military operations to provide an effective means of gathering intelligence and venturing into hostile areas without the need of a pilot. The machines were first used in WWII, but there have been significant developments in the technology since then. It has even been suggested that large mail order companies could develop UAVs to deliver their goods to customers in the future. It was in 2013 that the chief executive of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, revealed the company had been testing unmanned drones to deliver goods. Aviation authorities are currently in the process of drafting rules for the commercial use of drones for everything from TV news coverage to package delivery to crop monitoring. Drones were first used in WWII, but there have been significant developments in the technology since then . Forte dei Marmi is not the only beach looking at using drones. Officials near the iconic Bondi beach in Australia are considering to use drones to help detect sharks, according to reports. In 2013, Iranian-based laboratory RTS revealed that they were developing a drone specifically designed to fly to the relief of people drowning near coastlines. Equipped with four rotors, the makers say it will be able to carry three life jackets as well as record sound and take pictures. The manufacturers also claim it will also be able to detect lifejackets in the water and feature a heat-sensing camera which is able to detect objects in the dark. Once the drone locates individuals in the water, manufacturers say victims will be able to shout at it which will activate a system that drops a life jacket. Makers claim it has an inbuilt GPS system and will be able to return from its rescue mission without user guidance.","Bosses at Forte dei Marmi say technology could be in use in two months .

"Jamie Gant, 11, died after being rushed to hospital from his home in Bath . A popular 11-year-old schoolboy was found hanged in his bedroom minutes after telling his mother he was going upstairs to finish his homework. Jamie Gant died after being rushed to hospital when his mother discovered his lifeless body in their home in Twerton, Bath. The child, who had just started secondary school, had never shown any intention to take his own life, an inquest into his death heard. Avon Coroner's Court heard how Jamie had told his mother he was going to finish his homework on September 28. Ten minutes later, his lifeless body was found in his bedroom. Paramedics arrived at the family home and rushed Jamie to Bath Royal Infirmary where he was pronounced dead. 'There was absolutely no indication that there was anything contributing to the death, or anything else people had been aware of,' Detective Sergeant Tom Herbert of Avon and Somerset Constabulary said. 'Everyone felt Jamie was a very happy boy, very popular at school and he had been able to speak to them if he had been concerned as he had in the past. 'There was no evidence of bullying.' Recording a narrative conclusion, Coroner Maria Voisin said the child may not have intended to kill himself. 'I’m told Jamie was a lovely, popular boy and there is no mention of anything that would have led to, or caused an intention, in relation to this. 'There is clearly the act which resulted in Jamie’s death, but I do not consider I have enough evidence to answer whether the intention of Jamie was to take his life. 'He may not have realised that death was the conclusion of his act.' Jamie's parents paid tribute to their son as a 'happy and loved young boy'. 'Jamie, was a much loved and very happy young boy who had a bright future which has been sadly cut short. 'He will be deeply missed by family friends and all who knew him,' a statement read.

"A Democratic district attorney who has pursued Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker over alleged campaign finance violations told a fellow prosecutor that his crying wife, a union official, drove him to hunt the governor and his conservative allies because of his anti-union laws feared by organized labor. The explosive revelation came Tuesday as lawyers for Milwaukee DA John Chisholm began two days of oral arguments in a Chicago courtroom over earlier rulings that effectively ended his wide-ranging investigation. The investigation aimed to show that conservative groups were illegally working hand-in-hand with Walker's office when they ran 'issue ads' pressing the case that public employee unions should face reforms. Such arrangements, attorneys say, are common on both sides of the political aisle – including President Barack Obama's longstanding coordination with Priorities USA Action and other 'super PACs.' Leaders of virtually every conservative political nonprofit in the Badger State, 29 in all, have found themselves swept up in Chisholm's criminal probe as they were hit with pre-dawn raids that seized their computers, cell phones, email records – and even a child's iPad. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Democratic District Attorney John Chisholm (right) pursued associates of Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker (left) with a five-year criminal investigation on charges that have been thrown out of state and federal courtrooms . in 2011 Wisconsin lawmakers passed Walker-driven legislation that was the most sweeping anti-union law in US history, provoking protests and marches by organized labor in the state Capitol . Armed police kept many of them from contacting their lawyers or corralling their children in some cases while they executed searches initiated by Chisholm over a period of a year and a half. Republicans have accused Chisholm of using heavy-handed tactics, furthered by police using floodlights to illuminate suburban homes as flashing squad cars jammed driveways and cul-de-sacs. None of the targets of the searches were ever convicted of any crime, and few were charged. Since Chisholm prosecuted an unrelated 2009 embezzlement case that Walker's office urged him to take up when he was a county executive, conservatives have wondered why the DA expanded the probe into what Wisconsin insiders call a 'John Doe' investigation – ensnaring dozens of Walker's aides and allies once he became governor in 2010. The John Doe proceeding, peculiar to Wisconsin, allowed Chisholm to enforce a gag order demanding complete secrecy from his targets and potential witnesses, prohibiting them from discussing the case, defending themselves in public or firing back when damaging documents were leaked to the press. Chisholm has persisted despite defeats in every court that has weighed in. Writing for the Legal Newsline, an American Media Institute investigator chronicled an interview with an unnamed Chisholm confidant – formerly a fellow prosecutor – to whom he explained his reasons. Chilsolm's wife Colleen, he said, repeatedly broke down in tears and insisted he go after the governor following the passage of a 2011 budget law that trimmed the sails of the state's powerful public employee unions. Mrs. Chisholm, a teacher, represented a union as her school's designated shop steward. Legal Newswire reported that she feared what would become one of the biggest reversals of labor power in American history. His wife 'frequently cried when discussing the topic of the union disbanding and the effect it would have on the people involved … She took it personally,' Mr. Chisholm reportedly told his close associate, who has not come forward because he fears retaliation in the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of Wisconsin union politics. Walker's law drew riotous protests from liberal groups organized by union labor, leading to months of marches and sit-ins at the state Capitol. Angry picketers harassed Walker in front of his home and some of the governor's supporters received death threats. The activists were angry at Walker because their unions were to be required, for the first time, to contribute to employees' pensions and health insurance plans. The law also forbade them from collectively bargaining for benefits the went beyond wages. Walker survived a recall effort in 2012, winning more votes than he had in his original 2012 election and fueling conservatives' hopes that organized labor's day in the sun had passed . Judge Rudolph Randa slapped down Chisholm's attempts to criminalize conservatives' political ads, saying that they could work with Walker's office as long as they weren't advocating for any candidates . The American Media Institute's source said Chisholm told him 'he felt that it was his personal duty to stop Walker from treating people like this.' Mrs. Chisholm, like hundreds of teachers, joined in the protests. So did many members of her husband's ostensibly impartial staff, according to the source. Chisholm's criminal probe widened 18 times, court records show. But ultimately judges at the state and federal level slapped him down and brought his investigation to a screeching halt. U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa ruled in May that the investigation ran afoul of Wisconsin law and the U.S. Constitution since it hinged on the idea that right-wing activists were illegally coordinating their ads with the governor's office. That legal theory, Randa wrote, was 'simply wrong.' Governments, he ruled, can only regulate issue ads run by outside groups if they specifically advocate for or against a candidate by name, offering 'express advocacy' or its 'functional equivalent.' Referring to the heavy-handed raids, Randa vented that 'attempts to purify the public square lead to … the Guillotine and the Gulag.' Chaos: Walker's law restricting public sector unions threatens to become a blueprint for other states' conservative activists, worrying labor leaders who have never seen their power diminished so quickly . Once and future president? Walker is touted as a possible 2016 White House contender; the kind of alleged political coordination with outside issue groups that drove the investigation against him reached its high point during President Barack Obama's two successful elections . Worse, he determined that Chisholm's prosecution team had  no 'reasonable expectation of obtaining a valid conviction.' On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago heard oral arguments as Chisholm sought to overturn the ruling. American Media Institute president Richard Miniter, whose organization commissioned the story, told MailOnline that Chisholm's actions would be equally improper if he were a Republican. 'Abuses of the public trust are exactly what journalists should be investigating, no matter which party is to blame,' he said. 'We launched this three-month investigation and hired a former New York Times Supreme Court correspondent to run it because it seemed like Chisholm was using his office to criminalize ordinary political activity,' Miniter explained. 'He told colleagues that his wife's tears motivated him to criminally investigate a sitting governor. The courts found that he had no legal basis. That should embarrass even the unions.' Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson called Tuesday's revelations 'chilling.' 'To date,' he said, 'no one has been able to explain why District Attorney John Chisholm has gone to the lengths he has gone to try to find criminal conduct that could taint Governor Walker. If this new information is accurate, now we know the motivation, and there needs to be an investigation of the investigators.'","Milwaukee DA John Chisholm pursued Wisconsin Gov.

Chisholm told a fellow prosecutor that he was motivated by weeping complaints from his wife, a schoolteacher and labor shop steward whose union stood to lose if Walker's policies prevailed."
"A woman who was told she would never become a mother because she suffers from a heart condition is to have her dream of a family come true - thanks to a total stranger who offered to donate her eggs and a friend who is acting as a surrogate. Miranda Hill from Engadine in Sydney's south, who calls her situation a 'love story', will have a little one to call her own in four weeks when her best friend gives birth to a baby boy created with her husband's sperm and a Queensland mother's donated egg. The 32-year-old was first diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a condition that doctors warned could result in her suffering a stroke if she carried a child, at the age of 21. Scroll down for video . Miranda Hill right) is having a baby with the help of her best friend Megan Hill (centre) and an egg donor from Queensland Jemma Bacon (left) who has become her close friend . The 32-year-old, pictured with her husband Chris, was diagnosed with the heart condition cardiomyopathy at 21. Doctors warned Mrs Hill that she was likely to suffer a stroke if she fell pregnant . 'When I was 21, having a baby wasn't high on my priority list,' Miranda told Daily Mail Australia. 'My best friend, who is now my sister-in-law [Megan Hill], when we realised it would be hard for me to have a baby, would always joke ""don't worry, I'll have one for you"" and I'd just laugh at her and didn't think it was possible.' After marrying Megan's brother-in-law Chris in 2009, who Miranda describes as the man of her dreams, she realised that her desire to have a baby and raise a family was a physical impossibility. 'I sort of kept my pain really private between my husband and I – it's hard to be upset when another woman in your life has a baby or announces their pregnancy. You don't look nice when you're the one with tears in your eyes because you're sad about your situation,' she said. 'My husband talked me through it – he's a man of few words but when he does say something he really means it. 'He said to me: ""If I can't have a baby with you, if I can't raise them with you, then I don't want to do it at all"".' Instead, the couple focused on their nephews and nieces, spending extra time with each of them and getting very involved in their lives. But it was during one particularly difficult Christmas in 2012 that Miranda received an offer that her heart couldn't refuse. 'I'd had a particularly hard Christmas not being a mum and being around lots of babies – they bring a lot of joy but it can also be a heartache – and Megan said: ""look, I've finished my family - my daughter's four, my son is two - so let's do this, I'm ready again"",' Miranda said. Megan (centre) who has known Miranda since they were 18-years-old, used to joke with her saying, 'don't worry I'll have a baby for you' when they were younger just to cheer her up . It was during a particularly difficult Christmas for Miranda that Megan said: 'look, I've finished my family - my daughter's four, my son is two - so let's do this, I'm ready again' 'Megan is a really pragmatic woman –she wouldn't say something she didn't mean.' 'Now she's very set on this idea that ''this is my nephew, I'm carrying my nephew"",' Miranda said of her best friend (pictured) 'Now she's very set on this idea that ''this is my nephew, I'm carrying my nephew"".' The two women began their research and found that their dream could be made a reality through IVF Australia – until Miranda was hit with another crushing blow. 'I found out I needed an egg donor. My egg supply was extremely low, I'd probably be able to retrieve one egg and I would have to also carry out some genetic testing to make sure I wasn't going to pass on the heart condition I live with,' Miranda said. 'But I found Egg Donation Australia online and they're a huge group of women who donate their eggs because they want other women to become mothers too – it's beautiful.' Miranda was introduced to Jemma Bacon, a single Queensland mother-of-one who is a strong advocate for egg donation and has given 11 embryos to women struggling to conceive, and a friendship flourished between them. 'We went to Brisbane to meet her and her little boy Cooper and we just really clicked, we've known each other for 18 months but you wouldn't know it – the first time we spoke on the phone we spoke for two hours solid,' Miranda said. 'She has an amazing attitude, she just wants to give someone else the chance to be the mum that she loves being.' Jemma, who has been very involved with the pregnancy and flew down from her Yeppoon home to attend Miranda's baby shower, said she chose to donate her eggs to the desperate couple herself. 'I had seen her thread and they're just so supportive - the love she gave everyone even though they were going through a hard time themselves was beautiful,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Queensland mother, Jemma Bacon (pictured with her four-year-old son Cooper) offered to donate her eggs to Miranda after she was told her own egg count was too low . Megan is now four weeks away from giving birth (left) to the child which Miranda (pictured right as a child) never imagined she had the possibility of having . Megan (pictured) has been keeping the others updated on the size of her stomach while Jemma issues jest apologies to the heavily pregnant surrogate for 'knocking her up' 'It feels like your best friend is having a baby, that’s how invested you are. There's pride and joy and elation.' The trio are now four weeks away from the birth of Miranda's little boy and the excitement is starting to show: the mother-to-be has completed setting up her nursery while Megan keeps the others updated on the size of her stomach and Jemma issues jest apologies to the heavily pregnant surrogate for 'knocking her up'. 'The moment Megan had the embryo transfer and two weeks later the blood transfer, the nurse rang me to let me know it had worked and I went into shock. They had to call me back in the afternoon to ask if I was OK. The mother-to-be has completed setting up her nursery (pictured): 'At 20 weeks, when we found out he was a boy, that's when I realised ""this is real, he's coming and he's going to live in my house and call me mum"",' she said . Miranda has now made her story public to inspire other mothers like her, that 'there really is no end to the road – there are so many options these days' 'It's something you hope for but don't dare believe it will happen.

"Bill de Blasio has defended New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, describing him as a 'man of integrity'. The New York City Mayor made his remark after Silver, one of the state's most powerful politicians, was charged on Thursday with pocketing $4million from bribery and kickback schemes and faced pressure to quit. De . Blasio said he did not think Silver should step down, citing . his 'due process rights.' Scroll down for video . Bill de Blasio (left) has defended New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (right), describing him as a 'man of integrity' 'In my experience with Shelly Silver, I've seen integrity . and public service,' de Blasio told reporters, according to a . transcript released by his office. Silver, a Democrat who has served as the highest-ranking . state assemblyman since 1994, was accused in a federal criminal . complaint in New York, as authorities moved to seize $3.8 . million in proceeds tied to the alleged corruption. The 70-year-old Silver, a licensed lawyer who represents . Manhattan's Lower East Side, is known as one of Albany's three . most powerful men, alongside Governor Andrew Cuomo and Senate . Majority Leader Dean Skelos. He has been a leading voice in . years of negotiations over state budgets and key legislation. The Assembly canceled its Thursday session following . Silver's arrest, less than two weeks after the new legislative . session opened. Silver would lose his seat if convicted of any of five . felony counts and faces a maximum of 20 years of prison on each . count. He became the latest addition to a long line of New York . politicians implicated in corruption scandals. At least 30 New . York politicians have faced legal or ethics charges since 2000. 'As today's charges make clear, the show-me-the-money . culture of Albany has been perpetuated and promoted at the very . top of the political food chain,' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet . Bharara told reporters. Silver (center), one of the state's most powerful politicians, was charged on Thursday with pocketing $4million from bribery and kickback schemes and faced pressure to quit . At a brief court appearance on Thursday afternoon, a judge . released Silver on a $200,000 bond. Asked for a comment outside the courtroom, he said, 'I am . confident that after a full hearing and due process I will be . vindicated for these charges.' Despite some calls for Silver's resignation, Albany . Democrats emerged from a private meeting on Thursday to declare . their support for him, with Assembly Majority Leader Joseph . Morelle saying the members 'overwhelmingly' stood behind Silver. Cuomo has not commented on the arrest, but said in an . interview with the New York Daily News that it was 'a bad . reflection on government,' adding that he didn't know enough to . form a judgment about the case. In 2013, Cuomo launched an anticorruption panel called the . Moreland Commission to probe wrongdoing in the state's capital. But he abruptly shut the commission down in March, drawing . criticism from Bharara, whose office took possession of its . files to continue any investigations. The commission's work was merged with an ongoing federal . probe of Silver's outside income initiated in June 2013, the . criminal complaint said. Silver had long listed New York personal injury firm Weitz & . Luxenberg on his financial disclosure forms as a source of . income for representing its clients in cases. But the complaint said over $3 million of his income was for . referring asbestos sufferers from a doctor whose research had . been secretly provided $500,000 in state funds at Silver's . direction, as well as other benefits. New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (center) is seen in federal court with his attorneys Joel Cohen (left) and Steven Molo . Prosecutors said Silver also received $700,000 in kickbacks . by steering real estate developers with business before the . legislature to another law firm, identified by its defense . lawyer as Goldberg & Iryami. 'He simply sat back and collected millions of dollars by . cashing in on his political office,' Bharara said. Weitz & Luxenberg in a statement said it had cooperated with . the investigation and was 'not aware of any improprieties . whatsoever.' Michael Ross, a lawyer for Goldberg & Iryami, . declined comment on the allegations. The complaint did not name the doctor but said he had . created a mesothelioma research center at a New York university . hospital. Details in the complaint match those of Robert Taub, a . professor at Columbia University. In 2011, the assembly passed a . resolution, sponsored by Silver, honoring Taub for his . contributions to mesothelioma treatment. A spokesman for Columbia said it had no knowledge of the . allegations and will cooperate with the investigation. Taub did . not respond to a request for comment. After surrendering to authorities in lower Manhattan at . about 8 a.m., a somber-looking Silver headed to nearby federal . court, wearing a dark suit and a black hat, his car mobbed by . reporters and photographers. 'It is unfortunate that the prosecutors chose to pursue this . as a criminal case,' Silver's attorney, Steven Molo, said by . email. 'We intend to vigorously contest the charges and Mr. Silver looks forward to his day in court.' Silver's longtime Senate counterpart, Joseph Bruno, was . acquitted in May at a retrial on bribery charges. One of Silver's predecessors as speaker, Mel Miller, was . convicted of corruption in the early 1990s, but the conviction . was overturned by a federal appeals court. Two former state Senate Democratic leaders, John Sampson and . Malcolm Smith, are also facing criminal charges.","Bill de Blasio said he did not think Sheldon Silver should step down .

"Ray Compton was reported to the council by a passer-by after being seen standing on a chair to hang fairy lights . When a string of decorative fairy lights came loose outside his restaurant, Ray Compton stood on a chair and hooked them back in place with a broom. The 25-second task was soon forgotten – but not by health and safety zealots at the local council. A passer-by reported what had happened to officials, and Mr Compton received a call four days later from an environmental health officer who announced that the case was under investigation. During the ticking off he was warned that he could face further action for supposedly putting himself at risk by hanging the lights 12ft off the ground. He was also told he should have used correct climbing apparatus, namely an ‘aluminium construction secured at three points’ – council jargon for a ladder. Yesterday the married father-of-one attacked the waste of taxpayers’ money, saying: ‘This really is barmy British bureaucracy. ‘I thought it was a prank call so I don’t think I was very co-operative with the officer. I was asking if I should have requested permission to have the high street closed and perhaps made sure that St John Ambulance were on standby.’ He added: ‘It really is a case of health and safety gone mad. We have to have some common sense in this life – the council cannot nanny everyone.’ Mr Compton, who owns the Intimo-Fresco Italian restaurant in Maldon, Essex, saw the lights had come loose during high winds on the afternoon of New Year’s Eve. The street was virtually deserted at the time so there was no risk of anyone knocking him, and the seat of the chair was only around 18 inches away from the ground. He said: ‘It could not have taken more than 25 seconds to sort out, it really was that quick. The chair is very solid and I feel safer standing on it than I do on a ladder.’ A council spokesman said: ‘Following a complaint from a member of the public about unsafe working practices, an environmental health officer phoned the business to establish if there was any truth to the allegation. 'The officer discussed working at height and advised that appropriate equipment should be used. The council is not proposing to take any further action.’ The father-of-one, who owns Intimo-Fresco Italian restaurant in Maldon, Essex, said the incident was a waste of taxpayers' money .","Restaurant owner Ray Compton was reported to council by passer-by .

"In a galaxy far, far away he was one of the most feared crime bosses in the universe, with a particular distaste for plucky hero Han Solo. But now the infamous Jabba the Hutt has appeared in our own galaxy - at least, in an animation showing weather patterns on Earth. In the map, the face of the criminal overlord can be made out, with vortices representing his eyes and wind creating scaly, green skin. Scroll down to use the interactive animation . Tokyo-based software engineer Cameron Beccario has created a weather map (shown) that looks like the infamous Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt. The animation shows wind speeds and weather patterns around the world. In the image Jabba's 'eyes' are represented by two vortices . The familiar pattern arose in an animated map showing global weather conditions called earth.nullschool.net. Created by Tokyo-based software engineer Cameron Beccario, the image garnered considerable attention on social media networks when observers noted the similarity to the Star Wars character. He said the wind map was a personal project used to learn how to develop web visualisations. ‘I originally found the image while playing around with the site, which I then posted on the site's facebook page,’ Mr Beccario, 39, told MailOnline. According to meteorologist Tyler Hamilton from The Weather Network, the eyes represent ‘stationary vortices that are common during the winter months.’ The mouth is the ‘intertropical convergence zone’ (ITCZ), which is an area that circles Earth near the equator where northeast and southeast trade winds come together. The pink eyebrows are high-speed winds moving more than 155mph (250km/h) in the upper atmosphere, while the other green lines show the motion of wind elsewhere in the world. Light green shows the lowest intensity winds, moving up to red and then pink. ‘The combination of high altitude winds, colours, and equirectangular projection caused this humourous face to appear, and I couldn't stop laughing. He noted that he thought it looked 'more like Oscar the Grouch' than Jabba the Hutt, but the resemblance to both characters is uncanny. ‘Of course, it's 100 per cent an artefact of the site's calculations,' he added. 'The website shows global wind data over a number of different altitudes, updated every three hours, from data made available by the US National Weather Service.' 'This particular image shows wind velocity at a pressure level of 10 hectopascals, which is roughly 26.5km [16/5 miles] up, as forecast by the US NWS on 19 January at 12.00 UTC. 'The colors vary with wind speed, as does the motion of the particles, which get faster as the wind speeds up. Note the projection introduces distortion, too.'

"Veteran television actor Stephen Collins and his wife of nearly 30 years have finalized their divorce, an acrimonious breakup that revealed the former '7th Heaven' star had inappropriate contact with underage girls decades ago. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael J. Convey on Friday approved a divorce judgment that ended Collins' marriage to Faye Grant, who first disclosed molestation allegations against her estranged husband in court filings. Collins acknowledged he acted inappropriately with three underage girls in incidents that occurred between 1973 and 1994. The revelation cost Collins several roles after audio of a 2012 therapy session in which he discussed the incidents was posted by celebrity website TMZ last year. Grant recorded the session but denies leaking the audio to the website. Acrimonious: Stephen Collins and his wife of nearly 30 years Faye Grant have finalized their divorce during a split which revealed he had inappropriate contact with underage girls . Grant first disclosed molestation allegations against her estranged husband in court filings. Collins admitted he acted inappropriately with three underage girls in incidents that occurred between 1973 and 1994 . The actor acknowledged in an interview with Katie Couric that he molested one girl and engaged in sexual misconduct with two other underage girls. However he denied being a pedophile . Collins sought to deny his wife any future spousal support payments. A copy of the couple's divorce judgment was not immediately available. A divorce trial was scheduled to begin next month. The trial would have focused on the financial fallout from the release of the therapy session audio and would have divided the pair's assets. Grant and Collins and their attorneys reached a settlement on Friday after negotiating for several days at a downtown Los Angeles courthouse. They both said during Friday's hearing that the marriage was irretrievably broken and could not be fixed through further counseling. Mark Vincent Kaplan,  Collins' attorney, arrives at court in Los Angeles on Thursday. A copy of the couple's divorce judgement was not made immediately available . The revelations cost the 7th Heaven (cast pictured) a number of roles. Collins' admissions came in a recorded therapy session in 2012. Grant had the tape but denied releasing it . Collins filed for divorce in May 2012 and the case received little attention until the molestation allegations became public. The actor acknowledged in an interview with Katie Couric that he molested one girl and engaged in sexual misconduct with two other underage girls. He denied he was a paedophile and said he has controlled his urges since 1994. Grant included the molestation accusations in divorce proceedings and authorities in New York and Los Angeles have investigated the claims, but Collins has not been charged. The incidents occurred between 1973 and 1994, according to a statement Collins released to People magazine in December. 'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret,' Collins wrote. 'I have been working to atone for it ever since.'

"Fatal: A family was killed when an artillery shell they were storing in their home exploded. (File photo) A large family has been killed after an artillery shell they kept in their home exploded. Women and children were among the ten relatives blown up by the devastating blast in a remote tribal region in the country's north-west along the Afghan border. Pakistani government official Tahir Khan said Monday's explosion was from a suspected artillery shell that stored in the house in the village of Dars in the Tirah Valley. The valley is located in the Khyber tribal region. The valley had been a hotbed for Islamic militants until the Pakistan army captured it last year in fierce fighting.

(File photo) The volatile region is still seen as a potential flashpoint in the fraught relations between nuclear powers Pakistan and their neighbours India. The leader of India's anti-corruption party this week called for a referendum on whether army should stay in Kashmir and Jammu to deal with internal security threats. AAP leader Prashant Bhushan said: 'People should be asked whether they want the Army to handle the internal security of Kashmir. 'Any decision which does not have the backing of the people is undemocratic. If people feel that the Army is violating human rights and they say they don't want the Army to be deployed for their security then the Army should be withdrawn from the hinterland,' The lawyer-activist, however, made it known that the government had the prerogative to decide on troop deployment along the country's borders. 'The government can decide if the Army needs to be deployed to deal with external threats along the border. The government can also decide if the Army needs to be kept to help protect the minorities in the Valley. But there should be a referendum on whether people want AFSPA to continue in the Valley or not,' he said.","Dead included women and children, officials confirmed today .

"A 92-year-old California man is suing his health care provider after he claims his penis completely split in half and eroded as a result of neglect. Rupert Collins filed a lawsuit against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. for elder abuse, negligence and unfair business practice stating a septic catheter caused the problem. He alleges that despite repeated requests to remove the catheter over a period of almost two weeks, his penis became cut and swollen to the point it could not be saved. Care: Rupert Collins was being treated for another unspecified condition at Napa Valley Care Center (pictured) when his condition worsened . Collins was a patient on July 21, 2013 at Napa Valley Care Center, which is not included in the lawsuit, when the problem first developed. A nurse at the facility sent a fax to Kaiser, according to the complaint. The fax said, 'that Rupert's penis was red and swollen with what was described as a cut. Rupert had a Foley catheter inserted into his penis. 'May we have a trial of no Foley to give the area a rest.' According to the lawsuit Kaiser denied the request and there is no documentation that doctors or nurses from the insurer checked on Collin's penis. The lawsuit states, 'As a direct result of this reckless neglect by Kaiser, the Foley was left in Rupert's red and swollen and cut penis, and his penis began to erode further and further each day.' Alleged negligence: Rupert Collins is accusing Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc, a subsidiary of Kaiser Permanente of poor health care - causing him to lose his penis . On July 23, 2013, there was a medical board care conference about Collins' care, however, the lawsuit states that no representative from Kaiser attended. 'As a direct result of Kaiser's failure to participate, there was no meaningful communication or ongoing assessment and the dire need to remove the catheter from Rupert's eroding penis continued to be ignored,' the complaint states according to the Courthouse News Service. Another nurse sent another fax to Kaiser on July 30 asking to remove the catheter, but this was again denied, claims the lawsuit. Then, the next day, Collins' daughter looked at her father's penis herself. 'When Diana examined Rupert's penis, she was horrified at what she saw. Rupert's penis was split completely in half from the tip of his penis all the way down to the scrotum sac,' the complaint states. She got a third nurse to contact Kaiser, but they allegedly said, 'The penis erosion is normal and will heal on its own.' However, she pushed for a urologist to see her father who stated, 'that if Rupert had been treated earlier, the penis could have been saved but that the penile erosion was now complete, Rupert's penis would never heal and that reconstructive surgery was not a viable option,' the complaint states. 'Rupert's penis and urethra is permanently eroded away and Rupert has suffered permanent genital mutilation,' it continues.' Collins is currently seeking general, special and treble damages for his loss.","Rupert Collins launched lawsuit against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan .

"A New York teen’s Facebook posts have led to his arrest for making terrorist threats against the police. Osiris Aristy, 17, who lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn, posted a series of status updates that included emojis of policemen with guns pointed at them. A criminal complaint states that the posts ‘caused New York City police to fear for their safety’. Aristy was arrested on January 18 at 2:46 a.m. at his home on Wyckoff Avenue near Himrod Street. While the specific posts and photos mentioned in the criminal complaint have either been deleted or are locked down, others remain with the same emoji combination of the policeman with the gun aimed at his head . In addition to making terrorist threats, his charges included criminal possession of a weapon, criminal use of drugs and criminal possession of marijuana, DNAinfo reported. Routine Facebook monitoring by the police showed Aristy posted selfies with guns and marijuana joints, in addition to the emoji status updates threatening to kill cops. Police then received an arrest warrant from District Attorney Ken Thompson's office. Specific posts include a January 15 photo of Aristy with a revolver and rounds of ammunition captioned: ‘feel like katxhin a body right now’. This was followed by a post that read: ‘N***a run up on me, he gunna get blown down'. There was then an emoji of a police officer with three gun emojis pointed at it, according to a criminal complaint. Aristy's Facebook profile features many photos of him either smoking or preparing joints and blunts either alone or with friends . Later that night, Aristy posted: ‘F**k the 83 104 79 98 73 PCTKKKK’, again followed by the police officer emoji with two gun emojis pointed at it, according to the DA’s office. Aristy then wrote: ‘U know how I rock skrap’. ‘As a result of this conduct, the defendant has caused informant and other New York City police officers to fear for their safety, for public safety, and to suffer alarm and annoyance,’ the criminal complaint reads. Other posts include one from January 17 of him with a gun and a marijuana joint sticking out of his waistband, with the caption '.38 on me I do hits in my tims’. Some of the posts in question appear to have been deleted from his Facebook page, but others remain. When police arrested Aristy on Sunday, they found a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson firearm in his bedroom and more than 25 grams of marijuana in his living room packaged in 21 Ziplock bags. Hi bail is set at $150,000 and he is due in court next Friday. Police take posts to social media very seriously. ‘You make a threat on the internet, we’re going to be watching,’ 83rd Precinct Inspector Maximo Tolentino said. ‘We are going to attempt to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.’ Aristy’s attorney Fred Pratt said that his client’s Facebook posts did not constitute ‘an actual threat’ against the police. He said that many people on Facebook use the gun and police emoji together without it meaning an actual threat to officers. Police told a meeting of Bushwick Community Board 4 that Aristy has 12 prior arrests including for robbery, assault, possession of marijuana, disorderly conduct, and possession of a weapon . ‘I understand that people found what he said distasteful and uncomfortable, but he never threatened to take action against police,’ Pratt said. He had no comment on the weapon or drug charges. Aristy was already known to police and has a lengthy rap sheet. At a Bushwick Community Board 4 meeting on Thursday, Tolentino made it clear that Aristy ‘was not a good guy’ having already ‘targeted this community on numerous occasions’. He has 12 prior arrests, including for robbery, assault, possession of marijuana, disorderly conduct, and possession of a weapon. As recently as October he pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree after he attacked people on two separate occasions in robberies, once with a beer bottle and a second time  with a knife. in the first incident,  Aristy and five others repeatedly beat a man with beer bottles before taking cash and a cell phone on Greene Avenue near Wyckoff Avenue at 4:45 a.m. on May 18, 2014. Aristy is due in court on February 20 in relation to two separate robberies that took place in May 2014 in which the victims were beaten with beer bottles and had a knife held to their throat respectively . The victim suffered dizziness, bleeding, and cuts and bruises to his face, according to a criminal complaint. Within 10 days, on May 27 at 3:00 a.m., he and another person placed a knife to a man's neck, knocked him to the ground and again took cash and cell phone. Aristy’s plea deal for those crimes included six months in jail, which he has already served; five years of probation, and a court-mandated program of counseling, drug testing and school monitoring.

"A flyer advertising 80p drinks at Electric in Birmingham . Nightclub promoters have been branded 'utterly irresponsible' for advertising an event which offered drinks at just 80p each. Organisers had planned to sell cut-priced drinks at Electric in Birmingham, to coincide with the end of students exams. Online flyers boasted that the 'Twisted Monday' event would be 'Birmingham's Biggest Monday Night.' Former Health Minister Gisela Stuart, Labour MP for Edgbaston, said: 'It's utterly irresponsible, encouraging cheap heavy drinking on a Monday night. 'There's quite enough problems with overloaded A&Es. We don't need it on a Monday night with people getting drunk on cheap alcohol. 'We are increasingly coming to the point that responsible organisations already know that offering alcohol as a loss leader is irresponsible behaviour. It encourages quick, fast consumption of large amounts of alcohol.' Debbie Bannigan, chief executive of alcohol charity Swanswell, said: 'It is not just about the consumer taking responsibility. It is also up to clubs, pubs, and bars to sell alcohol responsibly, and play their part in minimising harm.' Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies said: 'We know that increased availability of cheap alcohol is fuelling problems up and down the country and it is often our hard working public servants having to mop up the mess.' In online advertising revellers were told that tickets would be priced at £4. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council, who are responsible for licensing, said the event did not appear to contravene Home Office guidelines on responsible drinking. Following widespread criticism the night, which was due to take place on February 2, has been axed. Before it was scrapped Ray Mohamed, a freelance promoter for GLM, who were marketing it, claimed the club would not allow irresponsible drinking. 'If the bar staff see that people are overly wasted, the staff would say we can't serve you anymore,' he said. 'It's up to a certain time for the 80p ones, so it's just some offer for us to pull people into the club.' Electric nightclub in Birmingham, pictured above, has since scrapped the event . Electric manager Amo Taib denied the event had been cancelled because of  irresponsible pricing concerns but admitted that it was 'not cost-effective'. He said promoters had 'jumped the bandwagon' and started advertising the night before it had been confirmed. 'As a company and as a club it's not something I wanted to do,' he said. 'It was only ever in talks.' Promoters GLM were not immediately available for comment.","Promoters marketing event at Birmingham nightclub offering 80p drinks .

"Property rent in one Californian city shot up by a staggering 20.6per cent last year, reflecting a trend across the country. According to the real estate data firm Zillow, the average monthly fee for a rental home in tech-centric Oakland is now $2,369. Overall, analysts found that U.S. rental prices were  3.3 per cent higher in December compared to the previous year. Price hikes: Property rent in Oakland, California city shot up by a staggering 20.6per cent last year, reflecting a trend across the country . Lakewood in Colorado is another city where residents have felt the hike, with monthly rentals jumping 15per cent to an average of $1,770. Experts say that because fewer Americans can afford to buy a home, demand for apartments and rental houses has pushed up prices. The share of Americans who own their homes has slipped to 64.4 percent from a peak of 69.2 percent in 2004. This is attributed to the housing market crash that triggered the Great Recession in late 2007 . 'We do not have the affordable rental housing resources to meet the demand,' said Barry Zigas, director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America, at an industry conference this week. Rental prices have risen 52per cent since 2000, while incomes for renters have only increased 25 percent, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. The higher costs make it difficult for renters to save for a down payment, which then causes them to rent for a longer period of time and delay any potential home purchases. 'You don’t have to be a housing economist to see that there is a problem there,' Humphries said. On the up: Overall, analysts found that U.S. rental prices were 3.3 per cent higher in December compared to the previous year - the graph above shows the increases since 2011 . Additional construction has yet to significantly limit price growth nationwide. Builders broke ground on 376,000 apartment complexes last year, a 10.2per cent increase from 2013, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. By contrast, single-family house construction rose just 1.4per cent last year. Rents jumped 15.4per cent in the San Francisco area to a median monthly cost of $3,031, an increased mirrored by San Jose where prices were up 14.5per cent to $3,187 a month. Rents climbed 10.5per cent in Denver to $1,817 a month. Kansas City also notched a substantial 8.5per cent gain to $1,204 a month. Still, tenants are catching a break elsewhere. In Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, rents rose by less than 2.2per cent. Rents in Minnesota’s Twin Cities area ticked up a mere 0.1per cent this past year to $1,501.","The average monthly fee for a home in tech-centric Oakland is now $2,369 .

David Irvine trawls thrift shops, yard sales and even street curbs for unwanted paintings and prints that he can transform into innovative works of art as a part of his Re-Directed series. 'It's been a popular series, because of the upcycling and humor and all that,' he told The Guardian. 'I think a lot of people can relate to the themes and pop culture.' Legendary figure: Toronto-based artist David Irvine paints pop culture icons, like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters, onto paintings and prints he finds at thrift stores and yard sales . Innovative artist: Mr Irvine (pictured) features the pieces from his Re-Directed series on his website The Gnarled Branch . Meat market: The artist added slabs of steak to this otherwise drab painting of a house in the woods . Mr. Irvine, who features his work on his website The Gnarled Branch, has started selling the original pieces from the series on Etsy as the demand for his work continues to grow.

While Mr Irvine adds his own special touches to each work of art, he notes on his website that he will never paint over the original artist's signature. The artist said that he enjoys using old salvaged prints as medium for his work because there is 'a certain nostalgia to them'. 'I really like the old-style frames,' he said. 'You just don't see these in department stores any more.' For those who have a particular image or idea in their mind, Mr Irvine accepts commissions.

"A mother-of-two woke from being sedated to discover all her top teeth had been removed, despite her visiting the dentist to have a new crown fitted. Nicki Stanley was plagued by poor dental health for years, and expected to have new crowns fitted when she visited the dentist. While the 46-year-old was deeply sedated, all her upper teeth were removed. She was left needing to wear ill-fitting dentures or face going toothless, and became reluctant to leave her home. But Ms Stanley can now smile with confidence once more after a pioneering cosmetic dentist stepped in, fitting tooth implants. 'When I lost all my teeth, it was like losing my personality,' she said. 'I couldn't even bring myself to go out in public - with my new smile, I'm a completely different person.' Nicki Stanley, 46, from south London woke after being sedated in the dentist's chair to discover all her top teeth had been removed unexpectedly . Ms Stanley said she had only visited the dentist to have new crowns fitted and didn't expect to leave toothless. For five years she became a recluse, too embarrassed to leave her home . Ms Stanley believes her dental problems stem from her mother's use of antibiotics while she was pregnant. Despite always looking after her teeth, she found herself needing fillings and other work. Terrified of being in the dentist's chair, she was deeply sedated ahead of the dentist performing what Ms Stanley believed would be crown work. But instead the mother-of-two woke to find every tooth from her upper gum was missing. For six years her ill-fitting dentures plagued Ms Stanley, causing her to become a recluse, only leaving the house to go to work as a teaching assistant. Scarred by her experience, she refused to step foot inside a dentist surgery, and as a result failed to seek treatment for her decaying bottom teeth. The majority fell out and she ended up with just five teeth on her bottom gum. Now, thanks to Harley Street dental surgeon brothers Dr Anthony Zybutz and Dr Michael Zybutz from Total Dental Care, Ms Stanley has her smile back. The brothers were forced to remove all her remaining teeth, and the rotten stumps from her upper gum during an eight-hour operation worth £30,000. 'I had tried everything to keep my teeth in good shape. I had special fluoride toothpaste, I visited the dentist as often as I could - but nothing worked,' Ms Stanley said. 'I only had six teeth left on the top but it was enough to keep crowns and not need dentures - that was my worst nightmare. 'When I left the surgery I was still a bit confused from the sedation - when you're in that state you haven't got a clue what is going on. 'It was only when I got home and came round after three or four hours of sleep that I realised what had happened. 'The horror when I started feeling my mouth and found nothing was unimaginable. But Ms Stanley now has her smile back after Harley Street dentists spent eight hours fitting implants . 'Although I went back a few weeks later to have a dental plate fitted they were uncomfortable and almost impossible to do anything with. 'She did her best but nothing could make them stick in my mouth. 'For five years I barely left the house and I was never photographed - I'd never been so embarrassed. 'And I was so scared of going back to the dentist that I haven't been able to get my bottom teeth sorted either. 'I had no quality of life and I constantly cancelled plans so that I didn't have to interact with other people and expose my fangs. 'I rarely spoke if I didn't have my hand covering my mouth. 'The difference having tooth implants - I've never been happier. 'I'm out every weekend celebrating my new smile. 'I've never been able to go around my head so high until now.' Dr Anthony Zybutz performs more than 80 dental implant procedures a year. He said: 'Nicki had all of her remaining teeth removed - and she didn't have that many left - and a full set of dental implants. 'For someone so young to have all her teeth removed is quite rare - it's really much more common for people in their 70s or 80s who would have had all their teeth removed preventatively. 'This is not a simple procedure and but we're a specialist clinic. 'It's absolutely brilliant to see the difference it has made to Nicki. 'Her new confidence is incredible and I'm so pleased to see how life-changing it has been for her.'","Nicki Stanley visited the dentist to have new crowns fitted on her teeth .

Twenty-year-old John Corcoran IV of Glenolden, Pennsylvania, molested more than a dozen children over two years. The attacks took place at his home, as well as in the showers of a YMCA locker room, and on bonfires outside a local historical site, the Lower Swedish Cabin in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, authorities said. Corcoran (pictured center) is now charged with luring and raping 14 children aged between eight and 14 over a two-year period, including while he was out on bail for earlier arson charges . ""(He) lured these vulnerable children under the guise of his friendship and then exploited them with the promise of gifts only to then sexually exploit and abuse them,"" Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. Corcoran has been in jail since August on the arson charges, in which he's accused of torching three abandoned buildings before arriving on the scene to help fight them. The new allegations surfaced after a mother found her child in possession of pornography. Her child said it came from Corcoran and accused him of sexual abuse. The investigation led to 13 other children, aged eight to 14, who said they were also abused. Prosecutors said the grooming and sexual assaults happened over the last two years, some occurred even while he was out on bail for the arson charges NBC 10 Philadelphia reports.

"Russia did kill dissident Alexander Litvinenko in a ‘state execution’, US spies have claimed. American intelligence secretly intercepted messages between those involved in the murder, it was reported last night. The intelligence provided the key evidence of an execution, a source claimed. Scroll down for video . Alexander Litvinenko, the ex-KGB agent poisoned in London in 2006, has claimed Russian President Vladamir Putin and Ukranian crime boss Semion Mogilevich had a 'good relationship' America’s National Security Agency (NSA) got hold of messages between key individuals in London and Moscow from the time that the former Russian spy was poisoned with radioactive material in London in 2006. The source told The Telegraph the evidence would have been 'inadmissible' in court, but that British authorities were 'confident that this was a state execution'. The revelation comes hours after it was revealed Mr Litvinenko, who died after drinking poisoned tea in a London hotel, had linked Russian president Vladamir Putin to one of the world's most wanted criminals from beyond the grave. Mr Litvinenko, a vocal Kremlin critic, claims on a tape made a year before his death in 2006 that Putin and Ukranian crime boss Semion Mogilevich had a 'good relationship'. Mr Litvinenko had been investigating the links between the Russian mafia and Italian politicians . Mogilevich has been linked to a string of offences, said to run from prostitution rings to contract murders and trading in nuclear material. In the tape, Mr Litvinenko adds another charge to the sheet: he claims Mogilevich - who he was investigating - was selling arms to Al Qaeda. The recording, made in November 2005 and uncovered by The Telegraph, Mr Litvinenko can be heard saying: In the past, I have given a lot of information about Semion Mogilevich to Mario Scarmella. 'Now Semion Mogilevich is on the FBI's most wanted list. 'And Mogilevich has a good relationship with Russian President Valdimir Putin since 1994 or 1993. 'And Mogilevich has contact with Al Qaeda. 'And Simon Mogilevich sells weapons to Al Qaeda.' In the tape, Mr Litvinenko also claims he gave Mr Scarmella -  a consultant for the Mitrokhin Commission, which was investigating links between the Russian mafia and Italian politicians - information about a former KGB officer who has links with Al Qaeda. He says the agent also had links to Russia’s foreign intelligence and state security services, and had used them to influence Chechen rebels. He claims Mogilevich (pictured) had sold weapons to terrorist group Al Qaeda . Mr Litvinenko goes on to claim he was blackmailed after handing over the intelligence. In the recording, Mr Litvinenko alleges the Russian special services asked for his brother to be arrested and extradited back home, following arrests made using information he had given to Mr Scarmella. Mr Litvinenko, who was 43, died three weeks after drinking tea poisoned with a rare radioactive isotope in November 2006. The family have said they believe the Russian government was involved in his murder. Mr Litvinenko died three weeks after being poisoned by polonium-210, which was put in his tea, a year after the recording was made . British police suspect ex-KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy, who has denied any involvement, and Dmitry Kovtun slipped polonium-210 into Litvinenko's tea when they met him at the Millennium Hotel in central London. Russia has always denied any involvement in the death of Mr Litvinenko. who had worked for MI6 for several years, as well as by the Spanish security services to help investigate Russian mafia activities. A public inquiry into his death finally begins in the British capital next week, and the judge who will oversee the inquiry has already cited a 'prima facie case' indicating Russian involvement.","'Electronic communications' said to prove .

Friends . said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for . selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training . for battle. Last . month a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16 . how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two . years said: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... they end up in Syria.’ The twins’ parents raised the alarm after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing. A . former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not . allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’. Support: Visitors arrive at the family home yesterday, but the girls' parents have not spoken publicly . Others . recalled that the twins wore headscarves when they were as young as . nine. But Rhea Headlam, who sat next to Zahra in primary school, said . they were ‘just normal teenage girls’. ‘I’m really shocked – I used to bump into them at Primark,’ she added. ‘They were both really clever.’ Last . summer Salma achieved 13 GCSEs – 11 of them at grades A* to C – while .

They . went on to study at Connell Sixth Form College, where fellow students . said they hoped to follow in the footsteps of their elder sister Hafsa, . 25, who is at medical school in Denmark after graduating from Manchester . University. ‘The twins both have aspirations to become doctors – that is their ambition,’ said one. Another . claimed it was ‘typical’ of the girls to head to Syria ‘after they had . finished term’, adding: ‘They wouldn’t want to mess up their education. ‘I’m shocked they have gone. They didn’t seem to be radical or extremist in their views.’ The girls’ devoutly Muslim Somali refugee parents and their 11 children had been moved from an estate made famous by the TV series Shameless to an upmarket suburb, after telling the council they needed more bedrooms. They were given a six-bedroom end-terrace despite the protests of the existing tenant. Police probe: Officers were seen leaving the house. The large back and front gardens were strewn with discarded household items and children's plastic toys . Neighbours said the twins’ parents were keen to share elements of Somalian culture with them, taking round dishes of traditional delicacies for them to try. The twins’ father Ibrahim is understood to teach at a nearby mosque, where leaders this week issued a statement repudiating extremism and opposing violence of all kinds. Mohammed Shafiq, of the Ramadan Foundation, said the family were moderate Muslims who know all about the dangers of war-torn countries. ‘They were desperately unhappy to discover [their son] had gone to Syria, and they thought they were keeping a watchful eye on their other children. Then this happens,’ he said. Sources believe Salma and Zahra were inspired by their brother’s transformation into a jihadi fighter, and became radicalised themselves while viewing extremist Islamist material online. According to police sources, their brother also travelled to the family’s native Somalia, where he may have linked up with another Islamist terror group al-Shabab. A friend told The Sun the brother was known for his ability to recite long passages of the Koran. Officers are investigating how the girls funded their own trip, over fears they have been bankrolled by jihadi fighters who want them as their wives. As many as 1,500 Britons may have travelled to Syria to fight alongside rebels. Many of them have posted messages online promising to use their ‘terror skills’ if they return to Britain.","Twins Salma and Zahra Halane posted about learning to use guns .

"Actor Matt Damon has lent his support to a new campaign to help the 750 million people in the world who still do not have access to clean water. In a video for Stella Artois and Water.org, the Bourne Identity actor, 44, reveals the shocking statistic that women around the world are walking a total of 200 MILLION hours a day just to collect fresh water. The crisis disproportionately affects women as they are often the ones who are called upon to provide supplies for their families. Scroll down for video . In moving photographs taken by Stella Artois and Water.org women are seen walking to supply their families with clean drinking water . Matt states in the video: 'What if we could give them that time back and stop those journeys so they can start news ones of their own?' Images of Matt walking alongside a reservoir contrast to the poignant ones of women in India walking for miles to reach a source of fresh water. The women are heard saying: 'Everybody needs water. People can not live without clean water. It is very difficult for us to get water, very difficult.' In order to help them, Matt, Stella Artois and Water.org have joined forces to urge people to 'Buy a Lady a Drink'. And although it may sound like an odd union - a beer company known for it's laddish audience, coming together with a world renowned charity, both Stella and Water.org hope with their partnership they can make a change. They have designed four special drinks chalices - the purchase of which will provide water to one person for five years. The actor has joined up with Stella and Water.org to front the charity campaign . Stella Artois and Water.org have designed chalices, the sales of which will go to provide clean drinking water to people in need . Film star Matt Damon is supporting the campaign to bring clean water to women around the world . Talking about his work with Water.org co-founder Gary White, Matt said: 'Over the years, we have travelled together to several developing countries, meeting thousands of women and young girls who shared their dreams of becoming a doctor, nurse, lawyer or teacher. 'Many of our conversations took place while tracing the long and often difficult path these women and young girls walked every day to secure water for their families. 'We were deeply moved by their aspirations, but it was difficult to ignore the reality that the number of hours they spend on their journeys to secure water would effectively destroy their dreams.' He added: 'One of the Stella Artois films tells the story of Anita. Anita had a water tap installed in her home a year ago. 'Having water available at the start of every day has allowed Anita to work at the family business and plant crops, avoiding the long journey to the centre of Nagpur to shop at market for vegetables. 'Her children no longer miss school because of the need to line up at a local water source waiting for water that never comes.' As well as launching the campaign Stella have also donated $1.2million to Water.org. The three chalices were inspired by traditional handcrafted objects from three of the developing countries where Water.org operates, including textiles from India, baskets from Ethiopia and pottery from Honduras.

"It's lucky most visitors to this week's Davos conference are billionaires - because Switzerland has been named the most expensive place in the world to buy a Big Mac. The famous burgers cost 6.50 Swiss francs in the Alpine country - that works out at more than £5 ($7.50) for the McDonald's sandwich alone. Norway has the second most expensive Big Mac in the world at £4.40($6.50), followed by Denmark, Brazil and the US, according to the so-called Big Mac index. Scroll down for video . A Big Mac in Switzerland now costs the equivalent of nearly $8 - around £5 in British money, it emerged today . The  index was created by The Economist magazine in 1986 as a way of comparing the relative values of different currencies. By comparing a product which is almost perfectly identical and on sale around the world, experts hoped to show the 'purchasing power' of each nation's money. The price of Big Macs is compared against the standard US price for the product - which is currently $4.79, about £3.19 in sterling. The relative price of the iconic burger in Britain - now £2.69 in sterling - has fallen compared to other currencies in recent months. Meanwhile in Russia - whose currency has plummeted amid a fall in the price of oil and sanctions over the annexation of Crimea - Big Macs are cheaper than ever. Consumers in Vladimir Putin's country can now pick one of the burgers for the equivalent of $1.36 - just 91p, which is cheaper than a basic McDonald's hamburger in the UK. A fall in the rouble means Russia is one of the  cheapest places to buy the burgers - which cost just 91p there . The prolonged crisis in the Eurozone means the relative cost of a Big Mac on the Continent has also fallen in recent months and is now worth $4.26, or £2.84. The index's latest results were released as business and political leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Switzerland's Big Mac price has risen in the last six months and looks set to increase further as the country's currency continues to boom. The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 per cent to 0.81 against the euro last week following the Swiss National Bank's decision to remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro. It means Swiss ski resorts are being forced to cut prices by up to 20 per cent in a desperate bid to lure back holidaymakers. The currency surge means a British visitor now has to pay £80 more for their week-long lift pass bringing the total to £380, while a single day pass went up to around £60. The cost of enjoying just a small glass of beer while taking in the majestic view of the Matterhorn mountain jumped by around £1.30 to £4.60. The Big Mac was chosen for the 'purchasing power' index because it is almost identical around the world (pictured: A McDonald's in Bangkok, Thailand)","Big Mac index tests the relative price of currencies around the world .

"Monday evening is set to see Earth's closet call with an asteroid until 2027. The asteroid, designated 2004 BL86, will safely pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon on January 26 - so close. It will be the closest by any known space rock this large until asteroid 1999 AN10 flies past Earth in 2027. Scroll down for animation . Where to watch: Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time: from 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday evening, January 26th, until about 1 a.m. EST on the 27th. Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time: from 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday evening, January 26th, until about 1 a.m. EST on the 27th. During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. EST. From its reflected brightness, astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile (0.5 kilometers) in size. At the time of its closest approach on January 26, the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth. 'Monday, January 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to Earth for at least the next 200 years,' said Don Yeomans, who is retiring as manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, after 16 years in the position. 'And while it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' Observers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa have the best seats for seeing this interloper during its brightest time: from 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday evening, January 26th, until about 1 a.m. EST on the 27th. During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. EST. Because it's relatively large, 2004 BL86 will brighten rapidly as it approaches Earth. But this object should be bright enough to follow with a 3- or 4-inch-diameter telescope as it moves among the stars. 'To track down the asteroid, you'll need a detailed star chart that shows the exact path of 2004 BL86,' explains Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine. 'Our charts were specially prepared for this event.' The asteroid's closest approach to Earth actually occurs hours earlier, around 11 a.m. EST on the 26th. lmost exactly when it becomes brightest (about 9th magnitude), asteroid 2004 BL86 skirts very close to the Beehive Cluster, M44. During this time 2004 BL86 will be heading northward through the dim constellation Cancer. It skims the eastern edge of a star cluster called the Beehive (or Messier 44) from about midnight to 12:30 a.m. EST. The asteroid orbits the Sun every 1.84 years. It was discovered 11 years ago by the LINEAR telescope in New Mexico, which was designed to hunt for such objects. Despite the asteroid's two close visits then and now, it won't approach Earth again this closely for another 200 years. Astronomers have also assigned this asteroid a permanent number, 357439, but it has not yet been named. But at that time it's predicted to be somewhat dimmer, about magnitude 10, because Earth will see only a portion of its illuminated side. The asteroid brightens, despite the increasing distance, because we're seeing its face become more fully illuminated. 'One good technique for fast-movers like 2004 BL86 is to identify and lock onto a star along its path,' explains Kelly Beatty, also a Sky & Telescope senior editor. 'Then just watch at the time that the asteroid is predicted to pass by that particular star.' One way NASA scientists plan to learn more about 2004 BL86 is to observe it with microwaves. NASA's Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to Earth. 'When we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer Lance Benner of JPL, the principal investigator for the Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'At present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' Asteroid 2004 BL86 was initially discovered on Jan. 30, 2004 by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey in White Sands, New Mexico. The asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said Yeomans. 'Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.' See the Asteroid's route below .

"The fully-released 911 call from a mother, who cradled a dying teenage boy with multiple stab wounds, has revealed horrific details of the victim's injuries. Lucas Cavanaugh, 17, was repeatedly knifed on Sunday in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, allegedly by the boyfriend of a girl he had sent a Snapchat message. The girl's mother, Robynn Davis, was the first to find the teenager lying wounded outside her home and made a hysterical call to 911. She wept to the dispatcher: 'He's been stabbed multiple times. It's everywhere [the blood].... He's on his side and his intestines are hanging outside of his body... He's taking deep, deep breathes... He's disemboweled.' Scroll down for the audiotape of the 911 call . Lucas Cavanaugh, 17, passed away on Sunday after being stabbed multiple times allegedly by the boyfriend of a girl he had sent a Snapchat message . Ms Davis begged the victim, identified as 17-year-old Lucas Cavanaugh, not to die, as she urged police to hurry as the alleged attacker, 16-year-old Matthew Fischer, was still on the loose. According to the recording, Ms Davis can be heard saying: 'He's in the house, he's somewhere. He's my daughter's boyfriend.' She can be heard on the eight-minute tape reassuring the teenage boy and pleading with him. 'Lucas, baby, please, oh God. Are you alive? Yes, you are. Please, please let's make it. 'He's got a pulse and he is breathing but he's completely unconscious. He has been stabbed right in his stomach,' she added to the 911 dispatcher. Matthew Fischer, 16, has been charged with murder over the fatal stabbing of classmate, 17-year-old Lucas Cavanaugh, on Sunday in Park West, South Carolina . An incident report released by police on Tuesday described how an officer responding to the scene found Cavanaugh lying in the middle of the street with a stomach wound and two women sitting near him. The stabbing allegedly took place because a teenage girl's boyfriend was upset about a Snapchat message sent by the victim. Matthew Joseph Fischer, 16, of Mount Pleasant was visiting his girlfriend's home in Park West near Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday when he saw a message from Cavanaugh on her iPod, detectives said. The message was sent through Snapchat, a photo-and-text app on which messages are visible for only a brief time. The message angered Fischer, according to an arrest affidavit. Officials have not released details about the content of the message. 'The defendant took the iPod and contacted the victim. Words were exchanged at which point the defendant told the victim 'Come over 'and 'I'll kill you man,' the affidavit said. A desperate 911 call was released of the teenage girl's mother begging police to hurry as she tried to save the life of Lucas Cavanaugh (pictured) Cavanaugh, of nearby Sullivan's Islands, came to the girl's house, and the two fought, authorities said. 'During the altercation, the defendant produced a knife from his right pant pocket and proceeded to stab the victim in the torso, resulting in death,' the affidavit said. One of the women brought the officer a knife and identified it as the weapon, according to the report. She said a youth had come to her house with a bloody knife shortly after the incident, dropped the knife and run off. Fischer was later arrested at the scene while sitting in his mother's car, authorities said. He was forced out of the car at gunpoint and taken into custody. Fischer is charged as an adult with murder and possession of a knife. He was denied bond on Monday. He and Cavanaugh attended Wando High School. The teenager's body will be laid to rest on Friday after a private funeral at The Holy Cross Episcopal Church on Sullivan's Island. The family held a public visitation on Thursday and the night before, the teen's friends gathered on a local beach to bid farewell to him, releasing balloons and lanterns and covering his beloved car in flowers. The 17-year-old was remembered as 'well-liked, kind and a free spirit' with a passion for cars which he channeled into restoring his 1981 corvette. He wanted to go on to study automotive engineering and design at the University of Cincinnati. 'It's been a tough time for me and my family,' said his father, David Cavanaugh, ABC reported. 'But what you all did for Luke is just so wonderful. And no matter how dark this time is right now I am just so touched to see everyone come here. I had no idea that Luke touched so many people. Sometimes as a father you just don't see that. Luke was a good kid.' Friends of the victim gathered on a South Carolina beach on Wednesday night to bid a sad farewell to their friend, releasing balloons and lanterns .","The girl's mother, Robynn Davis, can be heard in a hysterical 911 call on Sunday as she tries to save the life of victim Lucas Cavanaugh, 17 .

"A hospital in southern Italy arranged for a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage so that she could claim compensation for the loss of the unborn baby in a fake road traffic accident, it is alleged. Investigators say that a doctor deliberately induced the birth of the heavily pregnant 37-year-old woman, as part of a huge road traffic accident insurance scam at the Corigliano Calabro hospital in the southern region of Calabria. The woman deliberately got pregnant, then at seven months presented herself at the emergency room claiming to have had a car crash, it is alleged.

The foetus was alive when it was born, they claimed, but was denied oxygen and left to die. The head of road traffic police in the province of Cosenza, Domenico Provenzano, told a press conference, 'All it would have taken was a mouthful of oxygen and the baby would be alive today.' The 57-year-old doctor and the pregnant woman split the insurance payout, it is alleged. They are now both under house arrest along with two other people accused of infanticide, forgery, fraud, embezzlement and corruption. The horrific case came to light as part of an investigation into 144 people connected to an insurance scam at the hospital worth millions of euros. According to the investigators doctors at the hospital produced medical certificates for non-existent conditions and details of treatment that never took place, while a radiologist attributed X-rays of injured patients to healthy people.","Investigators say a 37-year-old woman had deliberately got herself pregnant .

"Lord Saatchi and his late wife Josephine Hart, who died after a long struggle with ovarian cancer . A controversial new law allowing doctors to use experimental drugs on dying cancer sufferers is set to clear a major Parliamentary hurdle today. Conservative peer Lord Saatchi has reached a deal with opponents of his bill, which gives doctors the right to try innovative new medicines to stop patients suffering years of ‘brutal’ chemotherapy. It means the proposal is likely to be backed by the House of Lords today, paving the way for a Commons vote before the election in May. Lord Saatchi, the advertising mogul, could save people suffering the ‘horror and indignities of brutal chemotherapy and radiation treatment’. The peer is pushing for changes in the law following the death of his wife Josephine Hart from ovarian cancer in 2011. The Bill has been held up for months amid widespread concerns in the medical profession that it does not provide enough protections for patients. It will now go to the Commons as long as there is no last-minute opposition. It is thought that a vote could take place before the general election. Lord Saatchi said: ‘Those condemned to death by cancer suffer a worse fate than the worst mass murderer. ‘While they await death, they suffer the horror and indignities of brutal chemotherapy and radiation treatment. ‘The drugs, the cycles of their administration, and the surgical procedures are often decades old. They create the same symptoms as the disease – nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and fatigue.’ He said allowing doctors to use untested new drugs could save lives rather than simply delay death. Opponents of the bill – including the Labour peer and scientist Lord Winston – said the bill did not provide enough protection for patients. But after talks with Lord Winston a new protection – meaning doctors will need seek the approval of at least one other medical professional before trying an innovative drug. Lord Saatchi said peers ‘on all sides of the House’ are now expected to support his bill. He told the Telegraph: ‘By the end of today the Medical Innovation Bill will have been forensically examined, tested and improved by my fellow peers on four separate occasions. ‘Those peers number among them some of the greatest legal and medical minds in this country, as well as representatives of patient groups and medical charities.’ Lord Saatchi said allowing doctors to use untested new drugs could save lives rather than simply delay death . Professor Lord Robert Winston, a Labour peer, is concerned that the new law does not offer enough protection for patients . Lord Saatchi added: ‘What the Bill will do is offer the same protection to a doctor who offers an innovative treatment to the dying patient – in advance of the treatment taking place, as long as they can get the support of at least one other relevantly qualified doctor. ‘It will encourage them to think beyond the standard treatment. It will allow them to see what else might – only might, for there are no guarantees – make a difference to the dying patient. ‘It will change the culture of defensive medicine to one where the balance of risk is gently recalibrated making it permissible to consider trying something new, something less well documented than the well-worn path to death.’","Tory peer Lord Saatchi has reached a deal with opponents of his bill .

"A schoolgirl was found hanged in woodland by her friends after they formed a late-night search party using the torch function on their mobile phones to find her, a inquest heard today. Josie Herniman's three best friends discovered the 15-year-old's body after her distraught mother raised the alarm when she failed to return home. The trio searched streets around her home looking for Josie, before Adele Walker flagged down her father Craig's car and they headed to local woodland. Josie Herniman, pictured, went missing from her Weston-super-Mare home on September 29 last year . Three of Miss Herniman's friends used their mobile phones to search woodland near Somerset home . The girls used the lights on their mobile phone to pick through the undergrowth before eventually discovering Miss Herniman's body. Paramedics attempted to resuscitate Miss Herniman but she was declared dead at the scene. In a written statement to the inquest, Mr Walker told the court: 'I asked Adele where they were going and she replied heard towards the woods. 'Adele asked for the group to be dropped off in the entrance way. I turned around and parked. 'I walked quickly towards the woods, as I looked I could see and hear the children's voices in the woods. 'I could see them because they were all using their mobile phones as a source of light.' Mr Walker added: 'As I went into the woods I started to shout 'Adele where are you?' I heard a child shout ""she's dead"". 'At this point I was walking through the woods towards the children screaming. I was there for approximately one minute before I saw the mobile phone lights. 'I walked past Adele and asked where Josie was, and she replied ""she is dead"". 'I ascended a steep bank, maybe about five or six foot high. I could see her bag at the bottom of a tree.' The inquest at Flax Bourton Court, near Bristol, heard Josie was found in Oldmixon Woods, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, at 9.29pm, in September 29 last year. The inquest heard that Miss Herniman had an argument with her boyfriend on the day of her death, but, this was nothing out of the ordinary and she was 'no more upset than a young girl would be'. Friends left floral tributes near the scene of September's tragedy where Miss Herniman lost her life . Detective Sergeant Martin Longden, who investigated Miss Herniman's death, said: 'One of the things that was evident through really strong grounds on social media was the suggestion Josie was being bullied. 'Myself and my team, throughout the whole investigation, found no evidence whatsoever.' He added: 'It became very clear very quickly from interviewing her friends that she was a well-loved individual by both her parents. 'She had a large circle of friends and was well thought of.' DS Longden continued: 'Josie had revealed to some close friends that she may have suffered some form of unwarranted sexual advances by an individual who she never disclosed. 'It reportedly happened about the same time of Halloween when this occurred. My conclusions were that you have a 15-year-old girl who is intelligent, well loved and popular. 'Myself, and my team, have really struggled to identify a specific cause as to why Josie would actually go forward and go through with an incident like this.' Reaching a narrative conclusion, Coroner Maria Voisin, said there was no evidence that Miss Herniman had intended to take her own life.","Josie Herniman left her home in Weston-super-Mare on September 29 .

"Millions of British holidaymakers will enjoy cheaper European breaks this summer with the euro forecast to plunge to a 13-year low against the pound. Families will get far more ‘bang for their buck’ over the next few months after it was announced that around £850billion will be pumped into the eurozone’s struggling economy. The injection of cash by the European Central Bank will lower the value of the euro. This means everything from restaurant meals and sightseeing tours to hotel stays and property will be cheaper for Britons. Families will get far more ‘bang for their buck’ over the next few months after it was announced that around £850billion will be pumped into the eurozone’s struggling economy, lowering the value of the euro . The ECB’s money-printing programme – known as quantitative easing – will not begin until March, but the euro has fallen against the pound in anticipation, meaning Britons are already benefiting. Today, £1 will buy 1.34 euros – the highest figure for seven years – compared with only 1.17 euros last year and 1.06 euros in 2009. And experts believe the euro will continue to fall. They predict that by July £1 could buy up to 1.55 euros, a 13-year high. That means that buying 500 euros in the summer could cost £322, compared with £400 at the same time last year. Experts believe the euro will continue to fall and predict that by July £1 could buy up to 1.55 euros . The news is likely to lead to a rush on European breaks rather than ‘staycations’ or trips to the US. Daily Mail research found that at this exchange rate a family of four could save £245 on a seven-night city break in Paris this July compared with July last year. Economist Harry Adams, at foreign exchange specialists Argentex, said: ‘The euro has already considerably weakened against the pound and will continue to do so over the next six months. 'We estimate that by July, we could be seeing the euro at about 1.55 against the pound – the cheapest the euro has been since 2002.’ Economist Ben Brettell, of financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Quantitative easing will increase the supply of euros into the European financial system, reducing the price of it.’ Although the weaker euro will help holidaymakers, it is bad for businesses that export to Europe, because it means their goods are more expensive to buy for customers on the Continent. As a result they may sell less in the eurozone. Quantitative easing will continue until at least September next year. It is a last-ditch bid to kick-start growth and step up the fight against deflation. Buying 500 euros in the summer could cost £322, compared with £400 at the same time last year . The European Central Bank will inject around £45billion a month into the eurozone’s financial system by buying up government and corporate bonds across the 19 countries of the single currency bloc. But it will be printing only 20 per cent of the cash, leaving decisions on the rest to national banks throughout the zone. Greece, in particular, has struggled through a deep recession and a quarter of its workforce is unemployed. Its economic situation is so dire that it has been locked out of the latest quantitative easing for now because of limits on how much debt its central bank can buy. The Left-wing party Syriza is expected to win Greece’s general election tomorrow. Its leader, Alexis Tsipras, wants to end austerity measures and is calling for most of Greece’s debt to be written off. This would be unpopular with other EU leaders and some experts believe that if a compromise cannot be reached then Greece could default on its debt and even leave the euro.","The euro is forecast to plunge to a 13-year low against the pound .

"A Princeton professor has joined a group of US intellectuals offering to take 100 lashes each for a Saudi blogger who is being punished over his criticism of the country's hardline clerics. Robert P George, who is the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University and the vice-chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, has volunteered to take the penalty on behalf of Raif Badawi. He joins six other advocates for religious freedom, including Dr Zuhdi Jasser, who is the President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy. Scroll down for video . Robert P George, left, a leading professor at Princeton University, has joined six other advocates for religious freedom who have offered to take 100 lashes each on behalf of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, right . Dr Zuhdi Jasser, who is the President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, a Syrian-American Muslim activist and a US Navy veteran, is also offering to take a flogging for Mr Badawi . Mr Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in prison, a £177,000 fine and 1,000 lashes after criticizing Saudi Arabia's powerful clerics on his blog. The 31-year-old is facing 20 weekly floggings of 50 lashes each. The first was almost two weeks ago - but the second was postponed on medical grounds. In a letter to the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Professor George and his fellow advocates call for the immediate release of Mr Badawi. They ask that if Mr Badawi is not relieved of his punishment, they will take the flogging for him. The other signatories are Mary Ann Glendon, of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, Hannah Rosenthal, CEO of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation, Daniel Mark, an assistant professor at Villanova University, Eric Schwartz, Dean of the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota and, Katrina Lantos Swett, President of the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice. Mary Ann Glendon, left, of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Hannah Rosenthal, right, CEO of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation, are calling for an end to the 'grave injustice' Saudi Arabia has been accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' for delaying Mr Badawi's sentence so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again . In the letter, the hypocrisy of Saudi Arabian officials is highlighted. They note that officials attended the recent march in Paris in support of human rights and civil liberties and in memory of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Cacher market massacres - while in their country, Mr Badawi has been dealt an 'unjust' punishment which violates those same rights. 'Raif Badawi stands condemned under rules that flagrantly violate these human rights and civil liberties and is being subjected to an unspeakably cruel punishment of 1000 lashes,' the letter says. 'We call on the government of the Kingdom to put a halt to this grave injustice.' It adds: 'Compassion, a virtue honored in Islam as well as in Christianity, Judaism, and other faiths, is defined as “suffering with another.” 'We are persons of different faiths, yet we are united in a sense of obligation to condemn and resist injustice and to suffer with its victims, if need be. 'We therefore make the following request. If your government will not remit the punishment of Raif Badawi, we respectfully ask that you permit each of us to take 100 of the lashes that would be given to him. 'We would rather share in his victimization than stand by and watch him being cruelly tortured.' The letter, posted on the American Islamic Forum for Democracy's website, dated January 20, is addressed to   Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the US.

Professor George and his fellow advocates, including Eric Schwartz,  pictured, ask that if Mr Badawi is not relieved of his punishment, they will take the flogging for him . The group said: 'AIFD has long stood with Raif and has been calling for the U.S. to do more on his behalf since his egregious arrest, conviction, and sentencing. 'AIFD finds no difference between the crimes committed by the Islamist terrorists in Paris who assassinated cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo in Paris and the crimes against humanity committed by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the name of blasphemy against innocent heroes for religious liberty like Raif Badawi. Mr Badawi's official crime was to insult Islam but supporters say his real offence was to criticize the country's powerful Sunni clerics on his blog. Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone is believed to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi is hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch. Mr Badawi's wife Ensaf Haider, who fled to Canada, said after seeing the video: 'Every lash killed me' The father-of-three faces being flogged 50 times each Friday for 20 weeks. His wife is living as a refugee in Canada with their three children, and fears the floggings may kill him . Mr Badawi's wife Ensaf Haidar, who fled to Canada with their children, says he started a forum that was simply meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me.' Yesterday, Amnesty International repeated its calls for the 'torture' so be unconditionally stopped. The organisation's Middle East deputy director, Said Boumedouha, said: 'Instead of continuing to torment Raif Badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated assessments the authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally. 'Raif Badawi is still at risk, there is no way of knowing whether the Saudi Arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead.'

"It's showtime for Pluto. Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft has travelled three billion miles and is nearing the end of its nine-year journey to the dwarf planet. And on Sunday it will begin photographing the mysterious, unexplored, icy world. The first pictures will reveal little more than bright dots - New Horizons is still more than 100 million miles from Pluto. There remain many unanswered questions about Pluto. The New Horizons probe (artist's impression pictured) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on July 15, 2015 . But the images, taken against star fields, will help scientists gauge the remaining distance and keep the grand piano-sized robot on track for a July flyby. It is humanity's first trip to Pluto, and scientists are eager to start exploring. 'New Horizons has been a mission of delayed gratification in many respects, and it's finally happening now,' said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. 'It's going to be a sprint for the next seven months, basically, to the finish line,' he said Friday. 'We can't wait to turn Pluto into a real world, instead of just a little pixelated blob.' This combination of images made by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2002 and 2003 shows Pluto at different angles. Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft is nearing the end of its nine-year voyage to Pluto . Launched from Cape Canaveral in January 2006 on a $700 million mission, New Horizons awoke from its last hibernation period early last month. Flight controllers have spent the past several weeks getting the spacecraft ready for the final but most important leg of its journey. 'We have been working on this project, some people, for over a quarter of their careers, to make this mission happen,' said project manager Glen Fountain of the Applied Physics Lab, 'and now we're about to hit the mother lode.' The spacecraft's long-range reconnaissance imager will take hundreds of pictures of Pluto over the coming months. It snapped pictures last summer, before going into hibernation, but these new ones should be considerably brighter. As New Horizons travelled towards Pluto, it captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon, Charon. The New Horizons spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015. The 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles (429 million to 422 million km). Put together, the footage covers Pluto and almost one full rotation of its largest moon, Charon, which orbits 11,200 miles (about 18,000km) above the dwarf planet's surface. Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on Pluto's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine-tune the distance that New Horizons will fly past Pluto and its moons. Pluto's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images, but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target. It will be a few days before the new images are beamed back to Earth; scientists expect to release them publicly in early February. By May, New Horizons' photos should equal and then surpass the ones taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, with pictures of the plutoid and its moons improving with each passing day. The real payoff will come when New Horizons flies by Pluto on July 14 at a distance of 7,700 miles and speed of nearly 31,000 mph. It will whip past Charon, Pluto's largest moon, from 18,000 miles out. Scientists have no idea, really, what Pluto looks like way out in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune's orbit. Pluto is the biggest object in the Kuiper Belt. Together with mega-moon, Charon, roughly half Pluto's size, the two orbs could fit inside the United States with room to spare. Five moons have been found so far around Pluto. More could be lurking out there, awaiting discovery by New Horizons. This is one of the clearest images obtained of Pluto and its moon Charon by the Hubble Space Telescope . The Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, designed and built New Horizons, and is now managing the mission for Nasa. Pluto was still officially a planet, No. 9 in the solar system lineup, when New Horizons departed Earth. It was the only planet in our solar system yet to be explored. But seven months later, the International Astronomical Union stripped Pluto of its planethood, classifying it instead as a dwarf planet. Later came the term, plutoid. Some scientists are hoping Pluto's upcoming close-up - and expected cosmic buzz - may prompt the group to reverse its decision. The nature of science, after all, is fluid, as even the astronomical union maintains. Streator, Illinois - hometown of Pluto's discoverer, the late astronomer Clyde Tombaugh - already has declared 2015 the 'Year of Pluto.' Tombaugh spotted Pluto in 1930. New Horizons may, indeed, 'turn the tide in some people's opinions into the other camp,' Weaver said. 'But that's not really so important.' More important, he said, is finding out 'what does Pluto really look like.' The New Horizon's probe, seen above in this artist's impression, will use miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers to study the geology of Pluto and its moon Charon .","New Horizons probe has travelled three billion miles over nine years .

The former psychologist told MailOnline: 'There are women who really dress up, who look very beautiful, but above all, I like that they lose their inhibitions here. 'They look happy.' She added: 'This last year, I have dedicated myself 100 per cent to photography and I hope to continue this way. 'Next month I have an exhibition of a series called Gammacity, with urban photos I've taken. 'These beach shots form a series called Radioactive Life. 'In this area where I live now, there is a large population of older people - many retirees. 'That's why I photograph them.' The glamour of some of the women particularly enchants Moldes, show says it is interesting seeing them all dressed up for a day out . The aspiring photographer calls her series of beach shots, Radioactive Life . Moldes is also expanding her exhibition to include a series of urban photographs, called Gammacity . The colourful assortment of images shows older couples heading to yoga classes, doing exercises on the beach and soaking up the rays. Spain's Costa Blanca, home to Benidorm and a string of other seaside resorts, first became popular with Britons in 1957 with the dawn of the package holiday. It boomed in the 1960s, but then experienced a decline for a decade after tour operator Court Line went bust stranding tens of thousands of people abroad. In peak holiday season, expat residents mingle with holidaymakers on the busy beaches . Moldes says that her favourite part of her hobby is seeing how the women who 'lose their inhibitions here' But Benidorm picked up again following the death of General Franco in 1974, which prompted a boom in Spain as it opened up to tourism and international business. Benidorm's reputation has suffered in recent years and has even become the subject of the television comedy series of the same name that paints it in a less-than-flattering light. However, with new luxury hotels being built and low property prices, the seaside town is hoping to boom once again.

"A disturbing video has been released showing the horrifying moment a Melbourne man in his 40's was knocked over by his own delivery van and pinned beneath its wheels. The footage, captured by CCTV from a nearby property in Balwyn, shows the man as he is pushed to the ground, before the van gathers speed and rolls over the top of him, dragging him into the street. The man had been delivering a fridge to the house, and it was in the back of the vehicle when it began to roll towards him. A  man was knocked over by his van, and dragged into the street as the wheels ran over his chest and head . The van comes to a stop just before the front wheels roll over him, and he is shown trapped underneath the weight of the vehicle in the middle of the road.

'The van began to roll, and he's attempted from the rear end to try and stop that himself, which didn't end too well,' Lindsay Bent from Ambulance Victoria told Channel Seven. The man's colleague jumped into the van in order to turn off the vehicle's engine and prevent it from moving further, before the footage shows a maxi taxi arriving just outside the property.

"An aspiring singer who auditioned for Israel's version of the X Factor was placed under house arrest Thursday on suspicion of hacking into international pop star Madonna's computer and stealing and selling unreleased songs, his lawyer said. Police said Israel's cybercrime unit arrested 38-year-old Adi Lederman on Wednesday after an investigation coordinated with the FBI, which confirmed its involvement. Police also accused Lederman of stealing songs from other international artists whom they declined to name. Caught: Israeli authorities arrested a 38-year-old man named Adi Lederman on Wednesday, believed to have carried out a hack on Madonna's (left) computer to release one of her under development songs. He is a former contestant on Israel's 'A Star is Born,' their form of the X Factor, pictured right . Songs from Madonna's upcoming album 'Rebel Heart,' to be released in March, were leaked online in December. At the time, she urged her fans not to listen to the stolen copies that had surfaced, writing on Instagram: 'I have been violated as a human and an artist.' She later released six songs, calling it an 'early Christmas gift' for fans. Madonna welcomed Lederman's initial arrest, writing on her Facebook page that she was 'profoundly grateful to the FBI, the Israeli Police investigators and anyone else who helped lead to the arrest of this hacker.' She called the hack 'deeply devastating.' 'The end of Privacy is not something any of us are ready for!' added in an Instagram post on Thursday. Madonna has long claimed a special bond with Israel. The diva has made personal pilgrimages to the country, she practices Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, and she launched her 2012 'MDNA' tour in Israel. The investigation began after Madonna's representative in Israel lodged a complaint, a police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with protocol. Lederman, a Tel Aviv resident, auditioned for the Israeli reality show 'A Star is Born' in 2012. When asked by one of the judges what he does for a living, he responded: 'Mainly wasting my life away, it seems, because I'm told that I should be on stage.' He sang Stevie Wonder's 'Don't You Worry About a Thing.' Efrat Nahmany-Bar, a lawyer for Lederman said he denies the allegations. She said Lederman has not been charged and believes there was not sufficient evidence for an indictment. She said Lederman has no access to computers under the terms of his house arrest.

"Magnus Peterson has been jailed for 13 years after being found guilty of a string of fraud offences having duped investors out of hundreds of millions of pounds . A hedge fund boss whose investors lost £350million when his Mayfair firm collapsed as a result of his rogue trading has been jailed for 13 years. Magnus Peterson forged relatives' signatures, wrote fraudulent IOU's and lied to auditors to keep the Macro Fund afloat while he extracted millions from the company for himself. The fund collapsed in 2009 in an 'emblematic' example of the financial crash, with 51-year-old Peterson convicted of eight counts of  years later. Today the Swedish national was jailed for 13 years at Southwark Crown Court. The father-of-four was previously ruled against in a High Court action launched by creditors of one of his companies. It was this ruling which prompted the Serious Fraud Office to criminally investigate the financier after previously fearing there was no 'realistic prospect of conviction'. During his three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court, jurors heard how Peterson blew 20 per cent of the fund over a few days of 'disastrous' trading. Having convinced investors - many of whom were pensioners - to agree to an 'option overlay', Peterson told clients they could not lose or gain five per cent of their original input. The trader began using a separate company, Weavering Capital, to mask how much of his clients' money he had lost. Trading with money from the Macro Fund, he invented deals and profits produced by the latter company to keep the scheme going. At one point the financier forged the signatures of his father-in-law and brother in Sweden on documents including one declaring responsibility to the Irish Stock Exchange. But following the credit crunch of 2008, investors began seeking returns on their original cash instalments. It was then that Peterson launched a Ponzi-like scheme - using fresh cash investments to pay off debts to older clients. As jurors were told, 'he was robbing Peter to pay Paul.' In 2009, the Macro Fund was closed and Peterson later arrested in one of the first prosecutions of its kind following the financial crash. The Serious Fraud Office did not pursue allegations of fraud however in the belief there was no realistic prospect the trader would be convicted. The case was closed in 2011. The following year, a High Court action launched by Weavering Capital creditors however found he and some others liable for millions. Mr Justice Peter Smith (left) described the trader as 'charming and clever'. The criminal case into his practices was reopened by David Green QC (right) when he took charge of the Serious Fraud Office . In its wake and with the appointment of David Green QC at the SFO alongside threats of a judicial review from scorned creditors, the case was reopened. While swindling investors out of millions, it emerged Peterson had pocketed £7million for himself by the time he was brought to court. He was found guilty of fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading and acquitted of seven other counts including fraud by false representation. Sentencing today, Mr Justice Peter Smith said the trader had 'fooled' those who trusted him with investments. August 2003: Macro Fund launched on Irish Stock Exhchange . March 2009: Fund put into administration . April 2009: Joint administrators mount proceedings against Peterson . September 2011: Serious Fraud Office drops investigation . October 2011: Civil trial at High Court begins . May 2012: Peterson ordered to pay £289million in damages for defrauding investors . July 2012: Serious Fraud Office reopens criminal investigation . December 2012: Peterson is charged with fraud offences . October 2014: Criminal trial begins at Southwark Crown Court . January 2015: Peterson is jailed for 13 years . 'You were playing for high rewards and the punishment should reflect that, which is why I am sentencing you to 13 years in prison. 'Investors were entitled to expect integrity from you. 'The jury found you guilty on eight counts of disloyalty, fraud and forgery. The Macro fund was liquidated in 2009 with losses of more than half a billion dollars for investors. 'You are a clever man and the fraud was clever, dishonest and sophisticated. You are articulate and have charm and your submissions to the jury were fluent although they made no real sense. He added the man had duped regular people out of hard-earned savings and contributions intended for charity. 'These were not just adventurous speculators, they included those saving for their pensions and charities. 'You did not have direct dealings with those cheated, but you knew well enough who would be your sorts of victims. 'It is no excuse that others might have been expected to safeguard the interests of others, and that others were involved in your wrongdoing. 'You acted in concert with others and it beggars belief that you were not leading a scheme and that others were not led by you.' According to the Serious Fraud Office, it was one of the first hedge fund prosecutions of its kind to arise out of the 2008 financial crisis. Amanda Pinto, QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, said: ‘This case is about a fraud carried out by Mr Peterson, through the investment fund the Macro fund, which he ran between 2003 and 2009. 'Investors put millions of dollars into the Macro fund...In the end, the fund went down to the tune of over 600 million dollars, losing all their money. ‘And this was not because of bad luck or incompetence - this was because of dishonesty.’ Southwark Crown Court (above) heard how the trader had 'fooled' investors into giving him more money . ‘The Macro fund was in dire straits’, Miss Pinto added. ‘At the very same time, he was personally extracting hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the Macro fund for his own and his family’s benefit.’ Gideon Cammerman, representing Peterson, said: 'There was a sense he was bound to be discovered. 'WCF was impecunious, the repayments could never have been met. The fraud was sustained over a period of time with a large number of victims.' He described Peterson’s actions as 'foolhardy and stupid', but added they were not to make him rich but to maintain his lifestyle. Dressed in a checked shirt, grey jacket and dark blue trousers, Peterson looked stunned as he was led away.","Magnus Peterson was jailed in one of the first prosecutions of 2008 crash .

"London's first electric zero-emission black cabs are now on trial in the city. Designed and built in Britain, the all-new zero-emission Range-Extended Electric Metrocab run on a powerful, near-silent electric motor. Inside there is seating for up to seven passengers, complete with a USB charging socket, panoramic glass roof and colour TV displays. The new electric black taxis which are now on trial in London. Designed and built in Britain, the all-new zero-emission Range-Extended Electric Metrocab runs on a powerful, near-silent electric motor . A multifunction touchscreen display, digital 'infotainment system', hands free phone, air con and air suspension are also fitted as standard. Having been in development for over 10 years, the new Metrocab has covered over 600,000 engineering test miles. London cabbies were invited to trial the new cab last year by registering online. In April 2014 London Mayor Boris Johnson had a test drive in one of the new Metrocabs. • 75mpg and over three times more fuel efficient than comparable current London taxi . • 75% less CO2 than comparable current London taxi, <50g/km CO2 . • 560km combined range . • Significantly lower running costs, typically saving a London cabbie £20 – 40 per day . • Zero-emissions mode and home charging via standard mains outlet . • Evolutionary design, sympathetic to iconic London taxi silhouette . • 10 years in development and over a million engineering test kilometres . • Six passenger seats (plus optional seventh passenger seat in the front) • Fully compliant with London Public Carriage Office (PCO) regulations . He said at the time: 'It's superb, an absolutely beautiful machine and a masterpiece of British engineering. 'I have just driven it and it's totally silent. It's the Rolls Royce of taxis and it will do 100mpg'. So far a price tag has not yet been set, but Metrocab has announced there will be no price premium over the current black cab, which costs around £33,000. The new Metrocab is driven by two independent brushless electric motors. A small petrol engine, coupled with a generator - the 'Range Extender' - is used to recharge the battery pack or provide power directly to the motors. Plug-in charging is also achieved via any mains outlet when the taxi is off duty. As pollution levels rise over major cities, governments are looking to more energy efficient, low emission, modes of transport. A company spokesman said: 'The new Metrocab boasts an incredible environmental record, exceeding current standards. 'Metrocab can operate with zero emissions, giving it a range of well over 50 miles on its battery pack only. Developed over 10 years, the new Metrocab has covered more than 600,000 engineering test miles . 'In Range Extender low-emission mode, the new Metrocab produces less than 50g/KM of CO2 – significantly better than any other vehicle in the market.' Performance figures entitle Metrocab owners to a wide range of tax breaks and government grants. Last year Nissan launched a new version of the London black cab, featuring an engine it claims will be far more environmentally friendly than any of its rivals. In 2014 London Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured) had a test drive in one of the new Metrocabs . The taxi, which comes with a 1.6 litre petrol engine instead of the 2.5 litre diesel one fitted in the majority of the capital's cabs, is designed to mix innovation and tradition - embracing the large round headlights and over-sized grilles that have been synonymous with London taxis for decades. Last year Mr Johnson, who drives a petrol Toyota people carrier, announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital. In July he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £10 to drive into Central London as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020. Other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with EU clean air rules. Around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in Britain. Britain is facing £300 million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution . Strict targets should have been met by January 2010 and in February 2014 the EU launched legal proceedings to force the Government to deal with air pollution. MailOnline was unable to reach Metrocab for an update on the trial. The Nissan taxi is environmentally cleaner than existing cabs, offering 32 miles to the gallon and CO2 emissions of 132g/km - but an electric 'zero emission' version to rival Metrocab is rumoured to follow in 2015 .","The first ever electric black cabs have now gone on trial in London .

An upside down kettle lies beneath what looks like a broken part of a kitchen cupboard. A fridge lies overturned on its side, covered in rubble.

"Islamic State militants  have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government. The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court. One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq. Terrorists: Islamic State militants have publicly executed two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government . News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground. The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury. The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory. The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants. The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid. Horror: The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court . Charlie Winter, a programs officer at counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, told The Independent that reports of ISIS executing their own fighters are not unsurprising. 'Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them. They do not flinch at killing anyone if they have committed a serious crime which goes against their interpretation of sharia, such as usury or embezzlement,' he said. 'Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone's monthly income, they don't extort people like some secular groups have done in the past,' he added. The news comes as it emerged as many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria. Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure is higher. Despite the deaths and mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals. Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have released a new video showing fighters speaking in English, French and German making threats against Western soldiers. Saying they look forward to slaughtering any Western ground troops sent to the region, the terrorists threatened to 'chop off the heads of whoever you may bring'. None of the men in the clip wear masks, although only three of them speak to the camera. One of the jihadists, identified by the nom de guerre Abu Abdullah al-Britani, speaks in a clear southern English accent, while the other two men identify themselves as French and German nationals respectively. Briton: One of the jihadists, identified by the nom de guerre Abu Abdullah al-Britani (right), speaks in an English accent, while the other two men identify themselves as French and German nationals respectively . Showing chilling bravado, the man calling himself  Abu Abdullah al-Britani urges Western nations to send their troops to the region so that ISIS can 'kill every single soldier, Allah permitting.' 'We will take their weaponry as booty and these people will die… You cannot come into Iraq and think that you will take it. No way. We are willing to lay down our blood on this soil,' he adds. Gesticulating wildly, the Muslim fanatic goes on to say: 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring.' He goes on to insist that the Islamic State have no chose of losing the battle against the West because they are backed by God, before saying 'Know that we are fighting to die... and know that you are fighting for this world and that this is nothing to us. Threat: Gesticulating wildly, the British Muslim fanatic goes on to say: 'We will chop off the heads of the Americans, chop off the heads of the French, chop off the heads of whoever you may bring' Referring to Western airstrikes that have targeted ISIS in recent weeks, including those that have forced militants to abandon key locations in and around the besieged Syrian city of Kobane, al-Britani insists that bombing raids 'will not divert us from our plans'. He says that strikes 'only strengthen us, and give us more purpose to be here' before threatening to take the lives of any Westerner fighting against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Once al-Britani eventually stops talking, a man identified as Abdul Wadoud al-Firansi emerges in front of the camera and speaks in perfect French, with English subtitles appearing below. Addressing his messages to 'the swine Francois Hollande', al-Firansi reads out religious passages and accuses the French president of using his country's wealth to turn people away from Islam. 'Wait. We are also waiting,' he says. 'Everybody knows how much money you and you coalition have spent and lost in your war against Islam.' The young militant, who appears to be missing several teeth, goes on to say: 'A great defeat shall befall you because Allah has promised that. You,. the coalition, will become the losers,' he adds. Addressing his messages to 'the swine Francois Hollande', French national Abdul Wadoud al-Firansi (right)  references a 1,300-year-old apocalyptic prophecy predicting war between Islam and an 'infidel horde' Al-Firansi goes on to make references to a 1,300-year-old apocalyptic prophecy that predicted a war between an Islamic army and 'infidel horde' in Syria. Al-Firansi refers to Westerners as 'Romans' throughout his rant, in the hope of drawing similarities between the apocalyptic predictions in the hadith, and the modern reality of a coalition of armies aiming to destroy the terrorists that have been raping and the massacring their way around the Middle East. He finishes he message with the words: 'The reality is the Islamic State has returned. Victory after victory it gains territory... so die in your rage because this is the era of Islam.' Militant: Once al-Firansi finishes speaking, another militant identified as Abu Dauoud al-Almani (centre) steps in front of the camera and speaks in German, which is again subtitled in English . Once al-Firansi finishes speaking, another militant identified as Abu Dauoud al-Almani steps in front of the camera and speaks in German, which is again subtitled in English. He claims the video is being shot in the Syrian town of Dabiq - where the aforementioned apocalyptic prophecy is predicted to play out - and urges Western nations to send their armies to fight ISIS because 'We have been waiting for you for over 1,400 years.' He also urges his fellow Muslims in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to join ISIS.","Executions took place in Syrian city of Al-Bukamal, near the Iraqi border .

"Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, having heightened his profile in recent weeks for admonishing the Obama administration over its Cuba policy, has leaped to front of the 2016 pack among Republican voters. A newly released Zogby poll, conducted last weekend, puts the freshman senator in second place in the GOP primary, just behind Mitt Romney and tied with Jeb Bush. Rubio polled at 13 percent - just three points behind front-runner Romney. Among women, he came in first, though, earning 22 percent of female respondents' support. Romney and Rubio attracted 13 percent and 10 percent of women of women respectively. Scroll down for video . Florida Marco Rubio, right, is greeted by colleagues as he arrives to the State of the Union on Tuesday evening. Rubio will play hooky from work next week - likely missing a key vote on the Keystone XL pipeline - to make a national fundraising swing for his expected presidential campaign . The survey was released just as  ABC News revealed that Rubio will play hooky from work next week - likely missing a key vote on the Keystone XL pipeline - to make a national fundraising swing. He's kicking off the week-long campaign effort today in Miami, where he'll meet with 300 donors and supporters to discuss his political future. The Senate seat Rubio holds is due for review in 2016, and the Republican politician has said he won't ask Florida voters to reelect him if he runs for president. He has until May to decide. Rubio suggested on Wednesday that he was still mulling over his options. But an adviser told ABC, 'he has told us to proceed as if he is running for president.' He's bringing on a new fundraiser, as well - Anna Rogers, finance director at Karl Rove's American Crossroads. She'll join Rubio's Reclaim America political action committee on Feb. 1. The freshman senator will participate in a forum on Sunday night hosted by conservative non-profit Freedom Partners, the political arm of Republican mega donors David and Charles Koch. The marquee event of Freedom Partners' winter meeting, the panel will take place in Palm Springs, California, and will consist of Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul - two other presumed Republican presidential candidates - discussing 'American Recovery Policy.' ABC News' Jonathan Karl will moderate, and the event will be livestreamed on the news network's website. Rubio will remain in California after the event to woo donors in Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Rancho Sante Fe and Costa Mesa, ABC says, before moving on to Texas and Chicago. The extended fundraising trip will keep Rubio out of the Capitol all next week as colleagues vote on the Keystone XL pipeline. The measure is assured to pass, but President Barack Obama has said he will veto it, and its unclear whether the Senate has the juice to override him. The House passed the legislation earlier this month but not with enough votes to counter a veto. They'll have to take another vote once Obama's officially rejected the legislation. FLASHBACK: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, left, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, right, and then-Congressman Connie Mack, left, are pictured here aboard the campaign plane for then-Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, in this 2012 photo. Romney, Bush and Rubio may now find themselves fighting each other for the 2016 nomination . Rubio is planning a nationwide tour to promote his recently released book, American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone. The book tour will conveniently take him to early primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is the only Republican to have formally announced his intentions to run for president, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham says he's formed a 'testing the waters committee.' But former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum haven't been coy about their presidential ambitions, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has hired a campaign manager. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and businesswoman Carly Fiorina have hired fundraisers for their probable campaigns, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is reportedly staffing up, as well. If Rubio runs for president, as is now expected, he's says he'll rely on his foreign policy expertise to set him apart from competitors with executive experience like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. 'The next president of the United States needs to be someone that has a clear view of what’s happening in the world, a clear strategic vision of America’s role in it, and a clear tactical plan for how to engage America in global affairs,' Rubio said Wednesday at a breakfast in Washington, D.C, hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. 'And I think for governors, that’s going to be a challenge at least initially, because they don’t deal with foreign policy on a daily basis.' Rubio is a member of the Senate foreign relations committee and has hammered President Barack Obama and his administration for negotiating a deal with the Castro regime in Cuba without the knowledge or consent of the Senate. The move precipitated the Zogby poll, which put Rubio 10 points ahead of Perry, Cruz and Paul. He also out-polled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was favored by 11 percent of likely Republican primary voters, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, supported by nine percent of respondents, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, six percent and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal with four percent. Candidates polling under one percent were South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, New Mexico Governor Susanna Martinez, and former Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. The poll shows a pathway to the nomination for Rubio, whose chances of winning his home state of Florida in the primary were significantly reduced with fellow Floridan Bush's entry into the 2016 competition. Rubio's said Bush's campaign hasn't effected his own decision-making process. But it may have moved the needle on his fundraising timeline. Bush, now a free man, having pushed most of his day to day responsibilities off of his plate to focus exclusively on his presidential campaign, is about to embark on a 60-event 'shock and awe' donor blitz, the Wall Street Journal reports. The veteran politician hopes to grab all the cash before like-minded and geographically similar opponents officially enter the race, effectively freezing them out. Rubio also has plans for a nationwide tour - to promote his recently released book, American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone. The book tour will conveniently take Rubio to early primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It's tentatively scheduled to begin on Feb. 13 in Des Moines, according to ABC.","Rubio polled at 13 percent - just three points behind front-runner Romney; he earned 22 percent of female respondents' support .
Rubio adviser: 'He has told us to proceed as if he is running for president'; he has until May to decide whether to run for reelection or president .

"A former Vanderbilt football player accused of raping an unconscious student was so drunk that 'he was not his normal self', an expert witness has testified. Cory Batey, 20, is on trial in Nashville, Tennessee with his former teammate Brandon Vandenburg, 21, for allegedly sexually assaulting the neuroscience student with two other men in June 2013. On Friday, the court heard Dr. James Walker, a forensic neuropsychologist testifying for the defense, that Batey's ability to 'act knowingly' was impaired after drinking between 14 and 22 drinks. 'He was so intoxicated he was not his normal self,' Walker said. 'He was doing things he would not normally have done.' 'Not himself': Cory Batey, pictured listening to testimony during his rape trial on Tuesday, was so drunk when he allegedly raped a student in a dorm room that his judgment was impaired, the court heard on Friday . He drank enough to 'alter his judgment and his impulse control… his ability to think about consequences,' he said. Another expert, who did not testify, estimated that Batey's blood alcohol content would have been between 0.175 and 0.33 per cent, the Tennessean reported. The legal limit to drive is 0.08 per cent. Still, when he was first interviewed by police in connection with the alleged attack, he told them he had nothing to drink that night because he knew it was against campus rules. Walker also testified that Batey, who had arrived on campus as a 'pretty upright moral young man', felt himself change because of the 'ease and availability' of young women around him. His girlfriend reported that Batey had been sexually aggressive on one occasion but that he stopped when she asked him. 'Ring-leader': Fellow football player Brandon Vandenburg listens to his alleged victim testify on Thursday . By his side: Vandeburg's family listens as the woman testifies how she awoke sore but not knowing what had happened the next day. The last thing she remembers was drinking with Vandenburg in a bar . He told Walker that he was 'horrified' by his actions on the night of the alleged attack and insisted that he had felt peer pressure. After allegedly raping the woman - in a brutal attack that was captured in cell phone footage and sent to Vandenburg's friends - Batey spent the night with his girlfriend, the court heard. Batey's defense team has said that his judgment was changed by a campus culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex. On Thursday, the court heard from two witnesses who said that DNA from multiple men were found on the victim's clothing, alluding to the promiscuous culture on campus. The experts testified after the victim herself took to the stand and revealed that she could remember nothing about the attack because she had blacked out from drinking alcohol. Co-accused: Former Vanderbilt players Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (left) and Brandon Banks (right) also face charges connected to the alleged rape. McKenzie testified that he did not touch the woman . Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet . A nurse testified about the bruises she found across the young woman's thighs and buttocks, but the alleged victim said she did not know the extent of the attack until she saw the cell video footage. All four former players - Batey, Vandenburg, Jaborian McKenzie and Brandon Banks, have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial wrapped up its tenth day on Friday. The defense has one more witness to testify on Monday and then closing arguments are set to begin.","Cory Batey is on trial in Nashville, Tennessee with former teammate Brandon Vandenburg 'for raping a woman with two other men in 2013'

"Risk: James McCormick made £50million and put thousands of lives at risk by selling fake bomb detectors . A conman who put thousand of lives at risks by selling fake bomb detectors was given advice on how to market the devices to United Nations agencies by British Government officials, it has emerged. James McCormick made £50million by selling the plastic objects based on £13 novelty 'golf ball finders' to security forces - particularly in Iraq, where they were used at virtually every checkpoint in . Baghdad and Basra from 2006 and are still in use today. The 57-year-old touted the ‘completely ineffectual’ gadgets for up to £27,000 each to police forces and armies around the world. And it has now been revealed that he attended a seminar on 'how to sell to the UN' organised by UK Trade & Investment in March 2008, where he met with officials responsible for promoting British business abroad. Although there is no evidence that staff at the seminar knew the devices were useless, the Department for Business was warned about the dangers of fake detectors in 2008. A whistleblower sent a dossier entitled 'Dowsing rods endanger lives' to business minister Ian Pearson in November that year, saying: 'Somebody is going to be seriously hurt or killed using or relying on these devices to detect explosives, if they haven't already.' The gadgets are essentially just hand-held aerials fixed to plastic hinges. But, . incredibly, McCormick persuaded governments and military chiefs that . they could detect tiny traces of explosives, drugs, ivory and even . humans at a distance of up to three miles. Yesterday the ‘morally bankrupt’ businessman was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey.

Scam: It's believed his scam allowed suicide bombers to kill and maim thousands. On one occasion terrorists drove a vehicle with rockets and missiles through 23 checkpoints in Baghdad where the device was used . McCormick, a former trainee policeman, used the millions he was paid to fund a lavish lifestyle. He owned a £5million Regency townhouse . in Bath, a £1.5million farmhouse near Taunton, Somerset, a £250,000 . holiday home in Florida and a £350,000 villa in Cyprus. The conman also spent £630,000 on a . Sunseeker yacht and £210,000 on three horses for one of his two . daughters who wants to compete in the British dressage team at the 2016 . Olympics. Although police have frozen £15million . of his assets, investigators believe he has laundered at least another . £15million through Cyprus, Belize and Beirut.

Later versions of the device were modified slightly, but still closely resembled the golf ball finders. McCormick reeled in clients by . embarking on a series of sales talks in which he purported to explain . the science behind his system. He even claimed to have a doctorate – despite leaving school in Liverpool with just three O-levels. During the trial, Professor David . Last, from the University of Wales, said: ‘To me it was a jumble of . technical phrases and disconnected sentences. In my judgment it had no . scientific validity whatsoever.’ As well as Iraq and Afghanistan, the detectors were sold to Niger, Georgia, Romania, Thailand and Saudi Arabia.

They were ‘completely ineffectual as a piece of detection equipment’ and were no better at identifying bombs then trying to detect them by . random chance. ‘The devices did not work and .

"El Salvador's Congress on Wednesday pardoned a woman accused of abortion and later sentenced to 30 years in prison for homicide in a landmark case that has put the country's harsh laws under the spotlight. The vote may signal similar relief for other women who have been convicted and sentenced to jail for abortion, which was criminalized in El Salvador in 1997. Domestic worker Carmen Guadalupe Vasquez had already served seven years of her sentence prior to the pardon. In 2007, Vasquez suffered major complications during her pregnancy and her child died shortly after she gave birth. The case was pressed by a movement known as A Flower for the 17, a reference to the number of Salvadoran women convicted of homicide in similar cases. Women are seen protesting in September 2014 (file photo) She was initially accused of the crime of abortion, which carries up to eight years in prison, but the charge was later dropped and replaced with aggravated murder charges. Leftists members of Congress voted for the pardon, led by lawmakers from the ruling Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), while the conservative National Republican Alliance (Arena) voted against it. 'This case establishes a precedent for justice for poor women who have been criminalized for the supposed crime of homicide without proof,' said Jorge Menjivar, a spokesman for El Salvador's leading activist group seeking the decriminalization of abortion. At least 129 individuals have been jailed under the country's abortion law, according to official figures. Human rights activists on Thursday hailed the decision by El Salvador's congress to pardon Vazquez, who was convicted of killing her child after she said she suffered a miscarriage. The pardon was approved by 43 of the 84 members of the Legislative Assembly, with the 26 representatives of the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance voting no and the rest abstaining. 'With this decision, El Salvador has undone a terrible injustice,' said Erika Guevara-Rosas, the Americas director for Amnesty International. She said the woman should never have been imprisoned in the first place. The decision 'must mark a turning point for El Salvador's retrograde laws, which punish women and girls when having medical complications during their pregnancies,' Guevara-Rosas said. Human rights activists on Thursday hailed the decision by El Salvador's congress to pardon Vazquez, who was convicted of killing her child after she said she suffered a miscarriage. Women are seen participating in a November 2014 march . Salvadoran law prohibits all abortions, including in the case of rape or when a woman's life is in danger. Vasquez  was an 18-year-old domestic worker when she says she was raped and hid her pregnancy to avoid losing her job. She has said she miscarried at her place of work and the fetus was stillborn. When Vasquez sought treatment for bleeding at a hospital, a doctor alerted authorities and she was detained on suspicion of having had an abortion. Prosecutors charged her with aggravated homicide, and she was sentenced in 2007 to 30 years in prison despite a forensic medical report that found the cause of death could not be determined and there was no evidence of trauma on the body. Lawyer Denis Munoz said there was never any proof that the woman had harmed the fetus. This week's pardon came after the country's Supreme Court ruled there was reasonable doubt in the case. Guevara-Rosas said the woman was still behind bars and it could take a few weeks for her release to be processed. The case was pressed by a movement known as A Flower for the 17, a reference to the number of Salvadoran women convicted of homicide in similar cases.","El Salvador's Congress on Wednesday pardoned a woman accused of abortion and later sentenced to 30 years in prison for homicide .

"Twelve Muslim men have been banned from gathering in large groups after violent outbursts at a rally led by radical hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Four of the men have been served with a three-year anti-social behaviour order that also prevents them from carrying flags or setting fire to items in protest. Judge Paul Worsley QC said the orders were necessary to protect members of the public. A Muslim gang have been banned from gathering in large groups after being involved in violence that broke out at a march led by hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Above, some of the group arrived at court today . He also restricted what eight of the men are allowed to do when attending a Dawah - a public event where Islam is preached. Judge Worsley issued the order at the Old Bailey after hearing a day-long argument from lawyers for the men who suggested the Asbo would breach their right to religious expression. He ruled: ‘I am entirely satisfied that an order to limit the conduct of these defendants is appropriate in each case.' 'They have proved they are prepared to behave in a way which is totally unacceptable involving violence or threat of violence to members of the public going about their business. ‘I take the view it is necessary for the protection of the public and to ensure crime is not committed that Asbo orders are made.’ The twelve men named in the orders are Munim Adbul, 33, Mohan Uddin, 37, Mohammed Alamgir, 35, Kamran Khan, 30, Qadeer Ahmed, 29, Mohammed Naseer Khan, 31, Moshiur Rahman, 32, Jalal Ahmed, 26, Yousef Bashir, 34, Mirza Ali, 40, Abu Aziz, 32, and Jordan Horner, 21. Two of them, Mirza Ali and Abu Aziz, 32, have already left the UK and are believed to be in Syria. Mohammed Alamgir (pictured outside court today) took part in an attack on rival Shia Muslims during a protest march organised by Choudary . All are from Luton and Walthamstow, east London. Seven of them appeared at the Old Bailey today. The order Asbo comes after the men were all convicted of public order offences for their parts in two violent outbursts in central London in May 2013. Four of the group of Sunni Muslims - Ali, Uddin, Alamgir, and Khan - were involved in an attack on rival Shia Muslims during a protest march in Edgware Road on 10 May. Sectarian violence broke out during the rally, organised by Choudary, at which the hate preacher was calling out for jihad in Syria. Two men were beaten to the ground as members of the violent mob screamed: 'This is what is going to happen to all Shia' and  'Shias are kaffirs. They are the enemy within. They are evil.' Under the terms of the Asbo, the four men are banned from participating in any protests if notification has not been given to the local authority or police. They are also banned from burning items on protests except for smoking materials or braziers, carrying a flagpole at protests, or approaching members of the public at protests. Eight days after the march, all of the group except Horner, Alamgir and Ali, took part in an attack on a football fan as they ran a extremist Islamic stall on Oxford street, central London. The mob cleared the area of Muslim women and children before attacking Andrew White, and handed out Muslim propaganda as their victim was lying prone on the ground. Following the attack the men began shouting 'f*** the Queen.' One of the group, Jordan Horner, 31, was already subject to an Asbo for taking part in vigilante patrols in east London calling for a Sharia State in the UK. Those involved in the Oxford Street incident are banned under the Asbo from setting up a dawa stall without first having informed the local authority and obtained permission where necessary. Moshiur Rahma (left) and Kamran Khan (right) outside court today. All 12 men must not be in company with each other when attending any protest, demonstration, or rally, according to the Asbo . They are also banned from performing dawa within 200m of any other stall, performing dawa while displaying a banner or flag save for a two-metre banner, being in a dawa group where a flagpole is held, or being in a dawa group where items are burnt save for smoking materials or braziers. Under the terms of the order dawa is defined as ‘proselytising in a public place not including a mosque’. The third restriction, which relates to all twelve, states that they ‘must not be in company with each other when attending any protest, demonstration or rally.’ Prosecutor Alex Chalk said: ‘We don’t seek to exclude them from practising their religion nor attending rallies nor performing Dawa, simply that it reflects the needs of competing interests in a democratic society.’ Four of the men were involved in sectarian violence that broke out during a rally, organised by Choudary, pictured, at which the hate preacher was calling out for jihad in Syria .","Twelve men have been served with a three-year anti-social behaviour order .

"Phillip Clayton claims his 86-year-old mother Maureen, a retired teacher, died in agony, covered in pressure sores, after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed for 11 weeks . An 86-year-old woman died covered in 'horrendous' pressure sores after nurses failed to turn her in her hospital bed, her son claims. Phillip Clayton said his mother died in 'pain and tears' and contracted MRSA as a result of the care she received. He claims a delay in fitting a pacemaker also contributed to his mother's death after she was admitted to hospital with a dangerously low heart rate. He has launched a complaint against Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent after his mother Maureen died in November. NICE guidelines advise adults at high risk should be turned at least once every four hours to prevent pressure ulcers. The hospital is now carrying out a review into her care. Mr Clayton, 56, a public sector worker, said: 'The fact that my mother died is unfortunate. 'The way she died in pain and tears from the pressure sores is a disgrace and in my view, totally unacceptable. 'It is wrong to say my mother would not have died but I do think the care she received shortened her life. 'It was not the right way for her to die. The way she spent her last few weeks was shocking. 'The real problem is a total lack of leadership which permeates right down to ward level and results in an appalling level of service. 'I do not need apologies or a formal investigation, what I would like to see is change.' Mrs Clayton, a retired teacher, was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham, Kent. Her heart rate was low and she spent three days on a cardiac unit before being diagnosed with liver problems and transferred to the Will Adams ward. Mr Clayton claims while there staff failed to turn her during her entire 11 week stay - when it should have been done once every four hours. Mr Clayton says his mother even contracted MRSA as a result of the 'disgraceful' care she received at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent (pictured) Mrs Clayton was admitted to the hospital on September 13 after a fall at her home in Rainham . He added that they only rearranged the pillows under her back which did not prevent her from contracting painful pressure sores. Three weeks into her stay she was diagnosed with MRSA and died on November 27 from renal failure. Mr Clayton added: 'They simply rearranged the pillows underneath her. Turning a patient in bed is not rocket science. It is a basic nursing skill. 'There was a long delay before she was fitted with a temporary pacemaker and then a permanent one. During this time she deteriorated. 'If she had been fitted with the pacemaker in the first week and been able to get up, maybe things would have been different.' A spokesperson from Medway NHS Foundation Trust, who run the hospital where Mrs Clayton was treated said: 'The Trust takes concerns around care very seriously and is currently carrying out a review, as discussed with the family. 'The outcome of the review and the actions we are taking as a result of the findings, will be shared with the family.'","Phillip Clayton says his mother Maureen died covered in pressure sores .

"From blond cornrows to a slick side parting, David Beckham has long been a source of hair inspiration for British men. But now Beckham, and the rest of the footballing world, have stiff competition in the shape of YouTube vloggers whose hair tutorials are now being watched - and emulated - by millions. Top of the vlogging - and hair - pops is Robin James, who boasts 37,000 followers and a quirky approach to styling. Scroll down for video . Men are now more likely to turn to YouTube stars such as Robin James for style inspiration than footballers . David Beckham, seen here with son Romeo, was once the inspiration for most men but no longer . While his signature look, the supersized quiff he calls 'the Elephant Trunk', might look outlandish, it and others have proved a hit with men. As a result, a new survey has revealed that one in 10 men over 25 say vloggers are their main source of style inspiration, while among teens and twenty-somethings, the numbers are even higher. Almost one in three under-25's are avid viewers of YouTube vlogs and tune in at least twice a week, with half saying they watch the videos of their favourite stars up to 10 times a week. While James is the most eye-catching of the new breed of hair vloggers, he is by no means the only one. Robin James is most famous for the 'Elephants' Trunk', pictured in progress (left) and right, complete . So popular are James' styles, he has amassed an impressive 37,000 regular viewers . Andy Samuels, a friend of One Direction's Liam Payne, has also proved a source of inspiration . Samuels specialises in easy, step by step tutorials that explain how to get his signature quiff . But as Samuels' intense concentration reveals, getting the supersized quiff right isn't always easy . Jim Chapman is another YouTube star and is seen here explaining how to get Harry Styles' preppy look . Chapman is one of Youtube's most groomed vloggers and includes spray tans in his repertoire . Andy Samuels is another star who has turned his YouTube account (and close friendship with One Direction's Liam Payne) into a business. Like James, Samuels is a fan of the oversized quiff and, along with amassing almost one million followers on Twitter, has seen his YouTube tutorial on achieving the look go viral with 10,000 views to date. Another popular YouTuber is Jim Chapman, who along with over two million YouTube subscribers, is the boyfriend of fellow social media star Tanya Burr. He specialises in quirky videos focused on lifestyle trends but also keeps his followers abreast of essential style tips such as how to dress like One Direction star Harry Styles. Unlike James, Chapman doesn't confine himself to hair and indulges in everything from spray tans to armpit waxing and even the odd bit of make-up. But Chapman has competition in the shape of 20-year-old Alfie Deyes, aka Zoella's preppily-dressed other half, who has spawned a generation of copycats. Deyes is the wholesome (and rather well groomed) face behind the PointlessBlog, a Youtube vlog that documents his daily doings. This vlog about Chapman getting his armpits waxed was especially popular and got more than a million views . Chapman is dating fellow vlogger Tanya Burr and sometimes allows her to do his make-up (pictured) Alfie Deyes' preppy look and carefully spiked hair has spawned a legion of imitators . Deyes is one of the most popular of all the vloggers and boasts an incredible three million subscribers . The PointlessBlog celebrated its fifth anniversary in July 2014 and #5YearsOfPointlessBlog trended worldwide number #1 for 9.5 hours. As a result, Deyes' casual preppy look and carefully spiked hair has spawned a legion of imitators and is now the dominant look among teens. Although he doesn't give style advice, his army of female fans have proved quite the inspiration for teens in search of a girlfriend. And Deyes seems to enjoy all the attention he gets too. 'I love it,' he says of being mobbed on the street by lustful ladies. 'I just double the amount of time I would previously have allowed for the trip.' So successful is Deyes, he has been able to persuade stars such Ariana Grande to appear in his videos .

"The family of a young mother left unable to eat, drink, speak or walk after falling from her horse when thugs pelted it with stones have spoken of their heartbreak at her plight. Mother-of-two Lindsey Broomhead, 29, has been in hospital for eight months after suffering severe brain damage when she was thrown off horse Murphy while riding in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Surgeons had to remove part of the cerebellum, the region of the brain which controls motor skills, meaning she cannot walk, and she also suffered a stroke, meaning she cannot swallow. Lindsey Broomhead, 29, has been in hospital since her fall eight months ago. Sugeons had to remove part of her cerebellum, leaving her unable to walk, and she had a stroke, meaning she cannot swallow . Ms Broomhead was riding Gypsy Cobb cross Murphy in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, when a group of teenage thugs pelted the horse with stones, causing it to throw Ms Broomhead off and bolt . But despite these terrible injuries, Lindsey's mother Val says she is still able to hug her children, daughter Kayden, nine, and son Corey, five, which has kept her spirits up. She added: 'Lindsey is making small steps, but she will never be able to have physical involvement with her kids again. Ms Broomhead pictured with her mother Val, who has now taken legal custody of her two children Kayden, nine, and Corey, five . 'Even if they go on holiday she will be unable to play on the beach or chase them about. She will have to sit aside and watch instead without joining in. 'All this has been taken away from her because of a needless, senseless prank. It really is devastating for all of us and our lives have changed so much. 'Luckily the children are little wonders and have been very good adjusting to the situation. Lindsey can give the kids a cuddle, which is comforting to them. But she can’t eat or drink without a tube. 'The only way she can communicate with us is through typing on an iPad or alphabet board. It was strange getting used to it at first but it’s been eight months now and life goes on. 'We’re all adjusting to it but it is so sad to see her like this.' Val, 59, who with husband Frank, 62, now has legal guardianship of Kayden and Corey, also spoke about the emotional impact the fall has had on the family. She added: 'We’re very lucky to have a great family and this has brought us closer together. 'Most days you feel positive - Lindsey is an amazing woman and her spirit is so uplifting - other days you want to break down and cry buckets it’s so sad. 'We go and visit her in hospital everyday - sometimes twice a day - just to keep her spirits up. 'On Christmas Day we all got together in hospital to be with her for a few hours. It was strange but some things are more important - we just all pulled together. 'The school have also been very helpful in making sure the kids are okay. Everyone has been supportive.' Police are still looking for the attackers, who threw rocks at Murphy as Ms Broomhead rode him along this track in Rotherham, causing him to bolt and leaving Ms Broomhead for dead . Val said Lindsey and her family now want justice and for Murphy’s senseless attackers to be found. She said: 'Murphy now let’s people ride him again but Lindsey will never get on a horse for the rest of her life. It won’t change what has happened to all our lives, we want them to see justice. 'The police have been brilliant and so helpful, but these people are still out there and know what they did. This has devastated us and I wish they could see the effect their dreadful prank has had.'","Lindsey Broomhead, 29, was riding horse Murphy when thugs threw rocks .

"A Los Angeles restaurant is charging $50 for the country's first water tasting class lead by a certified water sommelier. Water 101 is being hosted at Patina by the restaurant's resident aqua expert Martin Riese - who will teach customers about the 'fundamentals of water' during the hour long lesson. 'Water is essential to life. But not all waters are the same,' he explained on the class brochure. 'Water has a significant impact on the way we taste food... and can be paired in a manner similar to wine.' Haute hydration: Certified water sommelier Martin Riese (pictured) is teaching a 'water tasting' class at Los Angeles restaurant Patina . Tasty aqua: The expert even has his own brand of water called Beverly HIlls 90H2O, which is sold at Patina Restaurant Group's establishment Ray's and Stark Bar . The price of admission also includes five 'dramatically different' waters and small bites from Patina's signature artisanal cheese selection. The first class in the series takes place on February 4 with others being held at Patina on April 1 and June 3. The flyer ensures future water connoisseurs that the groups will remain small so customers will get the most out of their tasting. Mr Rise, who is also general manager of the Patina Restaurant Group's dining establishment Ray's and Stark Bar, was the man behind the establishment's 45 page water menu, which features 20 varieties of water from around the world. Before he started working for the Patina Restaurant Group in 2011, the H2O expert had written a 200-page book on the topic, titled Die Welt des Wassers or The World of Water. He had acquired his water sommelier certification in 2010 after completing a $3,000 week-long course at Doemen's, in his native Germany. 'A lot of Americans think water is just water,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 2013. 'But I completely don't believe in that. Water has so many interesting nuances.' He noted: 'Every water has an unique taste, even tap water.' 'Different mineral content of each water gives the waters a different tastes,' Mr Riese explained. 'It can go from sweet to salty and smooth to complex.' The expert even has his own brand of water. Beverly Hills 90H20 is sold at Ray's and Stark Bar for $13 per bottle, although it is not clear whether or not it will be served at Mr Riese's upcoming tasting lessons. Mr Riese said the base of his water comes from a mineral water spring from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, noting that it took him and his partner Jon Gluck over a year to come up with the 'perfect natural mineral mix' to add. 'We’ve even patented our water formulation and bottle shape,' he said. 'Every blend is limited to a 10,000 bottle run.'","Patina is holding a Water 101 class that educates students on the 'fundamentals of water'

"An adorable baby orangutan born following an extremely rare primate C-section has given her first wave. Pictured moments after her birth on January 7, the newborn - who is yet to be named - is seen feeding from a bottle and cuddling up to staff at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center. Markisa, a 27 year-old Sumatran Orangutan, gave birth to the infant, who weighed a healthy 3.45 pounds. After the birth, she recovered from the procedure back at her home in Como Zoo while her baby received medical attention in hospital. Scroll down for video . Hello world! The baby orangutan, who is yet to be named, was born following an extremely rare primate C-section in Minnesota this month . It's a girl! Markisa, a 27 year-old Sumatran Orangutan, gave birth at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center on January 7 . Adorable: The newborn orangutan weighed a healthy 3.45 pounds but was cared for in an ICU while her mother recovered at Como Zoo . The baby orangutan was delivered by Dr Micky Trent with the consultation of an extensive medical team as it was Markisa's second required C-section, both of which were performed at the Veterinary Medical Center. Como Zoo primate keeper Megan Elder said: 'C-sections are very rare in that there are only about a dozen recorded within the International Orangutan Studbook that has tracked more than 1,200 births in captivity throughout history.' This is a very important birth both for the zoo and the species. Markisa was recommended for breeding by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Orangutan Species Survival Plan because of her status as one of the most genetically valuable female Sumatran orangutans in North America. In her first weeks, the infant was cared for in an ICU at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center and looked after by primate experts from the zoo - and the plan is for her to be slowly reacquainted with her mother. The newborn was bottle-fed by zoo staff during the time she is separated from Markisa. She was delivered by a team of Dr Micky Trent with the consultation of an extensive medical team as it was Markisa's second C-section . Her infant is being cared for in an ICU in the care of primate experts from the zoo. While separated from her mother, she is being bottle-fed . The Association of Zoos and Aquariums governs a Species Survival Plan for endangered species in captivity in the United States. The committee that supervises the SSP for orangutans set guidelines and recommendations each year to manage the captive population. Como Campus Manager Michelle Furrer said: 'The SSP provides good zoo homes for each animal and helps to maintain a diverse gene pool within the zoo community' 'The zoo will work with the SSP to ensure that this animal becomes a healthy addition to the zoo population.' About 200 orangutans are currently on exhibit in zoos throughout the U.S. Their native population, found primarily in Sumatra and Borneo, has dwindled due to commercial logging, agriculture, hunting and poaching - all of which put the species under the threat of extinction.
