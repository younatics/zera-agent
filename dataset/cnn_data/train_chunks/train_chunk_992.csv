"Scroll down for video...She is known for her million dollar smile and bubbly and glowing persona when she is pictured on the red carpet. But in her mugshot for her recent dramatic arrest last Friday, Reese Witherspoon looked anything but camera ready. With her head and eyes down and what appears to be a smirk across her face, it is not the actress her fans know from her fun flicks, including Legally Blonde and Election. What a difference: Reese Witherspoon had her head down and what appears to be a slight smirk across her face in her recent mugshot, a look far different from her red carpet appearance on Sunday night . Reese admitted in a statement released on Monday that she 'clearly had one drink too many.' And according to a police source within the Atlanta Department of Corrections who told People magazine, the actress failed to look up in her mugshot because she was 'wobbly'. 'She was wobbly,' said the source. 'She didn't need help walking, but she wasn't at a point where we could get a really clear picture.' The source told the publication that they had to take numerous snaps of the Academy Award winning actress in order to get some kind of mugshot. Fairing better: Reese's husband Jim Toth had his head up and looked at the camera in his mugshot . Eventually they were forced to use the one where she had her eyes cast down, allegedly because her 'motor skills weren't what they needed to be.' 'On another picture, she sort of bent down at the waist and we got the top of her head,' said the source. 'She wasn't being difficult or rude, but her motor skills weren't what they needed to be.' Meanwhile, video footage of Reese in handcuffs following her dramatic arrest in the early hours of Friday morning was revealed on Tuesday. The footage shows the 37-year-old actress being led out of an Atlanta police station in cuffs before being unshackled and taken inside for booking where she made her  ''you're about to find out who I am' comment.

"A remarkable album of photographs taken by the future King Edward VIII during a ‘sight seeing’ tour of the Western Front 99 years ago has come to light. Edward, Prince of Wales, took his own camera with him on his morale-boosting visit to the front-line in France in 1915. The young Royal took scores of snaps which included a group of captured Germans, shell holes, bomb damaged buildings and British troops practising throwing hand grenades at a dummy soldier. The camera king:  The Prince of Wales, France, spring 1915 . Sir Pertab Singh at a field day at the headquarters of the Indian Cavalry Corps, Chateau St Andre, near Aire in February 1915 in a photograph taken by the Prince of Wales . He also snapped numerous Army officers he met on the visit and posed for several photos of himself as well. The prince wrote captions on the back of some of the pictures, such as “Ruined House in Vassincourt near Bar le Duc. Note the shell holes in the wall!! Jan. 1915” Edward, who 21 years later sparked a constitutional crisis by abdicating the throne to marry double divorcee Wallis Simpson, was an Army officer himself and joined the Grenadier Guards in June 1914. Prince Alexander of Teck with his fellow officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Barry, Lieutenant Lord Claud Hamilton, Colonel and Prince Alexander at Nieuport, March 1915 . He was said to have been desperate to go to the front and fight but was banned from doing so by war chief Lord Kitchener in case the future king was killed or was captured by the Germans. Instead, he had to make do with visiting the men on several occasions in 1915. G. de la Rochefoucauld (left) on a canal towpath between Bergues and Dunkirk in May 1915. Image taken by the Prince of Wales; Twenty-five years before the Allied retreat, the Prince of Wales took this photograph of a ruined house in Dunkirk in April 1915 (right) The prince, who was aged 21 at the time, took the photos between January and September 1915 at various places in France, which were around five miles from the frontline. The personal album remained with him and then his widow Wallis until her death in April 1986 when the 50 year lease on their grand house in Paris – and its contents – was bought by Harrods owner Mohamed Fayed. The millionaire sold the album in 1997 to a private collector who has now made it available for sale at auction for an estimated £6,000 to £8,000. Matthew Hayley, of the auctioneers Bonhams, said: “Prince Edward went to the front line as often as possible on something of a sight-seeing tour to boost the morale of the men. He became popular with the soldiers. “It is quite remarkable to think that 100 years ago the heir to the throne could be placed so close to a war zone where there could have been things like unexploded mines. “There are over 650 prints in the collection that were taken by him or with his camera. They are his own work which in itself is very interesting. German prisoners of war in France, 1915. Taken by Prince Edward . “The provenance is excellent. After taking the pictures and having them processed he kept them. They remained with him and then at his home in Paris until 1997.” Some of the Army officers Edward photographed was Major General Prince Alexander of Teck and Lord Claud Hamilton, who was mentioned in dispatches the year before for commanding a machine gun for five days and nights without relief.

"This record-breaking feat is sure to get Blackpool residents – and tourists – pumped up. The iconic seaside town in Lancashire set a new Guinness World Record today for the world's biggest beach ball. The gigantic orange and white ball was inflated near Central Pier on Blackpool Beach, weighing a staggering 880 pounds and standing as tall as the White House in Washington, DC, when it was fully inflated. Pumped up: Visit Blackpool says it has set a new Guinness Word Record with a gigantic beach ball that has a diameter of 59 ft . Iconic: The gigantic orange and white ball was inflated near Central Pier on Blackpool Beach, weighing a staggering 880 pounds . Hold on tight: Blackpool's new record was validated on the spot by independent adjudicators, although it still awaits an official declaration . With a diameter of 59 ft, the custom-made orb is three times the size of a standard house and weighs about the same as an adult horse. It was inflated as part of a Visit Blackpool publicity stunt aimed at attracting tourists and giving the town's reputation a boost. Iain Hawkins, spokesman for the tourism board's #BlackpoolsBack campaign, said: 'We wanted to create something special, something unique that illustrates both Blackpool's legendary sense of fun and the fact that there has never been a better time for families to visit the most iconic seaside resort in the UK. 'The giant #BlackpoolsBack beach-ball, the biggest ever made in the world, does all of that and more.' It took almost an entire fortnight to manufacture the beach ball and transport it to Blackpool Beach, where it was inflated near Central Pier . On the count of one...: The ball was inflated as part of a Visit Blackpool publicity stunt aimed at attracting tourists and giving the town's reputation a boost . Life's a beach: The record-setting beach ball is capable of holding 3,766,313 pints of water or almost 60,000 standard beach balls . Councillor Graham Cain, Blackpool Council's cabinet member for tourism and leisure, said: 'We've gone through years of regeneration and we're now at a point where we can be very proud of the holiday area we have to offer.' It took an entire fortnight to manufacture and transport the ball, which is capable of holding 3,766,313 pints of water or almost 60,000 standard beach balls. Had it been inflated by mouth, it would have taken 32 days to blow up. Once it was inflated, Blackpool's new record was validated on the spot by independent adjudicators, the tourism board said. Polish supermarket chain Real was the previous record holder. The grocer inflated a beach ball with a diameter of 51 ft in May 2012. Tourism officials say the publicity stunt was an attempt to illustrate Blackpool's legendary sense of fun and history as a fun-filled destination for families . When it is fully inflated, the beach ball stands as tall as America's White House and is three times the size of a standard house in the UK . Hot air: Had it been inflated by mouth, it would have taken 32 days to fully inflate the massive beach ball .

"A teenager who took police on a 70-mile chase in a stolen van the wrong way on a motorway has been jailed. Ryan Nee, 19, stole a white Transit from Billericay, Essex, before heading north on the southbound side of the M11. Ryan Nee admitted burglary, theft of a vehicle, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a valid driving licence at a previous hearing and was sentenced to 15 months in prison . Police were scattered to try to stop the unemployed teen but he led them on a 70-mile chase all the way to Cambridge. A police helicopter flew overhead in the early morning chase on May 21 before he was stopped at Godmanchester, Cambs. Basildon Crown Court heard how the escapade only came to an end when Nee hit a stinger, smashed into a lorry and flipped the van. An ambulance was called to the scene but amazingly both drivers escaped serious injury with the teen suffering just “superficial wounds”. When asked why he was caught wearing gloves and a motorbike helmet Nee told police is was “because he was cold”. One policeman described the chase as the worst case of dangerous driving he had seen in his 26-year career. Nee, of Harold Hill, Essex, admitted burglary, theft of a vehicle, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a valid driving licence at a previous hearing. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison when he appeared via videolink at Basildon Crown Court on Monday. Recorder Elroy Claxton, sentencing, said: “Nee, you must appreciate this was a most dangerous piece of driving. “Driving on a motorway at night on the wrong side of the carriageway means you were a danger to other road users and a danger to yourself. “This dangerous driving lasted a significant amount of time and went on for 70 miles. “Your driving must have been frightening to other road users and there was a real danger of death to either yourself or other people.” Ryan Nee stole the transit from this road in Billericay, Essex before taking it on a joyride . Nee claimed to have been the lookout for a burglary at the property in Billericay and claimed he had not gone inside. Mike Warren, mitigating, said his client was “clearly not an experienced criminal” and had only taken part to pay off a £300 drug debt for cannabis. As well as his prison sentence Nee was disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge. The route that Nee took, leading police on a 70-mile chase from Essex to Cambridgeshire .","Ryan Nee, 19, of Harold Hill, Essex, stole the van in Billericay .

"South African President Jacob Zuma has pulled out of today’s memorial service for Nelson Mandela at Westminster Abbey to attend the lavish wedding of Robert Mugabe’s daughter. The Abbey service, thought to be the first for a foreigner, had already been rescheduled to accommodate Mr Zuma. However, Mr Zuma instead spent the weekend in Zimbabwe at the £3million wedding of Bona Mugabe. His spokesman denied it was a snub to Mandela. Allies: South Africa's Jacob Zuma (left) and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe pictured together in 2003 . Prince Harry, representing the Queen, and Prime Minister David Cameron will be among 3,000 at the memorial for Mr Mandela, who died in December aged 95. The date of the service was originally planned for February 11, the anniversary of his release from prison in 1990, but was changed so Mr Zuma, who was preparing for his annual State of the Nation address on that date, could attend. Honour: The service today at Westminster Abbey will be the first for a foreigner . South Africa’s controversial 71-year-old leader informed memorial organisers last week that he would now be too busy to join the unique event and would send his deputy and two ministers in his place. Instead, Mr Zuma spent the weekend at the extravagant wedding of Bona Mugabe, daughter of President Mugabe, 90, who hosted 4,000 guests at his large estate in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, for a two-day celebration. After Mr Zuma announced he would not be attending in person, Buckingham Palace informed the Abbey that Prince Harry would be attending on behalf of the Queen. A spokesman for the Abbey confirmed that Mr Zuma had sent his apologies, and admitted they were 'disappointed'. 'Clearly we were expecting President Zuma and we were disappointed that he can’t come but we understand that schedules change,' Abbey spokesman Duncan Jeffrey said. Back home, Mr Zuma’s decision to spend the weekend with the Mugabes instead of paying tribute to Mr Mandela in London was being interpreted as a deliberate snub to the former colonial power. Both white and black South Africans used Twitter to express their anger at their leader’s decision to prioritise the Mugabe wedding over an historic service in honour of Mr Mandela. At the main South African memorial in the days after Mr Mandela’s death, which was attended by current and former world leaders, Mr Zuma looked visibly rattled as he was booed loudly and repeatedly by crowds at the stadium in Soweto. Tensions: Many South Africans are angry at the current government when compared with Mandela's ideals . Mac Maharaj, Mr Zuma’s official spokesman, said Mr Zuma was too busy with domestic issues to attend the London event, but denied it could be interpreted as a snub. 'He has sent the second-highest office [his Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe] and two ministers,' he said. 'I have seen some articles saying this is a snub. This is not a snub – people are wrong.' Mr Zuma and the ruling ANC will on May 7 run in what are widely expected to be the most hotly-contested parliamentary and provincial elections the former liberation movement since Mr Mandela led it to power in 1994. A series of corruption scandals have seen Mr Zuma’s personal popularity plummet and many now believe the ANC could lose its two-thirds parliamentary majority for the first time.","First ever Abbey service for a foreigner had already been delayed for Zuma .

"Raheem Sterling was '100 per cent entitled' to have a night out on his return from England duty, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says. Sterling came under fire when it was revealed the 19-year-old hit Carnaby Street nightclub Cirque le Soir with England team-mates Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain until 3am the day after he told national team boss Roy Hodgson he was too tired to start against Estonia in Tallinn. But following Liverpool's 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday night, Rodgers emphatically defended his star winger. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sterling criticism unfair - Rodgers . Raheem Sterling in action against Real Madrid after coming under fire for hitting a nightclub until 3am .

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says his star player was '100 per cent entitled' to have the night out . Jordan Henderson drove  Sterling from Liverpool training at Melwood the day after his night out in London . 'I think for Raheem it's obviously just important he focuses on his football - it's unfortunate, six days before a game when he's on a day off can't go out,' he said. 'It's obviously a story for some, but if you read it carefully, then there's not a story in it. '100 per cent it was a night out he was entitled to have, yes.' Rodgers also praised Sterling's performance against Real as his side were comprehensively outplayed by the Champions League Group B leaders. 'He was terrific tonight, and he goes about his work really well. With his rise he'll learn maybe people want to knock you, but he's focused on his work,' Rodgers said. Hodgson also backed Sterling on Wednesday night when talking to students at Cambridge University. 'With young Raheem Sterling this week, it guts me to see that sort of treatment,' Hodgson said.

The England mentor added there have been no arguments with Rodgers despite clashes over Sterling and the Reds' striker Daniel Sturridge, who was injured on international duty. 'There is no tension with Brendan,' Hodgson said during a talk about his philosophy of leadership. 'We get on very well. I've been very fortunate that, in two and a half years I've not had a single situation where a manager has tried to drag a player out of the team, or told me that they don't want their players to take part. 'Brendan and I have always got on very very well since he took the job at Liverpool, so there's no problem at all.'","Raheem Sterling went out to a London nightclub until 3am the day after telling Roy Hodgson he was 'too tired' to play for England .

"Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at an up-scale department store chain outlet on Monday, say Frisco Police. Police attended the Dillard’s store at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco, north of Dallas, at 8.17pm, after the young NFL star was detained by security staff. Randle, 22, was charged with Class B misdemeanour theft of goods between the value of $50 (£31) to $500 (£314). Dallas Cowboys' Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at a Dillard's department store in Frisco, Texas . Randle, 22, was arrested on Monday and released after posting £220 bail on Tuesday morning . A police spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Randle tried to take a pack of two black Polo underwear valued at $39.50 (£25) and a small bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne priced at $84 (£53). Randle, whose base salary this season is $495,000 (£311,000), was released from custody on Tuesday morning after posting bail of $350 (£220), police confirmed. Although behind DeMarco Murray in the Cowboys' pecking order, Randle played a key role in their side's win over defending Super Bowl champions Seattle on Sunday.

"Walking for half an hour a day is equivalent to taking a 'magic pill' that combats ageing and prevents premature death, an expert has said. Dr James Brown surprised an audience at the British Science Festival by presenting the myriad benefits of a pill that could maintain healthy living and improve quality of life. The wonder-drug was able to prevent obesity and diabetes, lower the risk of some cancers, relieve depression and anxiety, increase mobility, and reduce the chances of hip fracture by 40 per cent. It also improved the ability to think and reason, slowed the progression of Alzheimer's disease, cut arthritic pain by 50 per cent, boosted energy levels, reduced fatigue and led to a 23 per cent lower risk of dying. Scroll down for video . Dr James Brown from Aston University revealed a 'magic drug' to the British Science Festival today, claiming it prevents obesity and diabetes, lowers the risk of some cancers and relieves depressions and anxiety. He delivered the punchline: 'This isn't a pill, it's exercise' Then he delivered the punchline: 'This isn't a pill, it's exercise.' Dr Brown, from the School of Life and Health Sciences at Aston University, said: 'All of these changes are not seen in people who run marathons; they're not seen in people who lift weights in the gym, or spend four hours running on the treadmill. 'These are seen in people who walk and who walk for half an hour a day. 'You can get all of these health benefits; you can get a reduction in all of these diseases that are associated with ageing, by just keeping active, by walking for half an hour a day. 'If there is one take home message it would be that.' During his lecture at the University of Birmingham Dr Brown outlined the 'use it or lose it' philosophy behind keeping active and healthy as we age. He stressed that remaining inactive for too long could lead to muscle loss that may never be recovered. This in turn could have a major impact on quality of life. Dr Brown described one study that compared the effect of putting a leg in plaster for two weeks in two groups of young and old participants. The young group lost twice as much muscle mass during that time - probably because they were more muscular to start with - but quickly put it back on when the plaster was removed. After four weeks of gym training, they were back to normal. In sharp contrast, the older participants' muscle mass was not restored after four weeks, or even eight. 'There's a very good chance that they will never get it back,' said Dr Brown. He added: 'What we know is that immobility of muscle can cause a significant amount of muscle wastage, and in some cases you never get that muscle back. 'This leads to something called the 'stairway to dependence'. What we now think happens is there's a series of steps of degradations of ability that lead an older adult to go from being independent to dependent.' Ultimately too much inactivity in an older person resulted in a condition called sarcopenia which was marked by significant muscle loss. 'This can lead to an inability to exercise,' said Dr Brown. 'Maintaining your muscle mass is really important.' Dr Brown said: 'You can get all of these health benefits; you can get a reduction in all of these diseases that are associated with ageing, by just keeping active, by walking for half an hour a day' Dr Carol Holland, from Aston University's Centre for Healthy Ageing, said there was evidence that 30 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented by improving aspects of lifestyle, including physical exercise. Keeping the brain active and maintaining social contacts was also important. 'Physical, intellectual and social engagement has a real impact in preventing or slowing intellectual decline in old age,' said Dr Holland. 'Intellectual decline isn't inevitable. Thirty minutes of moderate exercise a day can reduce your risk of age-related diseases. It can also reduce your risk of cognitive decline.' Dr Benjamin Ellis from Arthritis Research UK said: 'We strongly support Dr Brown’s view that exercise is one of the best ways of keeping a number of chronic conditions at bay – including arthritis. 'Doctors should prescribe physical activity to prevent and treat arthritis, rather than handing out painkillers, and we have to get over the message that exercise is not bad for the joints but is the best way of reducing your risk of getting arthritis.' The charity’s recently published public health report warns of an ‘arthritis epidemic’ as the population ages and becomes more obese, but stresses the importance of exercise and weight loss as the best way of countering this. 'Healthy physical activity improves the health of our joints and bones, and a wide range of activities such as walking, swimming, cycling and running have all been shown to reduce the overall risk of joint pain and disability,' added Dr Ellis.","Dr James Brown revealed 'magic drug' at British Science Festival today .

"A power cut could have prevented a . shark spotter from sounding a warning alarm just before a British . swimmer was savaged by a great white off the coast of Cape Town in South . Africa, it has been claimed. A shark spotter is thought to have . seen 43-year-old Michael Cohen enter the water and attempted to warn him . of danger - but the siren didn't work because of a city-wide power cut, . it has been reported. According to South Africa's Daily . News website, an official incident report from the City of Cape Town . claimed there was an electricity failure with the power company Eskom. In shock: Michael Cohen in the water seconds after the attack by a 10ft Great White shark off a beach in Cape Town . Dragged to safety: Mr Cohen is pulled ashore while the shark is still circling nearby . Alive - but only just: Mr Cohen leaves a trail of blood as anxious rescuers pull him from the sea . The report said: 'At around 12.25pm (on Wednesday), the . mountain shark spotter saw a swimmer enter the water near the Clovelly . Corner area. Regular swimmer: Michael Cohen, 42, is an accountant who previously lived in Chiswick, west London, before moving to South Africa . 'The spotter tried to sound the alarm, but due to an Eskom-related city-wide electricity failure, the alarm did not sound.' Eskom were unable to comment as the company said it was unaware of the City of Cape Town's incident report. An Eskom spokeswoman confirmed a power . cut lasted for two hours, starting from just before 11am to shortly . after 1pm. It was apparently caused by a trip on the power line . supplying Cape Town. However, they were unable to comment . on the possible impact this had on the shark alarm as they unaware of . the authority's incident report. Meanwhile a seal has emerged as an unlikely saviour by apparently helping Michael Cohen as he was attacked by the shark. Two men who dragged Mr Cohen to shore . described how the creature swam around them as if to distract the 12ft . Great White, which appeared to be preparing for a second strike. Mr Cohen, who lost his right leg and part of his left foot, yesterday remained in a critical condition in hospital. Back ashore: Mr Cohen is dragged on to Clovelly Beach immediately following last Wednesday's attack . Is this the culprit? This image of a Great White was taken close to where Mr Cohen was attacked. It was taken by shark spotters monitoring the area this week . Creating a diversion: A seal was on the scene as Mr Cohen was pulled from the water . Surgeons paid tribute to the . remarkable first-aid treatment he received when a shark-spotter tied his . belt and wetsuit shorts around the 42-year-old’s injured legs as . improvised tourniquets – stopping him from bleeding to death. Mr Cohen, an accountant, had ignored warnings of a shark in the area before taking to the water off Fish Hoek beach. Yesterday, passers-by Hugh Till and . Douglas Drysdale told how they ran into the blood-clouded surf to help . pull the stricken swimmer to safety after watching the attack. The pair modestly played down their own heroics, but highlighted the surprising role of the seal. ‘As Douglas and I were pulling him in . towards the shore, the seal frolicked nearby, and kept swimming past . us, it seemed rather agitated. ‘It occurred to us afterwards how . unusual it was for a seal to stick around in an area where a shark is, . or where there is blood. ‘It really did feel to us as though . he was offering support to us, or the swimmer, and was prepared to act . as a diversion if the shark went after us as well,’ Mr Till said. The 66-year-old was in the area with . his friend Mr Drysdale, 61, trying to spot whales when they saw the . shark looming towards Mr Cohen, who was swimming a few yards from the . beach. They stopped their car and ran to . shout warnings, but it was too late, leaving them to watch helplessly as . he was pulled under. Beach rescue: Medics treat Michael Cohen's injuries, using makeshift tourniquets to stem the blood flow from his legs . Drama: Members of the Fish Hoek emergency services stretcher Mr Cohen from the beach to a helicopter . Airlift: Mr Cohen is taken to hospital in Cape Town where he was expected to undergo around six hours of surgery . Even though the shark remained in the area, . possibly preparing for a second strike, the two men plunged into the . water to help in the efforts to drag Mr Cohen to safety. Professor . Andrew Nicol, who operated on the swimmer, said he had needed seven . litres of blood on arriving at hospital. He had fought to save one of the . Briton’s legs, even though it was badly bitten, because he had lost the . other leg. Mr Cohen’s femoral artery and vein were both torn – usually a . fatal injury – and Professor Nicol praised the life-saving first-aid . efforts by a member of the beach’s shark-spotting team. ‘The tourniquet resulted in the . almost complete stopping of blood loss from the thigh and I just want to . commend the people giving first aid on the beach for saving the life of . this patient,’ he said. ‘Self-made improvised tourniquets . don’t tend to work and are frowned on in medical literature, but this . really was life-saving. If the femoral artery and vein are both severed . you don’t tend to make it into hospital alive.’ He said the parents of Mr Cohen, who . is single, had been by his bedside. ‘They are extremely traumatised by . what’s happened and realise the seriousness of his condition.’ The Canadian-born accountant, who has . a British passport and lived in London before moving to South Africa, . had taken to the water even though the beach was closed after shark . sightings. He was said to be a regular swimmer at the beach, who had previously ignored warnings to stay out of the water. The site of the attack is close to . one of the highest populations of Great Whites in the world, and has . seen a number of deaths and injuries to swimmers and surfers. Last night, experts said the seal had . been nearby. Craig Lambinon, of the National Sea Rescue Institute, . said: ‘A shark remained close to the scene throughout medical efforts to . save the victim, and it has been confirmed that a seal was swimming . close by during the entire episode. ‘Witnesses confirmed the seal circled the men as they gradually waded ashore with the victim in the presence of a shark.’ Clear warning: A woman reads a book on a bench beneath a shark warning flag next to the closed Fish Hoek beach in Cape Town, South Africa, where the man was attacked .","Power cut stopped shark spotters sounding siren .

"Cricket legend Ashley Giles was among the stars of the game, past and present, in attendance as the world's highest ever cricket match was played out near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro on Friday. Balls were plucked out of thin air and hit onto the roof of Africa as the match was played in a freezing ice crater near Mt Kilimanjaro. England limited overs coach Giles and South African fast bowling legend Makhaya Ntini were among the participants, which took place not far from the 19,341ft (5,895m) Tanzanian summit known as the roof of Africa. Former England spinner Ashley Giles stands at slip during play in the world's highest cricket match near the summit of of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania . The match was played on the ice-covered crater of Kilimanjaro, breaking the previous record set in 2009 on Mount Everest . A group of more than 30 players, official umpires and support crew trekked almost 20,000 feet to the top of the great African peak over eight days in a bid to surpass the record set in 2009 on Mount Everest. The two teams, also including former England women's captain Clare Connor, current national representative Heather Knight and more from Australia, Canada, Kenya and South Africa, reached their target around dawn on Friday after slowly scaling the mountain to ensure they acclimatise properly. They then rolled out a plastic pitch over the ice and set about playing a full Twenty20 match. Players 'warm-up' before the highest ever cricket match, a full Twenty20 contest, following a 20,000-ft eight-day trek up the vast extinct volcano . The match was played on a rolled out plastic pitch with a bright orange ball just a short hike from the Tanzanian mountain's 19,341ft-high summit . 'This is absolutely incredible! We are playing cricket on the summit of Africa!' former England spinner Giles tweeted from the summit. Due to the extreme elevation, balls travel further than they usually would so the organisers carried 24 spare ball in their packs, along with helmets, pads and bats, to ensure the game isn't cut short by a shortage of supplies. 'I am not underestimating how hard it will be because of the affect it will have on my body and my mind,' he said before setting off. 'But we should be able to pull each other through the challenge and then play a game.' The cricketers battled thin air in the high altitude, which made the ball travel further and put the players at serious risk of illness .

"Marouane Fellaini wants nothing more to be fully fit and pushing for a place in Manchester United's struggling line-up, but he's certainly not wasting his time while working his way back from injury. The Beligian midfielder has shown his lighter side in a Twitter post with what he calls a 'new haircut' as he continues his support for the disability charity CAP48. Fellaini's afro has been fashioned into a more angular version of his usual ball shape, though the style making his trademark curly locks look even more pronounced appears suspiciously like a wig. Injured Manchester United star Marouane Fellaini shows off his new hair style for the charity CAP48 . The gesture, photographed at an event for the charity and posted on Twitter, is Fellaini's latest act of kindness for the charity based in his homeland. The former Everton star has been sponsor for the 55-year-old group since 2011, well before his £27million transfer from the Toffees in August last year. . 'A new haircut to support #cap48. Be ""carrement CAP48""!' he posted with a picture of his new 'do. The post followed this teaser on the social networking site. 'After the training, go to the hairdresser ... See you soon #Newhair #Again #Barbershop #Afro #NewStyle.' Fellaini celebrates a goal in United's pre-season match against Valencia before his ankle is injured . Fellaini's working his way back from a pre-season ankle with his only competitive appearance this campaign in the season opener, off the bench for Ander Herrera in United's 2-1 loss to Swansea. Lous van Gaal's side has since won just once, a 4-0 demolition of a below-par QPR before blowing a 3-1 lead to fall 5-3 to Leicester the following week. Having largely been considered a flop for his new club in a disappointing first season, Fellaini is confident he'll get a chance to prove himself under Van Gaal. However, the 6ft 4in Belgium star knows he has a host of competition in a side which has splashed £150m on new talent over the summer. The Belgian midfielder is working his way back to full fitness and pushing for a place in Lous van Gaal's team . 'I talked to Van Gaal, and he has never said that I had to leave,' Fellaini told Sport Wereld. 'He said I had a lot of competition, but that I got the chance to prove it [that I deserve to play]. 'I have known difficult moments last season, but there is a stronger player afterwards. I have confidence in myself and in my game again. 'I played a good World Cup and also during the preparation, I was good. It is unfortunate that this injury is for now just a spanner in the works, but at the end of the month I will be back.'

"A woman taking a no-make-up selfie craze said the charity craze saved her life leading her to find a lump in her breast. The social media campaign raised £8 million for Cancer Research UK in just one week. But for Jackie Nicholas the internet sensation saved her after she was nominated by a friend to upload a bare-faced selfie on Facebook. But after posting the photo the 35-year-old from Derby, visited a link to a charity's website, which advises women how to check their breasts. Scroll down for video . Jackie Nicholas, 35, found out she had breast cancer after uploading her no-make-up selfie to Facebook and following a link to a site which advised on how to check breasts for lumps . Mrs Nicholas,  a lecturer at Derby College, had her breast removed and underwent chemotherapy but is not in remission, with no sign of the cancer returning . To her horror she examined herself and found a lump, which was later confirmed as cancer. Now Mrs Nicholas, a lecturer at Derby College, has undergone treatment for the disease and is  in remission, with no current signs of the cancer returning. She credits her Facebook friend, Nicola Aldred, for her recovery after being nominated to take part in the campaign. Mrs Nicholas said: 'It is the power of social media which has saved my life. I've done well to catch this and find it early. 'I've given Nicola a huge thank-you for what she has done - it's amazing. 'I couldn't believe it when I found a lump. I really didn't know what to do. 'I never really thought it would happen to me at my age. It was a totally surreal situation.' The no-make-up selfie craze was started by teenage mother Fiona Cunningham, of Stoke-on-Trent, who was inspired after seeing actress Kim Novak attend the Oscars without any make-up. It turned into an internet sensation, with soaring numbers of women posting pictures of themselves wearing no make-up on Facebook and nominating their friends to do the same. Cancer Research UK said the money  generated has been used to fund 10 new clinical trials. Mrs Nicholas, who never thought she would be a victim of cancer, said she vividly remembers the moment she discovered the lump. 'I'd read the online story and had looked at the signs and symptoms and it told you how to check,' she said. 'When I found it I thought I was imagining it. It is much more common in people who are 45 and above.' Mrs Nicholas credits her Facebook friend, Nicola Aldred, for her recovery as she nominated her to take the selfie which led to her diagnosis . The no-make-up selfie turned into a viral craze, which has seen soaring numbers of women posting pictures of themselves wearing no makeup on Facebook and nominating their friends to do the same . Too frightened to do anything about it, Mrs Nicholas went ahead with a planned holiday to Paris with husband Tom, a teacher. She told him about the lump on holiday and they went to a clinic as soon as they could on their return. She said: 'I went to the doctor who referred me to the breast unit. You should have seen the number of women in there who were waiting. 'The tests showed there was no doubt I had a tumour. I was told by a consultant that I had cancer. Mrs Nicholas wants to raise awareness that the disease can hit younger women . 'Nothing can ever prepare you for hearing those words. 'Straight away I wanted to know what were the chances of me dying? My life was completely out of control.' After the diagnosis in May, she had to have a breast removed and is facing months of chemotherapy. She said: 'There is a chance it could return in the future and I will have to be tested for the next five years to make sure.' She now wants to raise awareness that the disease can hit younger women. She also would like to thank the hospital that was so helpful during her ordeal. 'I have so much faith in the NHS and we are so lucky to have it,' she said. 'The staff and everybody at Royal Derby Hospital were absolutely fantastic.' Mr Nicholas, 31, is grateful that a viral craze helped save his wife's life. He said: 'It's all come about through social media and it is something we can be thankful for.' Dr Nick Peel, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Thanks to the generosity of our supporters, the #nomakeupselfie trend raised £8 million in just one week, which resulted in us being able to fund 10 clinical trials. 'When it comes to spotting breast cancer early, it's important to get to know what's normal for you, so you're more likely to notice any unusual or persistent changes.' Mrs Nicholas added: 'If it was not for the no-make-up selfie then I might not be here now. It has definitely saved my life. I did think, am I going to die? 'Whoever came up with the idea of the no-make-up selfie is an absolute genius and a life-saver.'","Jackie Nicholas, 35, was nominated for a no-make-up-selfie by a friend .

The FA expects an attendance around 50,000 for the match against FIFA’s equal lowest-ranked team, making it likely to become the least attended competitive international football fixture at the stadium since the new Wembley opened in 2007.

But now a cruise line is offering intrepid travellers the chance to face the Northwest passage - the route through northern coast of North America,  connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In 2016, The Crystal Serenity will take 900 passengers on the largest expedition through the Northwest Passage ever made, setting passengers back between £12,500 and £93,000. The luxurious Crystal Serenity cruise ship (pictured) will be the first to traverse the Northwest Passage . Departing from the Gulf of Alaska, the 32-day journey will sail around Alaska and into the Beaufort Sea, through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and on to Greenland, before docking in New York City . British sailor John Franklin left England with two ships in 1845. The expedition never made it; all 129 of the crew perished in the Canadian high Arctic ice. Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen - who later led the first successful expedition to the South Pole - made history by crossing the Northwest Passage in three years reaching the Pacific in 1906. In 1942 a second ship replicated Amundsen's achievement, and only in 1944 did anyone do so in the space of a single year, without being forced by the ice to halt midvoyage for the winter. By the mid-1990s, only three or four ships made the journey each year. Four ships made the journey in 2006, by 2013, that had increased to 18. Silversea's 132-guest Silver Explorer recently  successfully completed the journey through the  Northwest Passage. The 23-day voyage commenced in . Kangerlussuaq, Greenland on August 9 and concluded in Nome, Alaska on September 1. It covered a distance of nearly 3,500 nautical miles. But the route has never been attempted by a ship of this size. Thomas Mazloum, executive vice president of Crystal Cruises explained: 'A lot of small expedition ships have now gone through the Northwest Passage and even some commercial ships.' 'But we don't have 100 guests on board; we have 800 or 900. To do it with a ship like ours, we need to do it differently.' The ‘once-in-a-lifetime expeditionary voyage’ is being offered by Crystal Cruises is set to appeal to wildlife lovers and those curious about our changing world. Departing from the Gulf of Alaska, the 32-day journey will navigate the Northwest Passage, around Alaska and into the Beaufort Sea, through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and on to Greenland, before docking in New York City. Holidaymakers will get the chance to see amazing arctic wildlife in its natural habitat, such as humpback and beluga whales, seals and walruses, oxen, kittiwakes and murres in flight. There will also be the chance to meet indigenous people, living in small Arctic settlements on the route.  The trip is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on August 16, 2016. Arctic sea ice conditions have shifted, making it possible for a wider range of vessels to sail the passage . Only around 200 ships have ever sailed the whole length of the Northwest Passage since Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen (who later became the first man to reach the South pole) made history by crossing it in 1906. Only in 1942 did a second ship manage to replicate his journey. But more recently, Arctic sea ice conditions have shifted, making it possible for a wider range of vessels to sail the passage. It is not without its risks though. In 2010, an expedition ship named the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground there. The crew and 118 passengers were rescued by a Canadian icebreaker. Amazing wildlife in its natural habitat: Passengers on Crystal Serenity will see a range of arctic animals . The area is served by seven icebreakers, operated by Canada's coast guard, but rescues can be lengthy due to the sheer scale and remoteness of it. So Crystal Serenity will be prepared for all eventualities, travelling with a support vessel, which can break channels through the ice, a helicopter pad  and facilities for towing and evacuations. And the cruise liner insists that they will not impact the small arctic towns and fragile environment. Thomas Mazloum told CNN: 'We want to do this in a responsible manner and educate people. I understand that some people may not like that, but I think we can have a positive impact.' 'We are not going to leave anything behind. Not a single drop of garbage or anything else.' Passengers will disembark in small groups of 150 - 200 when visiting Arctic settlements and Mazloum insisted that the local populations were enthusiastic about showcasing their culture to interested visitors.","Luxurious Crystal Serenity to make its virgin arctic voyage in August 2016 .

As the driver reverses cautiously out of his garage, rain begins to fall hard on his windscreen. Footage captured on a camera on the vehicle's dashboard, shows a man unwittingly driving  into a tornado . But this is not just a spot of bad weather. As the vehicle makes its way onto the road, the wind picks up and the downpour becomes ferocious. The windscreen becomes totally obscured as water droplets become streams and debris flies towards it. Soon the wind is so fierce, it sweeps the car and its driver back towards the garage - which it rips to shreds in seconds. Luckily for the driver, the twister appears to miss his car by a just few meters. The footage also shows the aftermath and the trail of destruction left by the tornado: Roofs have fallen in, buildings collapsed and several windows of the Toyota RAV 4 have smashed, and the body of the car is severely dented. According to Viral Hog, which posted the video, the footage was filmed on August 29 this year. Stormy weather: As the vehicle makes its way onto the road,  the downpour becomes ferocious .

"Owen Farrell starts his first game in more than a month on Friday as the Saracens and England fly-half attempts to prove his fitness ahead of the autumn internationals. The 23-year-old was  named by Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall on Wednesday for the tough European Champions Cup clash with Munster in Limerick as they look to build on last week's opening Pool One victory over French giants Clermont at Allianz Park. England coach Stuart Lancaster has indicated that — fitness permitting — Farrell will be his starting fly-half against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8, but any recurrence of the quad injury which has seen him play just four minutes in the past month would be a major setback. Owen Farrell has not started a match for more than a month but will do so for Saracens on Friday . Sarries travel to Munster  and Farrell will want to prove his fitness ahead of England's autumn internationals . Lancaster insists he is unconcerned about Farrell's lack of game time. He said: 'I trust Owen, he'll be ready. We've never been afraid to put players in for the first game, but you have to get the balance right when you're playing the All Blacks. Cohesion and experience is important to us and, of the fly-halves we have, Owen is our most experienced.' Victory in Limerick would put last season's beaten finalists in pole position to qualify from the group and McCall has named a powerful-looking side which includes second row George Kruis, who was also named by Lancaster in his 33-man squad. Farrell, pictured here playing for his country against Italy in March, has become a key player for England . England head coach Stuart Lancaster (right) says the Saracens No 10 is his first choice fly-half . Kruis has impressed this season and got his first England call up following injuries to Leicester locks Geoff Parling and Ed Slater. 'I've been pretty lucky with the opportunity,' Kruis said. 'Other guys who were well in the mix have been injured, but I've got the chance and I have to take it.' Out-of-favour wing Chris Ashton, who scored two tries against Clermont last week and has been in prolific form this season, starts on the right wing with David Strettle on the left. Both men have a point to prove after being overlooked by England. Chris Ashton will start on the  wing for Saracens against Munster but did not make the latest England squad . McCall said: 'Both wingers have been outstanding for us over an extended period of time.' Alex Goode, Billy Vunipola and Brad Barritt also start for the north London outfit in their final club game before England take on the world champions. McCall added: 'History suggests Munster are particularly good at lifting their performance for these home games in Europe.

Carlo Nash may get a driving ban and a hefty fine after being caught doing 140mph in a 70mph area . Val Attenborough, chairman of the bench, found Nash guilty in his absence and adjourned the matter until August 5 when he will be sentenced.

"EU bosses are to crack down on Google for failing to comply with privacy laws, France's data watchdog has said. Google has been combining data from across its sites so it can improve they way it tailors its advertising to individuals since March. However, regulators see the scheme as 'high risk' to people's privacy, and last October, the firm was given four months to revise its policy. Google has been combining data from across its sites to better target adverts since March 2012. However, regulators see the scheme as 'high risk' to people's privacy - and say the firm has failed to implement its recommendations . Google's privacy policy—which allows the . company to track users between services like Gmail and YouTube – has . drawn fierce criticism from both US and European consumer advocacy . groups. The regulators included a . list of 12 'practical recommendations' which would bring Google’s . privacy policy and data collection up to standard. They centre on the firm’s automatic collection of personal data, . ranging from browsing histories and real-time location data to credit card . details. However, France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes (CNIL) data protection agency said the internet giant had not yet made the changes demanded by the regulators. 'At the end of a four-month delay accorded to Google to comply with . the European data protection directive and to implement effectively . (our) recommendations, no answer has been given,' it said in a statement. CNIL, which led the probe on behalf of EU data-protection . authorities, said EU regulators 'are determined to act and continue . their investigations' and their 'repressive action.' 'Therefore, they propose to set up . a working group, led by the CNIL, in order to coordinate their . reaction, which should take place before summer.' The new policy was implemented after Google combined 60 separate privacy policies into one agreement. In October the data protection agencies warned Google its new confidentiality policy was not in line with EU laws, and gave the Internet giant four months to make changes or face legal action, including possible fines. Privacy campaigners warned of 'real concern' over Google's lack of action. Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'After a year of investigation it seems consumers are no closer to seeing any action taken against Google, despite regulators deeming its privacy policy to undermine their rights. 'It is of real concern that Google seems to be paying lip service to regulators and yet those same regulators have not taken meaningful action to resolve the situation. 'Ensuring consumers have control of their data and a clear understanding how it is used is a fundamental part of the digital economy. 'Google's actions seem to illustrate a company intent on frustrating both of these objectives.' Google's data center in Douglas Country, Georgia. The firm has again come under fire for its privacy policies, with French regulators claiming the EU could take action within months . Google maintained in a statement released Monday that its confidentiality policy was not in breach of EU law. 'Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services,' Google said. 'We have engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process and we’ll continue to do so going forward.' EU competition authorities are separately investigating whether Google has used its search engine to promote its own services and hinder competitors like Microsoft by manipulating search rankings.

"Stick with Sportsmail today as the full 23-man line-up for Euro 2012 is unveiled at 1pm . Rio Ferdinand has been told by Roy Hodgson that he will not be in England’s Euro 2012 squad, pointing to John Terry being among the 23 players he names at 1pm. When asked if he had been left out on Tuesday night, Ferdinand said: ‘Yes, it’s true.’ The snub is likely to signal the end of Ferdinand's international career. Out: Rio Ferdinand, who played in Harry Gregg's testimonial on Tuesday night, will not be selected for Euro 2012 over doubts about his fitness, while John Terry is now expected to feature for his country . Goalkeepers: Joe Hart (Man City), Scott Carson (Bursapor), John Ruddy (Norwich) Defenders: Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Phil Jones (Man United), John Terry (Chelsea), Joleon Lescott (Man City), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Ashley Cole (Chelsea), Leighton Baines (Everton) Midfielders: Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Aaron Lennon (Tottenham), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Gareth Barry (Man City), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Scott Parker (Tottenham), Ashley Young (Man United), James Milner (Man City) Strikers: Wayne Rooney (Man United), Danny Welbeck (Man United), Andy Carroll (Liverpool), Daniel Sturridge (Chelsea) The FA have refused to confirm the outcome of talks between Terry and Hodgson at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground on Tuesday but Hodgson has certainly resolved the issue of having Ferdinand and Terry in the same dressing room when Terry is awaiting trial for the alleged racial abuse of Ferdinand’s brother, Anton. The FA stripped Terry of the captaincy, which led to Fabio Capello quitting as England manager in February. The omission of Ferdinand and Phil Jagielka (understood to have been put on standby) as well as injury to Chris Smalling would suggest Terry has made the cut. But Hodgson could still take only seven defenders, with Phil Jones covering as one of four centre halves and as a second right back alongside Glen Johnson. Disappointment: Ferdinand, who lined-up for United in Tuesday night's testimonial for Harry Gregg in Belfast, will not be going to Euro 2012 . Is Hodgson right to axe Rio Ferdinand for Euro 2012? The players Hodgson plans to leave out received phone calls on Tuesday night breaking the news. Peter Crouch and Micah Richards are out, while Kyle Walker will miss out through injury. Crouch’s omission would suggest Andy Carroll will go to Poland and Ukraine. But the focus will remain  on Ferdinand and Terry at Hodgson’s Wembley press conference, even if the manager will point to Ferdinand’s injury record as the reason he has been omitted. Ferdinand has not played for England since last June. On Tuesday night, he was in action for Manchester United in their 4-1 in over an Irish League XI. The game at Belfast's Windsor Park was a testimonial for Harry Gregg, United's hero of the 1958 Munich air crash.

"Target Corp and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holiday shopping season last year, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed. Smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Those breaches have yet to come to light. Also, similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year. The sources said that they involved retailers with outlets in malls, but declined to elaborate. At least three other well-known U.S. retailers have been hit suffered a credit card breach akin to that of Target and Neiman Marcus, according to financier pundits . They also said that while they suspect the perpetrators may be the same as those who launched the Target attack, they cannot be sure because they are still trying to find the culprits behind all of the security breaches. Law enforcement sources have said they suspect the ring leaders are from Eastern Europe, which is where most big cyber crime cases have been hatched over the past decade. Only one well-known retailer, Neiman Marcus, has said that they too have been victim of a cyber attack since Target's December 19 disclosure that some 40 million payment card numbers had been stolen in a cyber attack. On Friday, Target said the data breach was worse than initially thought. An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Neiman Marcus said it was not sure if the breach was related to the Target incident. Most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain personal information is compromised. In many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer. Merchants are required to report breaches of personal information including social security numbers. It was not immediately clear if that was the case with the retailers who were attacked around the same time as Target. After being forced to admit their credit card hacking scandal late last year, on Friday Target announced an investigation had found hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, not the 40 million first anticipated . The Secret Service and Department of Justice, which are investigating the Target breach, declined to comment on Saturday. Target has still not disclosed how the attackers managed to breach its network or siphon off some of its most sensitive data. The sources who spoke to Reuters about the breaches said that investigators believe the attackers used similar techniques and pieces of malicious software to steal data from Target and other retailers. One of the pieces of malware they used was something known as a RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text, the sources said. While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches. Luxury merchant Neiman Marcus confirmed Saturday that thieves stole some of its customers¿ payment card information and made unauthorized charges over the holiday season . Visa Inc issued two alerts last year about a surge in cyber attacks on retailers that specifically warned about the threat from memory parsing malware. The alerts, published in April and August, provided retailers with technical details on how the attacks were launched and advice on thwarting them. A Visa spokeswoman declined comment on the reports, which did not identify specific victims. It was not clear whether Target's security team had implemented the measures that Visa had recommended to mitigate the risks of being attacked. Yet a law enforcement source familiar with the breach said that even if the retailer had implemented those steps, the efforts may not have succeeded in stopping the attack. That is because the attackers were more sophisticated than the ones in the previous attacks described in the Visa alerts, according to the source. The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Retailers are often reluctant to report breaches out of concern it could hurt their businesses. Target only acknowledged its 2013 attack after security blogger Brian Krebs reported the breach, prompting inquiries from journalists and investors. Neiman Marcus said an outside forensics firm discovered evidence on January 1 that indicated the retailer had been the victim of a cyber attack. It disclosed the breach nine days later, after another inquiry from Krebs, who was following up on reports about a surge in fraudulent charges traced to the retailer. Sources say that hackers are using pieces of malware known as a RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, such as a checkout . Target and J.C. Penney Co Inc. waited more than two years to admit that they were victims in 2007 of notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez, who was accused of masterminding the theft and reselling of millions of credit cards and ATM numbers. During his trial the companies were represented by lawyers who did not identify their clients as Target and J.C Penney. Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy with the American Bankers Association, said banks and credit card firms like Visa are forbidden from naming merchants that have been breached, unless they disclose it themselves. 'It is really frustrating to the bank and also the customer,' Johnson said. One of the sources who told Reuters about the recent rash of attacks said the memory parsing malware cited in the Visa reports was among the tools that the hackers had used, but said they used other techniques as well. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer is not commenting on the company's investigation of the breach. 'This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. It would be inappropriate to discuss details at this point.' The credit hack at Neiman Marcus - who are still yet to confirm how many customers have been affected - came as a shock to many shoppers, as the store is considered much more upscale than Target . Avivah Litan, a security analyst for Stamford, Connecticut -based Gartner information technology research firm, said she learned about a separate set of breaches, dating back no more than a few months before the November 28 Thanksgiving Day start of the holiday shopping season, from a forensics investigator. She declined to provide his name. 'Target was not the only retailer who got hit, but they got hit the biggest,' Litan said. Investigators believe that the early series of attacks on retailers staged before late November were mostly used as trial attacks to help the hackers perfect new techniques they then used against Target, stealing payment cards at unprecedented speed, Litan said. Chris Gray, director of Denver, Colorado -based Accuvant information security firm's risk and compliance practice, said that sophisticated cyber crime groups do that because they only have once chance to get it right before victims catch on. 'You want to test it and make sure it works,' Gray said. 'Then you push it out at the appropriate time and do as much damage as you can.'","New information claims at least three other well-known retailers experienced a credit card data breach over the holiday shopping season .

"An endangered orangutan is fighting for life after being shot more than 100 times with an air rifle in a cruel attack. The female ape, called Aan,has been blinded in one eye and has sustained other serious wounds to her body after being struck repeatedly by pellets. She was hit 37 times in the head by the lead slugs, while 67 projectiles penetrated other parts of her body in the shooting, which took place in an oil palm plantation in the Indonesian part of Borneo. Wounded: A veterinarian from the Orangutan Foundation removes the airgun pellets from the orangutan . Sick: 37 pellets were shot into her head, while 67 peppered the rest of her body . 'We're amazed, but truly thankful, that she has managed to cheat death – but it has been touch and go', said a local conservationist. The savage attack is yet another incident in a catalogue of cruelty against the large apes which are being targeted by vigilantes working for oil plantation owners. As their forest habitat has dwindled with trees being chopped down for the forestry industries, orangutans have encroached onto oil plantations and other properties looking for food. Earlier this year the Daily Mail revealed the story of a mother orangutan photographed with her arms around a baby ape as hunters working for their oil plantation boss moved in for the kill. Fortunately conservationists were able to save her before any harm came to her or the infant and they were moved to another location. But Aan has not been so lucky. Conservationists said the only good news to emerge from the incident is that she has survived and has started to eat at a clinic where the pellets are still being removed from her. Aan’s recovery is being aided by volunteers from the British-based Orangutan Foundation, but they are concerned she could die from infections caused by the wounds to her head, as well as those near her heart and lungs. The head of the local conservation agency, Hartono, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said: 'Even though she is eating, she is still, technically, fighting for her life. 'She has been very seriously injured and she could relapse at any moment. But she’s a true fighter. She’s fighting very hard.' Added to the fears that Aan could still die are concerns that should she survive she might lose the sight in her remaining eye and her hearing could be affected. If she survives, conservationists fear she will never be able to be released back into her slowly diminishing world in the wild. Touch and go: Aan could still die of her horrific injuries, but rescuers called her a 'fighter' She would be an easy target for hunters once again and she would have problems finding food. But keeping her in captivity would also cause her distress as she would want to return to a mate or an extended family still in the jungle. Rangers from the conservation group found Aan struggling through grassland on the outskirts of an oil plantation and managed to catch her and take her to a clinic. 'The next few weeks are touch and go,’ said Hartono. 'We are all praying for her.' Six months ago four men were sent to jail for eight months for shooting and beating to death three orangutans and long-nosed monkeys in East Kalimantan – the Indonesian part of Borneo, the large island that is shared with Malaysia. It was revealed after their arrest that the owners of a Malaysian oil company had paid them to drive the apes away from a plantation. Just 50,000 to 60,000 of the two species of orangutans are left in the wild, 80 per cent of them in Indonesia and the remainder in Malaysia. International conservation groups are worried the animals are faced with extinction from poaching and the rapid destruction of their forest habitat, which is being swallowed up by palm oil plantations.","The orangutan, named Aan, was blinded in one eye .

"He auctioned his entire life – car, home, job and friends – on eBay in a midlife crisis that made headlines the world over. When Ian Usher’s wife Laura left him six years after they emigrated from Britain to Australia, he shed every part of his old life. Then he took the proceeds and made a fresh start, travelling the world armed with nothing but a list of life-goals. A forlorn Ian Usher auctioned his entire life on eBay in Perth, Australia, after his wife left him four years ago . Meeting millionaire Richard Branson was one of the experiences on Mr Usher's list of 100 things to do . Four years on he has achieved most of them, has found love again . . . and is living on his own Caribbean island. Mr Usher, 48, who is originally from Darlington, made £192,000 after putting his three-bed house near Perth in Western Australia and all its contents on sale. The eBay lot included his Mazda car, motorbike, jet-ski and parachuting gear. The keen sky-diver also included an introduction to his friends and a trial at his job as a sales assistant at a rug shop. Still heartbroken after his marriage split, Mr Usher boarded a plane for Dubai, then on to dozens more countries. And since then he hasn’t looked back or wasted a minute. He has lived each day to the max – running with bulls, cage diving with great white sharks and even joining the Mile High Club. Ian Usher used the proceeds from auctioning everything he owned to buy a Caribbean island like this one off the coast of Panama (file photo) Ain't no mountain high enough: Standing in the shadow of Mount Everest . Mr Usher has ticked off 93 of the 100 experiences he planned to complete within 100 weeks. During what he describes as an ‘incredible’ two years, he learnt French and how to fly a plane, met Sir Richard Branson and scored a bit-part in a Hollywood movie. A life sold: Ian Usher also published a book about selling his whole life . He said: ‘I think a couple of standout ones were swimming with a mother humpback whale and her calf in Japan, and riding a motorbike on the Wall of Death. My week in Pamplona in Spain was fantastic, and terrifying too, running with the bulls there.’ The wish-list also included ‘flying a plane solo, seeing the red crabs at Christmas Island . . . I could go on. It was an incredible two years’. Along the way he founded an online network for others who, like him, feel they have been ‘blindsided’ by life. He blogged about his adventures and has self-published his book A Life Sold – another goal checked off the list. Before his money ran out he bought an idyllic 2.2-acre island off the coast of Panama, believed to have cost around £30,000, where he is building himself a home. And while it wasn’t on his to-do list, Mr Usher has also managed to find romance along the way. The new woman in his life is a Canadian called Moe, who often visits him at his new home.Mr Usher told the Sydney Morning Herald they met while dog-sledding, but . didn’t see each other for a further 15 months although they kept in . touch. ‘When we met up again in Florida, spending a week together in . Jamaica, then a further week in Costa Rica, romance developed,’ he said. He admitted that the choice of Panama in Central America as a place to settle was ‘a little random’. Living life to the limit: Ian Usher stands on the edge of the Grand Canyon as part of his whistle-stop world tour . ‘I really didn’t want to live somewhere where I’d have to work to be able to afford to live – at least for a year or two. I made an offer on a small island, which was accepted. It’s very laid back and relaxed.’ He lives in an archipelago Bocas del Toro (Mouths of the Bull), a popular tourist destination near the border between Panama and Costa Rica. Visitors are drawn by its beautiful natural landscape which includes lush rainforest, golden sand beaches and a coral reef. Unsurprisingly Hollywood has come calling, with Disney snapping up the rights to Mr Usher’s story. He said he hasn’t regretted his decision for a second. ‘It has been the most incredible adventure – exactly what I was after. [I’ve learnt] that I am much happier and more fulfilled when sharing life’s adventure with a partner, and that I am very resilient and resourceful.’","Briton checks off bucket list after becoming internet sensation in Australia .

"Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, married the daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon yesterday, but the ceremony was overshadowed by the conspicuous absence of his parents who refused to attend as a family feud rumbled on. Emma McQuiston will make history when she becomes the first black Marchioness in Britain after her wedding to the future Marquess of Bath at the family seat of Longleat. But she claims her relationship with the aristocrat has caused upset among the British elite because of her ethnicity and background. Picturesque setting: The couple outside the family seat at Longleat, but his parents, Lord and Lady bath, refused to attend the ceremony . Viscount Weymouth, Ceawlin Thynn, with his bride Emma McQuiston at Longleat (left). The groom's father the Marquess of Bath (right) decided to attend another society wedding with his wife Anna Gael. They watched  Heloise Lorentzen marry  polo player Sean Wilson-Smith at the village of Wonston, Hampshire, instead . In an interview with society magazine Tatler, the 27-year-old said: 'There's class and then there's the racial thing. It's a jungle and I'm going through it and discovering things as I grow up. 'I’m not super-easily offended but . it’s a problem when someone’s making you feel different or separate . because of your race. I have never had anything horrible said or happen, . but it is something you sense. You can just tell with some people.’ But the Marquess of Bath – famous for . his string of ‘wifelets’ – and his real wife, Hungarian-born Anna Gael, . 69, boycotted the ceremony, which took place at Longleat House . yesterday afternoon. A source told the Daily Express: 'It . was an intimate ceremony. Longleat is considered one of the foremost and . widely respected traditional British estates in the country. 'With the backdrop of the safari park, estate and house, it was quite special. 'Many . people have celebrated that she will be the first black marchioness in . the UK, which was widely praised as ""about time too"".' Naked fury: Ceawlin Thynn incurred the wrath of his parents over his renovation of Longleat, which has involved removing a number of his prized erotic paintings . Lord . Bath has expressed great displeasure at his son’s renovation of the . family seat at Longleat, which has involved removing a number of his . prized erotic paintings, and said he would stay away from the wedding. The 80-year-old Marquess – wearing . mustard chinos and a green velvet jacket – instead went to a wedding in . Hampshire yesterday morning, accompanied by his wife, . Ceawlin's mother. He . saw professional polo players Heloise Lorentzen and Sean Wilson-Smith . tie the knot in a lavish affair in Wonston, with the happy couple then . celebrating with their guests, many of them fellow polo players, at a . wedding banquet for almost 250. Lady Bath, who splits her time . between Longleat and Paris, is thought to disapprove of Miss McQuiston, . an aspiring celebrity chef. ‘She . has asked her son to call it off,’ a friend of the family said. ‘She . seems to think Emma isn’t good enough for him.

Last month, Emma McQuiston's mother lambasted Lord and Lady Bath for refusing to attend her daughter’s wedding to their only son. Suzanna McQuiston told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They’ve both known Emma since she was three-and-a-half. She’s a wonderful, incredibly beautiful and sweet girl. I just can’t understand it. ‘One thing I would say is that I don’t want people going on about snobbery. Emma has been a regular at Longleat since she was three-and-a-half. 'Her sister-in-law is Lady Silvy [Ceawlin’s half-aunt]. It’s nothing new to Emma.’ Not impressed: Emma McQuiston's mother, Suzanna McQuiston, has criticised Lord and Lady Bath for refusing to attend her daughter's wedding to their only son . In Therese And Isabelle in 1968, she . stripped naked and simulated lesbian sex. She also disrobed for Zeta One . in 1969, described as ‘the ultimate erotic extravaganza’. And in Take . Me, Love Me Nana in 1970, she played a prostitute. She . became known as the ‘Naked Lady of Longleat’ while a newspaper cutting . from 1970 called her ‘the most remarkable thing to happen to the English . aristocracy since Lady Godiva rode bareback into town’. Lord . Bath fell out with his son after discovering he had taken down murals . painted for Lord Weymouth and sister when they were children. The row is . so fierce that the pair live in separate wings at Longleat and rarely . meet. Lord Bath told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s my life’s work and he’s quietly binned it. 'It’s killed my relationship with him and I don’t feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding.’ It was a day of high society weddings – and a day full of surprises for the guests and the happy couples alike.

"In 1961, Yuri Gagarin was almost thrown into space and dragged back again inside a spherical vehicle known as Vostok 1, while a few weeks later American Alan Shepard followed suit in a similarly primitive capsule known as Freedom 7. Following in the footsteps of the Wright Brothers’ Wright Flyer, Henry Ford’s Model T or the de Havilland Comet 1, these spacecraft were the first vehicles to usher in a new era of transportation - space travel. And just like their siblings in other realms of transport, Vostok 1 and Freedom 7 would inspire a wealth of new designs and inventions as engineers across the globe rushed to fulfill the demand for new machines that would explore the stars - but among the handful of spacecraft that would be successful, there were a host of other designs that never made it off the ground. The perhaps appropriately named Dyna-Soar, owing to its ultimate extinction, was just one of many designs for spacecraft that have materialised since the dawn of the space age in 1957. Dyna-Soar would have been a reusable spaceplane capable of attacking a target nearly anywhere in the world at the speed of an intercontinental ballistic missile, achieved by travelling into space and diving back to Earth again . At the dawn of the Space Age, in October 1957 when the Soviet Union’s Sputnik 1 ventured into orbit, it was the United States Air Force (USAF) who first considered one of a few options for a fanciful spacecraft akin to science fiction. Their initial project was the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar (‘Dynamic Soarer’), a reusable spaceplane with a single pilot that would be capable of launching into space and back again. As a project of the USAF, however, this was not something designed for civilian exploration like Nasa’s efforts that were to follow, but rather it was a military weapon that would be able to bomb distant targets with the speed of an intercontinental ballistic missile. The spaceplane, though, as it’s name suggests, would have been capable of reaching space, and it was even thought to be able to orbit Earth. Among the pilots that were considered to fly it, chosen in secret, was successful test pilot (and later first man on the moon) Neil Armstrong. But the . USAF soon ran into problems, namely there was no rocket that was deemed . suitable to get the Dyna-Soar into orbit, and it lacked a clear goal – . thus, on 10 December 1963, just as construction began, the project was . scrapped. No, this isn't Nasa's Space Shuttle - it's the Soviet Union's Buran shuttle, on the launchpad ahead of its sole flight in 1988, which bears a large number of similarities to its American counterpart. Its rumoured the Soviets wanted to emulate the exploits of the US, and designed a vehicle that would rival the Space Shuttle. Despite one unmanned flight, however, the Buran was ultimately scrapped . The . research would prove invaluable in the creation of the Space Shuttle . over a decade later, but the Dyna-Soar also inspired some similarly . ambitious designs. Indeed, one was the Soviet Union’s own Space Shuttle clone that seemed to be an almost exact replica of America’s newest space exploration vehicle. Known as the Buran, development began in 1976 and it was intended to offer almost identical capabilities to the ‘real’ Space Shuttle. It launched on a booster rocket, known as Energia, could perform operations in orbit and was also reusable (aside from the booster that launched it). The Buran would complete one unmanned flight in 1988 before the programme was scrapped following the dissolution of the USSR in 1993. And, even more tragically, the sole spacecraft that took flight was destroyed in 2002 when the hanger it was stored in collapsed. The USAF's Air Launched Sortie Vehicle, conceived in the early 1980s, was intended as a mini-shuttle that could launch to and from anywhere in the world with ease. The purpose of it, much like the modern secretive X-37 spaceplane, was not widely known, and it was scrapped before the concept took off . Another attempt at a Space Shuttle that never made full operation was the USAF’s Air Launched Sortie Vehicle (ALSV). This small reusable spaceplane, not too dissimilar to the X-37 that is in operation today, would have been capable of launching from anywhere in the world atop a mothership in the form of a Boeing 747. A small booster would have carried it to orbit before the ASLV returned to land at an airfield on Earth – but again, this was a design that would never see the manufacturing floor. It wasn’t just American and the Soviet Union who were interested in fantastical feats of space exploration though - in 1975 the French space agency (CNES) designed a space shuttle known as Hermes. Development began with Esa in 1985, with the vehicle intended to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket. It would carry a crew of three and almost the entire spaceplane would be reusable, save for a small Resource Module at the rear that would be shed before re-entry. By 1992, however, the attempts at overcoming the challenges of building such a vehicle proved problematic, and Hermes was soon consigned to the bin. Esa's Hermes spacecraft was an ambitious effort from an agency that to this day is yet to design any sort of vehicle that could take humans into space. Nonetheless it, too, was deemed as being the 'holy-grail' of spacecraft in that it would be reusable and thus affordable, taking astronauts to and from Earth orbit on a regular basis . Another ambitious project was the Rockwell X-30, part of the continuing effort by the US to create a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle that had no expendable components. It was first derived by American company Rockwell International in the 1980s, with its main goal being to enable a crew of two to enter space and perform experiments. But a rather loftier goal set for the X-30 was for it to become a passenger liner that could take people from Washington to Tokyo in two hours , leading President Ronald Reagan to refer to it as the ‘new Orient Express’. The spaceplane would have accelerated to 25 times the speed of sound to achieve low-Earth orbit, before dropping down back into the atmosphere to land at its destination. The project was eventually terminated, however, due to major technical concerns and budget cuts. The Rockwell X-30, artist's illustration shown, would have been a passenger liner that used a scramjet-inspired design to reach speeds of 15,000 miles (24,000 kilometres) per hour. It would have been 160 feet (50 metres) long with a wingspan of 74 feet (23 metres). It was scrapped due to technical concerns, particularly how to keep the crew safe at such high speeds . A more recent dream for a revolutionary spacecraft was the Kankoh-Maru, a concept created by the Japanese Rocket Society in 2005. The egg-shaped vehicle would have apparently been capable of taking dozens of people into orbit before returning to Earth. If it sounds ridiculous, that’s because it was - the project was soon quietly cancelled when it was realised that such a vehicle would be all but impossible to build. The Kankoh-maru, artist's illustration shown, was to be a huge passenger-carrying vehicle that would take paying customers into space. The single-stage-to-orbit vehicle would have been 77 feet (24 metres) high with a diameter of 59 feet (18 metres). The Japanese spacecraft was quietly cancelled, though, when the technical difficulties were realised . All of these spacecraft so far bear an obvious similarity - they were vehicles intended to take astronauts solely into Earth orbit for either lengthy or brief ventures into space. But there was one design that promised oh-so-much more when it was dreamed up in the days of Apollo, when most regard3ed the moon missions as just a minor stepping stone to the ventures into deep space that were sure to follow. Nerva, which stands for Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application, was not a spacecraft per-se but rather an engine for one that promised to take humans beyond the moon to Mars. It was the first proof that nuclear thermal rocket engines were feasible, an engine far superior to the kerosene and liquid oxygen fuels employed by other spacecraft like Apollo. Together with the Saturn V rocket, Nerva was envisaged as the final cog that would make manned missions to Mars as early as the 1970s possible. Perhaps the most innovative development that never flew was Nerva (schematic drawing shown), a nuclear thermal rocket engine that would have been the vital cog to enable manned missions to Mars, and also help to build lunar bases. Sadly the programme was scrapped, although there are hopes its design could inspire future efforts to travel to Mars . That all changed with the Nixon Administration – with the Apollo missions struggling for support (three later missions – Apollo 18, 19 and 20 were cancelled) Nixon scrapped both Apollo and ultimately the Saturn V rocket in favour of building a space station in Earth orbit, Skylab, and eventually a reusable spacecraft that was intended to reduce the cost of going to space – the Space Shuttle. And, sadly, despite numerous tests proving how successful such an engine could be, Nerva was finished off in 1972. Nasa had planned to use Nerva to visit Mars by 1978 and create a lunar base by 1981, but with its cancellation those dreams were gone. Perhaps now, as Nasa once more prepares to dream of missions to Mars, the research into the revolutionary Nerva engine will make such missions possible. And even then, the designs of the other spacecraft that never flew serve as a reminder that, even though we may not have reached the lofty goals expected of space exploration so far, there has been no shortage of engineers and scientists shooting for the stars.","The launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 heralded the dawn of the age of space exploration .

"It is meant to be a day of solemn reflection on the sacrifice paid by those who fought and died for their country. So many of those who lined the streets of Bristol were left outraged when a man dressed as a devil chose to gatecrash a Remembrance Day march to honour the war dead. These shocking pictures show a masked man, wearing a pink corset and stockings, skateboarding alongside the parade of marching troops in Bristol today. The man was seen cutting in and out of the regiments after the formal ceremony had finished, during which wreaths were laid. His behaviour was in marked contrast to elsewhere across the country, where the war dead were remembered with suitable solemnity as the Queen led the nation in honouring the fallen with the Duke of Cambridge joining her at the Cenotaph. Scroll down for video . Outrage: This picture captures the moment a man dressed as a devil skakeboarding alongside Bristol's Remembrance Sunday parade . Affront: Horrified onlookers shouted at the bearded man as he disrupted the city's Remembrance Sunday parade today . The Bristol intruder was tackled by a policeman who dragged him through the crowd - as people shouted their disgust at him.

'He was taken into custody.'Jose Paulo Da Silveria has been charged under the Public Order Act and will appear at Bristol . Magistrates’ Court on December 4.' As he was bundled into a police car . yesterday, officers had to forcefully remove several males who approached him and . shouted obscenities and ‘death’s too good for you’. Witness Nick Calvert, 51, said: ‘He came down on a skateboard and was wearing a pink outfit and a mask with horns. Disgrace: The masked skateboarder, who was wearing pink frilly knickers and corset, was quickly stopped in his tracks by police . Bundled off: Police grabbed the skateboarder away from the parade as a crowd shouted their disgust at him . ‘A policeman grabbed him and dragged . him through the crowd rather swiftly. When he saw the policeman he tried . to get off his board but he got him. ‘There was a general show of disgust from the crowd because he was showing no respect. I have no idea what it was about.’ Ray Turton, 68, said: ‘The police dragged him through the crowd and tried to rip his mask off. ‘He put up a lot of resistance and they had to use quite some force to restrain him. People were shouting ""rip his head off"".’ At the Cenotaph memorial in London the monarch laid the first wreath to commemorate members of the Armed Forces who died fighting in all conflicts since the First World War. In brilliant autumn sunshine, senior members of the monarchy joined Prime Minister David Cameron, military chiefs, servicemen and women and thousands of watching spectators in paying their respects. When the first stroke of 11 sounded from nearby Big Ben, Whitehall observed a two-minute silence only punctuated by the hum of distant London traffic and birds. The Queen laid the first wreath, followed by the Duke of Edinburgh. Hostile reception: The skateboarding devil is led through the crowd by police after disrupting the Remembrance Sunday parade in Bristol . Taken down: Several officers pin the unnamed man to the floor while Bristol's Remembrance Sunday parade passes by . Disgust: Police stayed on the scene to protect the man from a growing number of furious members of the public . Then the Duke of Cambridge, wearing his RAF uniform, laid a wreath, under the gaze of the Duchess of Cambridge, who watched from a balcony at the Foreign Office alongside the Countess of Wessex and the Princess Royal's husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence. William was followed by the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Princess Royal, Prince Michael of Kent and Field Marshal Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank. Wreaths were also laid by Mr Cameron, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, opposition leader Ed Miliband and Westminster Plaid Cymru group leader Elfyn Llwyd, as well as high commissioners from Commonwealth countries and leaders of the Armed Forces. The crowds watching the service in central London could be the largest yet, the Royal British Legion said. Tribute: Thousands of people had gathered in Bristol to pay their respects to the millions of people who had fought and died for their country . The charity's head of remembrance, . Helen Hill, said that numbers were swollen as recent conflicts brought . the realities of war home to a new generation and created ‘people who . are aged 18-and-a-half who are veterans of recent conflicts’. ‘Once again the British public has . shown its support,’ she said, adding that the number of veterans . marching had increased by 3,000 in the last five years. ‘The numbers are going up, not down. There are an increasing number of associations looking after the veteran . community. More and more people want to participate in the activities.’ The Prince of Wales and Duchess of . Cornwall earlier attended a ceremony in Auckland as part of their . Jubilee tour of New Zealand. Under grey skies the royals sat with .

In Northern Ireland, the prime . minister of the Republic of Ireland Taoiseach Enda Kenny attended the . remembrance service in Enniskillen. The symbolic visit came as the Co . Fermanagh town marked the 25th anniversary of the IRA Poppy Day bomb . attack, which claimed the lives of 12 people. Mr Kenny laid a laurel wreath at the cenotaph, only yards from where the no-warning blast detonated a quarter of a century ago. Veterans' representatives laid wreaths . at the Cenotaph before almost 10,000 ex-servicemen and women marched . past to commemorate their fallen comrades. This year's Remembrance commemoration . is the first to take place since the death of the last veteran to serve . during the First World War on either side, according to the Royal . British Legion. There was warm applause from the crowd as the parade marched past the giant war memorial, inscribed to The Glorious Dead. In Scotland, First Minister Alex . Salmond joined the Lord Lieutenant and Lord Provost of Edinburgh Donald .

"A 93-year-old man hid a human leg bone found by his dog for fear he would be accused of murder before eventually letting his daughter call the authorities. Bill Flowers, of Nisqually, Washington, panicked last week when his dog bit off more than he could chew. The black pit bull mix named Liberty trotted home last Tuesday with a leg bone attached to a foot. ‘I was afraid they'd blame me for it,' the World War II vet told KIRO. I didn't do it: Bill Flowers, 93, was afraid he'd be blamed for the person's death, so he hid the bone . The elderly man first took the gruesome find from his dog and placed on top of a woodpile for two days before taking it out back and burying it, he explained. ‘I didn't know what to do with it,’ he told KIRO. ‘I took it and put it on top of the wood pile so the dog couldn't get it. It laid there two days and I took it and buried it.’ His daughter Cheryl soon found out and insisted he call the local sheriff. The place was soon crawling with investigators and police dogs searching for more remains. Don't fetch: This black pit bull mix named Liberty found the bone and brought it home . Hiding spot: Mr Flowers buried the bone in this hole in his back yard . Cadaver dogs tracked down a pelvis, ribcage and skull, officials told the station. The coroner is trying to determine the identity of the person found. ‘At this point it does not appear that it would be related to any of our current reported missing people or runaways,’ an official told the station, adding that the find is being treated as a homicide. Officials have no indication they plan to implicate Mr Flowers in the disappearance of the person. The investigation remains ongoing.","Bill Flowers' dog Liberty brought the gruesome find home last week .

"A west Pennsylvania grandmother has been charged with selling up to 100lbs of marijuana per year since 2009. Candace Kelly, of Butler County, Pittsburgh, was originally charged for the crime last fall after authorities say they found 64lbs of hydroponically grown marijuana and nearly $400,000 in cash at her home. The October charges against 64-year-old were dropped as a result of search-and-seizure and probable cause issues. In the weeds: Grandmother Candace Kelly, of Butler County, Pittsburgh, has been charged with dealing up to 100lbs of marijuana per year since 2009 . State police believe Kelly has been buying large quantities of marijuana from a northern California man at $3,300 per pound, then reselling it at a profit of $100 per pound. The issues with the search-and-seizure related to the previous charges, included accusations from her family that the police had entered Kelly’s home without a warrant, threatened to Taser a 17-year-old and had held the electric shock device against a 15-year-old’s head. It was in October last year that police entered the Buffalo Township home of Mrs Kelly, where they claim they found the marijuana and the cash. According to her husband Roger, the officers said they were with the drug interdiction task force, but did not produce any identification before forcing their way into their home while he had to stay at his daughter's house.

I said, “What are you going to do? I’m 17 years old, you going to tase me?” ‘He said, “I will tase you like you’re 18 years old”.’ Tuesday's arrest includes charges based on the same allegations, but which are now backed up by a state grand jury report.

"A Dutch teen had an epic meltdown after a bomb threat to American Airlines that she claims was a joke was referred to authorities. Twitter user @QueenDemetriax_ begged for forgiveness and to be left alone after sending the threatening tweet Sunday morning and within minutes receiving a reply from the airline saying her IP address had been forwarded to the FBI. She then pleaded with people to stop harassing her while gaining tens of thousands of followers and claiming she ‘blocked the FBI just in case.’ Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat . Infamy: The girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous, but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame . ‘Hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan,’ Sarah wrote Sunday. ‘I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.’ The airline’s reply was brief and to the point. ‘Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.’ The girl then pleaded with the airline, saying she’s only 14-years-old and from the Netherlands, that she’s never been to Afghanistan. ‘What do you want from me?’ She pleaded. It was to no avail, the airline did not reply. It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply . Worried: The girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus, anything to avoid being in trouble . Massive following: Her followers shot up over 30,000 by Sunday night . ‘I’m so sorry I’m scared now.’ she wrote. ‘I was joking and it was my friend not me, take her IP address not mine.’ The airline did not reply, but Twitter users did. Her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by Sunday night. She took note of the gain in followers. ‘I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous,’ she tweeted. Humility: The girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one . Problem solved: Tweet deleted and FBI 'blocked' Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made. ‘We took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic,’ spokeswoman Dori Alvarez told the New York Daily News. ‘We took it down so we could better focus on our customers.’ Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the New York Post, but tweeted that ‘only law enforcement can request private information about Twitter accounts.’ Sarah expressed remorse for the stunt, wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘I changed my name to Ibrahim.’","The girl instantly gained 30,000 followers and became the talk of Twitter Sunday morning after the joke started trending .

"Harvard might be known internationally for its academic prowess, but it is gaining attention for advocating a healthy approach to women’s bodies too. A photo project, called 'Rugged Grace’ done by the Harvard Women's Rugby team exploring what sport and community mean for their bodies and identities has become an online hit. Featuring members of the team dressed in simple grey shorts and sports bras, they write on their own bodies, and those of their teammates, the things that they admire or appreciate. The inspiring project sees the women with words like 'powerful' and 'big heart' written across their bodies . The team wrote what they loved and appreciated about each player on their body . The project also show the comradary and sisterhood that exist within the team . The group say that rugby 'necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful' The team say that their sport helps their positive body image. 'Rugby is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training' The Harvard team pride themselves in the strength and power of their bodies on the pitch . The uplifting photos see the girls covered in affirming words like ‘strong’, ‘open heart’, ‘powerful, ‘ripped’ and ‘battle scars.’ They also show the comradary and sisterhood that exist within the team, with shots showing them laughing together, hugging and standing arm in arm. On the Rugged Grace tumbler site they explain: ‘We asked teammates to write what they loved and appreciated about each player on their body, in the hopes of opening a visual discussion about beauty, strength, and appreciation. 'We decided to have players write their favorite things about other players physically on their bodies to demonstrate the immense body positivity, encouragement of strength and utility, and the overall supportive nature of this team. ‘Rugby is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training, and that intense appreciation, love, trust, and support for each other is what we wanted to reflect. The sport necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful.’ The project ascertains that for a woman to love her body is a political statement .

Maintaining pride in having a body that is “too big,” “too small,” or “not ideal” is a political statement against the many voices that tell us our bodies are problematic. ‘Mainstream culture normalises the flawless bodies that dominate every kind of mass media, sending girls the message that only slender, tall bodies are beautiful.’","Project called 'Rugged Grace' by Harvard Women's Rugby team .

"The founder of bookshop chain Waterstones has said that traditional printed books will see off the challenge of the e-reader 'revolution'. Tim Waterstone, who started the retail chain in 1982, said that there were indications that the e-book's market share was in decline, and that printed books were 'immovable'. Speaking at an Oxford Literary Festival event on Saturday, entitled The Future Of Publishing, Mr Waterstone said he did not believe that physical books were under threat from their technological counterparts, such as Amazon's Kindle, the Apple iPad and the Kobo eReader. No threat: Tim Waterstone, the founder of the Waterstones bookshop chain, has said that traditional printed books will see off the challenge of the e-reader 'revolution' 'I think you read and hear more garbage about the strength of the . e-book revolution than anything else I’ve known,' Mr Waterstone said, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'The e-books have developed a share of the . market, of course they have, but every indication – certainly from . America – shows the share is already in decline. The indications are . that it will do exactly the same in the UK.' Mr Waterstone left the bookshop which bears his name in 2001 after merging the business with HMV in 1998. In 2012 Waterstones, which is now owned by Russian businessman Alexander Mamut and run by James Daunt, started selling Amazon's Kindle in its 300 British stores, and Kindle . users can read some books for free while connected to the Waterstones . wifi network. Devices: The Kindle Paperwhite (left) and Kobo Touch (right) are just two of the many e-readers on the market . Bookseller: The high street chain was started by Mr Waterstone in 1982, and is now run by James Daunt . Last year British readers spent £300million on 80million e-books, but £2.2billion on 323million traditionally printed books. Figures released by the Association of American publishers showed that hardcover book sales had gone up by 11.5 per cent in the 12 months leading up to last November, while the sales of adult e-books had climbed by just 4.8 per cent, indicating that while sales were growing they had levelled off. A separate study by the Pew Research Centre from January this year revealed that while 28 per cent of American readers surveyed said they had read an e-book in 2013, 69 per cent said they had read a printed book. Success: Experts at Neilsen said a drop off in e-book sales could be explained by a lack of a publishing success story such as E.L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey . Fall: There was also a comparative fall in sales of children's titles such as The Hunger Games, which was made into a hit film series starring Jennifer Lawrence . Just four per cent of those questioned said they were e-book only. A UK study by Neilsen BookData showed e-book sales fell by 26 per cent in four weeks to June 9,  2013, compared with the corresponding period in 2012. Experts at Neilsen said the drop off could be explained by a lack of a publishing success story such as E.L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey in 2012, and a comparative fall in sales of children’s titles, such as the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, and non-fiction. Mr Waterstone told the audience in Oxford that print on paper had lasted for centuries and he was sure the traditional book would last long into the future. He said: 'The product is so strong, the interest . in reading is so deeply rooted in the culture and human soul of this . country that it is immovable.'","Tim Waterstone said he did not believe printed books were under threat .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Rodgers describe Sturridge as one of  best strikers in Europe . Daniel Sturridge - dressed from head to toe in all black - takes a walk in the countryside . However, the 25-year-old was out and about this week and posted a picture of himself dressed from head to toe in black - just before Halloween. Sturridge is desperate to return to action as soon as possible and said: 'On the road to recovery. Can't wait to be back playing. Long walk in the countryside.' Liverpool have struggled without the striker, whose injury was a massive blow after the departure of Luis Suarez. Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have both struggled and Rodgers admits Liverpool need to find a way to win without Suarez and Sturridge. Sturridge has been sidelined since getting crocked on international duty in September . He said: 'Anyone will recognise that if you take out of our team the goal threat that we had last year, then you're removing a huge percentage of that efficiency. 'But for us it's about finding a different way to get the same result, which is to win games. It's not been as fluent or as effective, but we're working hard to master that.'

"Turning up the central heating may cost a few pounds, but it could keep off the kilos. A new study out on Tuesday shows that people who live in warm homes are less likely to be fat and tend to have lower body mass index (BMI) levels than those who shiver through winter. Researchers at the University of Stirling in Scotland have uncovered a direct link between higher temperatures and lower levels of body fat in a 13-year study involving more than 100,000 adults who rely on central heating. A study of 100,000 by the University of Stirling has found that turning on the central heating during winter could help you keep your weight down . They claim It is not just what we eat and how much exercise we do that determines how heavy we are - the temperature at which people heat their homes could have a major impact on whether they can keep to their ideal body weight, the study suggests. In recent years scientists have suggested that warmer indoor temperatures have been a major contributing factor to rises in obesity levels in the US, Canada, UK and Europe. However, researchers from Stirling Management School's Behavioural Science Centre show that the opposite appears to be the case - there is a direct link between higher temperatures and lower levels of body fat. The study used BMI levels to indicate levels of body fat and noted those who live in well-heated homes are more likely to have low BMI levels, while people who spend less time with their heating turned up - or on at all - tend to be heavier. While previous studies suggested that warm homes might help cause rising obesity levels, this shows the opposite . Study co-author Dr Michael Daly, a behavioural scientist, said: 'We set out to investigate the scientific claims that cooler indoor temperatures help us maintain a healthy weight by pushing our bodies to expend more energy through shivering and generating heat through tissues. 'In fact, the research suggests people may eat less and burn more energy when residing in a warmer indoor environment.' The study takes into account factors such as excessive calorie intake and low levels of physical activity, but it is the first to examine the association between indoor household temperature and population BMI levels. Dr Daly said: 'We contrasted BMI levels for people living in different temperature groups in England and found reduced weight levels among people living in homes heated to above 73.4 degrees Fahrenheit (23 degrees Celsius), which was reflective of about 15,000 of the households studied. 'This research suggests the obesity epidemic could worsen where heating is turned down below comfortable levels, or off, for lengthy periods to cut costs. 'This is not just about people who live in well-heated homes being in the financial position to afford more expensive low-calorie foods, exercise classes and sporting activities and therefore finding it easier to maintain a low BMI level. The study took age, gender, social class and other factors into account. 'The comfortable ambient temperature of 68.5-73.4 degrees Fahrenheit (20.3-23 degrees Celsius) is where we feel comfortable in our clothes and are neither hot, nor cold. At temperatures above this we expend more energy and we eat less because our appetite is suppressed.' The study is published in the international science journal Obesity.","University of Stirling studied 100,000 people over 13 years .

"A new prototype Kindle will offer a built-in reading light . Amazon's new Kindle will offer an all-new technology - a built-in reading light. A prototype device is already working, and has been seen by a source close to Amazon. The device will go on sale in July, and will feature the same black-and-white E Ink display as Amazon's other Kindle readers. So far, Kindle users have had to buy an external light to attach to the device to read in the dark. The front light eliminates that problem - although it may dent one of the Kindle's most appealing features, its ultra-long battery life. The world's largest Internet retailer is aiming to have the new e-reader in stores in July, said the source, who has direct knowledge of the matter but asked not to be named because Amazon has not yet made the decision public. Amazon has been ramping up production of the new Kindle, which will run on E Ink's display, the source said. Amazon's Kindle e-reader has been popular, but readers . ‘I do see demand for a front-lit Kindle,’ said Jennifer Colegrove, Vice President of Emerging Display Technologies at DisplaySearch, an NPD Group company, which monitors trends in the display sector. There is a trade-off, she said: ‘Front-lit will consume battery power and (it'll) run out ... quicker.’ Amazon also plans to launch a new tablet closer to the holiday season later this year, the source said. The new Kindle Fire is expected to have a bigger diagonal display of 8.9 inches, bringing it closer in size to Apple Inc's iPad. The company did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment. The new Kindle Fire is expected to have a bigger diagonal display of 8.9 inches, bringing it closer in size to Apple Inc's iPad. The company did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment . ‘We don't comment on our customers' launch plans,’ said Sri Peruvemba, Chief Marketing Officer for E Ink Holdings, the supplier of Kindle's ePaper technology. ‘E Ink is an innovator and for the past 10 years, we have consistently delivered new products, major enhancements to existing products, and unique designs, so it is not surprising that there is constant speculation about what we will do next,’ said Peruvemba. While Barnes & Noble was the first to market with a glowing e-reader, there has been speculation about Amazon being a close second. Amazon will launch the new Kindle e-reader in the touch 3G and touch wi-fi versions, the source said. ‘They can afford to add a front light because the component is not very expensive and their display otherwise uses very little energy,’ said Colegrove. An increase of about $10 above the current prices should be ‘quite reasonable,’ she said. The source said Amazon was likely to keep prices the same, or raise them by a very small margin, if at all. Some blogs had speculated on the possibility of a color-equipped e-reader, but the source said that there was very little chance of Amazon launching one this year. Though Amazon has held can talks with E Ink, the companies haven't reached any concrete decisions yet, he said. Vinita Jakhanwal, an analyst at IHS iSuppli, which tracks electronic component supply chains, said when she looked at the color e-paper product in a trade show in October, that it needed ‘a lot of technological improvements’ to be used in a products in large volumes. ‘I doubt if the color Kindle is ready for a launch,’ she said.","Black-and-white E-reader will have built-in light .

"Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in Munich as experts today tried to defuse a 550lb Allied bomb dropped on the city during WW2. The undetonated explosive was found beneath ground at the site of the former Schwabinger 7 nightclub, a hangout of the Rolling Stones in the 1970s. Bomb disposal teams fear its complex chemical fuse could trigger a repeat of the 2010 tragedy when three experts were killed in a blast in another German city. Scroll down for video . Deadly: Bomb disposal expert Diethard Posorski next to the 550lb bomb discovered in Munich . Close up: The bomb, which was dropped by either American and British planes in either 1944 or 1945 . Team leader Diethard Posorski said: 'That is a chemical delayed-action detonator. I am not defusing that - I’m not suicidal.' So, rather than defusing the bomb, experts plan to surround it with sand and carry out a controlled explosion as the site. 2.8million tons Weight of all U.S. and British bombs dropped on Germany (54% USAAF) 75,000 tons Weight of Luftwaffe bombs dropped on Britain . 543,000 Germans lost their lives in WWII air raids . 60,000 Britons killed by German bombs . 390,000 Sorties flown by RAF bombers . 2,500 unexploded bombs yet to be found in Munich, according to experts . 5% The proportion of bombs that failed to detonate . A large timber shell was today built around the bomb, which is believed to have been dropped in 1944 or 1945 by either British or American forces. The controlled explosion is likely to take place tomorrow morning. Only then will the 2,500 people living within a 1,000-yard radius of the site in the Schwabing area close to the city centre. A nearby subway station has also been closed as well as parts of Leopoldstrasse, one of Munich’s busiest streets. It is unknown whether American or British planes dropped the bomb, which was discovered as diggers tore a building down. Both countries used the same type of 550lb explosives and rust is understood to have obscured any identifying marks. During the war Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Force are estimated to have dropped around 50,000 bombs on Munich. City officials believe that 2,500 unexploded payloads – around 5 per cent of the total dropped - are still buried in the Bavarian capital. Precaution: The bomb, which cannopt be defused, is covered with sand bags ahead of a planned controlled blast . Cordon: A German police officer guards a section of Leopoldstrasse, which has been sealed off along with a a 1,000-yard radius area. A total of 2,500 people have been evacuated . And they pose a huge problem in all of Germany, where barely a week goes by without a new discovery. It is unusual, however, to find a bomb in such a densely populated areas as most undetonated explosives tend to be uncovered outside big urban zones. Allies dropped of 2.8million tons during WWII, massively eclipsing the 75,000  tons unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain. By the war’s end, the USAAF had dropped 1.5million tons of bombs on the country and the RAF 1.3million tons. British bombers alone flew a total of 390,000 sorties. Locked out: Evacutated people in an aid station in Munich, where they will have to stay until Wednesday . Round-up: German police officers evacuating apartment buildings after the bomb was found . Sealed off: Recovery vehicles parked on Leopoldstrasse, which has been blocked to traffic . As a result, few towns escaped extensive damage from air raids and, by 1945, 543,000 civilians had been killed by the allied assault, compared with 60,000 in Britain. The worst air raid occurred in Dresden when, over two days, at least 30,000 civilians were killed in attacks by the RAF and the USAAF. Last week a similar 550lb bomb was found in Nuremberg and experts fear that the dud payloads are becoming more dangerous due to ‘material fatigue’. Already 67 years have passed since Germany’s defeat and over time the safety elements in the trigger mechanisms are increasingly wearing away. It means that some bombs could explode before being discovered and others will be more difficult to defuse. In the most deadly incident in recent years, three bomb disposal experts were blown to bits in June 2010 as they attempted to defuse an American bomb in the northern university city of Göttingen.

"Villagers in Thailand held a Google Street View worker after suspecting he was a government spy. About 20 residents in the remote Sa-eab village in Phrae province blocked the marked Google car on Tuesday after becoming convinced the worker was surveying for an unwanted dam project. The Google worker, named as Deeprom Phongphon, was only believed after swearing in a Buddhist temple that he did not work for the government. The Google Street View worker was surrounded by villagers as he drove through Sa-eab, in Phrae Provine. Above, the street car in action in the UK . The car aroused suspicion as it toured the streets of the rural village with its large camera attached to the roof. The Manager newspaper reported that the . villagers took the vehicle's driver to a local office to quiz him, then . to a temple where they made him swear on a statue of Buddha that he was . not working for the dam project. Residents said he would face bad luck within a week if he lied in front of the statue. 'The villagers were definitely not happy. The car looked very strange . and had something on the top - there was also all kinds of equipment . inside the car,' Wichai Ruksapon, 64, told AFP. Google's regional communications manager Taj Meadows said yesterday that the company was aware of the incident. The Prachatai news website said the villagers released the driver and later apologized to him and to Google. Sa-eab village, 385 miles north of Bangkok, is known for its long-running dam protests by villagers and environmental groups. '(We) apologize to the official, to Google, as well as to the Thai people throughout the nation and to the citizens of the world,' the villagers' representatives wrote. The Google worker was only let go when he swore in front of a statue of Buddha at a local temple . They explained that they were 'extremely . worried and there had been so many repeated cases that convinced the . villagers to believe someone was trying to survey the area in disguise.' Google Street View has run into problems in some other countries where there are concerns it captures too much information that should be private. The project's technology also scoops up Wi-Fi radio signals, and Britain's data regulator in June ordered the company to delete personal data it gathered that way, or face a contempt of court action. 'Embarking on new projects, we sometimes encounter unexpected challenges, and Street View has been no exception,' Google's Meadows said in an email, adding that 'Street View abides by Thailand's local laws, and only features imagery taken on public property.' The internet giant project takes photographs to accompany its Google Earth map program. In 2011, the Tourism Authority of Thailand partnered with Google Thailand to launch a tourism promotion initiative involving images of streets and top attractions in the country's major cities. Thailand was the world's 35th country to have Street View imagery available.","Google car aroused suspicion as it drove through Sa-eab village .

"UEFA could face serious questioning after a number of CSKA Moscow fans appeared inside the Arena Khimki during their Champions League clash against Manchester City. UEFA had banned the sale of tickets and ordered the Group E match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans. But at least 200 supporters were seen in front of the press box during Tuesday evening's match. UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans . But more than 200 CSKA supporters managed to get in to the ground and sat in front of the press box . Official crowd - 0 . Club delegates - 75 per club . Centre circle boys and parents - 50 . Media - 150 . UEFA partners (sponsors) - 300 . The fans were spotted drinking alcohol and chanting during the game which saw City draw 2-2 after Seydou Doumbia's close-range finish and Natcho's late penalty cancelled out first-half goals from Sergio Aguero and James Milner. It is claimed that the fans could have obtained the match tickets through sponsors who had been allocated tickets for the game. Manchester City fans were not allocated tickets for the game under the UEFA punishment. The Etihad club have not indicated whether they will complain over the apparent breach of rules. City threw away a two-goal lead as Seydou Doumbia and Natcho scored in the second half for the hosts . Natcho's late penalty made it 2-2 after City had looked comfortable after going two goals ahead in Moscow . James Milner scored City's second, sliding home to meat a cross from their first goalscorer Sergio Aguero . CSKA media director Sergey Aksenov insisted the club had nothing to do with the fans who entered. He said: 'Those people you are talking about are 360 people from the UEFA Champions Club - partners, sponsors. If they are CSKA fans, they are good for us. Everyone is invited by UEFA, not CSKA.' In a strange post-match press conference, CSKA coach Leonid Slutsky was also asked about the situation - but the question drew laughter from Russian journalists. 'I don't know,' he said, to applause. Captain Vincent Kompany was not so worried to speak his mind and criticised organisers for not allowing City supporters into the stadium, saying that they were being punished for the actions of others. 'It's supposed to be a game without fans but yet there are still 500 fans cheering on for them, which is not a problem, but I don't understand where our fans are,' he told Sky Sports News. 'Why can we not bring our fans? Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was not afraid to criticise that CSKA fans were allowed in to watch . Kompany said his team were at a disadvantage because they had no fans cheering them on in Russia . 'I feel like the only team being punished today was Man City. 'Probably pundits and the people writing the column will say well, you know, we should be looking at what our team did, so we'll do that and we'll improve, but (there are) little things where I think sometimes we need to speak up. I mean, it's nonsense. 'They're the team that got done for racism, not Man City. Why can't our fans come? 'It doesn't affect us, but fair is fair and maybe now is the time to say it and now is the time to speak up.' City's visit to the Khimki Arena in the same competition last year was also overshadowed by controversy as midfielder Yaya Toure was racially abused by CSKA fans. That was the first of three offences in the space of a year which culminated in the current three-match stadium closure. In this latest clash, CSKA claimed a draw after being awarded a controversial penalty four minutes from time. Despite Milner and Aguero's efforts, the game ended 2-2 meaning City have failed to win in Europe this season . In was suggested to City boss Manuel Pellegrini that the presence of supporters may have encouraged the hosts or even influenced the referee's decision. Pellegrini said: 'Well I agree but maybe it is not my duty to talk about things that do not correspond to my duty. 'I think UEFA has its rules. This stadium was closed doors to everyone. 'I don't know who has permission to give entrance to all those peoples, but really it is not my duty. I don't want to talk about the referee or other things. I don't want to be punished again.'","At least 200 CSKA Moscow supporters were sat in front of the press box .

"A coachload of schoolchildren was taken 80 miles in the wrong direction in the middle of the night after a driver misspelt their destination by just one letter. The driver accidentally typed Towyn into his satellite navigation system, then promptly drove to the village near the seaside resort of Rhyl in north Wales. Unfortunately, his sleepy passengers had hoped to wake up in Tywyn, near Cardigan Bay in west Wales. The Llew Jones International coach, like the one pictured above, was returning from Paris . The blunder occurred when the coach swapped drivers at Shrewsbury towards the end of a 13-hour journey following a trip to Paris. Parents of the 37 pupils aged 11 to 14, from Ysgol Uwchradd Tywyn, were left waiting to collect their children for an extra two hours on Tuesday morning. Sue Williams, whose daughter Sian was on the coach, said: ‘The teachers and the kids all fell asleep on the bus and when they woke up they realised they were going a different way to what they normally know.’ The teachers and children were taken to Towyn in north Wales instead of Tywyn which is 77 miles away . Mrs Williams added: ‘They ended up in Towyn, and then took an extra hour and a half to get back home, to the correct town. ‘I'm not happy at all by what happened, especially because Sian suffers from travel sickness and so do a few other kids.’ The driver took the pupils and teachers to Towyn, Conwy, before delivering them to Tywyn, Gwynedd, above . Cllr . Louise Hughes, whose daughter was also on the trip with 36 other . pupils, said: ‘I was very annoyed by what happened. I am glad they all . got back safely. ‘Delivery drivers make the same mistake and people ring, saying, “We can’t find you, we’re in Towyn”.

"Airline food isn't known for being tasty, and new research shows it shouldn't be known for being healthy either. A recent survey of 12 American airlines by DietDetective.com found that low-cost airline Allegiant Air has the least healthy inflight snacks and meals, with a rating of 1.5 out of five.

"PATH OF BLOOD by Thomas Small and Jonathan Hacker (Simon & Schuster £18. 99) Scroll down for video . There is no more important subject in the world at this moment. I do not know a single person who is not appalled and frightened in equal measure by the spread of Islamic fanaticism, especially the seemingly unstoppable rise of the ragbag gang of murderers known as Islamic State (IS). In addition it makes most of us rage as well as weep that young people who have known all the advantages of living in Britain (and make no mistake, there are many, no matter how much victimhood-type whinging goes on) should head off to a pitiless desert in the hope of building a so-called ‘Caliphate’. Oh, and of course, being permitted to have sex with those 72 legendary virgins in paradise — once glorious martyrdom is achieved through murdering ‘kuffars’. Which means us. Zak Ebrahim (his adopted name) and his father El Sayyid Nosair, who shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defence League in New York . On one level it is pathetic, absurd. On another, truly repulsive. We may loathe and fear this mind-set, yet we must still seek to be informed about it. (I hesitate to use the word, ‘understand’ since that seems a step too far.) You have to know the enemy in order to wage war –— and is there any doubt that this is war? That’s why these two timely books are — each in a different way — essential reading. One is a short account of how the son of a terrorist has eschewed his father and now devotes his life to preaching an alternative message. The other provides a lucid and vividly written background that reveals much about the Islamic terrorist mind-set. When Zak Ebrahim (his adopted name) was just seven, his father, El Sayyid Nosair, shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defence League in New York. Nosair began to ‘pore endlessly over the Qur’an’ and attended ‘mysterious meetings’ and became withdrawn from his family . On November 5, 1990 the little boy in Mutant Ninja Turtle pyjamas experienced the end of his childhood. His father ‘was the first known Islamic jihadist to take life on American soil’, and worked with the support of a terror cell overseas that would ultimately call itself Al Qaeda. Ebrahim’s mother was a Catholic American who lost her faith, found Islam — and very quickly married an Egyptian immigrant to whom she had spoken about two words. The couple were ‘happy for a time’, and even though he has repudiated his father, Ebrahim does have some joyful memories of time with him. They were few. For Nosair began to ‘pore endlessly over the Qur’an’ and attended ‘mysterious meetings’ and became withdrawn from his family. This pattern is one we have read about again and again, when Muslims are ‘radicalised’. After Nosair’s incarceration, Ebrahim’s family moved more than 20 times, and the children were bullied mercilessly at school for their father’s notoriety. But life was to become far worse. Ebrahim’s mother had always believed in her husband’s innocence — until after the explosion in the underground car park of the World Trade Centre in 1993, which killed six innocent people, including a pregnant woman. It emerged that Nosair was one of those who had organised this, from his prison cell. Astounded and repelled, his hitherto gullible wife sought a divorce. After a deeply unhappy adolescence, Zak found a job at a theme park in Florida where the racial and religious diversity of the visitors opened his eyes to a world of tolerance. ‘From the moment I put on my Rhino Rally safari suit, I meet tourists and co-workers of every description, which is so liberating that I can hardly put the feeling into words,’ he writes. In one of his infamous video messages, Osama Bin Laden urged his followers to ‘Remember El Sayyid Nosair’. Nosair’s adult son has done just that, but not in the way that brainwashed jihadis would like. His choice has been to turn his back on the extremism that might have been his legacy and argue against it in public. He explains that ‘. . .turning someone into a bigot is the first step in turning him into a terrorist. You find someone vulnerable — someone who’s lost his confidence, his income, his pride, his agency. Someone who feels humiliated by life. You fill him with fear and fury, and you see to it that he regards anybody who’s different as a faceless target . . .’ A Children of Al Qaeda extremist totes a gun . Now, Zak Ebrahim acts as a brave and inspiring ambassador for reason, tolerance and choice. You only wish he could visit every school in Muslim-dominated areas of this country and ‘offer myself up as proof that it is possible to shut one’s ears to hatred and violence and simply choose peace’. Of Nosair he says simply: ‘He chose terrorism over fatherhood . . . My father chose terrorism over me.’ Another important book in today’s climate is Path Of Blood, subtitled, The Story Of Al Qaeda’s War On The House Of Saud. In taking us back to Bin Laden’s aim to conquer his home country, Saudi Arabia, it throws invaluable light on the current situation in Iraq and Syria. The schisms and divisions within Islam can be confusing for the general reader, but with its glossary and ‘cast-list’, Path Of Blood serves to clarify history in the making. C urrently there are 10,000 foreign fighters in Syria, many affiliated with Al Qaeda — which, do not forget, denounced the extremism of IS. But like IS, Al Qaeda was able to lure impressionable young men by a mixture of religious rhetoric and a promise of fleshpots in heaven. The authors tell a vivid story of how a campaign of kidnappings, shootings and bombings was launched across Saudi Arabia and how the royal family fought back. The book is a salutary reminder of how pitifully undisciplined, fragmented and lacking in intelligence and expertise the terrorists were — yet at the same time how ruthless and dangerous. For example, a skilled bomb-maker had no compunction about turning his pitiful special–needs brother into a suicide bomber in an attempt to assassinate Prince Muhammad of the Saudi royal family. Next year a film with the same title will be released, drawing on extensive research, interviews and video footage captured from Al Qaeda safe houses — all material which is in this book. Most important, for me, was the insight gained into the workings of Saudi society, and the realisation that the country’s on-going role in ‘the war on terror’ has not been fully understood. Whatever we may think of their authoritarian, conservative and patriarchal customs, we need the House of Saud on our side.","El Sayyid Nosair shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defence League in New York .

These days property developers Michael and Carol Ann Gatt are effectively penniless. The couple lost their business, their home and almost everything they owned because of what they say was a simple banking error. They are suing Barclays for more than £3million for bringing them to ‘complete ruination’. Millionaire property developers Michael and Carol Gatt, who are suing Barclays for £3m after claiming a banking mistake resulted in them losing their business and country home . The Gatts, both 65, claim the bank wrongly told credit reference agencies that Mr Gatt was over his agreed overdraft limit, ruining their credit rating and killing their business. GLN Holdings Ltd, the Tunbridge Wells-based development company they ran for 22 years, subsequently collapsed. The couple, who have been married for 44 years, were forced to sell their home, Melksham Court, at a loss. Much of their furniture was sold off as well as their fleet of luxury cars.  They had to move into a bungalow owned by their son on the boundary of the Melksham Court estate in Stinchcombe, near Dursley, a stone’s throw from their former home. Mrs Gatt burst into tears at the High Court as she accused the bank and its ‘premier relationship manager’, Mark Williams – who deny any wrongdoing – of ‘incorrect and disgraceful actions’. She said she and her husband shared ownership of their home and assets as they ‘now share the devastation caused by the actions of Barclays Plc and Mr Williams’. Mrs Gatt told the court that in 2007 Barclays had provided credit reports to reference agencies stating the Gatts were £260,000 overdrawn on a limit of £1,500. But the bank had agreed to let them have the money, she told Judge Patrick Moloney QC, and so was guilty of ‘negligent misstatement’ and ‘defamation’. The Gatts were forced to give up their £4million country house at Melksham Court in the Cotswolds, pictured, and now live in a small property nearby . Mr Gatt told the court he had a good relationship with Barclays for many years. He had often asked for more money on his overdrafts, living off borrowings as it was cheaper than taking profit out of the business. ‘They kept lending money and lending money, with no moans about it,’ he told the court. ‘I’m an entrepreneur and property developer, not a bank clerk.’ Mrs Gatt said they would have taken steps to rectify it if they had been told they were over the overdraft limit. Rupert Allen, representing the bank and Mr Williams, said Mr Gatt was using a temporary overdraft. When the time limit ran out and it was not paid off, it became unauthorised, he said. The hearing continues.","Michael and Carol Gatt lived in £4m estate once coveted by Hugh Grant .

"VICTORIA: A LIFE by A. N. Wilson (Atlantic Press, £25) Queen Victoria in her wedding dress . As A.N. Wilson notes in his new biography of Queen Victoria: ‘Some human beings change and develop, and that is their strength. For others, strength consists in their incapacity for change.’ Victoria’s character, he argues, remained fixed in its essential qualities throughout her long life. He believes that the key to her capricious and fascinating nature, which imposed itself so powerfully on the era that bears her name, can be found in her childhood. The infant Victoria was the product of an unseemly scramble by the sons of George III to produce a legitimate heir to the throne, and it was the Duke of Kent who hit the jackpot when he hastily married a German princess, Victoire. Having sired a daughter, the Duke expired from a chill in January 1820, leaving his widow and nine-month-old child to the mercy of the English court where they felt like —indeed, were — foreign poor relations. Victoria firmly believed her childhood was miserable. In 1858 she wrote, ‘I . . . led a very unhappy life as a child — had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection — had no brothers and sisters to live with — never had a father — from my unfortunate circumstances was not on comfortable or at all intimate or confidential footing with my mother — much as I love her now — and did not know what a happy domestic life was.’ This, her biographer crisply points out, is largely nonsense. She had an older half-brother and sister, Prince Charles and Princess Feodore, of whom she was deeply fond, and her mother’s devotion is touchingly evident in a flurry of loving notes on pink paper written to Victoria throughout her childhood. ‘Believe me, my most beloved child, that nobody in this world can love you better than, your true and affectionate Mother’, she wrote on New Year’s Eve 1828. But as Wilson points out, there are two kinds of unhappy childhood: in one, the child has genuinely suffered. In the other, childhood is an unhappy memory. The monarch became bitter in her older age and was prone to tantrums . Victoria’s ‘almost unbounded capacity for self-dramatisation and self-pity’, he argues, left her with a strong, unfounded conviction of her wretched early years which led her throughout her life to exhibit the furious egotism of a small child. ‘It was for this reason,’ he writes, ‘that her best friends were servants, or those prepared . . . to behave as if they were servants.’ In old age, her fervent relationships with her bluff Scottish servant, John Brown, and later to Abdul Karim, known as the Munshi, who taught her to say ‘You will miss the Munshi very much’ and ‘Hold me tight’ in Hindustani, would be the cause of scandal and horror among her entourage. But from the earliest days of her reign, her obstinate wilfulness would repeatedly have grave consequences for the image of the monarchy. On her Coronation day, June 28 1838, the 18-year-old Queen wrote in her diary of her awe at seeing ‘the millions of my loyal subjects who were assembled in every spot to witness the Procession . . . How proud I felt to be the Queen of such a Nation.’ But just two years later she had contrived to make the monarchy a hated institution. Her behaviour in the Bedchamber Affair, when she refused to smooth the sensibilities of a new Tory administration by appointing a Tory Lady of the Bedchamber, convinced the political world that she was a capricious incompetent. Worse still was her spiteful treatment of her old childhood acquaintance, Lady Flora Hastings. When the unmarried Lady Flora’s waistline began expanding and rumour suggested that she was pregnant, the Queen insisted that she be examined by the royal doctor, Sir James Clark. The poor woman was a virgin, suffering from a malignant abdominal tumour which killed her in 1839. The public scandal was appalling, but Victoria refused to take it seriously, airily doubting whether the affair was ‘really making such a sensation as people said it did’. If her public behaviour was outrageous, she was scarcely better in private. Her marriage to Prince Albert was notoriously one of intense attraction and sexual fulfilment, and it produced nine children — all of whom, remarkably, survived, though the youngest, Prince Leopold, suffered from the haemophilia that would become the scourge of the courts of Europe as Victoria’s descendants married into them. Queen Victoria on the arm of her Indian servant Abdul Karim with whom she had a fervent relationship . But Victoria was not a doting mother. Some of her children — notably her first-born son, Bertie, the future Edward VII — she frankly disliked, and soon after the marriage of her eldest daughter, Vicky, she wrote: ‘I cannot tell you how happy I am that you are not in an unenviable position [pregnant]. Though I quite admit the comfort and blessing good and amiable children are — they are also an awful plague and anxiety for which they show one so little gratitude very often! What made me so miserable was to have the first two years of my married life utterly spoilt by this occupation!’ Even the adored Albert was not immune from her frightful tantrums. In 1857 he wrote her a pained note: ‘I don’t yet know why my question . . . “What makes you so bitter?” produced such an outburst . . . I am trying to keep out of your way until . . . you have regained control of yourself .’ Victoria’s mourning after Albert’s untimely death in December 1861 (for which she partly blamed the hapless Bertie) plunged her still deeper into self-absorption, from which she was rescued by her passion for one of the Balmoral ghillies — John Brown. ‘[He] is devoted to me,’ wrote the Queen. ‘So simple, so intelligent, so unlike an ordinary servant’. The Queen's stubborn nature was her defining characteristic . Indeed he was not. Prone to bawling the Queen’s orders in his broad Scots accent, he was fond of whisky, and the Queen developed a taste for a deadly concoction of claret mixed with whisky. So extravagant was her mourning when Brown died in 1883 that rumour circulated that they had been married. Wilson finds striking evidence in the testimony of a retired clergyman that this may have been the case, and concludes that their 20-year relationship was certainly a ‘marriage’ in emotional terms — though he doesn’t commit himself on the question of whether it was formally solemnised or consummated. Wilson is affectionately alert to the rich contradictions of his subject’s personality, and his deliciously readable biography becomes increasingly fascinating as Victoria’s reign unfolds. The brilliance of his writing is especially striking in the final pages, when he lists the extraordinary quantity of stuff Victoria wanted to be buried with: an entire jumble-sale of mementoes, including Brown’s handkerchief and his mum’s wedding ring. ‘Parents who put a certain type of imaginative child to bed find they are unable to do so without adding . . . so many things crammed into the bedding that it is hard to know where the child will find to sleep,’ Wilson writes. It is an extraordinary perception: the unspeakably grand octogenarian Queen-Empress, monarch for 63 years, laid to her final rest like the vulnerable small child she once was.","The infant Victoria was the product of a scramble by the sons of George III to produce a legitimate heir to the throne .

"Critical: Catrin Pugh, 19, is in hospital after her coach crashed in the French Alps . Three Britons remain critically ill in hospital tonight after the coach they were travelling on crashed and exploded in a fireball in the French Alps. Catrin Pugh, 19, is believed to have been placed in an artificial coma after the horrific accident on Tuesday afternoon. Ms Pugh was set to return to the UK after working the ski season in France and was joined by 52 other British season staff on their way home at the time of the crash. Her father was today set to arrive in France from the family's home in Wrexham to be at her bedside. A second British woman, aged 23, suffered 80 per cent burns when the vehicle ploughed into the mountainside shortly after leaving the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez. Medics in Grenoble are also treating a man but details of his injuries are unknown. A fourth person was discharged from hospital yesterday and has been repatriated to the UK. Fresh details of the crash, which claimed the life of  driver Maurice Wrightson, 64, began to emerge as survivors painted scenes of desperate panic. Matthew Beauchamp, 19, described leaping from the coach as it turned into an inferno and then being airlifted to hospital. He needed 20 stitches to his hand and 14 to his ankle. 'I'm lucky', he told The Evening Standard. 'I could have been injured a lot worse. For everyone to get out alive except for the driver is amazing. Matthew, from Downend, . Bristol, was returning from six months working in a hotel in the Alps during the ski season. 'The first ten minutes after the crash were the worst because of not knowing who was accounted for. Everyone was looking around in panic to see who got out.' His father David, 49, said: 'He told . me that the coach driver was shouting out that the brakes had failed, . giving them time to brace themselves.

'Matthew said the driver almost stood . up to make sure that everyone on the coach had heard, and that he . definitely took the decision to crash into the rock to avoid the coach . crashing through the barrier on the next hairpin bend. 'Flames immediately took hold on . impact, Matthew . was lucky that he was near the back.'. Yesterday, the relief driver and . passengers gave statements to police before boarding a . specially-chartered plane from Grenoble-Isère airport to London Gatwick. The coach crashed shortly after it departed from the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez on Tuesday afternoon. The doomed driver, Maurice Wrightson, . 64, has been praised for his 'remarkable courage' after sacrificing . himself to save his 52 passengers. Many of the survivors say he tried to . steer the vehicle, weighing 12 tonnes and towing a weight of three . tonnes, to safety after shouting that his brakes had failed. A crane hoists the frame of the bus which crashed and burned on the road from l'Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps.The driver was killed, and three people were severely injured . It has been revealed the doomed driver of the coach which crashed in the French Alps tried desperately to warn his 50 passengers there was a problem moments before the horror smash . He managed to stop the bus from . plunging into a ravine, instead crashing into the side of cliff, killing . himself as the fuel tank at the front of the bus exploded and flames . tore through the vehicle. Most of the passengers managed to escape via the right rear door. Student Fred Brickell, 18, was the . youngest passenger on the doomed coach, sitting just six seats behind the driver at the time of impact. He managed to scramble to the back as it crashed and escape through the back window. Survivor: Matthew Beauchamp, 19, injured his hand when he escaped the burning coach . His father Clive, from Ringmer, East Sussex, said: 'He would want to thank the driver who steered the bus. 'His thoughts would also be with his friends who were injured.' Mr Brickell said his son's possessions, including shoes and mobile phone, perished as the bus burnt out. Fred and other survivors were flown back to England on a chartered flight to Gatwick. Frédéric Cuvillier, minister of transport, stressed 'the remarkable courage of the driver'. He said: 'You can’t call it a miracle . because there is one dead and many wounded. But the human toll could . have been much heavier. 'The driver’s courage saved many . lives. All the testimonies of the people we have met have confirmed . this. His attitude and his actions prevented an even worse situation.” The charred remains of the bus are being examined in Vizille. There were no apparent problems with . the vehicle until the straight stretch of road before bend 21 – the last . hairpin bend of the mountain road. The investigating magistrate in Grenoble said brake failure was the main line of investigation. Jean-Yves Coquillat said: 'It's . probably a matter of braking. Now the question is why and the . investigation will be long. It will take many months. 'There will be expert and technical accidents are always complicated.' Mr Wrightson's employers at UK coach operator TGM also praised his actions. Heath Williams, managing director of TGM, said: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that one of our two drivers on board has died. 'We are offering our full support to . his family and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. He . will be sadly missed by everyone at Classic Coaches. 'A number of passengers have sustained injuries and our thoughts are with them as they recover . 'Early indications are that our driver . tried to take evasive action and that he alerted passengers. We pay . tribute to him for his efforts, and also to our relief driver who helped . people to leave the vehicle.' The accident happened in the Alpe . d'Huez ski resort - three passengers are understood to be in a serious . condition, while 17 suffered minor injuries . Burnt out: The 51 passengers are understood to be travelling back to the UK after working a ski season for  Brighton-based company Skibound which organises trips for schools . He said: 'It is too early to say what . caused the accident, however, we have launched a full investigation and . are working closely with the local authorities. Our own safety . specialist is attending the scene to support the investigation.' The accident happened at the foot of the notorious, twisting descent from the ski resort of Alpe D’Huez. The bus had left Dover on Monday with two drivers, one of whom was Mr Wrightson. They arrived in the ski resort of . Serre-Chevalier that evening. The following morning 25 passengers, . employees of British tour operator SkiBound, boarded the coach and . headed to Alpe D’Huez. A further 26 passengers boarded the . coach and Mr Wrightson, who was now the designated driver, pulled out of . Alpe D’Huez at 2pm. London, Birmingham, Manchester and, finally, Newcastle had been the intended stops.

He reportedly claimed to his boss that the tweet was 'part of a research project'. Professor Miller quickly deleted the message on Sunday after a . backlash from students and professors alike. Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at the New York school, wrote: 'Astonishing fat-shaming tweet, since deleted, from an academic, @matingmind. The mind boggles.' Miller's transgression brought into question the academic's impartiality when it came to picking students for highly competitive PhD programs. Dr Jason DeCaro, a former PhD student who is now a biological anthropologist in Alabama, tweeted: 'Dear rejected UNM psychology applicants: save now-deleted tweet for potential lawsuit. Jerk.' Miller posted a hasty apology: 'My sincere apologies to all for that idiotic, impulsive, and badly judged tweet. It does not reflect my true views, values, or standards.'

"Families should only be able to claim child benefit for their first two offspring, Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday. A . cap on the handouts would mean parents missing out on almost £700 a . year if they have a third baby, according to plans backed by the Work . and Pensions Secretary. His . approval sparked a new Coalition row with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg condemning the 'Chinese-style' state interference in parenting. Conflict: Pensions Secretary Ian Duncan Smith, right, has said families should only be able to claim for their first two offspring. Nick Clegg, left, compared proposals to a 'Chinese-style' crackdown . Discussing the two-child limit, Mr Duncan Smith declared in an interview . with the Sunday Times yesterday: ‘It’s a brilliant idea.’ The . plan, expected to slash £5 billion from the benefits bill, is being . studied as a key policy for the Conservative election manifesto in 2015. But . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday said it would penalise the . young and dismissed it as a ‘Chinese-style’ crackdown – a reference to . the single-child policy imposed by Beijing since 1979. British . parents currently get £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for . each subsequent child. But under the changes, parents who currently . claim because their annual income is less than £50,000 would lose out on . £696 a year. The reform would only apply to those who have a third baby . after the measure is introduced. A . source close to Mr Duncan Smith said he backs the idea proposed by a . member of David Cameron’s policy board – in part because it would force . parents on benefits to consider whether they could afford children, . rather than expecting taxpayers to pick up the tab. The . Work and Pensions Secretary proposed a new raft of welfare reforms last . night, with the aim of cracking down on benefits tourism, getting . people into work and cutting the welfare bill. Mr . Duncan Smith said that migrants from the EU should be banned from . claiming welfare until they have been in the UK for two years to stop . them exploiting the system. He said that allies in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland supported his idea, and could help him change EU law. The . cabinet minister, speaking to the Sunday Times, also suggested changes . for UK citizens, including the cap on child benefits, and removing . housing benefits for young people. He . said that removing housing benefit for under-25s could be 'a massive . money-saver' as it would encourage them to seek work rather than living . in state-funded accommodation. But . he also made clear that he wanted the lowest-paid to get higher wages - . perhaps by increasing the minimum wage. He said the move would help . save money currently spent on tax credits. He . said: ‘Iain has sympathised with this idea for some time. He thinks . it’s a serious money saver. And he believes that people on benefits . should have to make the same choices as other people normally do. It is . slightly infantilising unless you make people make those choices . themselves.’ Mr . Duncan Smith also supported cuts in housing benefit for the under-25s, . saying it would get young people into work first rather than putting . them into a flat paid for by welfare. ‘It . is very difficult for them to take a job because they could lose their . housing benefit and then they may lose their flat,’ he said. The . minister’s intervention is significant since it comes after Downing . Street slapped down Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, a member of Mr Cameron’s No . 10 policy board, after he revealed that the party was considering the . child benefit policy. The . minister’s approval comes after Chancellor George Osborne announced . plans to slash £12 billion from the welfare budget by 2018 as he seeks . to eliminate the budget deficit with spending cuts alone. But . Nick Clegg made clear that he wants child benefits left alone. He told . the BBC1 Andrew Marr Show: ‘I will look at all proposals but some of the . ones I have seen floated ... for instance, the idea of a two-child . policy – I am not in favour of penalising the young. ‘I . am not in favour of a sort of Chinese-style family policy saying the . state says it is OK to have two children, it is not OK to have three . children. ‘Remember this is . child benefit that goes to families, many of whom are working. They are . working very hard, often on low incomes. ‘My . priority is a fair approach to ongoing fiscal consolidation. If you . have to balance the books you mustn’t balance the books only on the . working-age poor. We are, indeed, in it all together and that’s why . everyone should make a contribution.’","Cap would mean parents would miss out on £700 if they had third child .

"TRAVELLING TO WORK by Michael Palin (Weidenfeld & Nicolson £25) Diaries are private places — places where the writer can take off whichever mask they put on to face the world and let their naked selves run around for a while. ‘I make no apology for exposing my doubts and fears,’ declares Michael Palin at the start of his third volume of diaries. Yet, for the most part, the private Michael Palin turns out to be a lot like the public one. If you’ve gone through life under the impression that he’s a fundamentally decent, cheery, ever-so-slightly bland sort of chap, then you won’t find much evidence here to the contrary. Michael Palin is publicly known as a comedian but the former Monty Python star has also enjoyed a career presenting travel documentaries . Occasionally, though, you catch a glimpse of something else, and the shock is so great that you find yourself wondering if there just might be another more complicated, less likeable Michael Palin lurking in the shadows. At the start, he’s about to embark on his first big jaunt — Around the World In 80 Days. A comparative novice as a presenter, he worries about how much contrivance is involved in trying to be himself on camera. ‘I try to be as natural as possible, and yet time and time again I have to act . . . I can act — I can act — but I can’t act me.’ Michael Palin, pictured with fellow Python Terry Jones and a cardboard cutout of Graham Chapman, whose death deeply affected Palin . By the end of the decade, he’s an acknowledged telly star, winning BBC Personality of the Year in 1998 and being presented with BBC Series of the Year — for Full Circle — by none other than Baroness Thatcher. ‘Thatcher is small, bony, her face white and waxy, her handshake cool but a little damp at the same time.’ But however successful Palin has become, an air of melancholy still creeps in around the edges. Some of the best writing here, both spare and vivid, is about death. Palin was with his great friend and fellow Python, Graham Chapman, when he died in 1989. ‘A single tear emerges from his right eye and rolls down his cheek. The mouth is set. The great ridge of Adam’s Apple is still. There is no more noise from him.’ A few days later Palin and the other Pythons attend Chapman’s funeral. At the end, after the congregation has sung Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life, he sees John Cleese sitting silently, his eyes full of tears. ‘That I shall remember for a very long time.’ Four months later, Palin’s mother dies of a stroke. ‘The little body is crouched round like the Tollund Man, but her strong face remains beautiful though sallow now and silent. I bend and kiss her and thank her for giving me life.’ What becomes increasingly clear is that like a lot of comedians Palin takes himself very seriously. He has a seemingly inexhaustible appetite for praise, solemnly quoting someone telling him that his play, The Weekend, ‘will be around in 200 years’ even though it’s just been given a terrible pasting by the critics. And while he can be fiercely self-critical, he doesn’t stint when it comes to giving himself a congratulatory hug. Referring to his series Pole To Pole, he writes: ‘It is the Sudan episode, number four, which I think will become a classic.’ There’s also a faint but unmistakable lordliness about the way he soaks up compliments. At a drinks party Palin is introduced to the novelist Ben Okri. It turns out that Okri is ‘a big enthusiast of my work, [he] recognises special qualities of naturalness and ease which he finds affecting.’ The Pythons reunited (from left to right) Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman,Terry Gilliam and John Cleese . At the same time it’s plain that Palin drives himself extremely hard. In the rare gaps between jobs, he always seems to be discussing other projects, some so strange that they sound like things Alan Partridge might have dreamed up — ‘An interesting film idea,’ he notes. ‘A proposal that I should be seen in the U.S. trying to track down Bruce Springsteen; using his songs as clues.’ Amid this furious activity, his famous niceness wears intriguingly thin in places and an altogether bitchier Palin shows through — as when he refers to Germaine Greer as looking ‘for a brief moment, like John Cleese in drag’. What’s clear, too, is how close — or closely tethered anyway — the Pythons have always remained. Scarcely a year goes by without some talk of a reunion and while it never happens, no one appears particularly resistant to the idea. Palin is particularly proud of his achievements with his television travel documentaries . The surprise, in retrospect, was how long it took. That said, there are frequent quarrels too, mainly over the running of their film company, Prominent Features. After one meeting, Palin finds himself thinking glumly that Acrimony Films might be a better name. But even when relations are strained, he’s fiercely defensive of the Pythons and doesn’t try to hide how irked he is that they’ve never received any official recognition. ‘I can only assume the Pythons are on some sort of blacklist, otherwise the group’s work would have been recognised as having as universal an effect on TV comedy as the Beatles did on music.’ The message is unmistakable: here is a man who longs to hear the words ‘Arise Sir Michael’ ringing in his ears. Meanwhile life goes on, albeit in what now seems like an absurdly sepia-tinged fashion. In December 1991, Palin tries to master the new word processor his wife has just bought him and which takes up half the room: ‘Quiet and smooth, an easy keyboard, no paper to insert, no crossing out or Tippex-ing’. It all adds up to an awkward mix. Although there are some revealing and affecting passages here, there is also a lot of flannel, as well as entries that don’t really hack it on any level — Saturday, May 6th 1996: ‘Will Carling has been sacked as England captain.’ Like Palin’s TV documentaries, his diaries slip down easily enough, but seldom touch the sides.","Palin was with his great friend and fellow Python, Graham Chapman, when he died in 1989 and write about it poignantly .

"A former TSA agent has revealed more odd rules from the world of airport security - including the time his co-worker told a passenger her goldfish was allowed on a flight, but its water could not travel. Jason Edward Harrington, writing for Politico, defended his decision to blow the whistle on TSA checkpoints earlier this year, and revealed more insider details from his time as an agent. On one occasion, Harrington said a passenger and his colleagues got into a 'heated' debated about whether or not mashed potatoes count as a liquid - concluding that they should be classified as a gel and therefore banned from travelling through security. Scroll down for video . Odd rules: Harrington said a passenger was told her goldfish was allowed on a flight, but its water could not travel. On another occasion, his colleagues got into a 'heated' row over the liquid in mashed potatoes . Overreaction: Harrington has continually sought to lay the blame for airport security frustrations at the feet of TSA bosses, not frontline staff . In his post, Harrington described the mixed response he had to his earlier revelations, with some TSA agents thanking him for criticising TSA bosses rather than frontline employees for the problems. But some felt Harrington's anecdotes about his former co-workers still read as an attempt to smear junior staff. 'They were angry that I seemed to place responsibility for the agency’s problems squarely on the shoulders of low-ranking employees, rather than focusing on upper management and underlying organizational problems,' he said. Harrington also revealed that he has been warned that intelligence agencies are likely to be monitoring him after he blew the whistle on TSA practices. 'My ex-husband is now a senior executive at the NSA at Fort Meade... The NSA will probably track you,' Harrington recalled being told. Orders from above: The former agent said that the most absurd security rules are passed down from officials at TSA headquarters to the front-line workers . Part of the process: Since 9/11 air travelers have experienced many different requests from TSA agents, and passengers are used to taking off their shoes as they approach security . In January Harrington wrote his first article for Politco - 'Dear America, I Saw You Naked'. In the piece he detailed the strange rules he'd had to enforce - including telling a now-disabled young soldier on his way home from Afghanistan that the celebratory bottle of champagne he was carrying was a risk to national security. The following month Harrington revealed more rules issued by TSA bosses in an article for Time, including making agents confiscate aluminum foil and ink cartridges, and a 2012 government memo warning that terrorists were plotting to use 'solar powered improvised explosive devices' on airplanes. Harrington has continually sought to lay the blame for airport security frustrations at the feet of TSA bosses who he says overreact to everyday items - such as banning tin foil specifically in case a passenger decides to use the serrated edge as a weapon. Problem? One TSA boss demanded that aluminum foil was taken away from passengers, fearing that the serrated edge on the box could be used as a weapon . At the start of February, U.S. security chiefs warned of a possible terror plot using explosives hidden in tubes of toothpaste during the Olympic Games and liquids were banned from carry-on luggage. The ban on liquids, gels, aerosols and powders in hand luggage applied to all non-stop flights from the U.S. to Russia, where the 2014 Winter Games was being held. Harrington has previously recalled managers who wanted to have agents fired for chewing gum - in case their attention span was reduced and their 'defences down' while chewing. In 2010, the TSA faced ridicule and anger from business passengers for banning the transport of ink and toner cartridges after a terrorist plot was thwarted in Yemen. At the time a statement from Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano was issued, reading: 'No high risk cargo will be allowed on passenger aircraft. 'Toner and ink cartridges over 16 ounces will be prohibited on passenger . aircraft in both carry-on bags and checked bags on domestic and . international flights in-bound to the United States.'

"President Putin said today military force in Crimea would be a last resort. Consequently, stock markets rebounded as did the Russian rouble . Stock markets rebounded today after president Putin said he saw no need to use military force in the Crimea and urged against economic sanctions. Vladimir Putin told a news conference that Russia's use of force in Ukraine would be the 'last resort' and that sanctions being considered against Moscow by the West would be counter-productive. Russian stocks and the rouble were up, while gold and the Japanese yen fell. European stocks rose, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 1.8 percent - recouping over half of Monday's losses driven largely by the Ukraine crisis. MSCI's all-country world stocks index, which tracks stocks in 45 countries, was up half a percent. U.S. stock index futures were up more than 1 percent - suggesting a higher open on Wall Street. Scott Meech, co-head of European equities at Union Bancaire Privee (UBP) said: 'It's still a very worrying situation but seems to have calmed down a bit. 'That's why we're seeing a bit of a recovery.' Russian stocks, bonds and the rouble plunged on Monday as Putin's forces tightened their grip in Crimea - whose population is mainly ethnic Russian. But after Putin's news conference today, the rouble-denominated MICEX stock index was up 5.2 percent, while the rouble rose 0.9 percent to 36.17 to the dollar. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose nearly 0.2 percent and Tokyo's Nikkei closed 0.5 percent higher as some foreign investors scooped up battered shares, although concerns over Ukraine kept the market on edge. In currency markets, the euro and the dollar gained 0.6 and 0.4 percent respectively to 140.22 and 101.85 yen. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3770. Geoffrey Yu, a strategist with UBS in London, said: 'Given three days worth of bad headlines, I think the market was just willing to take any sort of stability it can get.' Following Putin's statement, European stocks rose - with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 1.8 percent. MSCI's all-country world stocks index was also up half a percent . Yields on top-rated euro zone government bonds rose as demand for low-risk assets waned. Yields on lower-rated Italian and Spanish debt held near eight-year lows, resilient to global risk aversion to an extent that highlights how the market's perception of their creditworthiness has changed. 'Turn the clock back a few years and these markets would be hit by contagion,' said Nick Stamenkovic, a bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh. Russian stocks, bonds and the rouble plunged yesterday following continued military occupation in Crimea . 'But you see more signs of growth in these countries ...(and) the (European Central Bank) has backstops in place.' U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also rose, and were last up 4.7 basis points at 2.65 percent. Gold, another traditional safe haven, fell after rallying nearly 2 percent on Monday. It was last down 0.8 percent at $1,337.90. Brent crude oil fell about 1.6 percent to $109.38 per barrel.","Putin said today military force was a 'last resort' in Crimea .

"The devastating effects of a 22,000lb bomb used by the RAF to help end the Second World War are set to be laid bare as archaeologists investigate a remote test site in the New Forest. The 'Grand Slam', which was designed to simulate the effects of an earthquake in order to cause wide-spread destruction to critical infrastructure, was Britain's biggest conventional weapon ever. The bomb was the brainchild of Barnes Wallis, who is best known for creating the bouncing bombs used in the famous Dambusters raids in the Ruhr Valley. It was dropped on nine different sites in Germany in 1945 in a bid to damage morale and encourage the Nazis to surrender to Allied forces. Destructive: The Grand Slam bomb was the largest conventional weapon ever deployed by the British military . Inventor: The bomb was designed by Barnes Wallis, creator of the Dambusters' bouncing bombs . The target of the Grand Slam was key infrastructure, such as railway bridges and submarine bays, rather than built-up populated areas. The bomb - which Wallis spent years developing before it was built - was tested just once, on March 13, 1945, when it was dropped close to a concrete bunker in the New Forest near the town of Fordingbridge. It tunnelled deep into the ground at a speed of 700mph before detonating, setting off tremors which were the equivalent of an earthquake. The crater left at the New Forest test site was 70ft deep and 130ft across, and eyewitness reports suggested that the test building could be seen shaking. The concrete structure was originally thought to have been an imitation of a German submarine pen, but new evidence suggests that it was in fact an attempt to develop a more robust air-raid shelter, built over five and a half months at a cost of £250,000 (the equivalent of more than £10million today). Test: When the bomb was dropped on a site in the New Forest, it made a crater 70ft deep and 130ft across . Devastation: The site at a submarine base in Farge, Germany which was hit by a Grand Slam in March 1945 . After the end of the war, the site - known as Ashley Range - was returned to its natural state, and the concrete bunker was encased in a mound of dirt because it could not be demolished. 'The military had a responsibility to return it as found,' New Forest archaeologist James Brown told MailOnline. 'But there's a lot of concrete and other structures just left out there.' Visitors . to the forest can still see huge craters, an observation shelter and . chalk markings made on the ground in order to help bombers find their . targets. Now researchers from the New Forest National Park Authority hope to use modern scientific techniques to map the devastation caused by the Grand Slam in greater detail. They will deploy ground-penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography and magnetometry to work out to what extent the bunker was damaged by the bomb. Archaeologists are banned from digging near the site, because of the area's status as part of a national park and its use as a commons for the grazing of ponies and cattle. Site: An observation shelter situated at the New Forest bombing range where the Grand Slam was tested, which is now being investigated by archaeologists . Despite . its image as a peaceful, bucolic patch of England, the New Forest was . actually central to the war effort as one of the most active test sites . in the country. As well as the Grand Slam, tanks and bouncing bombs were first tried out in the forest, while the area also hosted nine air fields. Researchers hope that their hi-tech tools will enable them to reconstruct the history of the site in greater detail than ever before. Mr Brown said the new research could help the public learn more about the role played by the forest in the war. 'We can create 3D models of all that data that we can have people interact with,' he said. 'Some of our most recent history is some of our rarest - people are focussed on Bronze Age and Roman history and ignore the Second World War. 'It's only recently that interest in Second World War history and archaeology has picked up.' The Grand Slam bomb, also known as . 'Ten Ton Tess', was the largest conventional weapon ever to be developed . by the British military. It . was designed by Barnes Wallis, inventor of the bouncing bomb used by . the Dambusters, as a way of destroying key sites without having to hit . them directly. He came up with the idea at the beginning of the Second World War, but it was not until towards the end of the conflict that it finally attracted support from top brass and went into production. The bomb . was dropped from a Lancaster bomber and hit the ground at speeds of up . to 700mph, tunnelling as deep as 40m into the earth. Success: Germany surrendered soon after the introduction of the Grand Slam, which obliterated the Valentin submarine pens . It then detonated inside the ground after a nine-second delay, setting off huge vibrations which imitated the effect of an earthquake. This meant that structures could be damaged or even destroyed by the bomb as long as it fell within a few hundred metres. The . Grand Slam only had to be tested once, in the New Forest in March 1945 - . the effect was so extreme that RAF chiefs instantly knew it was ready . to be used in the air campaign against Germany. The . next day, one of the bombs was dropped on a railway viaduct in . Bielefeld, causing around 100m to collapse in a bid to interrupt German . transport and communications. Aerial: A photograph of the moment when the Grand Slam hit a railway viaduct in Germany the day after being tested in the New Forest . In . total, 42 Grand Slams were deployed on nine different sites, including . train bridges, gun batteries and structures housing U-boat submarines. The . use of the bomb contributed to the aerial assault on Germany which . convinced senior Nazis that the war had finally been lost, leading to . the final surrender in May 1945. After the end of the Second World War, there were still 57 Grand Slams left, but they would never be used in combat again. Only . five complete bombs still survive - they are on display at the RAF . Museum, Brooklands Museum, RAF Lossiemouth, RAF Coningsby and the . Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum.","The Grand Slam, designed by Barnes Wallis, created underground 'earthquakes' which could destroy targets without a direct hit .

"Vice President Joe Biden congratulated the wrong Marty Walsh after the Boston mayoral elections . When Marty Walsh won the Boston mayor's race, Vice President Joe Biden was quick to pick up the phone to congratulate him. But, there was a problem. The Marty Walsh who Biden had on the other end of the phone wasn't the Marty Walsh who had been elected to succeed longtime Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. It was in fact a former aide to the late U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy also of the same name. Before he could explain the mix-up, Biden launched into his congratulations, saying 'Marty, you did it, you son of a gun.' Walsh, . who said he has received misplaced calls for the other Marty Walsh in . the past, said he quickly set Biden straight and passed over the telephone number for the elected mayor. Walsh said Biden then jokingly congratulated him for not being mayor. According to The Telegraph, Mr Walsh had . three more calls during the night including one from the White House . but the mix-up was already explained before the President was put through to him. He also had voicemails left for him from Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Congresswoman who is head of the Democratic National Committee and RT Rybak, the mayor of Minneapolis, who is also head of the Democratic mayors' group. Newly elected Boston mayor Martin Walsh embraces his girlfriend Lorrie Higgins after winning Boston elections . Biden's niece has been recently making headlines when she allegedly told police officers 'you don't know who I am' when she was arrested following a fight with her roommate which landed her in jail. The 26-year-old was arrested at her luxury apartment in Tribeca, New York, on September 17 after she allegedly went mad at her roommate over unpaid rent. Friends of the young woman revealed after that she had begun to 'unravel' as a result of the pressure of being related to the Vice President.","Vice President known for calling Democrats when they win elections .

"An Oklahoma police department's newest recruit is a total dummy - a repurposed CPR dummy, that is. Nicknamed the 'Plastic Popo,' the smooth-faced new cop makes a convincing foil when dressed in a blue police uniform and propped up in the front seat of a police car. He's the newest weapon in the cash-strapped Ada police department's battle against speeding. Desk duty: Plastic Popo takes a break from his regular job of slowing down speeding drivers . Effective: The Ada force can't afford to have an officer in every spot where speeding drivers are reported, but Plastic Popo works for free . 'We can't keep people in every neighborhood that they complain about speeders,' Ada Police Chief Mike Miller told News 9. 'But we can put that car there and let it sit all day and it will slow people down.' He's quickly become the Ada PD's most popular cop, with a dedicated Facebook page where people who have tracked him down post selfies with the unflappable fuzz. His popularity hasn't gotten in the way of his effectiveness though - if anything, it's increased it. After setting the Plastic Popo up in a car on a road, says one Ada motorist, next, 'they'll put a real cop in it, and they'll pull you over. They get everybody.' Sacrifice: Plastic Popo was injured after a drunk driver crashed into his patrol car as he waited on the shoulder of a road . Famous: A Facebook page dedicated to Plastic Popo selfies instructs fans not 'to do anything that will make the real Popos upset with you' Despite his relatively risk-free role as a traffic officer, Plastic Popo has seen his fair share of action in the line of duty. The dummy was in position sitting in the front seat of a police car when a drunk driver hit the vehicle head-on. 'He was 10 or 12 feet off the shoulder and a drunk driver came along and took out the car,' said Chief Miller. Being the strong, silent type, Plastic Popo never complained, despite being towed away in his damaged police vehicle. His colleagues put a bandaid over his cheek and as soon as there's another free patrol vehicle, Plastic Popo will be back out on he roads.","An Oklahoma police department is using a plastic CPR dummy to catch drivers speeding .

"A tough new crackdown to help parents protect their children from internet porn will be unveiled today by David Cameron. Four of Britain’s biggest internet service providers will force customers to specify if they want to view explicit sites. Subscribers to BT, Sky, Talk Talk and Virgin who do not opt in will have no access to  internet porn. Wrecking childhood: Parents will have to specify whether they want explicit sites to be viewable on family computers under new measures to be announced today . The breakthrough is expected to be . announced by the Prime Minister as the centrepiece of a crackdown on . the sexualisation of childhood. Other moves will include restrictions on billboards plastered with images of scantily-clad models and aggressive advertising campaigns. There will also be a new website called Parentport on which parents can complain about any TV programme, advertisement, product or service they feel is inappropriate for children. Downing Street has introduced the crackdown in response to a report by Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union charity, which warned that childhood was being wrecked by web pornography, sexual TV and advertising content and suggestive clothes for youngsters. Mr Bailey told the Government that radical steps were needed to stem the flow. Mr  Cameron wants the Parentport website to help keep any infringements in check. Ed Richards, chief executive of Ofcom, said: ‘Seven UK media regulators have come together to develop a single website with a single aim – to help protect children from inappropriate material. Inappropriate: Overly-sexual clothes such as these padded bikinis for seven-year-olds  from Primark will also be covered by the new rules . Targeting young girls: T-shirts such as these with the message 'Future footballers wife' are likely to be reported on the Government's new complaints website . ‘Each regulator shares this common purpose and is committed to helping parents make their views and concerns known. ‘We have already tested the website with parents and the feedback has been positive. ‘We will keep listening to parents and intend to develop the site in light of further feedback.’ The one-stop-shop site will be run by regulators including the ASA, the Authority for Television On Demand, the BBC Trust, the British Board of Film Classification, Ofcom, the Press Complaints Commission, the Video Standards Council and Pan-European Game Information. The site – www.parentport.org.uk – will direct complaints to the regulator that deals with the area of concern. There is growing concern about the impact on Britain’s children of adult images on the internet. On average, children start going online at the age of eight. Sexual: Adverts such as the famous Hello Boys Wonderbra poster, pictured, featuring Eva Herzigova will be targeted in the crackdown . Research . suggests up to a third of under-tens have seen pornography on the web, . while four in five teenagers aged 14 to 16 admit accessing explicit . photographs and footage regularly on their home computers. Half of children say they use the internet alone in their bedroom, making it difficult for parents to monitor their activity. Children . as young as 11 are taking pornographic images of themselves and . swapping them with friends on the web or through text messages, . according to a survey this year. Internet safety expert Ken Corish . revealed that 40 per cent of youngsters aged 11 to 14 have used their . mobile phone or computer to send pictures of themselves, or have . received naked or topless images of friends. Restrictions: David Cameron will announce the crackdown today in response to a report by Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union charity, right . Experts blamed the shocking trend on the volume of internet pornography seen by boys, which leads them to expect girls to be promiscuous and flaunt their bodies. Four in ten of the 11,000 children surveyed thought it was ‘appropriate’ to circulate pictures of topless girls in school. Today’s announcement by Mr Cameron follows several attempts to limit the adult content available to children on the web. Earlier this year, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested that unless ISPs signed up for some form of parental controls he would introduce legislation forcing them to. When Tory MP Claire Perry began a campaign to protect children online, she was warned by experts that it would not be practical to block sexual content retrospectively. However, the campaign being introduced by the Prime Minister differs in that content will be blocked when a customer pays for a new internet package from a service provider. In June, David Cameron told TV watchdogs they had until this month to launch a crackdown on sex and violence screened on television before the 9pm watershed. The move followed public uproar about the ‘soft porn’ dance routines of singers Rihanna and Christina Aguilera in the X Factor final last year. Ofcom sparked anger by refusing to condemn the programme. The Prime Minister is holding a summit at No10 today with 30 media and retail executives, including broadcasters, magazine editors, trade bodies and advertisers. In another move, a ban will be implemented on children of up to 15 being employed as ‘brand ambassadors’ or in peer-to-peer marketing campaigns.","Customers will have to choose whether they want to view porn .

"Nato countries agreed to beef up their military presence on Russia’s borders last night following the seizure of Crimea. The alliance dramatically stepped up the confrontation with Vladimir Putin as Russia’s defence minister Sergey Shoigu claimed the worst crisis since the Cold War ‘may turn into a tragedy not only for Ukraine, but also for all of Europe’. Nato foreign ministers ordered an end to all civilian and military cooperation with Russia and told their generals to quickly devise ways to better protect alliance members that feel threatened by the Kremlin. Nato countries agreed to beef up their military presence on Russia¿s borders last night following the seizure of Crimea. Pictured, Russian soldiers unload tanks from railway platforms in Gvardeyskoe village near Simferopol, Crimea . At the summit in Brussels they agreed to deploy further military assets in eastern NATO nations like Poland and the Baltic states to deter Russia from further aggression. A leaked document also revealed that the alliance wants to go still further, offering military support and even Nato membership to countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova, which have no formal links with Nato. Citing a seven page ‘Nato Restricted’ document, German magazine Der Spiegel said the alliance was ‘committed to maintaining the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty’ of all three countries. The document suggested that the three countries would benefit from ‘increased western military support’, should take part in joint training and exercises. Nato is also reported to be planning to send a NATO liaison officer to Moldova’s capital, Chisinau, and the former Soviet state could even join Nato’s rapid reaction force - a move likely to enrage the Kremlin. NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasumssen (left, pictured with U.S. President Barack Obama) insisted that 'every European country' could apply for NATO membership as he rounded on Mr Putin . NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasumssen insisted that 'every European country' could apply for NATO membership as he rounded on Mr Putin. Issuing a new warning over Vladimir Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine, Mr Rasmussen strongly denied that Russia had pulled back its troops from Ukraine’s borders, despite the Russian President’s personal assurances to German leader Angela Merkel. Mr Rasmussen said Putin (pictured) is 'guilty of several glaring and undisputed breaches of international law' In the strongest warning from a Nato leader for years, he said: ‘This is not what we have seen. And this massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation. ‘The crisis in Ukraine is a wake-up call for all Europeans. It reminds us that security and peace are not matters of course.’ Referring to Mr Putin, he said: ‘He is guilty of several glaring and undisputed breaches of international law. I am afraid that he has not yet had enough. ‘My concern is that we have less to do with rational thinking here rather than emotions - longing to re-establish Russia’s good old sphere of influence in its immediate neighbourhood.’ He told Focus magazine in Germany: ‘We are, indeed, extremely worried about the Russian troop deployment. We regard that as a concrete threat to Ukraine having the potential for further interventions. ‘I am sorry to say that Russia acts more like an opponent than a partner.’ He added that he was “very determined to provide effective defence and protection of our allies”. Moscow warned of a potential doomsday over the crisis. Mr Shoigu, a hawkish Putin ally, claimed the West had whipped up the revolution in Ukraine with “a scenario similar to the Arab Spring”. He warned: ‘The games by the leadership in Kiev with neo-Nazis and the expansion of Russophobic tendencies may turn into a tragedy not only for Ukraine, but also for all of Europe.’","Nato generals are looking at ways to protect members close to Russia .

"Russia has amassed all the forces it needs on Ukraine's border to carry out an 'incursion' into the country and it could achieve its objective in three to five days, NATO's top military commander said on Wednesday. Calling the situation 'incredibly concerning', NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, said NATO had spotted signs of movement by a very small part of the Russian force overnight, but had no indication that it was returning to barracks. Russia's seizure and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region has caused the deepest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, leading the United States and Europe to impose sanctions on Moscow. Scroll down for video . Concern: NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove (pictured) said Russia is in position to launch an invasion of Ukraine in three to five days . Defence: Ukrainian armored vehicles fire weapons during a training session this morning. It comes as NATO says Russia has amassed all the forces it needs to carry out an 'incursion' into the country . In an interview this morning ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich described events in Crimea as 'a tragedy', adding that had he been able he would have blocked the referendum that led to the region being annexed. He added that he was hoping he could convince Moscow to return the Black Sea peninsula to Ukraine. The United States and Europe have said they will strengthen sanctions against Russia if it moves beyond Crimea into east Ukraine. NATO . military chiefs are concerned that the Russian force on the Ukrainian . border, which they estimate stands at 40,000 soldiers, could pose a . threat to eastern and southern Ukraine. Breedlove told CNN: 'Forty thousand doesn’t tell the story, this is a combined arms army with all of the pieces necessary should there be a choice to make an incursion into Ukraine, so supported by fixed-wing aircraft, rotary aircraft, all of the logistics required in order to successfully make an incursion if they needed. 'It’s my opinion that they could move within 12 hours of a go, so essentially they could move right away if given the go.'

Deliberations: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (centre) waits for the start of the NATO-Ukraine Commission at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday . Viktor Yanukovich has described events in Crimea as 'a painful tragedy' during his first interview since being ousted as Ukrainian president and fleeing to Russia in February. Yanukovich said that had he been able to retain power, he would have banned the March 16 referendum that led to Crimea being annexed by Russia, and insisted he was still trying to negotiate with Moscow to return the Black Sea peninsula. He also admitted that he had been 'wrong' to invite Russian troops to enter Crimea after he fled the country following three months of increasingly violent protests. Ousted: Yanukovich said that had he been able to retain the Ukrainian presidency, he would not have allowed the March 16 referendum that led to Crimea being annexed by Russia . Yanukovich said that looking back at how the situation has developed, he felt it was 'very difficult to agree with' the way Crimea had separated from Ukraine. However he refused to shoulder any of the blame for the loss of Crimea himself, saying it was the fault of the current government in Kiev where, he claims, neither he nor Russia have any influence. He said the result of the referendum and the subsequent annexation by Russia was simply the result of a protest by the Crimean people against the new Kiev regime. 'I personally cannot accept this,' Yanukovich added. The comments came in an interview with the Associated Press and Russian television channel NTV. It was conducted in the south west Russian port city of Rostov-On-Don - close to the country's border with Ukraine. The Russian force has aircraft and helicopter support as well as field hospitals and electronic warfare capabilities. He said told Reuters and The Wall Street Journal that Russia could have several . potential objectives, including an incursion into southern Ukraine to . establish a land corridor to Crimea, pushing beyond Crimea to Ukraine's . Black Sea port of Odessa or even threatening to connect to . Transdniestria, the mainly Russian-speaking, separatist region of . Moldova that lies to the west of Ukraine. Russia . also has forces to the north and northeast of Ukraine that could enter . eastern Ukraine if Moscow ordered them to do so, Breedlove said.

Military equipment: T-72 tanks are unloaded from railway platforms at a railway station in Gvardeyskoe village near Simferopol . Any . such actions would have far-reaching implications for NATO, a military . alliance of 28 nations that has been the core of European defence for . more than 60 years. 'We are going to have to look at how our alliance now is prepared for a different paradigm, a different rule set... we will need to rethink our force posture, our force positioning, our force provisioning, readiness, etc,' Breedlove said. NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels this week suspended all practical co-operation with Russia in protest at its actions in Crimea and asked military commanders to draw up plans to reinforce NATO members in eastern Europe that are fearful about a threat from Russia. Breedlove said the ministers had asked him to draw up by April 15 a package of measures that would include reinforcements by land, air and sea. 'We will work on air, land and sea 'reassurances' and we will look to position those 'reassurances' across the breadth of our exposure: north, centre, and south,' he said.","General Philip Breedlove spotted signs of movement by Russian troops .

"Tragic: Little Isabella Mia Tolentino, died of complications from appendicitis in July 2012 . A grief-stricken Texan mother is to sue her health insurance provider because she claims they were negligent and too cheap to fly her little girl back home for treatment after she fell ill with appendicitis. University of Texas Medical nurse Marissett Tolentino is seeking unspecified damages from Blue Cross Blue Shield - blaming them for the tragic death of her six-year-old child Isabella last year while on vacation in the Dominican Republic. Needing immediate surgery, Tolentino says that the insurance company told her that Isabella's condition was not an emergency and she was forced to undergo an operation on the Caribbean island during which her child fell into a coma from which she never woke up. The lawsuit was filed last week in a Galveston court last week and alleges that the insurance firm actively worked with the Dominican Republic hospital to keep Marissett Tolentino and her husband in the dark about their daughters condition and hiding paperwork before getting her home. The Tolentino's allege that the decisions made by Blue Cross Blue Shield cost their daughter her life and that they were kept in the dark about any potential complications. 'Blue Cross Blue Shield was aware of the severity of Isabella's condition, yet they knowingly delayed the process and placed administrative prerequisites above the urgency required to save Isabella's life,' says the lawsuit according to the Houston Chronicle. Complications: Isabella's parents tried to ensure that they had full and total health insurance for their trip to the Caribbean . A spokesman for the provider said that they would not comment on the pending litigation. According to the lawsuit, the Tolentino's were wary of traveling to the Caribbean for their vacation but did so knowing the health facilities provided at their resort as well as the nearby hospital were part of their insurance. 'I did my homework,"" Marissett Tolentino said. 'I was scared to travel out of the country.' At their resort Isabella began to experience serious abdominal pains on Jul5th and was diagnosed with appendicitis by doctors at Hospiten Bavaro. 'We strongly urged them that we didn't want her to have her surgery in the Dominican Republic,' Tolentino said. 'I was willing to put her on a commercial airplane - that was how scared I was of putting her in surgery over there.' However, upon consultation with their pediatrician in the United States, Tolentino decided her best mode of action was to ask for a private medical jet - costing $18,000. Sister: Isabella was advised to return to the US for treatment but her parent's provider would not pay for the jet she needed . According to the lawsuit, the Tolentino's were wary of traveling to the Caribbean for their vacation but did so knowing the health facilities provided at their resort . This was denied by the insurance company and the Tolentino's were told that appendicitis was not an emergency. 'I just thought, I've been paying all these premiums all these years and then when I really needed them, they wouldn't pay for an $18,000 flight,' Tolentino said. I have to deal with the daily struggles of losing my child over something so stupid - them flying her home.' Having allowed against their wishes to have their daughter operated on in the Dominican Republic, under anesthesia, Isabella's breathing tube became clogged with vomit and blood and she fell into a coma. There were alleged complications with the surgery according to the lawsuit including an intubation tube that was too small for the girl. Eventually Isabella was transported from the Dominincan Republic to Miami where doctors declared her brain dead from lack of oxygen. She was taken off life support on July 18. 'The brain is an organ that we don't fully understand,' Tolentino said. 'There are always these miracles - that's what I was hoping for.'","Isabella Tolentino, 6, died on July 18, 2012 after falling into a coma because of the treatment she received in the Dominican Republic for a case of appendictis .

"NATO issued a warning to the Kremlin last night that sending its tanks into Ukraine would mark a 'serious escalation' of the crisis.

The rebels refused to identify the origin but Ukraine alleged they were smuggled in from Russia. It came as Kiev premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that Moscow is poised to cut off gas to his country in a bitter row over payments, calling for emergency measures in the event of a shut down. Mini invasion: Military sources claimed two out of three tanks and three armoured vehicles that crossed the frontier from Russia had been taken out (pictured: a Russian tank crosses border into Ukraine yesterday) Threatening: The arrival of the tanks - in separatist hands - caused shock waves since the deployment appeared to contract Russian assurances to the West that it was seeking to diffuse tension . 'We have seen reports that Russian . tanks and other armoured vehicles may have crossed the border into . eastern Ukraine,' said NATO head Anders Fogh Rasmussen. 'If these reports are confirmed, this would mark a serious escalation of the crisis in eastern Ukraine.' He . called for Russia to continue to withdraw its troops massed in frontier . zones and de-escalate a crisis which has claimed at least 270 lives. A separatist source said: 'We confirm that we have the tanks. They will be sent to the most dangerous sectors.' Kiev military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk claimed that two of the tanks had been 'destroyed' along with other military vehicles by Ukrainians forces, but this was disputed by separatists. 'They . are in Donetsk and are the minimum that we have to defend the city,"" said rebel leader Denis Pushilin, alive despite two attempts on his life . in recent days.

"A Universal flu vaccine to protect against new strains of the bird and swine flu may be a step closer thanks to British research. For decades the key to creating a vaccine to protect against all forms of flu has eluded scientists. Current vaccines only target the most common strains by making the immune system produce antibodies to prevent infection. A Universal flu vaccine to protect against new strains of the bird and swine flu may be a step closer thanks to British research . But they remain one step behind the virus, which keeps evolving. However, thanks to a study carried out during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the annual flu season could be reduced and future pandemics prevented. Scientists at Imperial College London used the outbreak as a ‘unique’ natural experiment to investigate why some people got sick while others did not. Hundreds of staff and students donated blood samples as the pandemic took off and were then monitored over the next two flu seasons. Those who did not get sick had more virus-killing immune cells, known as CD8 T cells, in their blood at the start of the pandemic, the study found. A new vaccine would work by prompting the body to produce these cells to fend off the virus. Professor Ajit Lalvani from the National Heart and Lung Institute said the discovery has provided the  ‘blueprint’ for a vaccine, adding: 'New strains of flu are continuously emerging, some of which are deadly, and so the holy grail is to create a universal vaccine that would be effective against all strains of flu. Influenza kills between 250,000 and 500,000 globally per year, according to the World Health Organisation. The ICL announcement comes after scientists in America said they thought they might have developed 'universal' protection against the killer virus. Current vaccines only target the most common strains by making the immune system produce antibodies to prevent infection . Speaking in May, the US researchers said the vaccine was created by a team working for US healthcare company Sanofi using techniques that have also raised hopes of a new generation of vaccines against other diseases. Prof Lalvani's team recruited 342 staff and students at Imperial to take part in their study in autumn 2009, following the outbreak of the flu. Volunteers donated blood samples and were given nasal swabs, supplying regular updated information about their health. Researchers found those who fell more severely ill with flu had fewer CD8 T cells in their blood, and those who caught flu but had no symptoms or only mild symptoms had more of these cells. Prof Lalvani said: 'Our findings suggest that by making the body produce more of this specific type of CD8 T cell, you can protect people against symptomatic illness. This provides the blueprint for developing a universal flu vaccine. 'We already know how to stimulate the immune system to make CD8 T cells by vaccination. 'Now that we know these T cells may protect, we can design a vaccine to prevent people getting symptoms and transmitting infection to others. 'This could curb seasonal flu annually and protect people against future pandemics.'","Current vaccines only target most common strains by making the immune system produce antibodies to prevent infection .

"Just when you thought you were safe - the Polar Vortex is back. The Midwest and North East are thawing out after being covered with more than a foot of snow over the past week, but forecasters have warned it won't be for long as another cold front is on its way. The wintry storm is expected to slam the Midwest this weekend, bringing ferocious winds and freezing temperatures as low as 35 degrees below normal. After rattling the Midwest, it will stretch into the South and East at the start of next week, according to Weather Underground. Snow escape: A 6 to 10 day forecast shows a swathe of cold temperatures expected to hit the country next week - with the Midwest, South and East expected to get temperatures colder than normal . A six-to-ten-day forecast from NOAA also reveals a terrifying swathe of cold temperatures starting in the Midwest on Tuesday and stretching south and to the coast - where the mercury is expected to plummet to temperatures below average, while a higher than average amount of rain is also due. 'Temperatures 20°F below normal will likely invade the Upper . Midwest on Sunday, and gradually spread southeastwards during the week,' Dr Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground said. 'The peak cold is predicted to occur late next week, with temperatures 20 . - 35° below normal covering much of the eastern 2/3 of the country.' Ten-day forecasts by Weather.com show that temperatures will stay below freezing, with Embarrass, Minnesota enduring lows of -29F next Friday. And it won't be over quickly as forecaster predict that the best chance of snow is believed to be between February 26 and March 3, as temperatures on the East Coast remain at least 15 degrees below normal, Philly.com reported. Here we go again: An image taken in January in Detroit, Michigan shows a homeowner shoveling snow in scenes that are expected to continue for the rest of the month following a brief thaw in the Midwest . Brutal: Another file image shows a man battling cold temperatures in Michigan. This weekend, temperatures around 20 F below normal are expected to creep into the area . Masters added that due to these predicted temperatures, the cost of natural gas is soaring. The latest polar vortex follows a major thaw across the Midwest, where temperatures remained above freezing in Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit for the second day. But Dr Masters warned that with these warmer climes - with temperatures reaching the low 50s - come new problems of dangerous flash flooding. 'Much of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, . Minnesota, and Indiana are covered by snows of 10 to 30 inches that if melted, . would be equivalent to 2 to 6 inches of rain,' he said. In New York City, there are other warnings - as sheets of ice are falling from buildings as temperatures begin to rise, posing risks for pedestrians below. New storm: A forecast shows the Northeast can expect high winds on Saturday, while the Midwest will see heavy snow from Monday as the South suffers heavier rain . Cold ahead: A March forecast shows temperatures will remain below normal in the Midwest for the month . It will come as yet more grief for the Midwest, southern and eastern areas of the country, which has been battered with grueling weather while the West largely suffers from droughts. The relentless snow and ice storms this season have been connected to scores of traffic-related deaths and have led to the highest number of flight cancellations in more than 25 years. U.S. airlines have canceled more than 75,000 domestic flights since December 1, including roughly 14,000 last week - the highest total number and highest percent of cancellations since at least the winter of 1987-1988, when records began.","Midwest and East Coast are experiencing a thaw - but it will be short lived .

"Maxine Carr has become a mother – but her baby can never know her real name or how she protected Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Carr, 34, gave birth to her first child earlier this year at the safe house where she is living under a secret identity. The former teaching assistant, who provided a false alibi for boyfriend Huntley after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, is believed to have married her child’s father. New identity: Maxine Carr, left, ex-girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, will have the anonymity of her new child protected . Her husband is understood to be aware of her shocking past despite the fact a court order has given Carr lifelong anonymity. However, the terms of the injunction . are so stringent that their child cannot be told of its mother’s true . identity or her role in covering for Huntley. It means the baby could grow up never . knowing its mother became one of the most reviled women in the country . after the murders in Soham, Cambridgeshire. And a separate court order may be necessary to ensure the child’s identity is also protected. Carr served 21 months in jail for providing Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly and Jessica, both ten, in 2002. On her release she became one of just . four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child . killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon . Venables. Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to . have cost the taxpayer millions. Victims: Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman went missing in August 2002 . She is said to have miscarried twice since 2006 after becoming pregnant by different lovers. But it was reported in 2008 that she was preparing to marry a partner who was aware of her past. Carr was the girlfriend of school . caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of Holly . and Jessica were found. They had been missing for 13 days. Huntley eventually admitted that the . girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their . deaths were accidental. He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives. Although Carr was not implicated in . the murder, she gave Huntley  a false alibi, claiming that she  had been . with him at the time  of the killings, which delayed the police . investigation. In 2003, she was convicted of perverting the course of . justice, and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. A new court order may be necessary to . specifically protect her child’s identity – similar to the order which . preserves the anonymity of Bell’s child. Bell, convicted of killing two boys, . received a new identity on her release from jail, and after giving birth . in 1984 secured an additional order to protect her daughter. The child was initially granted anonymity only until her 18th birthday, but that was later extended indefinitely. It is believed that Bell’s daughter . did not know her mother’s identity until it was revealed by reporters. Thompson and Venables killed toddler James after abducting him from a . Liverpool shopping centre in February 1993. They were just ten years old at the time, and were sentenced to indefinite imprisonment, but were released in 2001. Both were given new identities, and . have a large number of restrictions on their movements, including a ban . on contacting each other. Last year Venables was given a second . prison sentence for downloading child pornography. And in May this year, . his identity was changed once again after a ‘serious breach’ in the . security of the identity he had been using. Huntley, 37, remains in jail, where he . is serving a life sentence for the Soham murders. He has been attacked . by fellow inmates at least twice, and is also thought to have made a . suicide attempt in 2006. Lifelong anonymity orders, like that . given to Maxine Carr, are relatively rare - there are no more than a . handful currently in place. They are imposed only in the most . high-profile cases, where it is almost certain that criminals released . from jail will attract intense media attention, and possibly the threat . of violence from members of the public. One reason they are so rare is that . most people convicted of the most horrific crimes end up spending their . whole lives behind bars, so the majority of those given new identities . committed their crimes when they were children and therefore attracted . more lenient sentences. Mary Bell: Convicted of manslaughter aged 11 . Mary Bell was a famous early recipient of an indefinite anonymity order. She was convicted in 1968 of killing two young boys before her twelfth birthday. Despite the gruesome nature of the killings, she was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, having been diagnosed with a mental illness. After 12 years in prison, during which time her mother had repeatedly sold stories about her to the press, Bell was released in 1980 and given a new identity. When she gave birth to a daughter in 1984, the child was also granted anonymity until her 18th birthday, later extended indefinitely. It is believed that Bell's daughter did not know her mother's identity until it was revealed by reporters. Robert Thompson and Jon Venables killed toddler James Bulger after abducting him from a Liverpool shopping centre in February 1993. They were just 10 years old at the time, and were sentenced to indefinite imprisonment, but were released in 2001. Both were given new identities, and have a large number of restrictions on their movements - for example, they are not allowed to contact each other. Robert Thompson, left, and Jon Venables killed James Bulger in 1993 . Venables returned to headlines last year when he was given a second prison sentence for downloading child pornography. In May this year, his identity was changed once again after a 'serious breach' in the security of the identity he had been using. Maxine Carr is unusual among those given new identities, as she is not a convicted killer. However, her association with Huntley caused such public revulsion that she too was granted an indefinite anonymity order for her own protection.",Anonymity order will extend to Carr's child .
"Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon's announcement that he is separating from his wife caught coach Cesare Prandelli off guard as the Azzurri opened their World Cup training camp Tuesday. 'I was surprised by his statement,' Prandelli said. 'I'm sorry, because whenever there's a separation it's upsetting for everyone. But the serenity with which he made the announcement leads to believe that he's mentally ready for this event.' Buffon, whose personal life has been under an intense spotlight in recent weeks, told Sky TV he has been 'separated for a while' from Czech model Alena Seredova, who he married three years ago. The couple has two boys. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Pirlo and Balotelli in Italy training . Taking a break: Gianluigi Buffon has separated from his Czech model wife Alena Seredova (R) Czech mate: Model Alena Seredova has been married to the Juventus keeper for three years . Buffon is preparing to play at his ninth major international tournament, moving him level with former Germany great Lothar Matthaus as the top Europeans. Buffon thanked his wife for not creating any problems in public and apparently wanted to clarify his status after he and Seredova were photographed at the Europa League final with their children. 'It was her who brought them to the stadium,' Buffon said. 'And I would like for them to come to Brazil - that would really please me. You can't ever forget that the first obligation we have is to make sure your kids grow up with the utmost serenity, no matter the fact that our roads could part.' Italy is training for three days this week before beginning full-time preparation next Monday. With Prandelli concerned about humid conditions in Brazil, players wore heart monitors around their chests as they trained under the sun at the Coverciano training center in Florence. As for social networks, Prandelli said he would hold an open discussion with the squad to decide on how best to handle their use during the World Cup. 'By nature, I'm not a person who bans things,' he said. Tweet or sour? Italy coach Cesare Prandelli will have a discussion over the use of social media at the World Cup . United States-born forward Giuseppe Rossi was included in Prandelli's preliminary 30-man squad despite missing almost the entire second half of the Serie A season due to the latest in a long string of knee injuries. 'He's a great talent and one of the most important players in the Italian landscape,' Prandelli said. 'His determination and desire to recuperate in time shows a lot of character. ... Of course he needs to work on his condition but I don't want to put too much pressure on him.' Antonio Cassano, another forward, is aiming to play in his first World Cup at the age of 31. Up front: Forwards Guiseppe Rossi (C) and Antonio Cassano (R) could join Mario Balotelli in Brazil . Cassano was a key member of Italy's squads at the last three European Championships but he was not a favorite of former coach Marcello Lippi and wasn't included on the 2006 and 2010 World Cup teams. 'He put himself back into consideration and that's already a victory. It means he did everything right,"" Prandelli said, referring to Cassano's strong season with Parma, where he scored 12 goals. ""And at that age this is probably his last big chance.' Prandelli raised eyebrows by leaving off physical forwards Alberto Gilardino and Luca Toni from the squad. 'We want to operate in a different manner inside the area,"" he said. ""That should be a message for the forwards.' Old stager: Giangluigi Buffon will be playing in his ninth major international tournament with Italy . In Brazil, Italy is in Group D with England, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Prandelli was asked how important it was to start well against England. 'It's easy to say a lot, for two reasons. Because if you win you get three points that are key for advancing, and beating a big squad is good for the squad's spirit,' he said. 'But history teaches us that at the last World Cup, Spain lost (its opener) to Switzerland and went on to win the cup. But obviously we would prefer to start with a win.' Italy will play two friendlies before flying to Brazil, facing Ireland on May 31 in London and Luxembourg on June 4 in Perugia.","Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon has seprated from wife Alena Seredova .

"Target has revealed that a sales assistant's stolen credentials helped cyber criminals pull off a massive theft of customer data during the Christmas shopping season last year. Around 40 million credit and debit card details and 70 million other private records were stolen by hackers accessing the US retailers' payment system using an unidentified vendor's details. The disclosure of how the criminals were able to pull off the crime comes as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed that the Department of Justice was investigating the massive hacking at Target. Hacked: Target, the third biggest retailer in the U.S., has revealed that cyber criminals stole a sales assistant's credentials to pull off the massive theft of up to 70 million customers' personal details . Molly Snyder, a spokesman for Target - the third largest retailer in the U.S., said: 'The ongoing forensic investigation has . indicated that the intruder stole a vendor's credentials, which were . used to access our system.' She declined to elaborate on what type of credentials were taken, who the vendor was, or to provide other details. Last week personal data stolen from Target customers in South Texas was found in the possession . of a pair of Mexican citizens arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border, but . investigators believe the original hackers will be far more difficult to . locate. The new details of the hack came as Attorney General . Eric Holder confirmed that the Department of Justice had launched an investigation into the crime. Holder, . testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the Justice . Department would seek the perpetrators of the Target breach as well as . 'any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card . fraud.' 'While we generally . do not discuss specific matters under investigation, I can confirm the . department is investigating the breach involving the U.S. retailer, . Target,' Holder added. Hunt: The new details of the Target hack came as Attorney General Eric Holder (right) confirmed that the Department of Justice had launched an investigation and were now actively seeking the perpetrators . Yesterday U.S. spy chiefs called on Congress to draft stricter requirements for how retailers and other private businesses should inform government agencies and customers about big breaches of personal and financial data. At a hearing before the Senate . Intelligence Committee, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, where the National . Security Agency is headquartered, asked intelligence chiefs if media . leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden had affected U.S. cybersecurity efforts. 'Is . the impact of the Snowden affair slowing us down in our work to be more . aggressive in the cybersecurity area?' Mikulski asked. FBI Director James Comey said . political uproar over surveillance and Snowden's leaks had complicated . discussions about how to fight consumer data breaches. 'There is the threat of fraud and theft because we've connected our lives to the Internet,' Comey said. 'We . need to make sure that the private sector knows the rules of the road . and how we share that information with the government.' Leaks by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden have 'complicated' the fight against data breaches . Some U.S. officials with . responsibility for cybersecurity have complained privately that, while . states have created a 'patchwork' of local rules requiring businesses to . report breaches of consumer data to authorities and the public, there . are no similar nationwide federal requirements. Congress . has been wrestling for years with proposals for legislation on data . security but has been unable to reach agreement. There is no national . standard to govern how and when businesses that suffer consumer data . breaches must advise their customers and federal agencies. The Secret Service has taken the lead . investigating the breaches at Target and other retailers, including . Neiman Marcus and Michaels Companies Inc, the largest U.S. arts and . crafts retailer. On January . 23 it was reported that the FBI also warned U.S. retailers to prepare . for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases over the . past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used . against Target during the holiday shopping season. As lawmakers accelerated to gather . information about the data breaches, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democratic . chairman of the Judiciary Committee, took a new tack, asking Target why . the company had not yet reported its data breach to the U.S. Securities . and Exchange Commission. 'Your . failure thus far to provide this information to your investors does not . seem consistent with the spirit or the letter of the SEC's financial . disclosure rules,' Rockefeller wrote in the three-page letter to . Target's chief executive Gregg Steinhafel. The company's shares have been hurt since the data breach was announced on December 19.

"An Ohio woman shot dead a masked intruder after she found him standing over her sleeping son with a knife in his hands, only to discover later that the victim had been her son's childhood friend. Reb Barbee, 17, from Prairie Township in Franklin County, was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the back Sunday after he broke into the home of Heather Tackett in the middle of the night. Police have arrested three teenagers on charges of murder and complicity to aggravated burglary. Mistaken identity: Reb Barbee, 18 (left and right), was shot dead after allegedly breaking into the house of his friend's mother, who did not know it was him because he was wearing a mask . Home invasion: Heather Tackett discovered Barbee standing over her son's bed with a knife in his hands as the teen slept . Investigators say the murder counts stem from the suspects’ failure to seek medical help for their wounded friend. Tackett, 37, who fired the fatal shot, told police she did not call 911 to report the incident because she did not think she hit Barbee, who fled her home, The Columbus Dispatch reported. The incident unfolded at around 4am Sunday when Ms Tackett entered the room of her 17-year-old son, Jake, to find a figure wearing an Insane Clown Posse mask standing over the sleeping teen with a knife in his hands. The mother reportedly screamed at the trespasser and then fired a single shot from her boyfriend's .38-caliber revolver. The masked man, later identified as Reb Barbee, took off running, leaving behind a trail of blood, police said. Accomplices: Adam Pickens, 18 (left), Tyler Blazer, 17 (right) and another 17-year-old have been charged with murder and complicity to aggravated burglary for allegedly helping Barbee break into the Tackett residence and then failing to seek medical help for the mortally wounded teen . Getaway: The mortally wounded Barbee was wheeled back to his house (pictured) in a computer chair by his three friends . Memorial: This makeshift memorial has sprung up outside Barbee's home in Prairie Township, Ohio . It was not until hours later that police came to Tackett and informed her that she shot and killed her son's old friend, who used to come over for sleepovers. ‘I am devastated,’ Tackett said. ‘I really liked that kid and I was really good to him, and it breaks my heart he’d enter my home like that.’ According to police, Barbee snuck into Ms Tackett's home on Hubbard Drive South by climbing through a second-floor bathroom window with the help of three friends, who stayed behind acting as lookouts. After the shooting, Tyler Blazer and Brandon Hamilton, both 17, and Adam Pickens, 18, wheeled their mortally wounded friend in a computer chair all the way back to his house on Donovan Place half a mile away. About an hour later, Pickens called 911 telling the dispatcher that his friend has been shot, and that the wound appeared to be self-inflicted, ABC6 On Your Side reported. The 18-year-old added that he did not want to get his friend in trouble. Barbee had been friends with Jake Tackett and attended sleepovers at his house, but the two had a falling out a year ago, according to Heather Tackett . Reb Barbee was rushed to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound at 6am. Hamilton and Balzer have been charged as minors, while Pickens is facing the same counts as an adult. He is being held on $250,000 bond. The prosecutor's office will determine if Heather Takectt will face charges in Barbee's deadly shooting. The mother said she would not have discharged the revolver had the boy identified himself, or at least said something to her.","Heather Tackett, 37, found Reb Barbee, 17, standing over her sleeping son with a knife in his hands and wearing an Insane Clown Posse mask .

"Sutherland's spokesperson responded by saying: 'Kiefer enjoyed working with Freddie and wishes him the best' A Fox spokesperson insists 24 star is 'beloved by cast and crew' and branded Prinze Jr's comments 'so out of left field' Not happy: Freddie Prinze Jr spoke out at Comic Con about his 24 co-star Kiefer Sutherland . He appeared in every episode of the eighth season of Kiefer Sutherland hit TV series 24. But it seems the experience was enough to turn Freddie Prinze Jr off acting for good. 'I did 24, it was terrible. I hated . every moment of it,' he told ABC News this weekend. 'I just wanted to quit the . business after that. So, I just sort of stopped.'

"Juventus received bids for Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba 'from top European clubs' this summer, but turned them down because the players were so important to the club. Chile midfielder Vidal was a key target for Manchester United, while Pogba was courted by several top clubs including Chelsea and Paris Saint Germain. But Juve's sporting director Giuseppe Marotta has revealed that the club decided not to let either player go, despite receiving big-money offers from abroad. Pogba (left) and Vidal (right) were both strongly linked to Premier League moves and Juve received bids . Pogba was heavily linked with Chelsea for a huge transfer fee but Juventus turned down all bids for the player . 'Yes, absolutely, some offers arrived, from abroad, from top European clubs,' he told Processo del Lunedi. 'But we decided not to indulge them. 'We were in a position not to accept and we did with great awareness of the fact that we are talking about two very important components of our squad.' Marotta would not reveal the size of the bids, but Vidal is thought to be valued at more than £30million, while Pogba could command at least that much if he chose to leave Turin.

"Michaels Stores Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, on Thursday confirmed that there was a security breach at certain systems that process payment cards at its U.S. stores and that of its unit, Aaron Brothers. The company said in January that it was working with federal law enforcement officials to investigate a possible data breach. Michaels Stores said the breach, which took place between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014, may have affected about 2.6 million cards, or about seven per cent of payment cards used at its stores during the period. Security breach: A statement from Michaels management indicates up to three million credit cards may have been compromised . The company said about 400,000 cards were potentially impacted at its Aaron Brothers unit by the breach, which occurred between June 26, 2013 and February 27, 2014. There was no evidence that data such as customers' name or personal identification number were at risk, Michaels Stores said in a statement. This is the second known data breach since 2011 at Michaels Stores. Michaels Stores, whose major investors are Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LP, said cyber security firms it hired found that malware not encountered previously had been used in the latest attack. The company said it was working with law enforcement authorities, banks and payment processors, and that the malware no longer presents a threat. Michaels Stores, which resubmitted its IPO documents late last month following a restructuring, is the latest U.S. retailer whose systems have been breached. Arts and crafts giant: Michaels has almost 900 stores around the country and in Canada . Last year, the number three U.S. retailer Target Corp suffered a massive security breach that resulted in the theft of some 70 million customer records. Reuters reported in January that smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target. U.S. retailers are planning to form an industry group for collecting and sharing intelligence in a bid to prevent future attacks. Michaels Stores, which owns several private brands such as Recollections, Artist's Loft and Loops & Threads, competes with Hooby Lobby Stores Inc, Jo-Ann Stores Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.","Michaels Stores confirmed a security breach in their system .

"The Federal Emergency Management Agency wants its money back after it says it overpaid $5.8million to thousands of people who received emergency disaster aid for their losses from Superstorm Sandy, the hurricane that struck the East Coast almost two years ago. FEMA is scrutinizing about 4,500 households that it suspects received improper payments after the storm, which resulted in total federal disaster payments of $1.4 billion, according to program officials and data obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request. So far, about 850 of those aid recipients have been asked to pay back a total of $5.8 million. Other cases remain under review. Scroll down for video . Gary Silberman stands in his parent's home in Lindenhurst, New York, which was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy. After receiving nearly $17,000 in assistance from FEMA, the agency is demanding he return the funds . Albert Silverman, Gary's father, sits in his car outside his home. FEMA sent Gary Silberman a letter in November demanding back the money he received partly because his father also applied for disaster funds even though they were both living together. That's a violation of agency double-dipping rules . The average refund demanded by FEMA tallied just $6,987 as of July 30, but that might be too much for many of the households. About half of the 4,500 reported an annual gross income of $30,000 or less. The campaign to recover overpayments, called 'recoupment' in agency lingo, typically involves inadvertent violations of eligibility rules, bureaucratic mistakes or missing documentation, rather than outright fraud. Many people asked to return money were deemed ineligible because their damaged properties were vacation houses or rental properties, not their primary residences. Others had double dipped into the aid pool, with more than one household member getting payments. Some received FEMA money for things later covered by insurance. Silberman holds a copy of a letter that identifies himself as a tenant of his parent's home. He argues he should still qualify for the money because he was a rent-paying tenant, not a dependant . The larger pool of cases still under review as of that date involved $53 million in aid payments -- or about 3.7 per cent of the total given out by FEMA through its individuals and households program -- though any potential refunds would likely involve only a portion of that money. 'For most people, the money is long gone and long ago spent on storm recovery,' said Ann Dibble, director of the New York Legal Assistance Group's storm response unit, which has been helping about a dozen families fight a FEMA clawback. Twenty five cases under review involved households reporting a gross annual income of $500,000 or more. The list of people asked to return cash includes Gary Silberman of Lindenhurst, New York, who got a letter last November demanding just under $17,000. The agency said he was ineligible partly because he and his elderly father, Albert, had both applied for disaster funds even though they were living together. That's a violation of FEMA double-dipping rules. The Silbermans also were barred from getting some types of aid because they had failed to buy flood insurance after getting $25,000 in FEMA aid for flood damage during Hurricane Irene a year earlier. Federal rules require homeowners who accept disaster aid to buy insurance to protect them from future storms. A home in Manalapan shows the severe damage it sustained after Hurricane Sandy passed on October 29, 2012 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida . Silberman says he should still qualify for the money because he was a rent-paying tenant in his father's house, not a dependent, but FEMA has so far rejected his appeals. 'I lost my home. I lost everything. I don't have $17,000 to give back,' Silberman said. Sandy was among the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. More than 280 people died in the U.S. and the Caribbean. When the storm struck the New York and New Jersey coastlines, the surging ocean poured into densely populated seaside neighborhoods, flooding hospitals and subway tunnels and turning entire communities into soggy, moldy wrecks. About 179,000 households in New York and New Jersey received FEMA payments for temporary housing or damaged property. Most of the recoupment actions have also been aimed at residents of those states, but the agency is also reviewing payments to households in Connecticut, Maryland and Rhode Island. FEMA mobilized for Sandy hoping to avoid problems that plagued the aid distribution process following Hurricane Katrina's strike on the Gulf Coast in 2005. That destructive storm forced the overwhelmed agency to relax internal controls to speed up relief efforts, which led to huge numbers of people getting money they shouldn't have received. FEMA's attempts to recover hundreds of millions of dollars, often from people who couldn't afford to pay, led to a court fight and a procedural overhaul. By 2011, the agency had mailed out letters to at least 90,000 households asking for aid refunds. Congress authorized the agency to waive much of that debt. The agency says it has since gotten better at making sure aid only goes to the right people, and in proper amounts. A television anchor reports from the stormy streets of Atlantic City, New Jersey, in October 2012 as Superstorm Sandy hit the Jersey Shore . 'They have a lot more controls in place,' said John Kelly, the Department of Homeland Security's assistant inspector general for emergency management oversight. In most cases, aid recipients won't know they're under scrutiny before a notice arrives in the mail demanding repayment. FEMA says it has reviewed thousands of cases and decided the payments were warranted. FEMA isn't the only government agency trying to recover Sandy-related funding. Last spring, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development urged officials in New Jersey and New York to step up their scrutiny of hundreds of millions of dollars in other federal rebuilding grants. New Jersey's Department of Consumer Affairs says it has asked 51 homeowners to return a combined $940,000 -- a number that will probably will rise as the state looks at more cases. Ted Friedli got a letter from the state in July giving him five days to return a $26,101 grant he'd received to repair his flooded house in Long Branch, New Jersey. The letter explained that auditors had pegged the cost of fixing the house and raising it up on a higher foundation at less than the family had already received from their insurance policies and a low-interest federal disaster loan. That meant that the state grant was pure surplus and had to be returned. FEMA said the Silbermans were also barred from getting some types of aid because they had failed to buy flood insurance after getting $25,000 in FEMA aid for flood damage during Hurricane Irene a year earlier. Federal rules require homeowners who accept disaster aid to buy insurance to protect them from future storms . 'I was stunned,' Friedli said of his reaction when he got the notice, which he said came with no warning and no mention of any possibility of appeal. New York officials were unable to say how much money they had recouped so far from grant recipients who had been overpaid or belatedly declared ineligible. During one audit earlier this year, HUD officials warned that New York wasn't doing enough to ensure that rebuilding grants weren't 'unduly enriching homeowners beyond their actual expenses.' It cited several examples in which checks had been sent improperly. One homeowner returned a check for $119,138 after realizing that it included payment for damage covered by insurance. A month later, she got another letter saying she had been approved for an even larger overpayment of $121,731. Office of Storm Recovery spokeswoman Barbara Brancaccio said New York state has since improved its record-keeping procedures. Federal prosecutors have, so far, brought far fewer fraud cases against aid recipients than they did after Katrina, though it is unclear whether that is because less theft has occurred or because investigators haven't been as aggressive. By Katrina's second anniversary, more than 768 people had been charged with hurricane fraud-related crimes in 41 federal jurisdictions. By comparison, only seven people so far have faced federal fraud charges related to disaster aid payments in the states where FEMA distributed aid after Sandy, according to an AP survey of prosecutors' offices. Kelly, the assistant inspector general, said the modest tally of Sandy-related fraud cases likely reflects a shift in law-enforcement priorities. The Justice Department enforced a 'zero tolerance' policy for Katrina fraud, he said. But he believes it has since given prosecutors more freedom to turn down cases involving relatively small sums of money. Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the number of Sandy-related prosecutions, but he noted that a federal task force on disaster fraud has received more than 30,000 complaints from the public about possible Katrina-related fraud compared to 1,758 complaints related to Sandy.

"Juventus and Inter Milan will go head-to-head in January as they both try to sign Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski. Podolski has found himself out of favour at the Emirates and is open to a mid-season move away. Juventus have confirmed their interest with CEO Giuseppe Marotta admitting: ‘If there is a possibility in January to move on the transfer market [for Podolski] we will do that.’ Inter Milan are also interested in the German international who is finding  opportunities difficult to come by under Arsene Wenger this season following the summer additions of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck at Arsenal. Juventus and Inter Milan are interested in signing Arsenal's Lukas Podolski in the January transfer window . Podolski, who has scored 47 goals for Germany in 118 internationals, joined the London club in 2012. He was not involved in the opening four matches of the season following Germany's successful World Cup in Brazil, and has been an unused substitute four times in Arsenal's last eight matches. He has come on for the last few minutes of the Premier League games against Leicester City and Aston Villa and the Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund and has only played an entire match once - Arsenal's 2-1 home defeat against Southampton in the Capital One Cup last week when he looked a peripheral figure. He did not feature in Arsenal's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday where again he was an unused substitute and has yet to find the net this season.

"A vintage spacecraft will next month close in on Earth after an unexpected long journey around the sun. As it approaches our planet, scientists will have a brief chance to communicate with the 36-year-old probe in an attempt to bring it back to life. But with limited resources of its own, Nasa has made the unprecedented move of handing the reins over to amateur scientists in the hope that a group of space fans can revive the mission. Scroll down for video . Nasa has officially endorsed an amateur group, known as the the ISEE-3 Reboot Project, for them to attempt to bring a vintage spacecraft, called ISEE-3, back to life. Pictured is an artist's concept image of ISEE-3 . In April the ISEE-3 Reboot Project team - made up of the groups Space College, Skycorp, and SpaceRef - undertook a successful crowd funding project to raise £74,000 ($125,000) to rescue the probe. Nasa recently officially endorsed the Virginia-based project and signed a space act agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s-era craft. This is the first time Nasa has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again. ‘The intrepid ISEE-3 spacecraft was sent away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind extending its mission of discovery to study two comets,’ said Nasa astronaut John Grunsfeld. ISEE-3 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward Earth from a stable orbit point between our planet and the sun known as the Lagrangian 1, or L1. Monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the interconnected sun-Earth system, which at its most turbulent can affect satellites around Earth. In 1984, it was given a new mission and called the International Cometary Explorer. In September 1985, it passed through the tail of Comet Giacobini-Zinner, making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a comet. It also went on to fly by Comet Halley in March 1986. From 1991 until 1997, when it was too far away for reliable communications, this satellite continued to investigate the sun. Now it's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to Earth in August  before it heads back out to interplanetary space. ‘We have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through this creative effort to recapture the ISEE-3 spacecraft as it zips by the Earth this summer.’ In March, amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and find out its route, raising hopes that the mission could be revived. Launched in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward Earth, ISEE-3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981. With remaining fuel and functioning instruments, it then was redirected to observe two comets. Following the end of that mission, the spacecraft continued in orbit around the sun. It is now making its closest approach to Earth in more than 30 years. The goal of the ISEE-3 Reboot Project is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a gravitationally stable point between Earth and the sun known as Lagrangian 1 (L1). Once safely back in orbit, the next step would be to return the spacecraft to operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed. The mission's original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. Once proving this was possible, the project is now using the Arecibo Radio Observatory (pictured) in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3 . ISEE-3's close approach in the coming weeks provides optimal conditions to attempt communication. If communications are unsuccessful, the spacecraft will swing by the moon and continue to orbit the sun. Nasa said it has shared technical data with these amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from ISEE-3. The mission’s original communication hardware no longer exists, so controlling the spacecraft will require the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware. If they are able to do this, the project will use the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico to send commands to ISEE-3. New data resulting from the project will be shared with the science community and the public, providing a unique tool for teaching students and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering. The data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36-year old spacecraft.","This is first time Nasa has given control of one of its craft to the public .

"Don't be alarmed – these dozing tots in the electrode head caps are in fine health. In fact, they're providing the proof that mothers who exercise during pregnancy give their children a head start in life. Researchers found that being exposed to physical activity while in the womb boosts brain development. Just three 20-minute sessions a week makes a difference. The Canadian researchers looked at new babies – such as the one in the picture – but believe the benefits could last for life. The babies, above, were played sounds by researchers, who then monitored their brain activity. it was established that the tots whose mothers had exercised during pregnancy showed greater brain development . ‘We are optimistic that this will encourage women to change their health habits, given that the simple act of exercising during pregnancy could make a difference for their child’s future,’ said the team from the University of Montreal. They asked ten pregnant women to exercise enough to leave them slightly short of breath at least three times a week. They clocked up an average of almost two hours of exercise a week – some walked briskly, while others ran, cycled or went swimming. A second group of mothers-to-be did not take part in exercise and so were only moderately active for around ten minutes a week. When the babies were born, the researchers measured their brain activity using a cap covered in more than 100 electrodes cushioned in sponges. As each baby slept on its mother’s lap, it was played a bleeping noise repeatedly. Occasionally, the bleeps were interrupted by a second sound. Brain activity, picked up painlessly by the cap, showed that the babies whose mothers had exercised found it easier to tell the two sounds apart. This is seen as a sign of maturity and suggests their brains had developed more rapidly. ‘Our research indicates that exercise during pregnancy enhances the newborn’s brain development,’ said study leader Professor Dave Ellemberg. The annual conference of the Society for Neuroscience heard that previous research had concluded that exercise in pregnancy improves IQ and vocabulary until at least the age of five. Other research suggested that women who are active in pregnancy may be boosting the heart health of their children in later life. It is not clear why exercise helps the unborn child’s brain but it may be that it increases the oxygen supply. Exercise may also increase production of a brain-boosting protein called BDNF. Researcher Élise Labonté-LeMoyne said that exercising in pregnancy could be a simple and inexpensive way to give a baby a head start in life. ‘Thinking about your child is very good motivation but also do it for yourself,’ she said. ‘You are training to give birth and that is probably going to be the hardest thing you will do in your life. If you are physically fit it could be a little easier to get through it and get back from it.’ Colleague Professor Daniel Curnier said: ‘While being sedentary increases the risks of suffering complications during pregnancy, being active can ease post-birth recovery, make pregnancy more comfortable and reduce the risk of obesity in children.’","Neuroscientists in Canada made the discovery by playing noises to babies .

"England stars Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart have teamed up with Unicef, the world's leading children's organisation, to help battle malaria. The duo are part of the England Footballers Foundation (EFF) four-year partnership with Unicef to help fight the disease which still claims the life of a child every thirty seconds. To launch the campaign the pair can be seen alongside fellow England team-mates Gary Cahill and Jack Wilshere in a striking poster to help tackle malaria - which is the biggest killer of children under five in Africa. The England Footballers Foundation (EFF) have teamed up with Unicef to fight against malaria . The EFF was first established in 2007 on behalf of the England squad following the team's decision to donate their match fees and time to chosen charity partners. Now they plan to use their status alongside Unicef to help raise funds and awareness about the danger of malaria, globally the third single biggest killer of children, and the benefits of sleeping under a mosquito net as a life-saving measure. The first fundraising event will take place on Thursday in London where a number of England players, including Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere will manage football teams competing for the coveted EFF Charity Cup. England captain Rooney (centre) has revealed he is 'hugely proud' of the EFF's partnership with Unicef . It's not just England that the world's leading children's organisation has links too. Spanish giants Barcelona have had links with Unicef since 2006. For five years the club used to have the Unicef name on the front of their shirts up until 2011. The Nou Camp outfit now pay the  organisation £1.25million a year to have their name on the back of their shirts until 2016. Superstar Lionel Messi is one of the fund's global goodwill ambassadors too. On being involved in the campaign Three Lions' skipper, Rooney said: 'It's unbelievable that every ninety minutes – the time it takes to play a football match – 180 children will lose their lives to malaria. 'As captain of the England football team I am hugely proud that we are able to help Unicef in its goal of protecting every child in danger from this disease.' Hart echoed Rooney's sentiments by adding: 'I am used to defending my goal net against some of the best players in the world, but for some children, being able to sleep under a life-saving mosquito net can mean the last line of defence from this deadly disease. 'I have always been a huge fan of Unicef's work so it's really amazing that through our Foundation we can help make a difference to the lives of some of the world's most vulnerable children.' Joe Hart (right) echoed Rooney's views at the four-year partnership with the Unicef . Unicef UK Executive Director David Bull said: 'The simplest way to keep children safe from malaria is to ensure that they sleep under a mosquito net, but many are still living without this basic life-saving need. 'The faces of the England football team are some of the most recognisable in the country so it is great to have them on board to help us raise awareness to tackle malaria and protect all those children in danger.' Since its inception, the EFF has raised over £3.5million, provided over 150 player appearances, produced three national advertising campaigns and created exclusive EFF events.

Scroll down for video . Bare-faced beauty: Katie Price, who opted for a more muted colour palette at today's photoshoot, opened her make-up bag for FEMAIL - but it's pretty minimal! The mother-of-four did, however, admit that she swears by four beauty treatments that she's been having since her final years of school. 'I have my eyelashes and eyebrows tinted every week. I think good brows are really important and I love having a matching manicure and pedicure. I've had the same girl doing it for six years,' she aid. And it isn't just her beauty regime that Katie couldn't care less about. Describing her personal style, she said: 'Well, let's just say I've never been voted best-dressed and I'm always in the worst dressed category but I don't care. 'I've got better things in my life than to worry about what I'm wearing. I prefer being comfortable and I know I can dress up when I want to,' she said. While she isn't too fussed about lip gloss or bronzer, Katie makes sure she takes care of her hair, hence signing up with ColourB4, a natural colour remover that claims to work by reversing the colouring process, shrinking the colour molecules along with any toxins trapped inside the hair. Subtle look: Katie, who cites Amanda Holden as her hair icon, makes sure she takes care of her hair and has joined ColourB4, a natural colour remover that claims to work by reversing the colouring process . Speaking about her new project, she said: 'I've gone from dark to blonde back to brown so all the dye has taken its toll on my hair. 'Plus, I went to a hairdresser in the U.S. years ago and he burned my hair off because he put too much peroxide in it and it's been so hard to grow back so never go to the hairdressers, do it at home. ‘I now use ColourB4 every time I colour my hair, in just one hour it safely transforms my hair leaving it in the best condition and ready for me to experiment with my next look.' And Katie, who cites Amanda Holden as her hair icon, is already planning her new look - and she's feeling daring. 'I am definitely going to change my hair and do something really different and crazy for a change. I might dye it green for a week because my son Harvey likes the colour,' she revealed. Not a fan of the slap: Katie says she doesn't wear any make-up and only has a pot of Vaseline in her make-up bag . Shunning style: Busy mother-of-four Katie says she's got better things to worry about than how she looks when she leaves home .

However, the future is looking bright for the nation's favourite former glamour girl, who already has a lucrative book deal, perfume, lingerie line, haircare range and equestrian collection under her blingy belt. She said: 'I have lots of exciting plans and I am going to focus on being a businesswoman. I've written the next four chapters of my autobiography this week and I've got a product coming out in July. 'I can't wait, it's very exciting. Let's just say it's more of a thrill and the word ""gushing"" comes to mind...'

"A bizarre argument is raging around the imperilled Formula One team Caterham — is their only director, Constantin Cojocar, a Romanian cleaner or a former Steaua Bucharest footballer? Cojocar was thrown into the limelight on Thursday after Caterham’s 220 staff were locked out of the factory in Leafield, Oxfordshire, their futures uncertain. The story is based on a row between QPR owner Tony Fernandes and Engavest, a consortium led by former HRT team principal Colin Kolles that seemed to have bought the team from Fernandes in June. An unidentified man collects his belongings from the Caterham factory in Leafield, Oxfordshire . Caterham have been in financial difficulty and administrators have reportedly locked staff out of the building . In a series of claims and counter-claims over the past 48 hours, Engavest said Fernandes had failed to hand over his shares. Fernandes retorted by saying: ‘There was no legal obligation to transfer the shares to them unless certain conditions — which included paying creditors — were met. 'Those conditions have not been met. Our lawyers have asked Engavest several times to comply with these conditions but they have failed to engage.’ In the same press release, Graham Macdonald, the chief executive of Fernandes’ company, said: ‘I question how anyone who was interested in the future of the business would appoint one of their cleaners — Constantin Cojocar — as the sole director and shareholder of the UK operating company?’ It casts more doubt on whether Caterham will be involved at the United States Grand Prix next weekend . The administrators, Smith and Williamson, confirmed that Cojocar is a director. But Engvast said they ‘did not appoint Mr Cojocar who, we believe, was a former top footballer for Steaua Bucharest during the 1980s.’ Cojocar did indeed score two goals in eight appearances while on loan at Steaua in the 1987-88 season, and also oversaw the cleaning of the Caterham factory, which is said to smell of dead rodents. Engavest said in a statement on Thursday night: ‘Every single condition precedent of the sales and purchase agreement for which Engavest was responsible has been met.’ Bernie Ecclestone, F1’s supremo, is trying to bring the sides together, with Caterham struggling to get their cars to Austin, Texas for the next Formula One race on Sunday week. Tony Fernandes implied on Twitter that he has not been paid by the consortium that bought Caterham from him . Caterham's cars are 48 hours away from the scheduled flight to America for the next Grand Prix . Fernandes relinquished control of Caterham to the consortium at the end of June this year . Michael Schumacher has ‘made progress’ according to a doctor who treated him after his ski accident last December. Schumacher was operated on and placed into a coma to reduce the swelling. Jean-Francois Payen said: ‘I have noted some progress. We are on a timescale which goes to three years and we need to be patient.’","Administrators reportedly locked out staff as ownership row continues .

"Formula One title rivals Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are adamant nothing changes between themselves in the wake of Mercedes being crowned constructors' champions. Mercedes clinched their first constructors' crown on the back of the team's ninth one-two of a thoroughly-dominant campaign at the inaugural grand prix in Russia earlier this month. Hamilton took the chequered flag for the fourth time in a row, and ninth overall this season to open up a 17-point cushion over Rosberg with three races remaining.

The suggestion has long been once Mercedes wrapped up the constructors' title then the gloves would be off between Hamilton and Rosberg in their battle to claim the drivers' championship. The duo have already been embroiled in a number of on-track battles this season in Bahrain, Spain, Monaco, and notably Belgium where Rosberg collided with Hamilton. Despite the circumstances heading into the closing trio of races in the United States, Brazil and Abu Dhabi, Hamilton said: 'It doesn't change anything. The same rules apply. 'We are both racing as hard as we can, we are allowed to race as hard as we can, and we still want to get maximum points for the team.' Rosberg concurred as he said: 'Up until now it's always been we can fight, and it continues to be like that.

"Andy Murray survived a test of his credentials to see off South Africa's Kevin Anderson in three sets and secure a place in the semi-finals of the Valencia Open. The world number 10, chasing his second title in the Spanish city, had endured few problems in earlier wins over Jurgen Melzer and Fabio Fognini but found seventh-seed Anderson a different prospect. Murray lost the opening set on a tie-break, but fought back bravely to claim a 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-4 victory which kept the players on court for two hours and 43 minutes. Andy Murray beat Kevin Anderson to make it through to the Valencia Open semi-finals . Murray is in eighth position for qualification to the ATP World Tour finals in London next month . 7. Tomas Berdych (CZE) - 4,105pts . 8. Andy Murray (GBR) - 3,975 . ---------------- . 9. David Ferrer (ESP) - 3,865 . 10. Milos Raonic (CAN) -  3,840 . *Standings on Friday October 22 . The slog may yet take its toll on third-seed Murray, but his progression to the semi-finals at least bodes well for his hopes of qualifying for next month's ATP Tour Finals for the seventh year in a row. The pair exchanged breaks early in the match before Anderson gained the upper hand in game seven with a winning cross-court forehand. The advantage did not last long, though, as a double fault saw the Scot break right back, with a tie-break eventually needed to decide the opening set. And it was Anderson who seized the initiative, moving 6-3 ahead and then wrapping things up with a simple lob at the net. Playing in his fifth successive tournament, tiredness appeared to be creeping up on Murray, who at times looked heavy in his legs and reluctant to move around the court. South African Anderson won the first set but couldn't stop Murray battling back to win in three . Murray looked tired at times during the quarter-final clash as he took part in his fifth tournament in a row . The pair traded breaks once more midway through the second set but it was Murray who then gave himself a chance to edge ahead with three break points in game nine. This time the third seed did not pass up the opportunity and produced a winner down the line to take a 5-4 lead, before serving out the set to usher in a decider. That break seemed to be the energy-booster Murray needed, and he broke again at the start of the third set with a delightful lob which Anderson was unable to return. The South African dug deep to get back on level terms but to no avail, and it was eventually left to Murray to serve out the match. Unsurprisingly he did it the hard way, wasting three match points, but finally came good on the fourth thanks to Anderson's exhausted-looking forehand into the net. David Ferrer waves to the crowd after beating Thomaz Bellucci in the quarter-finals in Valencia on Friday . Murray's last-four opponent will be a most familiar foe, with Spain's David Ferrer blocking his route to the final. It will be a third clash in three weeks between the pair, with each man having one win so far in their October series. Ferrer ousted Murray in the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters a fortnight ago, but the Scot took revenge by beating the world number five to take the Vienna title last Sunday. The top seed in Valencia, Ferrer sprinted to a 6-1, 6-2 quarter-final victory on Friday against Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci.","Murray fights back from set down to win 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 against Anderson .

"Alarm bells will be ringing around the Football Association after it was revealed the number of homegrown players plying their trade in the Premier League continues to dwindle. Just 13.9 per cent of top flight professionals to have taken part this season hailed from their current club, in a study by CIES Football Observatory. The startling figures serve as a hammer blow to FA chairman Greg Dyke, who has used his position to champion the cause of promoting young players. Everton's Ross Barkley is one of the Premier League's 13.9 per cent homegrown players this season . Gary Cahill doesn't register as homegrown in CIES' study as he wasn't at Chelsea between the ages of 15-21 . CIES follow UEFA's terminology when measuring homegrown statistics, meaning players are only valid if they have trained with the club between the ages of 15 and 21. The likes of West Ham's Stewart Downing, Aston Villa's Tom Cleverley and Chelsea's Gary Cahill do not count. Dyke set up a commission to identify the reasons why fewer English players are being given chances in the country’s top division. Only Italy's Serie A has a worse record of sides bringing through their own talent in the top five leagues in Europe. It is a hammer blow to FA chairman Greg Dyke, who has set up a commission to address the issue . England's shunning of homegrown talent is nothing new – they have long since been behind Spain and France in that regard – but the record low points to an intensifying problem. The German Bundesliga remains ahead of the Premier League with 16.4 per cent of homegrown players, while Ligue 1 leads the way with 24.6 per cent. Raffaele Poli, head of the CIES Football Observatory, told the Guardian: ‘The low percentage of club-trained players in England confirms that if clubs have the money to buy talent they tend to be reluctant to give a chance to youth academy players. ‘So the question is: why are clubs signing the best prospects, if they know they will not play?’","Only Serie A has a worse number of homegrown players .

"The woman who died after her ambulance was delayed due to the road closures enacted by New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s political allies was a mother-of-two who moved to America from Italy for a better life, it emerged today. Florence Genova had a heart attack at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey, on September 9 last year but her ambulance took seven minutes to get there because of the gridlock. Her family today said they don't believe that her death was due to the delayed emergency response caused by the George Washington Bridge lane closures ordered by Chris Christie's aides. Mrs Genova's daughter Vilma Oleri, 57, told the New York Times: 'I honestly believe it was just her time. 'We want to stay out of it. It’s not political.' Trouble in Trenton: The traffic chaos in which Mrs Genova died was caused by Gov. Christie's aides as an act of political revenge . Home for decades: Florence Genova's home in Fort Lee, New Jersey where paramedics struggled to reach her in the 'Bridgegate' traffic . Outraged: Some of Mrs Genova's neighbors spoke out against Christie. Pictured are Gus Jentile, left, and Vlado Stosic, right . Bottleneck: The ambulance took nine minutes to reach Mrs Genova as traffic backed up to cross the double-deck George Washington Bridge which spans the Hudson river between New York City and Fort Lee, New Jersey . But angry friends neighbors have have expressed their outrage that her care may have been compromised . in any way for what appears to have been an act of revenge on one of . Christie’s political opponents. The . 91-year-old was taken to the nearby Englewood Hospital where she died . later that day. It is not clear if the delay in the ambulance arriving . contributed to the death of Mrs Genova, a widow whose husband died five . years ago. Neighbours . of Mrs Genova told MailOnline they were appalled that her ambulance was . delayed by the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. They said they were shocked and disappointed if it emerged that Christie had anything to do with it.Gus Jentile, who lived next door to her for 56 years, said: 'I can't believe that a guy of that stature would stoop so low. 'I looked up to that guy as a politician.' Mr Jentile, whose kids grew up with Mrs Genova, said: 'Politics is a dirty game but it shouldn't cost lives'. Neighbor of 18-years, Vlador Stosic, 68, said that Mrs Genova was simply an old lady who kept herself very quiet. He . revealed she had lived alone for five years by the time of her death - . her husband dying outside their own home in Fort Lee, New Jersey after . falling and hitting his head on the ice. 'She would sit on the porch in the summer,' he said. 'Her children would visit every so often and she would never have other visitors' Mrs Genova is understood to have . grown up in Mongardino, a small town in Italy 30 miles outside of Turin . and moved to the US in the 1960s. She and her husband settled in Fort Lee which has a strong Italian American community. Neighbours said they built their own home as they made their new life in America. Her children have now moved away. Vlado . Stosic, who lives next door, told the New Jersey Star Telegram said . that Mrs Genova was found by a home health aide and that she had fallen . in her bedroom. Mrs Genova was unconscious so the aide called for an ambulance. Another neighbour, Dina Mirkovich, said Mrs Genova was ‘a very quiet lady’. She said: ‘My mother was friends with her. They spoke Italian to each other.’ ‘She built that house probably. The original old time people from this neighborhood, they all stay. The children move away.’ They should lose their jobs: Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, who refused to support Christie has called the closure a 'heinous act' Mrs . Genova was among four medical incidents which Fort Lee borough EMS head . Paul Favia said were affected by the road closures, which were put in . place over four days to spite the local mayor . Mark Sokolich for not backing Christie in his last election. The . others included a traffic accident with four people involved which . should have taken four minutes to get to, but instead took between seven . and nine minutes. In a . letter to Mayor Sokolich, Mr Favia said that in relation to Mrs Genova . ‘paramedics were delayed due to heavy traffic on Fort Lee Road and had . to meet the ambulance en-route to the hospital instead of on the scene’. Fort Lee police also revealed that the search for a missing four-year-old boy was hampered by the gridlock. Ila . Kasofsky, a Fort Lee councilwoman, told Mother Jones that one resident . was unable to cross the George Washington Bridge to be with her husband . during a major surgery. One woman was unable to pick up her son after his dialysis as well. The . governor's chances of a presidential run are now threatened following . the release of emails proving members of his staff blocked lanes on the . bridge back in September because the mayor of Fort Lee refused to . endorse Christie's re-election campaign. 'Is . it wrong that I am smiling,' former Port Authority official David . Wildstein said in a text message after successfully reverting three . lanes of traffic to one. Mayor Sokolich broke his silence in an interview Wednesday on CNN in which he called the lane closures  a 'heinous act' and that the officials who did it 'intentionally put people in harms way'. Axed: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie walks with his Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly (right) who he fired for lying to him about authorizing the lane closures . Payback: Kelly (left) lied to her boss and said she had not caused the closures, according to Christie . When the lane closures first . happened, Mayor Sokolich was told that it was because he wouldn't . endorse Christie but he refused to believe that. 'Right . from the beginning, people were saying it was about me and a failure to . endorse. I always dismissed it as not being important enough. I mean, . who would possibly reduce themselves to closing lanes to the busiest . bridge in the world, putting my town in harm's way?' Now . that the emails and text messages prove it was aimed at him, he says . he's glad he didn't endorse the incumbent Republican governor. 'No one should have to do anything like that or provide any sort of support under threat of retribution,' he said. Meanwhile, Governor Christie has been working to distance himself from Bridge-gate, pinning the blame on members of his staff. He has fired his Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and barred former campaign manager  Bill Stepien from working with the local Republican party. 'What . I've seen today for the first time is unacceptable,' Christie said. 'I . am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was I misled by a . member of my staff, but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned . conduct was made without my knowledge.' Shocking . emails revealed Christie's aides punished Mayor Mark Sokolich for . refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter traffic entering his . town's on-ramp to New York City's busy George Washington Bridge. Emails and instant messages between . Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and two appointees at . the Port Authority revealed a calculated effort to retaliate against . Sokolich by closing off lanes leading to the bridge. 'Time . for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the . event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive . political payback. 'Got it,' responded David Wildstein, a Christie ally who served as a Port Authority official until his resignation – unrelated to the bridge mini-scandal, the Christie administration has insisted – in early December. The Christie administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study supervised by Wildstein. Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to a Port Authority official on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . But the trove of emails and other . messages, obtained by several news outlets on Wednesday, show that the . governor's appointees reveled in their accomplishment and later . expressed shock when Port Authority officials in New York restored the . Fort Lee traffic. 'The New York side gave Fort Lee back all three lanes this morning. We are appropriately going nuts', Wildstein wrote to Kelly. 'What??' she responded in an email. 'Yes, unreal. Fixed now,' Wildstein responded. After . Mayor Sokolich complained to the Port Authority that the traffic jam . was keeping children from reaching schools on their bus routes, . Wildstein asked in an instant message, 'Is it wrong that I am smiling,' Texts between two Christie aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused, including a swipe at children of voters who supported Christie's gubernatorial candidate, Barbara Buono . 'No,' came the reply from the recipient. 'I feel badly about the kids ... I guess,' wrote Wildstein. 'They are children of Buono voters,' his unidentified texting partner answered. Barbara Buono was the Democrats' failed gubernatorial candidate who garnered Sokolich's endorsement. She told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the flap represented 'a clear abuse of power. This is what is being inflicted on the people of New Jersey.' Christie . won the support of several prominent Democratic politicians in his . state, in an effort to demonstrate his ability to build bipartisan . support and reach across the political aisle. That quality, a Republican strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday, 'will be critical if Christie has any chance at winning the presidency as a Republican in 2016.'","Florence Genova died after ambulance took seven minutes to reach her in traffic caused by Christie allies .

"Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson confirmed the club have launched disciplinary proceedings against players Paul Paton and Mark Wilson — as enquiries continue into an alleged assault on Celtic goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska. The pair have been axed from the squad to face Inverness on Saturday — and part of the club’s investigation will focus on whether they broke United’s code of conduct by being out 24 hours before an Under-20s fixture in which over-age players can feature. Zaluska, 32, was involved in an altercation in Glasgow’s Ashton Lane in the early hours of Monday morning after which he required hospital treatment. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara said Mark Wilson (right) and Paul Paton are under investigation . Goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska, sporting a black eye, is put through his paces in training earlier this week . The keeper was pictured with a woolly hat over his wounded eye ahead of Thursday's match with Astra Giurgiu . On Wednesday, United announced they were launching an internal probe into the conduct of two of their players ‘following information received by the club’. They revealed that neither player would be travelling with the squad to the Highlands. The pair did not attend training and will not return until disciplinary proceedings are completed next week. Thompson said Paton, 27, and Wilson, 30, would receive a fair hearing but insisted the reputation of the Tannadice club was paramount. ‘We’ve opened disciplinary proceedings against two players and will conduct the matter in private,’ he said. ‘We will sit down with the individuals concerned and ask them their version of events and decide if there’s been a breach of the club’s rules or employment law. ‘Who would be a football chairman? It’s part and parcel (of football) but it’s not funny and it will be dealt with privately. ‘We expect to hold them (disciplinary proceedings) at the start of next week and go from there. ‘I won’t prejudge anything but I take everything seriously at the club. The image of the club is very important, how supporters look at things and young kids, too. They look up to people in football and that’s very important. ‘I am not actually involved in the process because I am the final course of appeal. But everyone will get a fair hearing.’ Celtic boss Ronny Deila has cleared  Zaluska of all blame after he was allegedly assaulted in the street . Speaking earlier, manager Jackie McNamara said: ‘I think it’s best to keep them out of the limelight, with the attention surrounding it. We’re doing an internal investigation that will not be done by me, it’ll be by the club. It’s more of a disruption if they’re here at the moment. ‘My focus is Saturday because to me that’s what we’re here for, to play games of football. ‘We’ll try to focus the best we can. It will take as long as it takes. It’s outwith my hands — the club is dealing with it.’ Asked directly if the investigation was related to Zaluska, McNamara added: ‘I don’t want to comment on that. We’ve put a statement out and everything will come out in due course.’ Celtic goalkeepers  Zaluska (left) and Craig Gordon keep warm during a brisk training session earlier this week . Wilson issued a statement on Wednesday admitting he had tried to ‘calm a matter down’ involving the Pole. A spokesman for the former Scotland defender said: ‘There has been a lot of publicity surrounding events on Sunday night in Ashton Lane. Mark Wilson would like to clarify matters regarding himself. ‘Mark was out for a meal with his wife and some other couples. On his way home with his wife, they came across his friend and former team-mate Lukasz Zaluska. Mark tried to calm a matter down and latterly to help Lukasz as he was in a distressed situation.’ An SFA spokesman said the incident was currently a matter for the police and there will be no governing body investigation or disciplinary proceedings at this stage.

"The surroundings may be different, but the goal is the same for Ndamukong Suh. The Detroit Lions defensive tackle wants the team to continue their strong start to the season and move to 6-2 with victory over the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley on Saturday. Detroit landed in London on the back of a 24-23 win over the New Orleans Saints and atop a competitive NFC North ahead of the Green Bay Packers. 'It has been a tough first half of the season so far,' Suh told Sportsmail. 'Our goal at this moment is to go to 6-2, go into our bye week, rest up and come back out stronger.' The Lions have made a seamless transition from former head coach Jim Schwartz to Jim Caldwell and find themselves well placed for a run at the post-season. Ndamukong Suh (left) wants the Detroit Lions to continue their strong start to the season this weekend . Suh at an event at NikeTown in Oxford Circus . But last season, Detroit were similarly well placed. They entered their bye week at 5-3 and followed up with a narrow win at the Chicago Bears to strengthen their hold on the division. A 40-10 Thanksgiving day thrashing of Green Bay had the Lions in control of the NFC North, but that was their only win in their last seven games. Detroit finished 7-9 with four straight defeats and third behind the Packers and Bears. 'The switch from coach Schwartz to coach Caldwell has been good,' Suh said. 'Coach Caldwell is very transparent and understands what he needs from you as a player and a very open communicator. 'He is a guy I have grown to like as I have got to know him more and more and is good for Detroit. 'It was tough last year to see that all unfold the way it did. There were a lot of things we know we could have done better. Unfortunately that's the way the ball fell and we were outside the playoffs and couldn't find a way to get in. 'It is something that I have personally forgotten and moved past. This is a new season and we are off to a fairly decent start and hope to finish the first half on a really good note. 'It's always best to learn from your own mistakes and not let them repeat themselves. A lot of guys who were there last year and took part in that will understand that if it starts to creep up again we will find a way to combat it.' Suh pictured arriving at Gatwick Airport as the Lions touched down in England on Tuesday morning . Suh (centre) joined Atlanta's Steven Jackson (left) and Joey Barton (right) on stage for the NikeTown event . Suh is into his fifth season in the NFL and part of a fearsome Lions defense - the best in the league after seven weeks. The defensive tackle seems to have moved on from his disciplinary problems (he was fined three times in three months last season) with attention now on his performances. 'I don't think the fines and the negative connotations have held me back from developing,' he said. 'I think just from an imagery standpoint, people understanding who I am is overshadowed. 'But that's just the way the world works – negativity sells. I don't really worry about it. I understand who I am as a person and have a strong group behind me. Day in and day out they take care of me. I have been fortunate this year, playing at a high level and just flying under the radar. Detroit wide receiver Calvin 'Megatron' Johnson arrives in England, but is still an injury doubt for the game . 'Over the last four or five years I have developed the skills to put me up there among the best defensive tackles in the league right now. I think there's a lot of room for improvement each and every year. 'As a young pro becoming a veteran I think I'm on my way to doing pretty well but still have room for growth.' Ndamukong Suh, Steven Jackson and Joey Barton were at NikeTown London as part of the 'Suit up for Sunday' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 NFL International Series game.

"Hunting for the ideal home in the perfect location that has handy local amenities is not a modern concept. Prehistoric humans living up to 500,000 years ago chose their home with great care and security and nutritional concerns were top of their list when searching for a new place to live, archaeologists said. Homo heidelbergensis mostly chose to live on islands in flood plains which were abundant in foods containing nutrients vital for a balanced diet, according to researchers. The grass growing in flood plains would have attracted large herbivores such as horses, deer, rhino and beavers, which Stone Age man ate for protein and fat . Archaeologists from Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Southampton studied 25 sites in southern England and northern France where human ancestors lived between 500,000 and 100,000 years ago. The sites include Dunbridge in Hampshire, Swanscombe near Dartford and the Somme Valley in France where concentrations of hand axes have been found, indicating they were regularly used by early hominins. The study, published in journal PLOS One, is the first to look at the location preferences of early humans and the results surprised archaeologists. They found our ancestors were picky about where they chose to live and preferred a specific location - on islands in the flood plains of large rivers - while they avoided estuaries, hills and forests. Archaeologists from Queen's University Belfast and the University of Southampton studied 25 sites in southern England and northern France where Stone Age man lived between 500,000 and 100,000 years ago, including Dunbridge in Hampshire and the Somme Valley in France where hand axes have been found . Professor Tony Brown, a physical geographer at the University of Southampton who led the project, said: ‘Our research suggests that floodplain zones closer to the mouth of a river provided the ideal place for hominin activity, rather than forested slopes, plateaus or estuaries. 'The landscape in these locations tended to be richer in the nutrients critical for maintaining population health and maximising reproductive success.’ Experts believe early humans sought out flood plains because they suited their diet, which largely consisted of protein. Professor Brown and his colleagues then compiled a database of plants and animals known to exist in the Pleistocene epoch (a period between two-and-a half million to 11,700 years ago) to establish a potential list of nutrient resources in the landscape and an estimation of the possible diet. This showed that an abundance of nutritious foods were available and suggests this was likely to have been the dominant factor driving early humans to focus on these sites in the lower reaches of river valleys, close to the upper tidal limit of rivers. Over 50 nutrients are needed to sustain human life, including sources of protein, fats, carbohydrates, folic acid and vitamin C. Scientists found our ancestors preferred a specific location - on islands in the flood plains of large rivers instead of on hills and in forests -  which provided all the major components of their diet. Here, a diagram shows how flood plains offered a diet of plants for carbohydrates and vitamins, meat for protein and birds eggs . The grass growing in flood plains would have attracted large herbivores such as horses, deer, rhino and beavers, which Stone Age man ate for protein and fat. Neanderthals were not brustish or messy cavemen, but kept organised and tidy homes, according to new research. Archaeologists from the University of Colorado, Denver, discovered an ancient cave shelter which shows they thoughtfully arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising. Dr Julien Riel-Salvatore, said: 'There has been this idea that Neanderthals did not have an organised use of space, something that has always been attributed to humans. 'But we found that Neanderthals did not just throw their stuff everywhere but in fact were organised and purposeful when it came to domestic space.' A collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy was divided into three levels for different activities. The top level, containing animal remains, seems to have been reserved for butchering animals, while the middle was for sleeping and tool production took place at the mouth of the cave. The researchers suggest vitamins and protein may have come from sources such as raw liver, the eggs of water birds, fish and plants, including watercress, which grows year round and is rich in folic acid, that is important for child rearing. Fats in particular, may have come from bone marrow, beaver tails and highly nutritious eels, they said. The nutritional diversity of these sites allowed hominins to colonise the Atlantic fringe of north west Europe during warm periods of the Pleistocene and permitted the repeated occupation of this marginal area from warmer climate zones further south. Professor Brown told The Independent: ‘Looking at the nutritional resources available to these populations, we think that they would not have suffered from much heart disease, cancer or most viral diseases.’ The scientists also said raw materials for making tools and fires were readily available in flood plains. Flint used for making hand axes and scrapers could be found among river gravel, while archaeologists believe Stone Age man would have used reeds to make tools too, despite the fact that no evidence has been found. The scientists also said raw materials for making tools and fires were readily available in flood plains. Flint used for making hand axes (pictured) and scrapers could be found among river gravel . Our ancestors could also have found wood from beaver dams and also fashioned warm clothing from the animals’ fur. Professor Brown said: 'We can speculate that these types of locations were seen as ""healthy"" or ""good"" places to live, which hominins revisited on a regular basis. 'If this is the case, the sites may have provided ""nodal points"" or base camps along nutrient-rich route ways through the Palaeolithic landscape, allowing early humans to explore northwards to more challenging environments,’ he added. While it seems the flood plains provided the ideal environment for Stone Age man to thrive, they were dangerous as so many large herbivores also attracted big cats and hyena. Consequently, Homo heidelbergensis, was especially choosy about which parts of a flood plain he called home and chose the islands as put off many big cats who did not like swimming. Because of the ancient population’s healthy diet, Dr. Laura Basell of Queen’s University, Belfast, who is the project’s lead archaeologist said: ‘We think that most of them would probably have ultimately died as a result of hunting accidents, extreme weather conditions and consequent food shortages, and as a result of predation by big cats or by other humans.'","Archaeologists from Queen's University Belfast and the University of Southampton found Homo heidelbergensis chose to live on islands .

"Lord Ouseley, the country’s leading  anti-discrimination campaigner, has slammed the FA for attempting to sweep the scandal of David Elleray’s racist comment under the Wembley carpet. The FA announced their case closed against former top referee Elleray after an internal probe, just as Sports Agenda revealed the retired Harrow School housemaster had racially abused FA employee Robert McCarthy, a referee coaching manager, during a summit at St George’s Park. Elleray, 59, who sits on FA, UEFA and FIFA referee committees, has been slapped on the wrist for breaching the FA Council code of conduct and told to have diversity and equality training.

Race row: David Elleray (left) was heard making the offensive remarks at a referees' meeting . Ouseley believes Elleray should resign his football positions after his wholly unacceptable remark to McCarthy: ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine.’ Ouseley, highly-respected chairman of Kick It Out, said: ‘It beggars belief the way the FA have tried to close this issue down before anyone has even  found out about it. There is a real problem here in how the FA operates. ‘The process should be clear and transparent and it’s not. It beggars belief how the FA believe their campaign to fight racism can ever be trusted or taken seriously if Elleray is allowed to get away with making a proven racist comment and remain in office. 'It would show far greater leadership and responsibility if he relinquishes his roles in football, admitting his mistake. Investigation: The FA said that no official complaint was made about the incident . ‘Elleray is a highly intelligent man, so what’s the point of him having training at his age. It’s just a load of nonsense and this is the same FA who took the high moral ground over Richard Scudamore’s sexism email exchanges at the  Premier League. 'Such blatant racism by a senior high-profile figure can’t just be conveniently  forgotten by the FA, it doesn’t add up.’ The FA say Elleray has apologised unreservedly, there was no official complaint and a thorough investigation took place. Sue Barker, highly-rated at the Beeb for her stellar presenting role at Wimbledon, has been offered a new three-year deal to keep anchoring the corporation’s flagship sports event and A Question of Sport.

"Wales international prop Paul James will rejoin the Ospreys next season from Aviva Premiership club Bath. The Ospreys have confirmed a two-year deal for James, who left the Welsh region for Bath in 2012. James, 32, has won 55 caps and is part of the Wales squad for next month's Tests against Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and South Africa. Wales international Paul James will rejoin the Ospreys from Aviva Premiership club Bath on a two-year deal . James made 180 appearances for the Ospreys during a nine-year stint with them before moving to the west country. And the Ospreys' swoop bucks a recent trend of top players heading out of Wales. Ten member of Wales coach Warren Gatland's current squad play their club rugby in either England or France. 'A lot has changed at the Ospreys since I was last part of the set-up, but the team has started the season well and has impressed me,' James said. James revealed he is impressed with the current Ospreys set-up and admits much has changed at the club . 'It's obvious that there is a bigger picture that everybody is working towards, and that's important. 'There are some really exciting front-row players coming through the system who I am looking forward to working with, and while I can give them my experience, playing and training alongside them will also help me as well. 'I've had a great few years at Bath. I have really settled in well and the club has been great to me, so I want to finish on a high there this season before I head home for the next chapter.' Ospreys chief executive Andrew Hore added: 'Although circumstances dictated that we have lost players over the last few years that we didn't want to release, we have always clearly said that when the business was on a more stable footing we would look to bring selected personnel back to the region, and this is exactly what we have done with Paul. Prop James has made over 55 appearances for Wales after making his debut back in 2003 . 'Now that the Rugby Services Agreement (with the Welsh Rugby Union) has been finalised and we have the additional finances that come with the new European Rugby Champions Cup, enabling us to bring Paul back next season, the next challenge is to look to secure the future of the young players that we have here at the region.' James will be a loss to Bath, having established himself as part of an impressive front-row alongside England internationals Rob Webber and David Wilson. 'Paul has been an outstanding competitor for the club since his arrival,' Bath head coach Mike Ford said. 'He is a great leader, a guy who turns up to training with the right attitude every day and gives you everything he's got on match-day.

"The Premier League says referees chief Mike Riley will contact Swansea manager Garry Monk this week but insist that a letter and DVD from the Welsh club only arrived at its offices earlier on Monday.

'The correspondence from Swansea was received by PGMOL on Monday morning and Mike will no doubt be speaking to Garry this week,' the spokesman said. Football Association disciplinary officials are understood to be studying Monk's comments about the referee to see if the Swansea manager should face any action. Monk had said about Riley: 'I have sent a DVD off with a letter, expressing my disappointment and I've had no contact from Mike Riley. 'I think it is about being pro-active and he is clearly not doing that - he is clearly not listening to anything I am saying. '(Riley's) job is to ring me - it's not mine to ring him.

"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has given special dispensation to Caterham to miss the next two grands prix whilst a buyer is sought for the cash-strapped marque. A statement issued by the administrators in London-based accountancy firm Smith & Williamson has effectively confirmed Caterham will not be in a position to compete in next weekend's United States Grand Prix and the subsequent race a week later in Brazil. Administrator Finbarr O'Connell, who was forced to close the gates to the team's factory at Leafield on Thursday, has told Caterham staff not to return until a deal has been concluded. Caterham are in danger of going out of business after a four-year stay on the Formula One grid . Hope has been expressed that a buyer of 'substantial financial means' can quickly be found in order for Caterham to be back on the grid for the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi on November 21-23. Ordinarily, should a team miss a race for any reason they would be punished by Ecclestone, but given the circumstances in this case he has opted to be lenient. The statement read: 'In a telephone conversation today between Finbarr O'Connell and Bernie Ecclestone, Mr Ecclestone agreed to support the administrators in their wish to sell the Formula One team to a party with the financial strength to sustain it into the future. 'Mr Ecclestone also agreed to give dispensation to Caterham F1 such that it could, if necessary, miss the US and Brazilian Grands Prix, but hoped that a new owner would be in a position to race the team at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Formula One supremo Bernie Eccelstone (left, pictured talking to Paul Hembery, the Pirelli Motorsport Director) has given Caterham special dispensation not to field cars in the next two races . 'Mr Colin Kolles, the previous principal of the team, offered today to hand over management control of 1MRT to the administrators. 'Lawyers for the administrators and Mr Kolles are currently working on the paperwork to effect this transfer. 'The administrators have already been contacted by a number of interested parties expressing a wish to buy the team and they hope a transaction with an operator of substantial financial means can be concluded in the next few weeks. 'It is hoped that any purchaser of the F1 team will take over the employees and they will be able to recommence their work including that at the Leafield site.' Earlier on Friday Smith & Williamson were handed full management responsibility for Caterham. Caterham in action during practice at the Grand Prix in Japan in October . The firm had already been working on behalf of the creditors of Caterham Sports Ltd (CSL), a company which makes and supplies cars to 1MRT, the entity which owns the licence to race in Formula One. But O'Connell has also now been placed in charge of 1MRT, with his overwhelming priority to find a buyer for the beleaguered marque. The Smith & Williamson statement confirmed they had agreed terms to acquire the share capital of 1MRT, affording them the ability to sell the team lock, stock and barrel, rather than simply acting for CSL. Any buyer will acquire the Formula One licence, the cars, designs and intellectual property for current and future seasons, the workforce and all of the technical support provided to the racing team by CSL from the Leafield Technical Centre. Henry Shinners, another administrator at Smith & Williamson, said: 'Purchasing the assets would give the buyer ready access to F1 racing.' Tony Fernandes relinquished control of Caterham to the consortium at the end of June this year . O'Connell, meanwhile, added: 'We believe this arrangement gives us a much better chance of being able to reach a better conclusion for the racing team and its creditors. 'While this is a great step forward in making the whole team and assets more attractive, there is no need for the staff of 1MRT to return to the Oxford site in Leafield until a sale of the Formula One team occurs. 'This is a difficult situation which is not of our making. We regret any personal impact on 1MRT's employees. 'As administrators for CSL we are seeking to maximise the outcome for its creditors and other stakeholders.' O'Connell has firm belief a deal with an interested party can be struck, adding: 'Our objective is to get this team racing on a proper financial standing, and hopefully if a funder comes through, this team can run again. 'I have spoken to people who are interested in taking over the Leafield factory, and the staff being employed there. 'It's early days, but there is a major hope that all of that can happen.' The administrator overseeing the crisis had feared Catherham would not compete at the US grand prix .","Caterham are strapped for cash and are seeking a buyer at present .

"Furious Swansea boss Garry Monk accused Stoke winger Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver of cheating his team after a controversial penalty decision at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday. Monk, who now faces an FA disciplinary charge, called for Moses to be punished for diving. The Swansea boss added that if he had ‘dived’ in that manner he would have been too ashamed to face his own family. But when Moses tumbled in the penalty area shortly before the break Oliver was convinced and awarded his second spot-kick of the match.

He’s cheated the ref and then the ref’s cheated us. ‘It’s one of the most blatant dives you’ll ever see. You go and watch a million games and you won’t see more of a dive than that. He should be ashamed of himself. I wouldn’t be able to go home to my family and show my face. This is how I live my life. They can do what they want, but for me it’s a disgrace. ‘There was absolute minimal contact with Rangel. (Moses) has thrown himself to the floor. It is more laughable every time I watch it. It’s very hard to take when it’s so blatant and you see him being rewarded for it. ‘Anyone who simulates in training (at Swansea) is fined. I wouldn’t have it. If my player did that he wouldn’t play in the next game. The referee has taken the easy option to give the penalty. It’s a massive game-changing moment, and a disgusting decision. He’s the only guy in the whole stadium that thought that was a clear-cut penalty. I looked straight at their bench and even they couldn’t believe he’d given it. That tells you everything.’ Monk also hit out at referees’ chief Mike Riley for failing to respond to his concerns over decisions he feels have gone against Swansea this season. He said that the club had already gone over Riley’s head before yesterday’s game by sending a letter and DVD of some of the incidents to John Williams, chairman of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, last week. ‘I haven’t had anything back from Mike Riley which is astonishing to me and poor leadership,’ he added.

He’s supposed to be the head of these guys. ‘We’ve sent off a DVD with a letter, (expressing) my disappointment at no contact from Mike Riley. I think it’s about being proactive, but he’s clearly not proactive, so I have to go above him and hopefully that will send the right message and I can get the right answers.’ Stoke manager Mark Hughes was quick to defend Moses and said that Monk, the Premier League’s youngest manager at 35, had showed a lack of experience with his outburst. ‘It’s a situation that he needs to learn from,’ said Hughes. ‘He is disappointed but the longer you’re in this game, the more experience you get and sometimes you have to curb what you really feel. ‘There was no need for that from my point of view. I don’t think he (Moses) dived. I think he felt contact. He was running at pace between two defenders and the onus is on the defender not to go anywhere near him. ‘From the angle I’ve seen, there’s a definite movement from Rangel to put his arm across Victor and knock him off his stride. It’s a soft one and you can argue about it as much as you like. He gave it and that’s the end of it.’ While Monk claimed that Shawcross dragging Bony to the ground was a clear penalty, Hughes is concerned that his captain’s reputation counted against him. ‘For whatever reason, people are trying to highlight Ryan over most defenders in terms of him being more adept at holding people in the box, which is pure nonsense,’ said Hughes. ‘Maybe the referee had seen a bit of the media coverage. Every time there’s a corner against us the cameras go straight to Ryan. The referee will have done his pre-match work and maybe it’s been highlighted to him.’ Amid the controversy, Walters’ winner was almost forgotten after he headed in a cross from Oussama Assaidi, another Stoke substitute. Victory lifted Stoke up to 10th place, level on points with Swansea. So what did Walters make of it all? ‘I think because he gave the first one, he’s given the second one,’ he said with a smile.

"Only recently have I apologised properly to the next-door neighbours in Harlow where I grew up. Hour after hour I would be outside, hitting a football against a wall which adjoined their house. Winter or summer, I would be outside from the age of six, kicking the ball. My mum passed away in May and at her funeral I met those neighbours again and we had a chuckle about what they had to put up with. There were also some garages around the corner, with brick columns in between, and I would try to make sure I passed the ball on to the columns. It was just hours and hours of passing, left foot, right foot, whatever the weather. Glenn Hoddle, pictured at the 1981 FA Cup final, says his childhood really helped him define his skills . Hoddle insists 'whatever technique I ended up having as a professional was honed in those childhood hours' The reforms for grassroots football reminded the former England manager of those hours of practising . Sometimes I would use a smaller ball, to make it more difficult. I would even challenge myself to juggle a marble, to see how well I could do it. I am convinced that whatever technique I ended up having as a professional was honed in those childhood hours practising, manipulating the ball. Eventually, the ball almost becomes a part of your body and you are in total control of it. I was reminded of those evenings last week, when the Football Association Commission, of which I am a member, announced their reforms for grassroots football. The key points were that the FA are aiming to build 1,000 3G artificial pitches by 2020, with 150 football hubs around the country identified as areas that will benefit from them. And we will increase the number of qualified Level Three coaches — that is the level just below the UEFA badges — from 800 to 3,000. The England team against San Marino included young players but Hoddle hopes more will filter through now . These days it is much more difficult for kids to practise on the street like I did. But what we have to do is create environments where young people can get the same kind of advantages that I had practising against the garage doors in Harlow. Most importantly, we need to create a structure and facilities where control of the football is everything. When I played the game, I always loved to manipulate the ball. The game is football. It is not headball, nor chaseball or runball. If you can master control of the ball at a young age, you have a hell of chance to be a good player. But in England at times we have struggled with technique. It is a problem I have thought about for years as a player and then as England manager. There is no doubt control of the ball has held us back. Time after time, we talk about our inability to keep possession or about the superior techniques of foreign players. But there is nothing inherently superior about foreigners. And the climate isn’t hugely different in Holland and Germany. What is different are the coaching and the facilities. Perhaps some people may not appreciate just how revolutionary the installation of a 3G pitch can be. For decades we’ve tried to get by on poorly-maintained grass pitches. In the winter they can be mud heaps and out of use for weeks on end. The likes of Jack Wilshere (left) and Calum Chambers (right) are rare cases of English players in the top flight . Raheem Sterling has broken into the Liverpool and England first teams over the past two impressive seasons . On these new pitches, you can play time and time again without damage, meaning they can be used all day and night. And the run of the ball is that much smoother, so control of it becomes imperative. Sometimes, on some pitches that youngsters currently use, kick and run is the only way to play. I went to watch my eight-year-old nephew play the other week. When we turned up, the grass was so long it made the game ridiculous. The ball would not roll properly. It didn’t matter how skilful you were. It wouldn’t have made any difference because you couldn’t show it on a pitch like that. I have always been impressed with how they restructured youth football in Japan to produce a generation of technical players. They insist that, until the age of eight, football is about playing with the ball, manipulating it, in one-v-one situations. They don’t play matches. And when they do play games, at a later age, it is on smaller pitches with proportionate goals. The FA have already made great strides in this area, now insisting on small-sided games and smaller goals for youth football. I would maybe take it even further. I don’t think you need to be on the bigger pitches until you’re 16. That way, we develop skill rather than physique. Greg Dyke is hopeful that the new plans can boost grassroots football and help develop new England stars . Don’t get me wrong. Physical strength and stamina are part of the game. But they can be added later, when children have grown up. The rudiments of mastering a football are what cannot be grafted on to an adult. Decision-making and tactical awareness can also be taught by the qualified coaches. Mums and dads and volunteers do a great job sustaining our grassroots but there comes a time when professional input is required. In the past, it seems that the FA have dealt with our failures by sacking managers. Since FA chairman Greg Dyke initiated his Commission last year, we are now at least addressing some of the root causes. Football skills are built at a young age. The problems of English football will never be solved from the top down. It is from the grassroots upwards that we will begin to see a change in how we play the game. That takes time. Results do not come in eight months but rather over eight years. It does not necessarily grab headlines. But, believe me, there is more substance in the action taken this week than in all the many dismissals of England managers over the last 40 years.","Greg Dyke launched a second report for England Commission this week .

"Stoke City have intensified their row with Garry Monk by complaining to the FA about the Swansea manager's 'cheat' against Victor Moses. The FA are already investigating Monk's criticism of referee Michael Oliver, who awarded Moses a soft penalty in Stoke's 2-1 win on Saturday. Monk branded the decision 'disgraceful' and 'disgusting', while he also said Moses should be 'ashamed of himself' – comments that enraged Stoke chairman Peter Coates, who has also reported pundit John Hartson to the BBC over his claim on Match of the Day 2 that Moses dived. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Garry Monk give his views on Michael Oliver's performance . Garry Monk branded the decision to award Victor Moses a penalty as 'disgraceful' and 'disgusting' Coates has since contacted the FA about Monk's remarks. He said: 'We've been in touch with the FA to ask what is happening with Garry Monk because of what he said. 'It's up to the particular authorities concerned about what they do now because it's not in our jurisdiction and not up to us to offer advice. 'But we are unhappy when they come out and accuse one of our players of cheating. 'We don't believe that is justified in any shape or form. The player was caught, and then he went down.' The FA are currenlty investigating Monk's criticism of referee Michael Oliver during his side's 2-1 loss . Sportsmail understands that Coates' complaint will have little to no impact on the ongoing FA investigation, which is centred on Monk's comments about Oliver rather than those said against Moses. Monk is expected to receive a formal charge or warning for the comments made about Oliver. Monk is this week likely to be contacted by referees chief Mike Riley, who was also criticised by the Swansea manager at the weekend. Monk hit out at Riley for his 'very poor' failure to respond to his numerous complaints about the officiating of Swansea matches this season. Monk's grievances include his trenchant feeling that Swansea have been on the wrong end of several significant decisions this season. Monk, who has repeatedly aired his complaints in the past month and passed on his views to Chris Foy on the official's recent training visit to Swansea, has been angered that Riley has never contacted him to discuss his concerns. The rookie manager went to the length last Friday of bypassing Riley altogether by posting a letter and DVD to his superior, John Williams, the chairman of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, detailing the incidents that have riled him. A Premier League spokesman said on Monday: 'The correspondence from Swansea was received by PGMOL on Monday morning and Mike will no doubt be speaking to Gary this week.' Monk had said about Riley: 'I have sent a DVD off with a letter, expressing my disappointment and I've had no contact from Mike Riley. 'I think it is about being pro-active and he is clearly not doing that - he is clearly not listening to anything I am saying. (Riley's) job is to ring me - it's not mine to ring him. He is supposed to be the head of these guys and overseeing it all, and seeing what managers feel. 'But I've had no contact whatsoever, and for me, that is very poor.'","Swansea boss Garry Monk said Stoke City's Victor Moses should be 'ashamed of himself' after penalty decision .

"Manuel Pellegrini remains convinced under-fire Eliaquim Mangala will establish himself as a key figure in the Manchester City defence. France centre-back Mangala has endured a difficult start to life in the Barclays Premier League following his £32million summer arrival from Porto. The 23-year-old endured a torrid afternoon as City were beaten 2-1 at West Ham on Saturday, and to compound his woes opposition boss Sam Allardyce later revealed he had been targeted as the weak link. Eliaquim Mangala looks dejected after the final whistle as Manchester City lost to West Ham . Sky Blues boss Manuel Pellegrini has backed his under-fire defender . Mangala also struggled in a game at Hull a month ago but manager Pellegrini has not lost faith. Pellegrini remembers how Martin Demichelis was ridiculed after some calamitous performances when he joined the club last season but the Argentinian has now turned that situation around. Pellegrini said: 'The same thing happened with Martin Demichelis last year. Remember all the criticism for him after he just arrived in the Premier League. 'I think Eliaquim Mangala is a young player and he has a lot of experience. I am sure we bought the centre-back that we need in him. This year with him, Vincent (Kompany), Martin, (Matija) Nastasic and Dedryck Boyata we have centre-backs that I can assure you will play very well.' Mangala and Bacary Sagna were signed in the close season to increase Pellegrini's defensive options as it was felt City lacked depth in this area. Performances this term, however, have been inconsistent with 17 goals conceded in 14 games in all competitions, including the Community Shield. Pellegrini accepts improvement is needed, but he says that applies across the pitch and not only to the defence. Carlton Cole beats Mangala to the ball as the Hammers took all three points . Argentine defender Martin Demichelis also had trouble adapting to life in the Premier League . The Chilean said: 'I think it's very it's important to have clean sheets. As a team you play easily or you play with more trust when you don't concede any easy goal at the beginning. 'But I think we must improve in general, not just talking about the defending. We must create more chances, we must score more goals. 'We are working on that and I am absolutely sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season. 'But the only way is to compare last season with this season. And I don't think we are any worse this season.' The loss at Upton Park was the champions' second in the Barclays Premier League this season but Pellegrini does not believe it is a sign of any decline in powers. He points out that at the same stage last season City were a point worse off than they are now and sitting seventh, as opposed to their current third. He said: 'This year maybe we are playing in irregular form. Maybe some parts of the game are well, and others not so well. We are always clear that we need to improve and we are thinking about the best way to do it. 'But last year we had one point less than this year, and we didn't start as well as I wanted last year.'

"Liverpool loanee Divock Origi may have failed to get on the scoresheet for Lille against his soon-to-be Merseyside rivals Everton on Thursday night, but the Belgian striker still managed to put in a performance that will already rank him above Mario Balotelli in the current estimations of Reds fans. Despite being unable to breach Tim Howard's goal during the forgettable 0-0 draw, the 19-year-old striker was a constant thorn in Everton’s side as he tested Sylvain Distin on several occasions with his pace and power. Origi took just two minutes to prove his strength, outmuscling Gareth Barry in the centre of the Stade Pierre-Mauroy pitch before unleashing the dangerous Sebastien Corchia, who saw his shot on goal saved. Liverpool loanee Divock Origi, pictured with Tony Hibbert, played the full 90 minutes against Everton . Everton right back Hibbert struggled to cope with the strength and pace of Liverpool's summer recruit . In a half which was dominated by the home side, Origi saved his best bit of play for the 20th minute, when the youngster jinked past Leighton Baines before breezing all too easily past Distin and hitting a low cross towards Ronny Rodelin. This moment of magic had the Lille faithful on their feet and no doubt Liverpool fans will have been watching with excitement as they look forward to Origi gracing the Anfield turf next season, perhaps in place of Balotelli, who is yet to score a Premier League goal for his new team. Origi, who sealed a £10million move to Liverpool following an impressive World Cup campaign, played mainly through the middle of a Lille front three, but wasn’t afraid to drift over to the wings in an attempt to make space for his team-mates, often occupying two defenders at a time. The forward, perhaps understandably, spent part of his time on the field targeting Everton veteran Tony Hibbert, but on the two occasions Origi raced past the 33-year-old, he wasted possession with overhit crosses. Sylvain Distin closes down Origi during his side's goalless draw against French outfit Lille . Everton captain Phil Jagielka vies for the ball with Lille striker Origi during the Europa League encounter . Origi, hailed as a ‘monster’ by Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany, started the second half brightly with a neat turn on the edge of Everton’s box before firing a powerful right-footed strike just wide of Howard’s goal. As the second 45 minutes dragged on in a less than inspiring Europa League clash, Origi remained a threat, winning corners and making intelligent runs. But as his team tired around him, Distin and Jagielka finally seemed to get to grips with the frontman, even if it did take them all of 80 minutes. Of course, there’s little doubt that Origi is far from the finished product and he is by no means the answer to Liverpool’s problems just yet. He didn’t always manage to maintain possession for his side as he should have done and there are elements to his game that will need time to improve such as his crossing from wide areas. But what Brendan Rodgers will have on his hands next season is a young striker packed with raw talent and one that is prepared to put in the hard yards for his team. Power, speed and ability aside, perhaps what will please the Liverpool fans even more is the fact that there wasn’t a half-time shirt swap in sight.

"The administrator overseeing the crisis at Caterham fears the team will not be competing in next weekend's United States Grand Prix. Finbarr O'Connell, who represents London accountancy firm Smith & Williamson, says he is doing all he can to get the team on the grid at Austin. But he has been left 'distressed' and frustrated by some of the practices he has so far encountered behind the scenes at Caterham. Staff are locked out of Caterham headquarters in Leafield, Oxfordshire, for a second consecutive day . The administrator overseeing the crisis fears they will not  compete at the US grand prix next weekend . The gates at the team's Leafield factory are locked for a second day and the team's cars remain impounded, so hopes are fading fast that Caterham will be heading to Texas. O'Connell is working on behalf of the creditors of Caterham Sports Ltd, a company which makes and supplies the cars to 1MRT, the entity which owns the licence to race in Formula One. 'I'm constantly chasing 1MRT - it should be the other way around - to engage better with me,' O'Connell told Press Association Sport. 'I can only presume they have other issues going on, but I really need them to come to me with an acceptable figure (to offer their creditors) so they can gain access again to Leafield and we can support them. 'It's very important to us they race, very important. But the thing is, for the creditors of Caterham Sports Ltd, it's not up to them to fund racing. There are around 200 jobs at the headquarters that could be lost if a resolution to the situation is not found . Caterham in action during practice at the Grand Prix in Japan in October . 'Formula One is a rich man's game, as we know, so (1MRT) need to fund themselves and pay their way. 'I'm responsible to my creditors, I'm an officer of the court, I need to make things better for them. 'At the moment 1MRT are trying to get me to make things worse for them, which I'm not willing to do.' With practice in Austin just a week away, it was suggested to O'Connell that given the present situation Caterham would not be there. O'Connell replied: 'No, no. I've some meetings there as well - I hope Caterham F1 are there.' Former Caterham owner Tony Fernandes (above) claims not to have been paid for his shares of ownership . In the background is the mud-slinging dispute between the past and present owners of Caterham. Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes claims he has yet to be paid for the shares of ownership, while the buyers in a consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern businessmen who took over at the end of June insist everything has been done accordingly. O'Connell, meanwhile, has made it abundantly clear who he feels he should be dealing with - Colin Kolles, who initially served as an advisor to the consortium, but is now the man in charge. 'They tell me Colin Kolles is the principal of 1MRT. To say Tony Fernandes runs it is totally untrue,' stated O'Connell. 'There is a legal dispute as to who owns the shares of 1MRT, but Colin Kolles and his people run the F1 team, and he is the principal.' Fernandes vented his frustration via Twitter on Wednesday about the current situation at Caterham . O'Connell, however, has been left amazed by the fact Kolles has yet to make contact, adding: 'I've spoken to some of his people. 'But it would be no harm if he phoned me as well because I've not spoken to him once so far. 'Overnight I reached out to (F1 supremo) Bernie Ecclestone to see if he can assist in some way because it's in everybody's best interests to do something. 'I'm told Colin Kolles wants to go racing; I want my creditors to get some money, and Bernie clearly wants them to be on the grid. 'You would think there is the makings of a deal there, but overnight I've chased 1MRT, and I've heard nothing back from them.' As for the 200-plus staff whose jobs are on the line, O'Connell was given a taste of the problems they face on Thursday when he made the tough call to close the gates on the factory. Japanese Caterham Formula One driver Kamui Kobayashi crashes out of the Australian grand prix in March . 'I spoke to the head of HR earlier, and it's quite unfortunate 1MRT don't have an out-of-hours communication system,' said O'Connell. 'I was quite distressed 1MRT were unable to tell their employees not to go, so people travelled, only to be sent away at the gates. I tried to avoid that. 'But 1MRT didn't have the wherewithal to organise otherwise. 'We've told people that once we do an acceptable deal then they will be straight back in.'

"Queens Park Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes has labelled the war of words between manager Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt an ‘embarrassment’. Fernandes intervened on Tuesday after Taarabt responded to criticism about his physical condition by the QPR manager.

Redknapp was speaking to reporters after the 3-2 defeat against Liverpool at Loftus Road on Sunday . CLICK HERE to read what Adel Taarabt had to say after Harry Redknapp claimed the midfielder was 'three stone overweight' Fernandes said: ‘As a club, we are fully aware of stories in the press over the last few days regarding Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt. ‘We regret these issues being played out in public and Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt have been notified of our disappointment regarding their handling of the situation. I have spoken to them both personally. ‘On behalf of the club, I would like to apologise to the QPR supporters for the embarrassment this has caused and confirm that the issue has been dealt with internally. ‘The club’s focus is now on the Aston Villa fixture next Monday and hopefully after a tough few days we can turn a negative into a positive and build on Sunday’s improved display.’ Fernandes, who was at Sunday’s game, is furious that the row between the pair has been made public. He appeared to tweet a message in support of Redknapp’s stance yesterday but later deleted it. It read: ‘Professional players must be fit. If I do a job I’m ready to do the job. Full stop. The buck stops at you. It’s your body and your career.’ QPR chairman Tony Fernandes says the spat between Taarabt and Redknapp has been an 'embarrassment' Fernandes says he has spoken with Redknapp and Taarabt personally after the QPR duo's public argument . When asked about the fitness of the QPR'S Adel Taarabt, manager Harry Redknapp said: . 'No, he's not fit: he's not fit to play football, unfortunately. He played in a reserve team game the other day, and I could have run about more than he did. So no, I can't pick him. 'I pick people that want to try, and deserve to be at a good football club like QPR, and want to work, and come in every day and want to work, and train, and show a good attitude. And that's what I got today from the players. 'When he starts doing that, whether he ever can do it, maybe he'll get a game. The other lads, I've got a fantastic group of lads here, absolutely superb, all of them. 'I can't keep protecting people who don't want to run about and train, who are about three stone overweight. 'What am I supposed to keep saying, keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don't train? What's the game coming to? The others are as good as gold.' Taarabt reported for training on Tuesday morning, but the majority of QPR players had been given the day off. The forward, who also worked under Redknapp at Tottenham, is expected to confront his manager on Wednesday for the first time since the Moroccan’s controversial interview with Sportsmail. The PFA also threatened to get involved yesterday as the row between Redknapp and Taarabt escalated. The dispute became public on Sunday afternoon when Redknapp was asked an innocuous question about Taarabt’s absence from the calamitous defeat against Brendan Rodgers’ side. Taarabt, 25, has made only three appearances for Rangers this season, but claims he is fully fit and ready to play first-team football after recovering from an ankle injury. On Monday he was pictured in Sportsmail lifting his top to prove he is in good physical condition. On Sunday, when Redknapp was asked about Taarabt, he said: ‘I can’t keep protecting people who don’t want to run about and train, who are about three stone overweight. ‘What am I supposed to keep saying, keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don’t train? What’s the game coming to? The others are as good as gold.’ ‘I am a professional - this is not about retaliation, this is about protecting my reputation. I played in that reserve game for 90 minutes and if he didn’t think I was running he could have taken me off. Maybe I didn’t perform like I could because it was a reserve team game and I was protecting myself. ‘Just because we are losing games I am not going to kick the ball in the stands. My job is to create, bring goals to the team. Maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player. I can only get fitness playing Premier League. You can train six or seven hours, but you won’t be fit.’ ‘The training sessions aren’t the same standard as Milan, or what I would expect under another manager. They are not as intense, the players aren’t as motivated. It is the same as we used to do at Tottenham years ago. When we played West Ham he told the players “you’re not fit, you’re not this, you’re not that”. ‘I said “but the problem is we don’t have any plan in the game, we don’t know how to press as a team. It’s not about just running around, you need to play with your brain”. ‘I was thinking that West Ham didn’t have better players than us, but they were well organised. ‘Almost every time we lose the ball the opposition score. We need to do something about it. ‘If you work as a team you run less. If somebody sprints 100 metres they play a triangle round him and you are never going to get the ball. ‘If everybody runs 10m, 10m, 10m, then you are in shape, but we never do that. He doesn’t understand that. The coaches don’t have any influence on Harry - none. They are there just to be there. ‘Glenn Hoddle loves me, but I don’t know if Harry listens to him. ‘After West Ham he said all of the team is not fit. After Liverpool, because the performance was so good, he said everything was perfect - what, in one week, he changed the fitness? Impossible.’ ‘I spoke with Les Ferdinand and he told me “what a player you are - you should be in the team every time. I followed you at Milan and you were fantastic”. ‘Les doesn’t speak to us in training, but he watches us and then goes to watch the kids as well. He knows me from my days at Tottenham so we have a good relationship.’ ‘I don’t like the food at the training ground, but eat healthily like every other player. Simple. ‘My heaviest weight at Milan was 86kg (13st 8lb), my lightest 84kg - now I’m 85kg. It’s not true to say I’m not fit. He tried to give an excuse. ‘I was desperate to play before the game. I was fuming when I didn’t play. My father was calling and my family and I didn’t pick up. I love football, I go crazy when I don’t play. Why did he talk about someone not involved in that game? ‘The journalist was doing his job and asking if I was injured. ‘He should have said “when he is fit he will play”. He is not 30 or 35, he is an experienced manager and he should have controlled that situation. I didn’t do pre-season with the team because I had an ankle injury, so I wasn’t 100 per cent. ‘This club doesn’t deserve to be in the position it’s in. We have fantastic owners who are there to help us, and give us everything to perform. ‘There are not many owners like that and they deserve better. They are fantastic with me and everybody. They are very patient too. ‘There is no panic, they are relaxed, want to improve, make the club better and make the fans happy.’ Taarabt, in action against Burton in the League Cup, has made just three appearances this season .

"CLICK HERE to read Matt Barlow's full match report from The Hawthorns . Louis van Gaal may well have looked at the central defenders on show at The Hawthorns on Monday evening and concluded the most reassuring wore No 6 for West Brom. With Manchester United shaky at the back, and exploring the possibility of taking Ron Vlaar from Aston Villa in January, Joleon Lescott stood out as an option who would have cost nothing last summer. Crossing the Manchester divide is a trip few have made, but you imagine such tribalism fails to concern Van Gaal. Lescott  showed he still has plenty to offer at 32.

Twice early on he read the play wisely to intercept dangerous balls from Angel di Maria, alleviating the pressure on his team.

Lescott was vocal  too, moving his team-mates into position when required. His performance was far from faultless. He misjudged one ball to allow Robin van Persie a chance and was out-muscled for the goal by Marouane Fellaini.

"Martin Skrtel insists the blame for Liverpool’s defensive frailties must be shared collectively as they prepare for the ultimate test against Real Madrid. Though the Champions League holders look set to be without Gareth Bale on Wednesday night, they still arrive on Merseyside with a scintillating array of attacking options and players who will be aware of how vulnerable Liverpool have been this year. Liverpool have shipped 16 goals in all competitions and have not had a clean sheet since their one and only shutout against Tottenham on August 31, so many will be anticipating that Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Co will pick them off at will. Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren both agree that Liverpool need to improve when they face Real Madrid . Skrtel clears the ball off the line during the 3-2 win against QPR on Sunday, in which the defence was poor . A game against Real Madrid would, ordinarily, have the city gripped with excitement for days beforehand but on Monday the mood was flat, stemming from the fortuitous 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers, a performance that was strewn with defensive errors. Skrtel, however, believes it would be unfair to make the back four and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet culpable every time they concede and has called for unity in the build-up to a contest that he points out has the capacity to transform Liverpool’s campaign. ‘The easiest way is always to criticise the defenders and keeper,’ said Skrtel, who is only one of two players to remain from the starting line-up (Steven Gerrard is the other) the last time Liverpool faced Real Madrid in March 2009 — an extraordinary game which saw Rafa Benitez’s side win 4-0. ‘But I’ve said it before that defending isn’t only about the back four, it is about the whole team. We are attacking together and we are defending together. We know it wasn’t good enough (at QPR), but we will try to improve. Skrtel says the whole team is to blame for Liverpool's disappointing form, not only their defence . Lovren says he was unhappy after the QPR game, despite Philippe Coutinho's late winner at Loftus Road . 'Every game is important for us, especially in the Champions League because you only have six group matches and we want to qualify for the next round. ‘Every game has its own story. Maybe we will be happy with a point, maybe disappointed but at the moment we are only thinking of getting three. Liverpool's defence won’t be looking forward to facing Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday night, but there is some hope for them. Despite scoring 18 goals in his last 10 games for club and country, he has never scored at Anfield. At Manchester United the Portugal star played Liverpool on their own turf five games but drew a blank in each. He did, however, manage three wins and a draw, losing just once. ‘This is what we play for. The Champions League is the best competition in the world because you face the best players in the world. In my eyes, they are the best team in the world so this is a big challenge for us, but we’ll do our best and try to get a good result.’ That message was shared by Dejan Lovren, Skrtel’s partner at the heart of the defence. Having looked a colossus when he scored a thumping header to crown an impressive display in a friendly against Borussia Dortmund, his form has since matched that of his new team. He has looked increasingly shaky but, to his credit, the Croatia centre half has recognised that standards have not been good enough and he wants to banish the memory of what happened at Loftus Road in the best possible manner. Cristiano Ronaldo (right) has started the season in blistering form, with 18 goals in 10 competitive games . Skrtel described last year's Champions League winners Real Madrid as the 'best team in the world' VIDEO Real ready for tough week - Ancelotti . ‘I was glad it was over because I think one minute more and it would have been 3-3,’ said Lovren with brutal honesty. ‘It is the first time in my career I was unhappy after the game even though we won because we didn’t play good. ‘We need to be better and in our next game against Real Madrid we need to show more . . . their players, we know who they are and we will prepare a little bit different. But we will not play like that against Real Madrid, you can be sure of that. We will be better.’ Brendan Rodgers, meanwhile, has admitted the sale of Luis Suarez ‘halted’ the momentum that carried Liverpool to second place in the Barclays Premier League last season but, in an interview with Spanish newspaper AS, Rodgers insisted there was reason for ‘excitement’ at Anfield. Gareth Bale is set to miss out on the trip to Anfield, but Real's attack will still carry plenty of threat . Ronaldo has never scored a goal at Anfield, but did win three of his five trips there with Manchester United . ‘The natural progress of the team has been halted in some way in the summer with Luis Suarez leaving and lots of new players coming in,’ said Rodgers, who also revealed that he has an ambition to manage in Spain one day. ‘It’s an exciting time at Liverpool with lots of young players coming in but if we are going to get better, we are going to take the short-term hit at the moment knowing that in the long term the club will be better for it.’ Brendan Rodgers says the natural progression of the team has been slowed by Luis Suarez's move to Barca .","Martin Skrtel says Brendan Rodgers' side can recover their form on Wednesday against 'the best team in the world'

"It was undoubtedly the most engaging weekend of the Premier League season so far and the 40 goals to fly in came within a whisker of breaking records. Defenders seemingly under little pressure - most notably Sunderland's Santiago Vergini - thrashed through their own net to aid already swashbuckling attacking oppositions up and down the country. Rather cruelly, it was a sight to behold. An average of four goals-a-game was just three short of the most scored during a 10-fixture set in the 20-team era. Graziano Pelle scored twice as Southampton thrashed Sunderland 8-0 at St Mary's this weekend . Saints were helped on their way enormously by the barbaric own goal of Black Cat Santiago Vergini . The weekend was three goals shy of February 2011's 43-goal record (as Cheick Tiote scored vs Arsenal) Tiote netted a late equaliser as Newcastle battled back from four goals down to draw 4-4 against Arsenal .

That came in February 2011, with Everton, Arsenal, Newcastle and Wigan all scoring four goals or more on the Saturday as the weekend totalled an astonishing 43. The Toffees knocked five past gung-ho Blackpool after coming back from 3-1 down at Goodison Park. Events at St James' Park were even more surreal as the Gunners - home and dry four goals to the good at the break - somehow conspired to only leave the North East with a point. Cheick Tiote rifled in a stunning 87th minute equaliser to finish one of the most dramatic afternoons in British football. Roberto Martinez's Wigan had got in on the act, edging a seven-goal thriller with James McCarthy netting twice from midfield. The clashes on that weekend - February 5/6 - were far closer than some of the thumpings handed out this time.

Helped drastically by Vergini's moment of madness and Liam Brudcutt's bundled own goal, of course, but Saints offered reasons to believe they are capable of continuing their early promise. Four-goal Sergio Aguero had earlier swept Tottenham aside at the Etihad Stadium in the 4-1 win while Everton comfortably beat Aston Villa 3-0. Taking into consideration what had preceded it, the four swings in the final moments at Loftus Road as Liverpool somehow overcame QPR was as predictable as it was stunning. It meant - when taking Sunday's matches into consideration - that there were eight more nets bulging than any other matchday this campaign.","Southampton thumped Sunderland 8-0 at St Mary's on Saturday .

"Team spirit at QPR was once so bad that Bobby Zamora wished that he could skip training and fast forward to match day. Zamora, who joined the club in January 2012 and was plunged straight into a relegation dog fight, says that the rifts in the squad then were so deep that he would have gladly missed the weekdays because of the animosity in the team. ‘For myself, it was more a case of just wishing at times that you didn’t have to go training for a week and could just turn up for a Saturday,’ said Zamora. ‘Because when game time comes everyone is fighting for the same cause. Two seasons ago, during the week sometimes tempers could flare.’ Team spirit at QPR was once so bad that Bobby Zamora wished that he could skip training sessions . Recalling the negativity of 2012 and 2013, when QPR were a team characterised by their lack of fight, serves a purpose. For, though bottom of the table now with four points, with Liverpool coming to Loftus Road today and with manager Harry Redknapp under pressure, Zamora has some perspective. Bad though it may seem, things were infinitely worse then. Ironically, in 2011-12, despite the rancour QPR stayed up. However, the following season, with an equally bad atmosphere in the dressing room, they were relegated, with Redknapp overseeing only the latter half of the season before guiding the club back to the Premier League last May. ‘Two and half seasons ago we stayed up with all that,’ said Zamora. ‘And this season we’re in a better position all round: the club, the players, the squad. And there are 31 games to go there is plenty of time to get out of this. ‘The club has come on in terms of the squad, the management, the facilities, the training pitches. All aspects of the club are a lot better than two and half years ago. There are only four or five lads left from that time and there has been a big turnaround. There is a good togetherness. The lads all get on now. Rio Ferdinand has come and he has been impressed at how the lads are together. He was at Manchester United a long time and he can’t believe the togetherness of the lads and the spirit.’ That said, Ferdinand and the new signings such as Eduardo Vargas, Mauricio Isla, Niko Kranjcar, Steven Caulker, Sandro and Leroy Fer will have to start delivering victories soon. QPR spent significantly again in the summer despite the financial issues at the club. The latest financial results show a loss of £65.7million for the last season in the Premier League, on a turnover of £60m — figures that are unlikely to improve after a season spent in the Championship. Striker Zamora has played six of QPR's opening games back in the Premier League this season . The fine for breaching the Football League’s Financial Fair Play rules could be as much as £40m when the new figures are revealed — and the Football League are threatening to relegate the club to Football Conference if they are relegated and fail to pay it. With the planned new 40,000-stadium in Old Oak being opposed by the current landowner, these are unsettling times at Loftus Road. Having Les Ferdinand seated alongside owner Tony Fernandes today as the newly-installed Head of Football Operations does not help calm matters. Though Ferdinand was appointed by Redknapp as a coach at Tottenham, he is these days more associated with his last boss, Tim Sherwood, who along with Tony Pulis, would be a candidate to replace Redknapp. Redknapp has been unfortunate in that key signing Jordan Mutch is injured as is captain Joey Barton while Sandro is struggling for fitness. But losing Loic Remy on the eve of transfer deadline day to a well-advertised buy-out clause was less of a shock. Failing to support Zamora and Charlie Austen up front has been the obvious huge omission from the summer spending. Manager Harry Redknapp - pictured with Les Ferdinand - has a fight to keep the club in the top flight . The only possible solution for all concerned is simply to stay up this season to avoid the multitude of looming issues. And Zamora insists it is far too early to be concerned and that the players are behind Redknapp. ‘Harry has a wealth of experience. He’s seen it all: relegations, promotions, finals,’ said Zamora. ‘It really is crazy there is speculation with so many games to go. You can win two games and you’re right back up there.’ ‘We don’t talk about the speculation at the minute because it’s so early. You literally just need a couple of wins. Although they are tough games they can be won. He brought most of us in. Harry has supported us and wanted us here. Everyone is behind him and now we have just got to do our part on match day.’ QPR face Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City in the next three weeks – though you would imagine that the results against Aston Villa (home), Newcastle (away) and Leicester (home) are more likely to define Redknapp’s future. Zamora puts on a good positive front. ‘Catch me in four or five months to have this conversation,’ he says. ‘We’ll have plenty of points on the board then, I’ m sure. The spirit is there.’","Bobby Zamora wanted to skip training sessions two years ago .

"Ashley Young says Manchester United will go into Sunday’s meeting with Chelsea full of confidence despite failing to convince against West Brom on Monday night.

'We said we wanted to start the second half brightly and get ourselves back into it, which we did with Felli’s [Marouane Fellaini] goal, which was fantastic. 'We wanted to kick on from there and it looked like there was only going to be one team who were going to get the three points – that’s why you saw a lot of disappointed faces in our squad after the game.

"Click here to read Neil Ashton's interview with Adel Taarabt . Adel Taarabt and Harry Redknapp aren't exactly getting on at the moment. After QPR's last-gasp defeat against Liverpool on Sunday, the manager gave it both barrels to Taarabt about his physique, claiming the maverick was 'three stone overweight'. The 25-year-old wasn't particularly impressed with that assertion and told Sportsmail that he would prove he's in tip-top shape. And it isn't the first time managers have played out major bust-ups with their players in public. Sportsmail takes a look at some of the more colourful characters to have disagreed in the past. QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt hits back at manager Harry Redknapp's claim that he is 'three stone overweight' In an explosive Sportsmail interview, Taarabt said 67-year-old Redknapp spends most of his time in his office . Souness vs Bellamy – January 2005 . Graeme Souness isn’t a man to mince his words and accused Craig Bellamy of feigning an injury in order to get out of playing wide right at Newcastle. The striker was fined £80,000 by the Magpies after claiming his manager had fabricated about the background to their bust-up before a trip to Arsenal. ‘Craig Bellamy has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club with his attitude to the coaching staff, to me and to his team-mates,’ Souness said. ‘I told Bellamy that he had to apologise to the rest of the players but then I found out later he had not done so. That was on Friday teatime and that's when I decided he wasn't going to be in my team at Arsenal. If he had apologised, he would have been.’ Craig Bellamy was alleged to feigned an injury in order not to play for Newcastle under Graeme Souness . William Gallas and Jose Mourinho did have a good relationship before their spat in July 2006 . Mourinho vs Gallas – July 2006 . William Gallas was told in no uncertain terms that he had disrespected his Chelsea team-mates for failing to join the rest of the squad on a pre-season trip to Los Angeles. ‘It's not only me that is upset - we're all upset,’ Mourinho fumed. ‘Everybody is upset because we had a strong family and a strong group and this has shown a lack of respect to everybody and I don't like that.’ Gallas left Stamford Bridge soon after. Don’t mess with Mourinho. Redknapp vs Bent – January 2009 . Tottenham’s Darren Bent glaringly headed wide when presented with an open goal during a disappointing draw against Portsmouth. Harry Redknapp’s synopsis was that ‘you will never get a better chance to win a match than that. My missus could have scored that one’. A fair enough assessment given the gravity of the miss, but it didn’t stop a disgruntled Bent forcing a move away from White Hart Lane. Mancini vs Balotelli – January 2013 . This was an on-going soap opera worthy of primetime on terrestrial television - neither of these egos refused to budge an inch. The frosty relationship appeared reached its height in January 2013, the season in which Manchester City relinquished their Premier League crown. Roberto Mancini reacted angrily to something Mario Balotelli had done in training at Carrington, yanking on his striker’s bib as the pair became embroiled in a bust-up. The manager lost his job at the end of the campaign and Balotelli was sold to AC Milan the same year. City weren’t about to see their reputation tarnished and washed their hands of both, who had distracted from retaining the title. Darren Bent missed a glaring sitter, heading wide against Portsmouth as Tottenham could only draw at home . Manager Harry Redknapp wasn't impressed, saying his 'missus' could have scored from six yards out . Roberto Mancini was photographed grabbing Mario Balotelli's bib during Manchester City training . The two Italians became divisive characters at the Etihad Stadium and were let go by City . Houllier vs Ginola – November 1993 . This feud lasted a good 19 years. France winger David Ginola had over-hit a last-minute cross in a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria. Fairly nondescript stuff, until you fast-forward 15 seconds and see the ball nestled in the French net from the resulting counter attack – a goal that in fact ended their hopes of reaching the United States. Gerard Houllier, then the manager, was clearly still disgruntled by Ginola giving the ball away and wrote so in a book. Ginola took his former boss to court – citing defamation – only for it to be thrown out. ‘The court wanted to end this story by dismissing David Ginola's case,’ Houllier’s lawyer said. See the video below for Ginola's cross against Bulgaria . David Ginola (pictured playing for Tottenham in 1998) was criticised by Gerard Houllier (right) in a book . Di Canio vs Foderingham – September 2012 . Swindon Town goalkeeper Wes Foderingham wasn’t having the best of days away at Preston two years ago. He was at fault for two goals in the opening 20 minutes at Deepdale and hauled off by manager Paolo Di Canio. But it got markedly worse, quickly. The 21-year-old was so incensed by this decision that he had sulked off straight down the tunnel. Di Canio’s response? ‘He was one of the worst players I have ever seen in a football match.’ Foderingham – characterised as ‘arrogant’ and ‘ignorant’ - was forced to apologise. He duly obliged. Watch Di Canio's incredible interview after the game below . Wes Foderingham was dragged off after just 20 minutes as Swindon Town went 2-0 down away at Preston . Romelu Lukaku wasn't able to exert himself on the Chelsea first team during his spell at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho vs Lukaku - July/August 2014 . Chelsea may have managed to scoop £28million from Romelu Lukaku this summer, but it appeared Jose Mourinho never had any intention of blooding the striker into his first team. ‘Romelu was always clear that in his mentality and his approach he was not highly motivated to come to a competitive situation at Chelsea,’ argued Mourinho. Lukaku and blunt in his response: ‘I need to play at a high level and play in a good team. I'm not saying Chelsea are not a good team but I needed to be in a place where it felt right.’","Harry Redknapp labelled Adel Taarabt 'three stone overweight'

"Fresh from scoring four goals in the Premier League, Sergio Aguero has announced he will be releasing his autobiography in English. 'My Story', released last year in Argentina with a foreword from Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi, goes through his career from the start. From Independiente through to Atletico Madrid and Manchester City, the 26-year-old is slowly but surely becoming the world's top centre forward. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero posted the picture on his Twitter page on Monday . Aguero struck FOUR goals for City against Tottenham on Saturday as the hosts cruised to a 4-1 victory . Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games) Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games) Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games) Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games) Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) He has 85 goals in 132 appearances for City in just over three seasons, and has the best minutes per goal ratio in Premier League history. Aguero tweeted on Monday: 'Excited to announce my book will soon be available in English! Here's a sneak peek of the cover! #AgueroMyStory.' Aguero is preparing for Manchester City's behind-closed-doors game at CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Tuesday, having picked up just one point in their opening two games.

"Michael Oliver has been handed the Manchester derby on Sunday - just months after missing Marouane Fellaini's flailing elbow on Pablo Zabaleta. The Belgian flung an arm in the Manchester City defender's direction during United's defeat at Old Trafford, but was given a reprieve and stayed on the pitch. The 29-year-old Oliver is, however, one of the best referees in the Premier League and this appointment reflects that. Referee Michael Oliver (centre) has been handed the Manchester derby this weekend . Oliver failed to send Marouane Fellaini off for this elbow on Pablo Zabaleta at Old Trafford in March . United midfielder Fellaini looked shocked as he was handed a yellow card by the 29-year-old referee . Oliver talks to Ashley Williams and Wayne Routledge during Swansea's game against Stoke . HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. The Premier League have leaned on the youngster for some of its bigger fixtures over the last 12 months. And this weekend is no different; Oliver will lead the teams out at the Etihad Stadium. He will look to avoid being in the spotlight for missing an incident this time. He was also criticised by Sportsmail's Graham Poll in the aftermath of Chelsea's win at Burnley in August after wrongfully cautioning Diego Costa for simulation when the striker had been tripped by goalkeeper Tom Heaton. Oliver also booked Nacer Chadli for cupping his ear to the home Arsenal supporting during Tottenham's 1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadium last month. And during Swansea's recent match at Stoke he correctly gave a penalty to the visitors for Ryan Shawcross wrestling down Wilfried Bony in the area. Oliver has been talked about as a potential official during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Phil Dowd was pilloried for failing to spot serious penalty box grappling by Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling on Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry during United's draw against Chelsea on Sunday. And Dowd has been given the Monday night game between Crystal Palace and Sunderland at Selhurst Park.

"Gus Poyet has admitted Sunderland cannot afford to rebuild their team every summer if they are to secure the stability they crave. The Black Cats head coach presided over yet another major overhaul of the squad last summer after pulling off an unlikely escape act from the jaws of relegation. But two and a half months into the new campaign, the 46-year-old Uruguayan finds himself fighting fires once again with his team having succumbed to a self-inflicted 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal on Saturday - seven days after being trounced 8-0 at Southampton. Gus Poyet looks frustrated during Sunderland's 2-0 loss against Arsenal on Saturday afternoon . Vito Mannone looks frustrated after Sunderland lose 2-0 at the Stadium of Light to Arsenal . Poyet was in contemplative mood after another soul-destroying reverse, but pointed to the continuity in Arsene Wenger's squad compared to the state of flux in his as he started the process of analysing just what had gone wrong. He said: 'I'll tell you one instance that you probably don't know: eight players from the Arsenal starting line-up last year are here, they are in Arsenal's squad; seven players from Sunderland's starting XI last year here are not even at Sunderland. 'That shows you there is an advantage for people who have a squad that is together and you add quality and what you are missing, and another team where you start from zero every single year, and every year you need to see if you have got the characters, if you have got the quantity, if you have got the quality, if they understand the game, if they can defend as a team, if you are going to play long or short or passing... 'It's a little bit of a disadvantage without being an excuse, but we need to make sure that we don't do it any more. We don't want to start next year again from zero and another seven players in the starting XI.' It is a fact that Poyet is still trying to mould a team from the players with which he was presented by sporting director Lee Congerton during the summer, although there were only three members of the new intake among his starting XI against the Gunners - Patrick van Aanholt, Jack Rodwell and Will Buckley. Poyet's Sunderland side sit around the relegation zone after losing 2-0 against Arsenal at the Stadium of Light . Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez shoots to score past Sunderland goalkeeper Mannone . Ironically, it was two of his longer-serving and usually more dependable men who were culpable in a defeat which highlighted the club's depressing capacity to self-harm. The home side had held firm in the face of sustained pressure from Arsenal's slick passing game with Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini feeding Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to place a stranglehold on the ball. But with half an hour gone, central defender Wes Brown, under pressure from the admirable Sanchez, attempted a back-pass to Vito Mannone from the best part of 50 yards, but only managed to scuff the ball into the Chile international's path and saw him sprint away before lifting a delicate shot over the advancing keeper. To their credit, the Black Cats rallied after the break and made a genuine fist of forcing their way back into the game, only to succumb once again at the death when Mannone, who was beaten three times last weekend by team-mates, allowed Buckley's back-pass to get away from him and Sanchez pounced to double his tally. Mannone can only watch as Sanchez's ball flies above him and into his goal . Wes Brown was at fault for Sanchez's second goal at the Stadium of Light on Saturday afternoon . Poyet said: 'They are human beings and anything can happen on a football pitch. These are actions that I don't think can repeat themselves, I don't think you can train for them. 'They are just mistakes that happen in football and, unfortunately, it's going a little bit against us at the moment.' If Poyet and his players face another long and difficult week - they travel to Crystal Palace next Monday evening - Arsenal headed south having brought a tough few days to a more than satisfactory conclusion and purring over summer acquisition Sanchez. Oxlade-Chamberlain told the club's official website, www.arsenal.com: 'He's a world-class player - everyone saw that at the World Cup. He's proved that and he's played for Barcelona, where we've all seen what he's done. 'He's an unbelievable player and part of his game is his character and his hard work - that's where he's got both his goals from. 'He reminds me of Luis Suarez when he chases everything down and he makes nothing into something. He's done that for us twice today and he's scored goals at important times for us.'","Sunderland lost 2-0 to Arsenal at the weekend .

"Leeds' managerial circus returned on Saturday evening as trigger-happy owner Massimo Cellino parted company with Darko Milanic after six games in charge. Milanic's six-game reign - the same as predecessor David Hockaday - ended almost immediately after the 2-1 loss to Wolves at Elland Road. Neil Redfearn - who bridged the gap between Hockaday and Milanic with 10 points from 12 as caretaker - will take over as new head coach. Leeds United have sacked head coach Darko Milanic following their 2-1 defeat at home to Wolves . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino appointed Milanic last month on a two-year deal . Wolves subsittute Leon Clarke scored in the 85th-minute give Wolves a 2-1 victory at Elland Road . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has blitzed through a number of managers in a short spell at Elland Road. The controversial Italian completed completed his 75% takeover of the club in April. Brian McDermott: Appointed as Neil Warnock's successor in April 2013 but leaves the club by mutual consent in May 2014 after a win-less period of eight games. Leeds won 15 of their 36 matches under McDermott . David Hockaday: Appointed head coach on a two-year contract in June but Hockaday and his assistant Junior Lewis are sacked after six games in charge. Neil Redfearn: The club's academy director takes over from Hockaday as caretaker coach . Darko Milanic: The Slovenian is appointed on a two-year deal in September but lasts six games at the helm at Elland Road. Neil Redfearn (again): Redfearn will will take charge of first team training once more from Monday morning. Cellino asked director of football Nicola Salerno to deliver the news to Milanic shortly after he had defended his position in his post-match press conference. 'I want to apologise to the supporters, they deserve better results,' Cellino said after ending Milanic's reign after just 32 days. That is a statistic to make Brian Clough's 'damned' 44 days look long-serving, but Cellino has never been a man to hang around. In his 20-year spell with Italian side Cagliari he earned the nickname 'the manager eater' after removing 36 managers. Since arriving at Leeds in January he has sacked Brian McDermott twice, Hockaday and now Milanic. The Italian said he had got the right man after recruiting Milanic - a winner of nine trophies with Slovenian side Maribor - from Sturm Graz on September 23. However, a failure to win any of his six games in charge and a perceived negative attitude has cost the 46-year-old who travelled to England on a one-way ticket without his family. Redfearn is now to be given the job on a permanent basis, with the majority of Leeds fans baffled as to why the 49-year-old academy coach did not get given the nod after his successful caretaker stint. He watched the Wolves loss with Cellino and sections of the crowd sang his name as Leeds went behind to Leon Clarke's 85th-minute winner.","Neil Redfearn will be appointed as new head coach .

"Leeds president Massimo Cellino's court trial in Sardinia for tax evasion has been delayed, it has been reported. Cellino's trial for allegedly failing to pay import duty on a yacht was due to take place on Thursday, but the judge has had to step down due to a conflict of interest. A new trial date has yet to be confirmed. Judge Dr Sandra Lepore convicted Cellino for failing to pay tax on his yacht Nelie in March and cannot hear the second case involving another yacht, Lucky 23. Leeds president Massimo Cellino's trial for tax evasion has been delayed, a new date is yet to be confirmed . Cellino was fined around £400,000 for the earlier conviction and subsequently barred from completing his takeover of Leeds by the Football League under its 'owners and directors' test. The Italian businessman won an appeal against the League's ruling and completed his takeover at Elland Road in April. But the appeal judge who overturned that decision ruled that if Judge Lepore confirmed in her written report that the tax evasion in the Nelie case had been a deliberate act of dishonesty then Cellino would fail the League's 'owners and directors' test. Leeds drew 1-1 at Carrow Road in their Championship clash with Norwich City on Tuesday night . Judge Lepore has since confirmed there was 'elusive intent' and 'Machiavellian simulation' by Cellino and the League is under mounting pressure to force him to sell the club. The League has yet to receive a copy of Dr Lepore's report and, it is understood, has no right to request a copy. Under League rules, Cellino is obligated to notify the governing body of any change in his 'fit and proper' status.

"Wonders of the universe have been revealed in a series of stunning images and videos. The Central West Astronomical Society’s astrophotography competition saw entrants submit images of deep space, the solar system, the moon and much more. And prizes went not only to technically brilliant images, but also to entrants that captured the beauty of the sky back on Earth, without specialist equipment. Scroll down to see video entries . The winners of the 2014 David Malin Awards have been announced. This image by Phil Hart won the theme of 'The Moon. 'This is a striking image that has a quite painterly quality,' said astronomer Dr Malin, after whom the awards are named. 'The careful cropping and a soft and gentle light, makes the photograph look like an art work"" The winners will be on display at the CSIRO Parkes Observatory’s Visitor’s Centre until July 2015. Also known as the David Malin Awards, the prizes were presented by British-Australian astronomer Dr Malin himself. ‘The quality of the images was of an incredibly high standard and a testament to the great skill and talent of Australian astrophotographers,’ the society states on its website. The images range from swirling dust and gas to moving dishes. ‘The winning entries show both technical skill and an ability to capture the beauty of the sky in a visually pleasing way,’ said John Sarkissian, CSIRO Operations Scientist at Parkes radio telescope - ‘the Dish’ - and organiser of the awards. Matthew Vandeputte received recognition for his stunning video titled 'The Dish', shown above . This picture by Paul Haese, called 'Dust and Gas', was the overall winner and also the winner of the deep sky category. 'I think this is the best true-colour image of the Orion Nebula I have seen for a long time,' said Dr Malin. 'It has everything. The basics are well covered by a realistic-looking colour balance and the dynamic range, which makes the heart of the nebula look brighter than everything else, which is as it should be' The high-res solar system category winner was Steven Budar with his 'Mars 2014' series of images. 'Intriguing composition of a series of excellent images of Mars over several months, all of them showing fine resolution and the obvious change in the diameter of the planet with distance,' said Dr Malin . He continued: ‘More than 200 entries were submitted this year. ‘With such stiff competition, to have received any one of these awards is a great honour. Congratulations to all of the finalists and winners.’ The overall winner, and also the winner of the deep sky category for images taken with a telescpe, was Paul Haese. His winning entry showed the Great Nebula in the constellation Orion, a star-forming region 1,300 light-years from Earth. Another stunning image, this one by Phil Hart, showed the moon setting over a shipping channel. Stefan Buda, meanwhile, took a series of images of Mars in 2014, showing the planet come closer to Earth and appear larger in view. His images also show how much ice is visible at the Martian poles. The competition will run again next year, when entrants will again have the chance to win prizes such as those offered by Canon this year, which included thousands of pounds worth of photography equipment. Phil Hart won the 'wide-field' category with his 'Dusty Hearty of the Milky Way' images. 'This is a perfectly simple rendition of the Milky Way using an off-the-shelf camera and a standard 50mm lens. However, the quality of the result is outstanding, especially the colour balance and stunning detail' Paul Haese also won the wide-field solar system category with his 'Prominence' photo. 'This is a stunning image in all respects, and shows the active sun and large prominence on the limb,' said Dr Malin. 'A lot of effort and specialised knowledge goes into making images of this quality, and this is a superb example of an arcane art'","Winners of a competition run by the Central West Astronomical Society have been announced .

"A Tennessee couple were picking up a breakfast snack from their local McDonald's - but were instead served a paper bag brimming with cash. Greg and Stacye Terry, of Hermitage, were accidentally handed thousands of dollars, which were supposed to be deposited in the bank but somehow ended up in the drive-through window. The costly mistake was quickly discovered, and the Terrys did the right thing by returning their unexpected windfall without a moment's hesitation. Scroll down for video . McCash: Greg and Stacye Terry, of Hermitage, Tennessee, were picking up a breakfast from their local McDonald's, but instead got a bag filled with thousands of dollars in cash . Honest customers: Greg and Stacye Terry ended up returning the small fortune after discovering the error . The incident happened at the fast-food eatery on Lebanon Road in Hermitage. On a recent morning, Stacye and Greg pulled up in their truck next to the drive-through window and placed their usual breakfast order. After being handed a standard McDonald's bag containing what they thought to be their food, the Terrys drove off. ‘My husband opened the bag and discovered the money inside,’ Stacye Terry told NewsChannel5. ‘He said, “You are not going to believe this.” Sure enough, it was their bank deposit money.’ When a McDonald’s employee discovered to her horror that she had accidentally handed the customers a stack of banknotes neatly wrapped in plastic that were supposed to be deposited in the bank, she was able to quickly reach the Terrys in their home. ‘The second that he said it was their deposit, my first thing was let's get in the truck and take it back,’ said Stacye. ‘There is no other way to have it.  I couldn't live with myself.’ Rolling in dough: The unusual incident took place at this McDonald's branch on Lebanon Road in Hermitage, Tennessee . Costly snafu: The clerk who handed the Terrys their pricey order quickly realized her mistake and tracked them down . Phil Gray, who owns the branch on Lebanon Road, released a statement thanking his patrons for their actions. ‘We are looking in to why this mistake happened, but what is most important to us is knowing that we are part a community with the values that were evidenced by this person's actions,’ the statement read. The Terrys expressed hope that no one on the eatery's staff would be fired over this snafu. Greg Terry, who works as a land surveyor, and his wife said they plan to continue patronizing the fast-food joint, but they do not expect to get another order of greenbacks in their lifetime.

"Bond: Paul O'Grady with Olga, who was given 18 months to live but has survived after a series of treatments . He was devastated when his beloved dog Buster died of cancer. So when vets told Paul O’Grady his pet Olga was suffering the same condition and had only 18 months to live, he decided to do all he could to save her. Ignoring advice to have her put down, the chat show host and Lily Savage star is paying £8,000 for the cairn terrier to undergo intense chemotherapy and surgery. Olga has made guest appearances on his Channel 4 tea-time show since 2006 and is so close to his heart that he named his production firm Olga TV after her. O’Grady, 58, who had 12 stents inserted into his arteries after two heart attacks, said the cost of the expensive treatments was not an issue. ‘She has had her kidney out and is now on chemo,’ he said. ‘Her operation cost twice as much as it did to give me a stent – it was £8,000. But I don’t care what it costs as I would sell my house to pay for it.’ The treatment seems to have been successful so far as the star revealed the nine-year-old dog was ‘flying around at the moment like a puppy’. O’Grady was described as ‘absolutely gutted’ when Buster, his 14-year-old shihtzu-bichon frise cross, was put down in 2009. The comedian developed a strong bond with the dog after rescuing him from a motorway and gave the full name of Buster Elvis Savage. He later dedicated the second volume of his autobiography to his loyal companion, describing him as ‘the greatest canine star since Lassie’. Co-stars: They have worked together on The Paul O'Grady Show and years ago with O'Grady as Lily Savage . Namesake: The comedian has even named his production firm - Olga TV - after his beloved pet . Buster had appeared with O’Grady’s alter ego Lily Savage on the Big Breakfast and was replaced by Olga on his chat show. The host told viewers the ageing pet was ‘in retirement’. A memorial statue was made of Buster for Battersea Dogs Home, where O’Grady presents ITV show For The Love Of Dogs and is also a celebrity ambassador. Paula Boyden, of the Dogs Trust, said it . can be a ‘challenge’ to detect cancer in animals, but that treatments . had improved following research into the human form of the illness. An MRI scan - £2,000 . Chemotherapy - up to £5,000 . Overnight stay at vet's surgery - up to £55 . A dog's arthritis tablets for one year - £120 . Blood test for a dog - £128 . Castrating a cat - £52 . Parasite treatment for a rabbit - £50 . Dental surgery for a cat - £233 . A dog's X-ray - £232 . Surgery on a cat's cataracts - £1,600 for one eye or £2,400 for operations on both . ‘Some cancers are quite obvious to diagnose, but for example, blood cancer, can be quite difficult,’ she said. ‘There are three ways to treat the cancer: surgically remove it, radiotherapy under general anaesthetic as the dog has to remain very still or chemotherapy. 'Using chemotherapy on dogs does not produce the awful side-effects as in humans like losing hair because you are trying to prolong life for up to a couple of years – which is a lot for a dog – not completely cure it. ‘The £8,000 bill is not eyebrow-raising as it involves surgery. It probably costs around £4,000 for chemotherapy at a specialist centre and that’s why people take out pet insurance.’ O’Grady has had recent problems with his own health and was hospitalised after suffering an angina attack in November amid fears he was overworking. He was revived in an ambulance after a heart attack in 2003 and admitted to intensive care following another in 2006. The former 40-a-day cigarette smoker told The Sun he has quit them for e-cigarettes. ‘When I get the urge I now suck on this new cigarette, although I’d sell the grandkids for 20 Lambert & Butler,’ he said. O’Grady has three other dogs – Bullseye, Louis and Eddie – as well as pigs, sheep and chickens.","Comedian was left devastated when old dog Buster died of cancer in 2009 .

"Loic Remy will have a scan on his damaged groin on Wednesday as Chelsea face up to a striker crisis ahead of their clash with Manchester United. The France forward, who scored Chelsea’s opener in the 13th minute against Maribor in their 6-0 Champions League victory at Stamford Bridge, limped off immediately after his goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho, who is already without Diego Costa for Sunday’s trip to Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League, claims Remy has no chance. Loic Remy put Chelsea ahead after 13 minutes after cutting in from the right hand side and firing home . As his Chelsea team-mates celebrated, Remy was left clutching at his troublesome groin, and was replaced . Remy's injury could pose a serious problem for Chelsea, who go to Manchester United next week . Didier Drogba, who came on to score his first goal for Chelsea since returning to the club, could start at Old Trafford if both strikers are ruled out. Mourinho said: ‘Remy has a muscular injury. I don't know the dimension and I'm not worried. When a player is injured, play another one. ‘I don't expect him to play. I don't like to speak about injured players. ‘Tomorrow is our day off and the doctor is forbidden to call me to speak about injuries. I don't want to speak about injuries, Man United. I don't want to know. Remy stretches for the ball inside the Maribor box, and the striker picked up an injury early on . Didier Drogba scored his first goal for Chelsea since his return to Stamford Bridge from the penalty spot . ‘I cannot speak about Man United. I can speak about ourselves. We are playing well, we are getting good results. We don't cry on injuries. It's our philosophy, we don't cry. ‘We just think one injury means an opportunity for somebody else. We cannot hide. In this moment we have some problems with players that are not available to play. ‘We will prepare the game Thursday, Friday, Saturday to try to be at our best possible level against an opponent which we respect very, very much.’ Drogba could make a shock start if Costa and Remy fail to recover in time to face United. He scored a penalty in the 23rd minute after asking permission from regular taker Eden Hazard for the honour. Mourinho added: ‘I don’t like it, but if they ask to do it then they have to score. Kurt Zouma impressed on his Champions League debut in a game where Chelsea were rarely troubled . Mourinho insisted that Zouma is 'ready to play any match' and compared him to France star Raphael Varane . ‘I was not expecting Didier to play 75 (minutes). I spoke with him yesterday and we spoke about 30. It was circumstances. He had to go on. ‘He was comfortable to play 75 minutes. It was very, very important for Didier. The best thing for a player to improve his condition is to play. ‘His last goal for Chelsea was the most important goal in the history of the club.’ Mourinho also had kind words for central defender Kurt Zouma, and claims the youngster is ready to challenge for a first team place after making his Champions League bow on Tuesday. Zouma, who started his first Chelsea game in the Capital One Cup tie against Bolton, played the 6-0 win over Maribor in place of Gary Chaill. Mourinho said: ‘It's always better to play them when the situation is good. Zouma is in a different dimension. ‘Zouma is ready to play any match, but because I wanted to give stability to the team I played since day one with Cahill and John. ‘It is a similar situation to the one I had at Real Madrid with Raphael Varane.’ Jose Mourinho had the opportunity to introduce some of his younger squad players, including Nathan Ake . He also backed Nathan Ake, who came on as a substitute last night, and Dominic Solanke to become first team regulars at Chelsea. Mourinho added: ‘Ake's a different level, but is in the level of the almost there. ‘Solanke is in the phase of the talent that we know that is there, but is far from being there. For him it was also a perfect situation. ‘Something he never forgets and for sure he's going to play many, many Champions League matches, because he'll be a very good player.’ VIDEO We are playing with confidence - Mourinho .","French striker Loic Remy injured his groin scoring against Maribor .

"An American brewery has been criticised for selling a beer called 'Dumb Blonde' which they claim 'goes down easy'. The Texas-based Deep Ellum Brewing has been condemned for relying on 'rape culture' to sell the product, which uses a picture of a doll wearing a blonde wig on the can. The company has also been using the controversial logo and catchphrase on a pink van as part of a marketing campaign to celebrate a year since the drink was first released. Too far? Dallas Blonde beer which is sold in cans with a picture of a doll wearing a blonde wig with the phrase 'goes down easy' written on the side . In a post on the political blog Burn Orange Report, writer Genevieve Cato said the way the company was selling the beer was 'unacceptable'. 'Deep Ellum's lazy use of this well-worn sexist comparison of women to alcohol is disappointing and insulting to their female customers, but it goes deeper than that. Anniversary: The controversial beer celebrated its first birthday with the slogan 'A year older. None the wiser' 'You need to look no further than the comments on their Facebook picture to see the way advertising like this fuels the acceptability of rape culture in our society. 'As a craft brewery in Texas, Deep Ellum is already well situated to be profitable and popular amongst beer drinkers across the state. 'It is completely unacceptable, and unnecessary, for breweries to continue to use this kind of language to sell their products.' John Reardon, who owns the brewery told the Dallas Observer he thinks the rape culture claim went too far. He said: 'We knew the play on words there,' but insisted Dallas Blonde beer was meant to be fun. 'We're not saying that all blondes go down easy,' he adds. But, he does admit he has had some negative responses to the advertising campaign. He has addressed the complaints by email. He also says he's trying to fine the most appropriate way to respond to Cato's article. He added: 'If there are women out there who are offended, then we should apologise.'","Deep Ellum Brewing criticised for using 'rape culture' to sell beer .

"When most people offer to pick up their date they take a car. But not Taylor Swift - who flew Harry Styles in her luxury private jet from New York to London. The One Direction star arrived at last night's Jingle Bell Ball at London's O2 arena with a huge grin on his face, fuelling speculation the couple are now an official item. One Direction's Harry Styles chooses not to fly home on a commercial flight with his bandmates and instead took Taylor Swift's private jet from New York to London yesterday . Harry was whisked from Taylor Swift's luxury jet into a car where he was driven to London's O2 arena for the band's performance . 18-year-old Harry ditched the rest of his bandmates to spend a few hours in the sky on the romantic transatlantic flight, while the others flew back to the UK on a domestic flight. Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson . and Zayn Malik had to fight their way through the crowd of fans at Heathrow, and instead of saying hello were shoved into an awaiting car. One Direction were joined by JLS and Cheryl Cole - who performed a duet with WILL.I.AM - at the Capital FM A-list Christmas performance on Saturday night. Taylor was secretly whisked into a VIP area to watch the band perform - out of sight of the fans. And while Harry might seem smitten with his new romance - the increasing amount of time he has been spending canoodling with the pop star doesn't seem to have gone down too well with the rest of the band. Guess it's no longer a secret than? Taylor Swift emerged from her New York hotel room holding hands with Harry Styles last week . A source told the Sun: 'Her presence has stirred tensions in the band as Harry’s now spending most of his time with her, and jetted into the gig on her private jet instead of coming in with the rest of the lads.' The loved-up pair were spotted holding hands as Harry took her out . for another date in New York on Thursday.

And with both stars in New York for work commitments, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to get to know each other even better. They were first spotted together in public last Sunday, when they went for a romantic stroll through New York's iconic Central Park, although they were both joined by their entourage. Since, Harry has been spotted emerging from the Love Story singer's hotel room several times this week, making no secret of their budding love affair.","Harry abandoned the rest of his bandmates who flew to London on domestic flight landing at Heathrow yesterday .

"Voters support plans for gay  marriage and believe it is wrong  for the Government to ban the Church of England from conducting the ceremonies. And public opinion is evenly divided over whether marriage is a ‘sacred act between a man and a woman’ and cannot be regarded as the same between same-sex couples. But they are sceptical about David Cameron’s motives for backing the new laws – only one in seven says he is doing it because he thinks it is right in principle. Poll: Voters support plans for gay  marriage and believe it is wrong  for the Government to ban the Church of England from conducting the ceremonies . An overwhelming two out of three say he is trying to curry favour with those with trendy views. The results of a Mail on Sunday poll, conducted by Survation, suggest strong support for gay rights across a wide range of issues among most voters, but with sharp differences between the young and old. Overall, six out of ten support  the gay marriage plan. Among the under-35s, it soars to 73 per cent;  by contrast, 56 per cent of over-55s are against. The poll will intensify the debate over claims by Right-wing Tory MPs that the party’s stance on same-sex marriages is resulting in its traditional supporters switching to the anti-EU UKIP party, which opposes gay marriage. UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, now has nearly half as much support among the public as the Tories,  and over 50 per cent more than the Lib Dems. Labour is ahead on 38 per cent, with the Conservatives on 30, UKIP 14 and Lib Dems nine.However, the poll offers conflicting evidence over whether Mr  Cameron would have anything to gain by dropping his support for gay marriage. A total of 23 per cent said they would be more likely to vote Tory if the Prime Minister did a U-turn, against 14 per cent who would be less likely to vote Tory. However, among those who voted Tory at the 2010 election, 50 per cent back gay marriage, with 50 per  cent against. And when the sample is whittled down to those who back the  Conservatives now, a total of 56 per cent support it, with 44 per cent against. Unsure: The public is sceptical about David Cameron's motives for backing the new laws - only one in seven says he is doing it because he thinks it is right in principle . Survation pollster Damian Lyons Lowe said: ‘The results suggest  Mr Cameron’s supporters are increasingly socially liberal. If he changes his mind, traditionally minded Conservatives who have defected to UKIP and other parties may return to the fold, but others who like his more progressive approach may walk out.’ The increasing acceptance of gay rights is reflected in the two-to-one support for the claim that to deny same-sex couples the right to  marry is discrimination. Welsh Tory MP David Davies caused controversy last week by claiming most parents preferred their children not to be gay, partly so they could have grandchildren. A total of 53 per cent said they agreed with Mr Davies, with 41 per cent against. Many gay marriage critics have said a marriage cannot be sacred between two people of the same sex. A total of 42 per cent agreed – 42 per cent said they disagreed. The Government’s plan to allow gay marriages in churches, with the exception of the Church of England, is rejected by voters. While nearly six in ten say the Church of England has every right to oppose gay marriages, only one in three says Mr Cameron is right  to ban the C  of  E from conducting gay marriages. More than half say the C  of  E vicars should be allowed to conduct gay marriages if they wish to. But regardless of their opinion on gay marriage, most people think MPs should focus on more important matters. Fewer than one in four say it is a priority for Parliament; more than 60 per cent say it does not deserve such attention. Survation interviewed 1,003 people online on Friday and yesterday.","The results of a Mail on Sunday poll suggest strong support for gay rights across a .

"Flowers, dress, caterer and a priest brave enough to jump out of a perfectly good plane... that was the to-do list for daredevil newlyweds Jessy Schild and Ingo Mueller before they took the most literal of leaps into married life. Love was clearly in the air for the thrill-seeking duo as they exchanged vows on board a plane and then jumped out of it from 16,000ft with the best man, bridesmaid and the pastor close behind. Jessy, 32 and Ingo, 46, from Freiburg, Germany, then sealed their union with a kiss in mid-air. Scroll down for video . Love is in the air: Jessy Schild and Ingo Mueller kiss after exchanging their vows at 16,000ft . After releasing their parachutes and romantically floating to the ground the happy couple landed to cheers from guests waiting to congratulate them. Ingo is an experienced skydiver and president of the local skydiving club with more than 1,000 jumps to his name, but Jessy had to do a tandem jump with an instructor. Both were in their element though, and the instructor attached to Jessy's back came in handy when the pair combined in freefall for a smooch. Time to leap: The couple and their wedding party prepare to jump from the plane . Sealed with a kiss: The instructor tandem jumping with Jessy helps the pair have a smooch in freefall . Jessy said the wedding took over a year to plan and the stakes were higher than most weddings when it came to the weather. But she said the toughest part of the organisation was finding a pastor to perform the ceremony who was willing to take a leap of faith with them. 'Ingo has been at the SkyHigh club for 20 years and is an active jumper, I have done many tandem skydive jumps so I came up with the idea of having our ceremony inside the aircraft,' said Jessy, who helps skydivers prepare to jump and edits their videos. 'For us a skydive was the best way to close our marriage. The biggest challenge was to find a pastor brave enough to jump with us. Back to earth: The happy couple arrive on the ground to cheers from their waiting guests . Exchanging rings: Finding a priest willing to jump was the hardest part of their wedding preparations . Blushing bride: Jessy jumped in her wedding dress with full hair and make, and high-top sneakers . 'We felt super happy to jump from the plane as man and wife and to be able to freefall together with our bridesmaid, best man and the pastor was amazing. 'It was very cold (-18 degrees celcius) at the exit altitude of 4,700 metres but beautiful.' While not worried about the jump, Jessy admits there were some shaky moments during the in-air ceremony. 'We were more worried about the pastor his hands were shaking throughout the ceremony,' she said. No sign of nerves: Jessy appears relaxed as she soars through the air after their airplane wedding ceremony . Leap of faith: The priest (bottom) did his first tandem skydive after marrying Jessy and Ingo . 'At one point he was shaking so much he even dropped one of the rings, luckily we found it quickly. 'We were lucky that the weather was good enough for us to jump otherwise the wedding would have took place at the airport and we'd have done the jump the next day. Ingo said his wedding day was 'perfect'. 'I was just so happy to hear Jessy say ""yes"" - it was a wonderful day thanks to all the nice people who helped make it possible,' the groom says. Oliver Furrer, who captured the couple's skydive wedding on camera, said it was a magical day. Grounded couple: Ingo and Jessy land within moments of each other as their life together begun . Formal proceedings: Ingo suited up and Jessy switched her high-tops for heels once on the ground . He said: 'It was really something unique, I've been skydiving for many years and never seen anything like this. 'Despite wearing her wedding dress and having just had her hair done the bride seemed to take the jump well, she wasn't nervous at all. 'The pastor was the most nervous, he'd never skydived before so I think he was a little scared. 'With so many people jumping all at the same time it could have been dangerous, there's a chance people can collide in the air. 'But luckily the instructors were very safe and knew exactly what they were doing. Everything went perfectly.'","Jessy Schild, 32, and Ingo Mueller, 46, got married at 16,000ft .

"If you have ever wondered what - or who - your partner dreams about, there’s an app for that. Curious people can use their smartphone to record what their partners say in their sleep, perhaps revealing details and desires they might keep to themselves during the day. The Sleep Talk Recorder app listens for noises while people slumber and starts recording the second it hears any mumbling during the night. Scroll down for video . Dreams revealed: The Sleep Talk Recorder app (pictured) listens for mumbling and sleep talking while people slumber and starts recording the split second it hears any noise during the night to reveal what partners are dreaming about . People have more weird and wonderful dreams around the time of the full moon, a British study found. The content of our dreams doesn’t vary with the seasons or with the days of the week, it showed. But in the week or so surrounding a full moon, they are decidedly more ‘weird and bizarre’. Psychologist Richard Wiseman made the surprise discovery as he analysed the experiences of 1,000 volunteers who were played sounds as they slept. The findings build on Swiss research last year which found we take longer to fall asleep, sleep for 20 minutes less and sleep less soundly at full moon. Production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is also altered. Professor Wiseman believes that this may disturb our dreams. Another, stranger explanation is that we evolved to be sensitive to the moon’s rhythms. Upon waking the next morning, users can check their smartphone and listen to what they or their partner has blurted out during the night. They can also share a clip of their sleepy musings on Facebook or Twitter. The sensitivity of the iPhone app, which costs 69p, can be adjusted to give people the best change of capturing any sleep talking. Martin Lindau from Gothenburg, Sweden, came up with the idea for the app and said: ‘Sleep Talk Recorder monitors your sleep, but it's not just an ongoing recording. ‘An advanced filtering function qualifies sounds and triggers Sleep Talk Recorder technology in a millisecond.’ ‘We think most people are curious of what is happening during their sleep and when they're not conscious. So we thought that it must be a way to catch this in an easy way using your smartphone. ‘Many users have reported their delight in finally having solid evidence that their partner snores or saying funny stuff.’ Sleep talking recorded: Upon waking the next morning, users can . check their smartphone and listen to what they or their partners have . blurted out during the night.The app organises the sound files (pictured left) and makes it easy for people to see how often they talk in their sleep (right) and if there are any patterns . The iPhone app also saves the recordings and plots them on a timeline so people can spot any patterns in their night time conversations. Emma Jones, a shop assistant from Portsmouth, Hampshire, has been living with her boyfriend for three years and says he talks during the night. The 29-year-old said: ‘My boyfriend . James is always talking in his sleep and I'm hoping to finally hear what . he is saying using this new app. ‘I . must admit I am a bit worried, though. It would be awful if it turns . out he is muttering his ex-girlfriend's name or a girl that we both . know. ‘If I wake up one . day, look at the app and find out he has been dreaming about another . girl - he could end up sleeping on the floor!’ Dreamers beware: The app could be used by couples to find out what - or whom - each person is dreaming about, which could prove awkward if it turns out they are subconsciously thinking about an ex or something inappropriate and blurting it out in the night .","The Sleep Talk Recorder app listens for .

"NBC Sports Network has decided to cancel a hunting show after the host, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, likened his critics to Adolf Hitler. The network sparked outrage after airing an episode of Tony Makris's show, 'Under Wild Skies,' in which Makris kills an African elephant by shooting it in the face and then celebrates the hunt by drinking champagne. In response to his critics, Makris went on an NRA-sponsored radio show and accused them of 'animal racism' for jumping to the defense of elephants as opposed to other animals. Scroll down for video . 'Under Wild Skies' host Tony Makris stands beside an elephant he just killed with the help of a hunting guide (right) Makris explains how he was aiming for the elephant's face when he fired several shots at the animal . Makris, pictured, hits the animal - but does not kill it. The elephant shrieks in pain and runs off, but doesn't get far enough away to escape its fate. 'And [critics] said but they're so . big and special and they're smarter. And I went, you know, Hitler would . have said the same thing,' he said. NBC Sports has canceled 'Under Wild Skies' as a result of his remarks. '""Under . Wild Skies"" will no longer air on NBC Sports Sports Network due to the . program’s close association with its host, whose recent comments . comparing his critics to Hitler are outrageous and unacceptable,' the . network told Deadspin in a statement. 'NBCSN will continue to air all of our other quality outdoor programming.' The episode where Makris kills an elephant is filmed in Botswana, where elephant hunting remains legal until 2014, when a new law against hunting the endangered animals kicks into effect. In a highlighted reel from the show, Makris . and the guide are shown hiding behind brush about 20 feet away from the animal. They . talk about shooting it in the face before Makris fires a couple shots. 'I'm bent over literally shootin' through a hole in the trees,' he says to the guide, just before firing the two shots.

'Somebody got a little cheeky there,' he says breathlessly, apparently referring to the elephant's struggle to stay alive. 'Can we shoot some birds this afternoon, or...?' he adds. In the next shot, Makris and the hunting guide are standing next to the lifeless elephant. 'You snuck us right in this guy's . bedroom,' Makris says, marveling at his work. 'I mean look at this, this . is where he hangs out!' 'He didn't know we were here, but what a hunt!' Afterwards, the men celebrate by drinking champagne. Deadspin, which first reported on the show, points out that a ban on hunting elephants is set to go into effect in Botswana in 2014. Some NBC Sports viewers are now calling on the network to cancel the show. Twitter user Mike Potter called NBC's airing of the show 'outrageous, obscene, unforgivable and just plain wrong.'

"A Pennsylvania mother and nurse could face jail time for carrying out an at-home abortion on her teen daughter, which sent the 16-year-old to the hospital. Jennifer Whlaen, 38, covered her face as she appeared in court earlier this month to face charges of illegally purchasing a $45 abortion kit from an overseas pharmacy when her daughter experienced an unwanted pregnancy in January 2012. Whalen says she purchased the kit because she couldn't find a local abortion clinic and didn't want to travel out of state. DIY: Pennsylvania mother Jennifer Whalen bought abortion drugs misoprotol (left) and mifepristone (right) online form an overseas drug store when her 16-year-old daughter experienced an unwanted pregnancy in January 2012 . Two weeks after administering misoprostol and mifepristone, Whalen rushed her daughter to the Geisinger Medical Center when she began bleeding and thought something was 'really wrong'. Medical records show that Whalen's daughter was treated for an 'incomplete abortion and a urinary tract infection' on February 6, 2012. The trip to the hospital alerted authorities to the DIY abortion, but it wasn't until two years later that Whalen was formally charged. The District Attorney explained the delayed charges saying the case 'was unusual and investigators had to research the drugs involved and other elements of the situation'. Incomplete abortion: halen's daughter was admitted to Geisinger medical center on February 6, 2012 when she started bleeding two weeks after taking the abortion drugs . The combination of drugs has been used by women in parts of Latin American and Africa where surgical abortions are harder to come by, according to Slate. According to Pennsylvania law, abortion drugs require a prescription, something Whalen says she didn't know about. Abortions there must also be carried out under the care of a doctor. Whalen says she is nurse, but doesn't have a nursing license. An article from last December reported that she worked at a nursing home. She is now facing a felony count of medical consultation and judgement in addition to misdemeanor charges of not being licensed as a pharmacist, endangering the welfare of a child and simple assault. Since one of the counts is a felony, it is possible that Whalen could face prison time. During her first court appearance, Whalen waived her right to a preliminary hearing. She has been free on$25,000 bail and her arraignment has been set for March. Her daughter is now 18.","Jennifer Whalen, 38, bought the kit for her then 16-year-old daughter in January 2012 when she experienced an unwanted pregnancy .

"The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was killed after a tree fell onto her static home while she was sleeping, desperately tried to comfort her as she lay dying, it has today been claimed. Tess Peirce was sleeping in a separate caravan to her daughter Bethany Freeman, when St Jude's Storm struck this morning. It is believed Ms Peirce had discovered the 30ft fallen fir tree across her Bethany's temporary bedroom when she left her own caravan and was trying to talk to her daughter while firefighters fought to free her. Despite attempts to resuscitate the teenager, she died a short while later at the scene. Neighbours Helen O'Connell and her partner Frederic Perdrix were at home next door to the barn in Hever, Kent, when Ms Peirce came round this morning urgently seeking help. Scroll down for video . Terrible accident: Bethany Freeman, 17, was crushed when this tree fell on her while she lay in bed (pictured). She was comforted by her mother but could not be saved . The 17-year-old girl died after a tree fell onto the static home she was sleeping in at Hever, Kent . Emergency services were called to the scene in Hever, Edenbridge, but the girl is believed to have died from her injuries . The caravan was parked in a yard when a tree fell onto it during the storm - crushing it completely . Ms O'Connell said: 'She came round here wanting some help. She was absolutely distraught. She said she had come out of her caravan this morning and had found the other caravan with her daughter in it had been flattened by a huge fallen tree. 'Tess said she could hear Beth speaking. She wanted our help to get her out. All the neighbours came out to try and help. 'A farmer came round with his JCB truck to try and lift the tree off the crushed caravan. 'It was awful. We were trying to console Tess while they tried to get Beth out. 'I think Tess was trying to talk to Beth, trying to comfort her. 'There was no power because the electricity had gone off so we couldn't use any power tools. Neighbours were rallying to find a petrol run chainsaw which eventually someone did. 'But eventually they said Beth had died and there was nothing anyone could do for her.' The neighbour said that Ms Peirce lived in one of the caravans with two of her three sons - one of them lived elsewhere. It is believed Ms Peirce had applied for planning permission to convert one of the buildings for her and her family to live in and the other building she planned to set up as respite accommodation for terminally ill people. The family were living in the caravans while the renovations were carried out. Ms Peirce added: 'It's such an awful tragedy. They are a really nice family. I feel so upset for them.'

He said: 'The police phoned me at half past seven this morning and said they needed my help. They said a young girl was trapped and they needed me to help lift something with my JCB. 'I ran down and got the truck and drove to where it was. Initially they told me to wait because there were firemen cutting branches off the tree. 'Then they called me forward and I used my truck to lift the caravan and tree off the girl. 'They got her out and tried to resuscitate her but it was no good. 'Apparently at 7 o'clock this morning she'd been able to speak to her mother from under the tree but there'd been nothing from her since then. 'Her mum and two brothers were completely devastated, they were inconsolable. There were absolutely horrific scenes. 'They'd been looking to build their dream home there and were living in the caravans while that was happening but they were having difficulties with getting planning permission. 'It's all so terribly tragic.' Meanwhile the search continues for a 14-year-old boy feared dead after being swept out to sea while playing in the surf - hours before 99 mph winds battered Britain.

"Today's storm was predicted to be the worst since the Great Storm of 1987, which battered England and Wales leaving 18 people dead and causing £1.5billion worth of damage to the economy. In the early hours of October 16 winds peaked at more than 120mph, damaging buildings and felling 15million trees in the south east of England. Millions of homes were left without . power for at least a few hours, with some having no electricity for days . as trees fell on power lines, disrupting supplies. Scroll down for video . Damage: An uprooted tree lies across a car in London after the Great Storm on October 15, 1987, which claimed 18 lives . Powerful: The highest gust recorded from the storm was at Gorleston, Norfolk, hitting 122mph . Whilst . most of England and Wales experienced wet and windy weather that night, . it was southern and eastern parts of England that were worst hit. The highest gust recorded from the storm was at Gorleston, Norfolk, hitting 122mph. A ship capsized at Dover, and a Channel ferry was driven ashore near Folkestone. Veteran weatherman Michael Fish bore . the brunt for famously telling the nation there was no hurricane in the . offing, just hours before it arrived. At the time Mr Fish told viewers tuning . into the broadcast: ‘Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC . and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you’re . watching, don’t worry, there isn’t, but having said that, actually, the . weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, . incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.’ Business as usual: A Routemaster driving through the streets of London after the strong winds .

Giles, who was chief forecaster at the time, admitted that he was in . fact responsible for the lunchtime broadcast on October 15 in 1987. It . was the worst storm since 1703 and a public enquiry was announced . shortly after the storm and an internal enquiry was conducted by the Met . Office. The official forecaster wrote: 'We now know that the strength of the storm was boosted by a . phenomenon known as the ‘Sting Jet’, where cold dry air descends into . storms high in the atmosphere. 'Rain . or snow falling into this jet of air evaporates and cools the air . further, adding more energy which translates into stronger winds. By the . time this ‘sting in the tail’ reaches the ground it can produce winds . of 100mph which are concentrated over a small area. 'In . 1987, no-one knew sting jets even existed, but now they are well . understood and included in forecast models. The storm which affected . Scotland in December 2011 was boosted by a sting jet, explaining the . maximum gust speed of 164mph recorded on top of Cairngorm.'","Winds of up to 120mph hit England and Wales in the early hours of October 16, 1987 and killed 18 people .

Honour: Lance Corporal Abbie Martin, a 20-year-old female Army medic who has been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service after bravely ignoring Taliban bullets whistling over her head to treat a dying colleague . She is among 118 servicemen and women who received awards in the operational honours list, published today. One is posthumous. Most of the honours go to troops who served with 12 Mechanised Brigade in Afghanistan between March and September last year. Lance Corporal Martin, from Haverhill, Suffolk, thought she would be working in field hospitals when she deployed to Helmand with the Royal Army Medical Corps. Lance Corporal Martin, from Haverhill, Suffolk, thought she would be working in field hospitals when she deployed to Helmand with the Royal Army Medical Corps . But a lack of medics meant she was instead attached to the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards. Five hours into her first patrol she was embroiled in a ferocious firefight while her unit took part in an operation to disrupt insurgent activity. Hearing the words ‘man down’ on her radio, she ran to treat his chest wounds as bullets peppered a wall behind her. Sadly, the wounded soldier, Guardsman Michael Roland, 27, later died. Lance Corporal Martin’s citation read: ‘Martin remained with the Guardsman throughout the casualty extraction, selflessly exposing herself to enemy fire.’ She said: ‘I’ve never been so scared in life. No one can prepare you for being shot at. ‘When you hear the bullets whizzing past your head and you know they’re close, your heart is racing and you think “What on earth am I doing here?”. ‘But you are the medic so you have to get there and save the person’s life. I remember thinking I am never going back again, not a chance. ‘But they [her comrades] need me and I need them. Lance Corporal Martin said she was ‘so proud’ to receive an award. ‘I am so in shock,’ she said. ‘I’m such a shy little girly girl so I never thought I would achieve anything in the Army.’ An Army officer who fought a Taliban insurgent despite his rifle jamming and being shot himself received the Military Cross. The Lance Corporal who saved him in the Upper Gereshk Valley, Helman Province, last July was also honoured. Captain John Scarlett, from the Coldstream Guards, and Lance Corporal Stephen Shaw, from the Royal Army Medical Corps, were in a patrol that fell under fire after an apparent ambush at an Afghan police checkpoint. As they were attacked by a gunman from a watchtower, three of their number were seriously wounded. Heroes: Captain John Scarlett, left, and Lance Corporal Stephen Shaw, right, were given the Military Cross . And as Captain Scarlett tried to rescue them his own rifle jammed, forcing him to use his pistol. He was shot in the leg and body armour but dragged to safety by Lance Corporal Shaw, who gave him life-saving medical treatment, as well as later treating the other casualties. Both men are awarded the Military Cross, given in recognition of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land. Captain Scarlett, 26, from Dulwich, south London, said: 'It’s obviously an absolute honour to be awarded the MC, but in no way do I see this as an individual achievement. 'My initial reaction was to know what the other guys got and I was really pleased when I heard Cpl Shaw had got it. 'I wasn’t the only person whose life was saved by Cpl Shaw, he does it a lot.' Lance Corporal Shaw, 24, from Heywood, Greater Manchester, added: 'It feels good, it’s a great honour. But it was a team effort.' The gunman was eventually captured, and the men airlifted to safety - but the three injured soldiers died. In his citation, 26-year-old Captain Scarlett was said to have 'displayed the very highest standards of leadership, courage, selfless commitment and gallantry.' Lance Corporal Shaw's citation said: 'Shaw’s actions during that horrific attack were in the very finest traditions of the British Army, demonstrating conspicuous courage, commitment and professionalism.' Brave: Lance Corporal Lawrence Kayser MC, of The Royal Anglian Regiment who has been awarded the Military Cross . A soldier who found himself just a few metres from enemy fighters hiding behind a wall risked his life to single-handedly drive them off. Lance Corporal Lawrence Kayser of Mill Hill, London, has been awarded the Military Cross for his bravery, and patrolling for five hours afterwards despite a grenade injury. Lance Corporal Kayser, 27, of The 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment, was part of a platoon of soldiers taken by air deep into enemy territory as part of Operation Maahi Buzurg - an attempt to clear a notorious insurgent-held area. The platoon was involved in a series of deadly battles over the next 10 days, one of which could have ended disastrously but for the soldier’s courage and quick thinking. In the early hours of June 21 the platoon had waited for hours to ambush a known insurgent route in Gereshk Valley. At around dawn, and by pure chance, a group of enemy fighters had positioned themselves beyond a wall in a compound just three metres away. Moments later a single insurgent rose above the wall, only to see 20 ISAF soldiers beneath him. A ferocious fire-fight erupted. Lance Corporal Kayser, positioned near the rear of the platoon and, nearest to the insurgent, realised all the men were now at risk from an attack coming from the adjacent compound. He leapt from his ditch and sprinted around the wall in case Taliban were there. His judgment proved excellent as entering the compound he came face to face with an insurgent fighter. Both fired and luckily, while the insurgent missed him, Lance Corporal Kayser managed to clip the insurgent in the abdomen. Lance Corporal l Kayser, who is based in Bulford, Wiltshire, pursued him before a grenade was hurled into the alleyway, landing just metres from his feet. He was struck on the arm with shrapnel from the blast. Despite a 'bee sting' sensation in his arm he pressed forward and the enemy fled, allowing him to clear the rest of the compound. It was only when he returned to his base five hours later that he discovered the extent of his shrapnel wounds. He said: 'I’m humbled but I have seen a lot of brave actions in theatre so I’m not sure I’m worthy of it. I’ve never been a medal man. But my parents are ecstatic.' An RAF sergeant who took on the Taliban when they attacked the allied forces’ main base in Afghanistan while Prince Harry was there has been awarded the Military Cross. Sergeant Roy Geddes, 43, from Elgin, Moray, jumped in a Jackal armoured vehicle after hearing explosions and gunfire on the north eastern side of Camp Bastion airfield. Racing to the scene his vehicle was hit by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG). Despite sustaining a knee injury and being unable to manoeuvre, the father-of-three ignored the wound to command his men and orchestrate the defence. Sergeant Roy Geddes (right), who receives the Military Cross and Corporal Kurt Lee, who is Mentioned In Despatches . The attack on Bastion happened on September 14 last year after night fell. Fifteen insurgents, dressed in Army uniform, caused millions of pounds of damage by blowing up five Harrier jets and fuel storage areas. The insurgents - 14 of whom were killed and one captured - were equipped with massive firepower and attacked on three fronts, injuring eight British personnel and killing two US Marines. Sgt Geddes was finally only extracted for medical help because his squadron commander ordered it. He said: 'This isn’t just for me, it is for the whole team. 'I couldn’t have asked any more of them on that night.' Corporal Kurt Lee, an RAF section commander, was mentioned in despatches for his involvement in the incident. Award: Lieutenant Commander Al Nekrews who defused a series of complex devices in Afghanistan during a 16-hour period, despite soaring temperatures and threat of attack . A Royal Navy explosives expert who defused a series of complex devices in Afghanistan during a 16-hour period, despite soaring temperatures and threat of attack, has been awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. Lieutenant Commander Al Nekrews, 40, is the Navy's first ever high-threat improvised explosive device (IED) operator and was deployed to Afghanistan for seven months in 2012 where he led a four-man team in Nahr-e Saraj, one of the busiest districts. On May 25, Lieutenant Commander Nekrews, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, and his team were dispatched to the scene of an explosion that had injured a British soldier and discovered what appeared to be a rug draped over barbed wire protecting a ditch. But the rug contained two complex devices which took 16 hours over two days to defuse manually after attempts to make them safe with a robot failed. While the road was protected by soldiers to the north and south, Lieutenant Commander Nekrews was vulnerable to attack from the east and west which could not be covered because of the threat of further buried explosives. On receiving the Queen's Gallantry Medal, he said: 'It was quite surreal. I am really proud of what I have achieved and my family are obviously all delighted as well. 'I should also praise the efforts of my team, Leading Diver Craig Waghorn and Sergeant Craig Simpson - I always trusted their judgment and it was invaluable to have that support.'","Abbie Martin among 118 service personnel to receive military honours .

"Russian cyber criminals have destroyed a pump used to supply water to thousands of homes in Illinois, according to an infrastructure control systems expert. Hackers accessed the public water facility in the city of Springfield and are believed to have then broken the pump by remotely turning it on and off in quick succession. The incident, which took place on November 8, sets a worrying precedent for security officials - particularly after another hacker has since claimed to have taken control of a second U.S. facility. Hackers using a computer in Russia have accessed an Illinois public water facility and are believed to have then broken the pump by remotely turning it on and off quickly . Joe Weiss, who advises utilities on how to protect themselves against hackers, told the AFP news agency: 'This is arguably the first case where we have had a hack of critical infrastructure from outside the United States that caused damage. 'That is what is so big about this. They could have done anything because they had access to the master station.' The attack, which is being investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Department For Homeland Security (DHS), has been traced to a computer in Russia, Mr Weiss said. It first came to light after Mr Weiss, of Applied Control Solutions, posted on his blog quotations taken from a one-page report by the Illinois Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center. The report said hackers obtained access using stolen login names and passwords. These were taken during a hack on a . U.S. company that makes Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software, which is used around the world to control machines in . critical industrial facilities. SCADA . software is in place at nuclear power stations and oil rigs; the . Illinois infiltration therefore sets a frightening precedent. Mr . Weiss said: 'We don't know how many other SCADA systems have been . compromised because they don't really have cyber forensics.' Further embarrassment: A second hacker has posted this screenshot of the internal control systems for a waste water treatment plant in South Houston . A Twitter profile picture of the South Houston hacker - he claimed said that the water system was only protected by a three-character password . He claimed the report said 'glitches' in the remote access system for the pump had been notices for months before the pump was destroyed. 'No one realised the hackers were in there until they started turning on and off the pump,' he said. Peter Boogaard, a spokeman for the DHS, said: 'At this time there is no credible corroborated data that indicates a risk to critical infrastructure entities or a threat to public safety.' However, a hacker using the online name 'pr0f' has responded to Mr Boogaard's statement by claiming to have taken control of a second U.S. public facility, this time in South Houston, Texas. Astonishingly, he said that SCADA system was only protected by a three-character password. To prove his point, he then posted links - on the Pastebin website - to what he claims are screenshots of the internal control systems for the waste water treatment plant. The issue of securing SCADA systems from cyber attacks made international headlines last year after the mysterious Stuxnet virus attacked a centrifuge at a uranium enrichment facility in Iran. Many experts said that was a major setback for Iran's nuclear weapons program and attribute the attack to the U.S. and Israel. In 2007, researchers at the U.S. government's Idaho National Laboratories identified a vulnerability in the electric grid, demonstrating how much damage a cyber attack could inflict on a large diesel generator. Lani Kass, who retired in September as senior policy adviser to the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said America should take the possibility of a cyber attack seriously. She said: 'The going in hypothesis is always that it's just an incident or coincidence. And if every incident is seen in isolation, it's hard - if not impossible - to discern a pattern or connect the dots. 'Failure to connect the dots led us to be surprised on 9/11.' Representative Jim Lanvevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said that the report of the attack highlighted the need to pass legislation to improve cyber security of the U.S. critical infrastructure. He said: 'The stakes are too high for us to fail, and our citizens will be the ones to suffer the consequences of our inaction.'","Attacks on critical infrastructure set worrying precedent for security officials .

"An Iraq war veteran who has lived with extensive injuries since being paralyzed during the conflict has admitted that he no longer has the will to live. For nearly a decade, veteran Tomas Young, has been living in chronic pain after being paralyzed by a sniper's bullet four days into his first assignment in the Middle East. Now the married 33-year-old, who can no longer eat solid foods, plans to refuse nourishment as he is tired of the exhaustive struggle that his life has become. Scroll down for video . Sick and tired: Tomas Young was paralyzed his fourth day serving in Iraq in 2004; now in hospice care, he is planning to refuse nourishment in a few weeks after a string of health complications . Injured: Tomas, pictured in 2007, was hit by a sniper's bullet in Iraq in 2004 . All you need is love: Claudia, pictured with Tomas, says their journey together has been hard but not sad . Two days after the September 11 . attacks, Mr Young, from Kansas City, Oklahoma, joined the Army to . serve his country in a time of chaos. In 2004, Mr Young was sent to Sadr City, Iraq. Four days after being deployed, he was shot by a sniper. He was hit in the collarbone on April 4 while riding in an unarmored Humvee and was instantly paralyzed. The . unconscious private was transferred to the Walter Reed Army Medical . Center outside of Washington, D.C., by way of Kuwait and Germany. Speaking with the Kansas City Star, Young said that his wife, Claudia Cuellar understands and supports his decision to die. ‘I’m sick and tired of being sick . and tired,’ he explained to the paper, adding that his medications . frequently leave him lethargic and nauseated.’ Mr Young was fitted with a colostomy bag meaning that he . can no longer eat solid foods. His wife doesn’t cook anymore so as to . help her husband not to think about food. Now in hospice care, Young says his mind is clear. Mr Young goes to Washington: Tomas Young pictured the Capitol building in the 2007 documentary 'Body of War' Men of war: In his note, Young blasts former President George W. Bush, pictured on March 13, 2003, and former Vice President Dick Cheney, who once said 'the American people will not support a policy of retreat' amid complaints during the increasingly unpopular war . ‘You . don’t have to struggle through every day just to make it because you’re . expected by society to endure until you die naturally or are murdered,’ he told the Star. Speaking with Democracy Now, Young . said that nothing would change his decision to end his life. He said . that if he weren’t in constant pain, he would explore other options. ‘We wouldn’t be having this conversation,’ he said. He hopes his public struggles, death and legacy will bring more attention to the terrible price of the war. Mr Young, . who was featured in the powerful 2007 documentary ‘Body of War,’ has . published a letter on the 10th anniversary of the Iraq conflict on TruthDig.com. 'You may evade justice, but in our eyes . you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of . murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans whose future you stole.' Veteran Tomas Young . As one of his final, poignant acts, the veteran addressed former president George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney accusing them of ‘egregious war crimes of plunder and finally of murder'. He spoke out against the former leaders for starting a war that he says achieved . nothing but killing and maiming a generation of soldiers, all while furthering America's thirst for oil. Mr Young writes: ‘I write . this letter, my last letter, to you, Mr Bush and Mr Cheney. 'I write not . because I think you grasp the terrible human and moral consequences of . your lies, manipulation and thirst for wealth and power. ‘I . write this letter because, before my own death, I want to make it clear . that I, and hundreds of thousands of my fellow veterans, along with . millions of my fellow citizens, along with hundreds of millions more in . Iraq and the Middle East, know fully who you are and what you have . done.’ The veteran continues: ‘You may evade justice, but in our eyes you are each . guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of murder, . including the murder of thousands of young Americans – my fellow . veterans – whose future you stole.' It isn’t the first time the war-wounded veteran has expressed his opinion on the war. He was featured in Phil Donahue’s 2007 documentary, ‘Body of War,’ and also spoke with ’60 Minutes’ about his ordeal. ‘Body of War’ explored Young’s many health issues, which include a brain injury, a . pulmonary embolism and a blockage of the lung. Meaningful: In the documentary, Young went to visit ground zero in Manhattan; he joined the Army two days after the September 11 attacks . War and peace: Left, the cover of the New York Times the day Bush declared war on Iraq in 2003; and right, the poster for the 2007 documentary 'Body of War,' in which Young is featured . Much like Ron Kovic, a . patriot-turned-anti-war-activist from the Vietnam war, Young began . seeing his country in a different light following his time on the . frontlines. He saw on the news that his friends . and fellow American soldiers were still being killed in Iraq, even . though there were no so-called weapons of mass destruction in the . country, and began a slow shift to becoming a voice against the Iraq . War. In the closing of his letter, he writes: ‘My day of reckoning is upon me. Yours will come. I hope you will be put on trial. 'But . mostly I hope for your sakes, that you find the moral courage to face . what you have done to me and to many, many others who deserved to live.’ Ready to die: Young, right, and his wife, Claudia Cuellar, who has been taking care of him as his health continues to deteriorate; she says she supports his decision to die .","Army veteran Tomas Young enrolled in the Army two days after 9/11 .

Superstar club DJ Pete Tong has said he is happy for his name to have become a byword for something gone wrong, as he was awarded an MBE by the Duke of Cambridge. The Radio 1 presenter was honoured for a career in broadcasting and music that has seen him progress from running a mobile disco to launching a record label and becoming an in-demand producer. His name has passed into the language as rhyming slang for 'wrong' - with the phrase 'it’s all gone Pete Tong' used to describe a mishap. After receiving the award from William during a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony Tong said a fanzine first used the phrase 'as an affectionate slap around the head', but 'it just stuck and turned into an amazing legacy - I’ve never had a problem with it'. It was also used as the name of a comedy movie where a DJ realises he is becoming deaf. Tong added: 'The movie obviously was great fun - why run away from something that’s so catchy so I use it as my brand really when I do parties around the world.' Speaking about his career the DJ said: 'I’ve been standing here for a few hours waiting to do this and still have to pinch myself - I’ve spent my career doing something I love, playing records. 'There are so many worthy people here today, I feel quite humbled by all the servicemen, policemen and the charity workers and people like that. So I count myself lucky to be recognised in this way.' The 53-year-old, who relocated to Los Angeles from the UK last year supervised the soundtracks for films such as The Beach and 24 Hour Party People and has released a lengthy list of compilations and mix albums. The 53-year-old behind the decks during a set an Ibiza nightclub . His musical interest began in his youth as a drummer but he progressed to DJ-ing and after leaving school he started up a mobile disco and then set up his own club night in London as well as booking bands. Tong’s specialist knowledge helped him to become a music writer on Blues And Soul magazine but after four years he went to work for music label London Records as an A&R man. After hosting a soul show on a Kent radio station, he went on to land a show on Capital Radio. Three years later in 1991 he was given a dance show on Radio 1, the Essential Selection which has helped him to become one of the most in-demand club DJs in the UK and with seasons in Ibiza, and he continues to present for the station. While his radio career was building, Tong continued his record company interests with his own label FFRR releasing music by dance acts such as Utah Saints as well as groups such as Fine Young Cannibals and Hothouse Flowers.

"English rugby is experiencing a major culture shock this season – Saracens are in danger of becoming lovable. The north London club have been successful in recent years, but they haven’t been market leaders in winning hearts and minds. In fact, they have been adept at getting under the skin of opponents, rival supporters and neutrals alike. Engine room: Billy Vunipola has been a big part of Saracens exceptional season so far . Talent: Andy Farrell was a coach at Saracens before England managed to convince him to join their staff . There has been a perception issue. They . have been derided for being a South African out-post, for a rigid . tactical approach and for seemingly antagonistic antics – from a grating . anthem at home to away-day ambush stunts. They have attracted grumbles . about squad size and what is seen as a defiant, us-against-the-world . mind-set. Yet, there are increasing reasons why this team who have been respected, sometimes feared, but not widely liked and admired, deserve more credit these days. They will go to Toulouse on Sunday for a seismic Heineken Cup showdown as standard-bearers for the Aviva Premiership, with a real chance of winning and progressing to the knock-out stages. Their quest should generate widespread support from these shores, due to their transformation. This season, Saracens have become a pleasure to watch. They have already scored almost as many league tries as they did in the entire 2012-13 campaign, after instigating a fundamental change in approach, to great effect. They are off-loading, creating space and running amok. Altered strategy is not the sole reason for greater admiration. Despite the South African links, they are contributing heavily to England’s cause – with a multitude of players in the national squads. The RFU wanted Andy Farrell, Saracens released him, and eventually lost him. Now Paul Gustard is being seconded to the union, as a rising defence guru. The club’s boot-room culture is creating a generation of accomplished, home-grown coaches. This is also a club with down-to-earth values behind all the stellar names and financial clout. There is a commitment to hard graft and a band-of-brothers unity – epitomised last Saturday at Gloucester as they stood their ground when reduced to 13 men, and celebrated each mini triumph with gusto. Yet, alongside the core culture, there is also ambition and innovation. Saracens have a world view and they finally have a worthy home too, complete with a state-of-the-art artificial surface. They worked hard to convince the local community in Barnet that this could be an asset to be shared. Now they are going some way to convincing the wider rugby public that they deserve to be loved. Flourishing: England's Alex Goode has been picked in the England squad again . France coach Philippe Saint-Andre is in buoyant mood ahead of his side’s Six Nations opener against England in Paris. The reason for his positivity is the improved access to his players, with a new agreement meaning they are available for training two weeks prior to the championship. They will first gather near Perpignan, to benefit from good weather before relocating to their regular base; Marcoussis, near Paris. France have their four-yearly chance to benefit from the aftermath of a Lions tour by dominating the Six Nations, but they have been a mess in recent times. As ever, Saint-Andre has an array of talented players at his disposal, typified by the centres in his squad; Wesley Fofana, Mathieu Bastareaud, Maxime Mermoz and young Toulouse sensation, Gael Fickou. More access: Philippe Saint-Andre will now be able to train his team for a fortnight before the Six Nations . But the coach cannot fall into the modern trap of assuming more access automatically ensures more success. With the clock ticking in the countdown to the World Cup, it is time for Saint-Andre to prove his worth at Test level. A major excuse for failure has been removed. France must deliver. Bristol clearly mean business. Having already established a hard-hitting management team led by director of rugby Andy Robinson, supported by head coach Sean Holley, the West Country club are now seeking to build a pedigree squad. The signings of ex-Wales and Lions scrum half, Dwayne Peel, and Bath’s imposing Samoan prop, Anthony Perenise, indicate growing ambitions and financial backing to support the drive to return to the Premiership. This column remains resolutely neutral, of course, but welcomes the prospect of a traditional power-house of the English game reclaiming a place among the elite. Bristol is a hot-bed of rugby with a strong, thriving league structure in the city and surrounding area. It is an area that deserves a top team to follow. Building up a strong squad: Sale's Dwayne Peel is set to join Bristol at the end of the season . There has been much amusement in recent days after the IRB declared – mid-season, with the Six Nations approaching – that the new scrum engagement process was being adjusted yet again. The decision has been made to do away with the referee’s call of ‘yes nine’, to clear the scrum half to feed the ball in. Instead, officials will make a signal or gesture. Cue endless tongue-in-cheek suggestions about what that might entail; a wink or a cough being among the more sensible ones put forward. On the one hand, the move is a sensible tweak to remove an audible alert to the pack challenging the put-in, so that the team in possession have a fighting chance to withstand the eight-man shove. But the renewed tinkering and the somewhat comical nature of this amendment does not show the game in a particularly positive light. Alterations: The scrum rules are going to be changed another time by the IRB . Former England Sevens coach Ben Ryan, now in charge of Fiji, has not been ‘paid a penny’ since taking charge of the Pacific-island nation’s team at the start of the season. Despite making a positive impression and overseeing victory in the Dubai Sevens tournament, Ryan has been relying on his own savings to fulfil his role. The Fijian Rugby Union insist that he agreed to serve the first three months of his contract on a ‘voluntary’ basis and if that is the case, he deserves considerable credit for a selfless gesture. The FRU are seeking government funding to start paying Ryan’s salary but ideally the IRB should intervene. While the world governing body are investing in the Pacific islands, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga remain poor but hugely important rugby countries and more help is needed. Selfless: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan has not received a salary for the first three months of his time in charge . There are growing indications that the sport has reached a global tipping point. News has emerged from Australia that the Wallabies’ captain, Ben Mowen, has opted to sign a lucrative deal with Montpellier, rather than play for his country at the next World Cup. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that New Zealand wing Zac Guildford has agreed to join Clermont Auvergne, instead of pursuing his Test ambitions. Piles of Euros are threatening the primacy of international rugby. Increasingly, players who are young and ambitious, or in their prime, are rejecting the lure of national service in order to gain financial stability and a change of lifestyle. Right choice? Ben Mowen has chosen Montpellier's money over playing for Australia in the next World Cup . This situation has been hampering Tier Two countries for many years, but it is now becoming a problem for leading nations too. No-one should begrudge an individual the right to maximise their earnings, but the fluid worldwide transfer market is in danger of diluting the standard of the international game. It would be a shame if rugby rapidly went the way of football, with clubs dominant and countries a mere after-thought.","Saracens are starting to gain the credit they deserve .

"Almost one million tickets were snapped up for Rugby World Cup 2015 during last month's general sale, tournament organisers have announced. And there were 650,000 ticket applications alone for England's pivotal pool clash against Australia at Twickenham next autumn, with 500,000 for the World Cup final next October. Tickets went on general sale for an 18-day period, and 23 out of the 48 tournament games went to a ballot at every price category. England captain Chris Robshaw barges over to score against Australia at Twickenham in November . Total ticket applications were more than five million, which is a higher level of demand than for any of the previous seven Rugby World Cup tournaments. Unsuccessful applicants in the September sale will be given priority when remaining tickets go on sale by the end of November. Games that attracted the highest ticket demand apart from England versus Australia, were other pool matches of England against Wales, world champions New Zealand versus Argentina and Australia against Wales, plus both semi-finals and the final. There were 650,000 ticket applications alone for England's pivotal pool clash against Australia at Twickenham . England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans said: 'We are thrilled with demand for tickets a year out from the tournament, and the record level of demand we saw in September is a terrific indicator of the general interest and excitement for Rugby World Cup 2015. 'Demand has exceeded supply for a high number of our matches, and the only downside of such strong demand is that there will inevitably be some disappointment when rugby fans are notified of the results of their applications on Saturday. 'We would like to thank everyone who applied for tickets, and anyone who missed out on tickets this time will get first priority when the remaining tickets go back on sale next month.' England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans was delighted with the incredible demand for tickets . And International Rugby Board chairman Bernard Lapasset added: 'We are delighted with the incredible demand for tickets across the tournament from fans in the UK and around the world. 'Rugby World Cup is all about the fans and the players, and today's announcement reinforces our belief that Rugby World Cup 2015 will be a very special record-breaking celebration of rugby and the host nation. It really is too big to miss.' Sports Minister Helen Grant, meanwhile, said sales boded well for 'a fantastic tournament', adding: 'I am sure the atmosphere will be absolutely electric and England 2015 will further cement this country's reputation as one of the best in the world for hosting major sports events.' In addition to the 950,000 tickets sold in the September sale, 340,000 tickets were sold by England Rugby 2015 to fans through rugby clubs in England and Wales as part of the Rugby Community Programme, while the overall sales figure will increase through the November sale. Official hospitality for the tournament is also moving along at record pace, with all boxes sold out at Twickenham, Exeter's Sandy Park and the Falmer Stadium in Brighton.","There were 650,000 ticket applications alone for England's pivotal pool clash against Australia at Twickenham .

"More than two weeks after TMZ released tapes of Donald Sterling making racist comments, the 80-year-old Clippers owner has broken his silence to apologize and ask for forgiveness. Sterling gave his first interview to CNN at his home in Beverley Hills, telling Anderson Cooper he isn't racist and that he believes estranged 31-year-old girlfriend V. Stiviano duped him by recording their private conversations. The interview was recorded Sunday and will air in full Monday night on Anderson Cooper 360. Scroll down for video . When Cooper spoke about the accusations that Sterling had a 'plantation mentality', the 80-year-old said that the CNN presenter was more of a racist than he was . In a preview of the interview, Sterling is recorded saying he is sorry for his racist comments and for the many people hurt by his actions. 'I'm not a racist,' Sterling tells Cooper. 'I made a terrible, terrible mistake. And I’m here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I’ve hurt.' Sterling was originally supposed to . appear with Stiviano for interviews with both Cooper and Barbara Walters . last week, but dropped out at the last minute. Stiviano followed . through to do an interview with Walters solo, while it appeared at first . that Cooper came up empty handed. The woman behind the tapes: Sterling's estranged girlfriend V. Stiviano was the first to speak about the scandal in an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters last week . When asked why it took him so long to respond to the recordings, in which he tells V. Stiviano not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in pictures, he says he has been too 'emotionally distraught'. 'I caused the problem. I don't know how to correct it,' Sterling says. At the same time, Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, asks to be cut some slack - saying it's a mistake he'll never make again. Apologizing: Sterling told Cooper he's sorry for the racist comments he made in recorded conversations with girlfriend V. Stiviano (pictured at a Clippers game last October) 'Am I entitled to one mistake, after 35 years? I mean I love my league, I love my partners, am I entitled to one mistake?' he asks. The NBA's board of governors will decide Sterling's fate, and could force him to sell his team if 75 per cent of the owners are in agreement. 'If the owners feel I have another chance, then they'll give it to me,' he said, adding that he doesn't see the point of a long-drawn out legal battle to rid him. 'If they fight with me and they spend millions and I spend millions let's say I win or they win, I just don't know if that's important,' he said. In the interview, Sterling specifically apologized to the Clippers players, who in the game after the scandal wore their warm-ups inside out as a show of solidarity against the owner. 'My players, they didn't need this. They didn't need this cloud over their head. They're good people and I love them and respect them,' he said. Sterling also says he's apologized to Magic Johnson, the target of one of his racist comments, since the scandal. But in a bit of a backwards compliment, calls the retired basketball star both a 'good person' and a bad role model. 'He's a good person,' Sterling said of Johnson. 'I mean what am I going to say? Has he done everything he can do to help minorities? I don't think so. But I’ll say it, he's great. But I don't think he's a good example for the children of Los Angeles.' At the center of the controversy: V. Stiviano (right) posted a picture of her and Magic Johnson on her Instagram, causing Sterling to get mad at her and telling her not to pose for pictures with black people . Backhanded compliment: In the interview, Sterling called Johnson both a 'good person' and a bad role model. Johnson is pictured above at a Clippers game Sunday, with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on the left and shaking hands with boxing champ Floyd Mayweather on the right. He is one of several people, including Oprah, who have expressed interest in buying the team. Sterling spoke at length about V.Stiviano, his ex-girlfriend at the center of the scandal who secretly recorded the now-public conversations. 'I don't know why the girl had me say those things,' Sterling says. When Cooper asks if he was baited by Stiviano, Sterling says yes because 'that's not the way I talk'. Sterling says he thought their relationship was real but that, with their 51-year age gap, he may have been 'diluting' himself. 'I don't trust her and I just wish I could ask her why and if she was just setting me up,' he says. 'I think that people say she was taping me for two years. So maybe I was just fooling myself thinking for two years that she cared for me. She certainly acted like it.' His first interview comes just three days after another close confidant released yet another tape in which Sterling explains that he was only saying the racist comments to entice Stiviano into having sex with him. 'The girl is black. I like her. I'm jealous that she's with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell, can I in private tell her, you know, ""I don't want you to be with anybody""?' Sterling says in the recordings released by RadarOnline. Private conversations: In a different set of recordings released to RadarOnline, Sterling says he only said the racist statements to get Stiviano in bed with him . Where did the love go? Sterling says he no longer trusts Stiviano and that she may have been pretending to care for him during the two years they dated. Since the scandal broke, the 31-year-old has been pictured out and about in her signature visor . The NBA swiftly punished Sterling following the release of the first recordings, banning him from the league for life and hitting him with a $2.5million fine. They may also force him to sell the team, and the NBA's Advisory/Fianance committee met by conference call last Wednesday to discuss the possible termination. The committee released a statement saying they will meet again next week to discuss the matter further. Three-quarters of the NBA team owners would have to vote in agreement in order to force Sterling to sell. Former Time Warner Cable head and Obama advisor Dick Parsons has been chosen as the team's interim CEO for the transition period. Meanwhile, Sterling's estranged wife Shelly hopes to hold on to her 50 per cent stake in the Los Angeles team. Wont' let go: Sterling's estranged wife Shelly says she wants to hold onto her 50 per cent stake in the team. Pictured above at a Clippers game on May 3 . 'She wants to remain a passive owner,' her attorney said in a statement released Friday. 'She's not going to want to manage the team. She's going to want a very skilled, professional, well-heeled new owner to come in and replace Donald.' Despite separating several years ago, the Sterlings remain married. 'She only wants to own the team in her lifetime. She's 79 years old. At this point, she's earned it. She's been an owner for 33 years, and she's an avid fan,' he lawyer said. Miami Heat star LeBron James spoke on behalf of many players in the league, saying they don't want any member of the Sterling family in power. 'As players, we want what's right and we don't feel like no one in his family should be able to own the team,' James said after the Miami Heat practiced for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Brooklyn. No Sterlings, please: Miami Heat star LeBron James spoke on behalf of other players in the league, saying they don't want any member of the Sterling family involved with the Clippers.

"Diego Simeone is playing no part in Brazil 2014 but is the hottest manager in football and the leading candidate to take over either Spain, if Vicente del Bosque stands down, or Argentina, should Alejandro Sabella fail to survive this weekend’s World Cup quarter final against Belgium. Simeone has moved to the top of the game’s wanted list after inspiring a comparatively low-budget Atletico Madrid to beat Real and Barcelona to La Liga title and reach the Champions League Final. The 44-year-old Argentinian has long . harboured the ambition of managing his own country, while sources close . to him in Buenos Aires are leaking word of provisional enquiries from . Spain. Mistake: Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone inadvertently told Jorge 'El Topo' Lopez's wife of the news . National pride: He could be brought in to coach Lionel Messi and Argentina, with Alejandro Sabella's future in doubt . New man? Spain have made tentative enquiries about him succeeding Vicente Del Bosque . Simeone is understood . to have an escape clause in his contract with Atletico and to be . monitoring the fallout of coaches from the World Cup. Although . defending champions Spain were astonishingly eliminated after only two . matches in Brazil – as were England, albeit less surprisingly -  del . Bosque, like Roy Hodgson, has been given the continued backing of his . national association. However, . the 63-year-old Del Bosque is being allowed time to discuss with his . family whether to stay in charge for the remaining two years of his . contract. A definitive statement from him was expected this week but . none has been forthcoming. If . there are any doubts Spain will need his successor in charge for their . 2016 defence of the European Championship, also won by Del Bosque, and . to begin the rebuilding process for Russia 2018. With . Pep Guardiola making it clear the has no desire to swap the daily . involvement of club management – be it with Bayern Munich, Barcelona or . anywhere else – for the international game, Simeone has come into . intensifying focus as potentially Spain’s first foreign head coach for . more than half a century (Jorge Santamairia, former Real Madrid giant . who took charge in the 80s, held dual nationality and played for Spain). Also, of course, Spanish is Simeone’s native language. Meanwhile, . Sabella’s position with Argentina has already been compromised by a . much-publicised dressing-room revolt, apparently led by Lionel Messi, . which has wrought a change of tactics en route to the clash with . Belgium’s galaxy of Premier League stars. It . is thought that only the winning of the World Cup – ideally for him . against arch-rivals Brazil in the Final in the Maracana on Sunday week – . could save Sabella’s job. And even then his survival would not be . guaranteed. Past times: Simeone led Atletico to La Liga glory on the final day of the season at the Nou Camp against Messi . Gone: But star striker Diego Costa is joining Chelsea for £32m this summer . Simeone amassed . 106 caps for Argentina, admitting that he was embarrassed at being the . first to surpass the tally of the great Diego Maradona. He described . himself as ‘the midfield player with a knife between my teeth.’ He . played in three World Cups, and during France 98 David . Beckham was infamously sent off for donkey-kicking him in retaliation . for a heavy foul. Simeone . confessed later that he exaggerated his reaction to that incident. He . is a notoriously fiery character and faces a touchline ban by UEFA for . going into meltdown when Atletico conceded a late equaliser to Real Madrid in . the Champions League final, going on to lose in extra time. He . is nicknamed Colo, historically a Latin American insult for those of . mixed peasant stock but now a chav-like word for his style of dress. Following . his retirement at the end of a varied playing career in Argentina and . Italy, coaching successes at home led to Simeone’s appointmen by . Atletico three years ago. He . is being advised to cash in now on his successs in Madrid which will . be near-impossible for him to sustain against the wealth of Real and . Barca in Spain, or in Europe in competition with the financial giants of . the Premier League and PSG in France. Atletico’s . sale of Diego Costa to Chelsea has given rise to reports in Paris of . Jose Mourinho facing the sack and Simeone following his . goalscorer-in-chief to Stamford Bridge. While that speculation appears highly fanciful, Spain and Argentina are keeping the Simeone option open.","Simeone is the hottest property in management at the moment .

"There was a telling moment on Wednesday when Stuart Lancaster encapsulated England’s philosophy by invoking the memory of the country’s iconic World Cup-winning No 10. ‘To be the best, it’s not about the flash stuff, it’s about skill, execution and everything being done at a very high level,’ said Lancaster. ‘If we take Jonny Wilkinson as the benchmark, he didn’t get everything right all the time and it wasn’t always flash, but he was incredibly consistent in everything he did.’ His answer came after Danny Cipriani was left out of the 33-man squad for the QBE Test series next month, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail nine days ago. Cipriani has been one of England's leading No 10s this season but has been overlooked by Lancaster . Jonny Wilkinson, who kicked England to World Cup glory in 2003, encapsulates England's philosophy . England will be aiming to win the Hilary Shield (left) and the Cook Cup vs New Zealand and Australia . Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), D Wilson (Bath), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), B Morgan (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens), T Wood (Northampton). Backs: D Care (Harlequins), L Dickson (Northampton), B Youngs (Leicester), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), S Myler (Northampton), B Barritt (Saracens), L Burrell (Northampton), K Eastmond (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester), M Brown (Harlequins), A Goode (Saracens), J May (Gloucester), J Nowell (Exeter), S Rokoduguni (Bath), M Yarde (Harlequins). Countless observers, this one included, believe the Sale fly-half has greater match-winning credentials than Stephen Myler, who has been picked as one of the three stand-offs. Those on the outside crave dashes of magic to ignite England’s attack, but the men in charge focus on the sum of several often earthy parts. Lancaster said: ‘Game management is one of the key things we look for in our fly-halves. Ability to execute an accurate kicking game, so you relieve pressure; if you’re in the middle of the field, you kick or run. ‘If I talk about taking the ball to the line and creating line breaks for other people, I think you look at George Ford. Goal-kicking is a key area. Stephen Myler probably tops the stats — his kicking has been very, very good. Then there’s defence, the ability to stop opponents on the gain line. These are all parts of the jigsaw. ‘There’s a package that we need to see, not just from him (Cipriani) but from all the players. Some players have had stand-out games but it’s about backing that up with another and another, not having a stand-out game then being seven out of 10. It needs to be nine out of 10.’ Lancaster's decision to pick Stephen Myler over Cipriani is a conservative and cautious decision . George Ford is the most attacking fly-half out of the three selected for the autumn series . Owen Farrell has kept his place in the squad in spite of his lack of game time at Saracens . Oct 26 Squad gathers . Nov 8 England v NZ (Twickenham) Nov 15 England v S Africa (Twickenham) Nov 22 England v Samoa (Twickenham) Nov 29 England v Australia (Twickenham) Late Jan Squad updated . Feb 6 Wales v England (Cardiff) Feb 14 England v Italy (Twickenham) Mar 1 Ireland v England (Dublin) Mar 14 England v Scotland (Twickenham) Mar 21 England v France (Twickenham) Jun 18 Deadline for pre-World Cup training squad . July Two-week training camp in Denver, Colorado . Aug 15 England v France (Twickenham) Aug 22 France v England (Paris) Aug 31 Squad to be submitted . Sept 5 England v Ireland (Twickenham) Sept 18 World Cup opener v Fiji (Twickenham) Yet, the criteria are seemingly applied to some players, but not all. Of the various fly-half candidates, Owen Farrell is the one without much game time or any really encouraging form this season. He, though, is regarded as a man apart. Provided he is fit, he will surely play, but his lack of momentum is a concern, whatever the official line. Based on Lancaster’s explanations, the England coaches are certainly not indulging in selection by basic hunch or taking wild risks. There is an onus on ‘objective data’ and a scientific study of all-round credentials. The siren call of public or media opinion is blocked out. The theme of consistent execution trumping bursts of ‘flash’ quality was evident again when the focus turned to the troublesome wing positions. Chris Ashton deserves to be in based on form for Saracens but he has been reasonably jettisoned because of concerns about his consistence and all-round game. The tries keep coming, but at Test level other aspects of his game have been exposed. Christian Wade of Wasps scored a stunning solo try in Dublin last Sunday and a more emotive management team would perhaps have taken a punt on him. But while the Lion has the flash factor, he lacks consistency of execution. The same principles are being applied in midfield and to Chris Robshaw’s continued status as first-choice captain and openside flanker. His place has been questioned amid acclaim for James Haskell’s form and speculation about a Steffon Armitage return. But he fits in with the current preference for grafters rather than dazzlers, and the fact remains that a back row of Tom Wood, Robshaw and Ben Morgan led a demolition of the All Blacks founded on ferocious and effective work at the ruck. That back row, or Billy Vunipola at No 8 ahead of Ben Morgan, has complementary assets. Haskell is breathing down the necks of the flankers, as is the returning Calum Clark, and this is an area of English strength, even without Armitage. Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni has earned an England call-up after scoring six tries in seven matches . Chris Ashton (centre) has been dropped by England in favour of Rokoduguni . Saracens lock George Kruis has also been called up for the first time by England . The same can’t be said for midfield. Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell were the chosen pair in last season’s Six Nations but Lancaster’s comments on Wednesday pointed to the possibility of Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt joining forces next month. Whatever decision is made, in the enforced absence of Manu Tuilagi there needs to be a thread of continuity at centre. Ideally, a combination will be backed throughout the four-match series. All the attention is on those places where the names are in pencil rather than ink. By and large, England are well placed, with good depth and a vast array of options. But the suitable time for trying newcomers such as Semesa Rokoduguni and George Kruis is surely nearing an end. By the end of November, more certainty is required.","Jonny Wilkinson is the player who encapsulates England's philosophy .

"ITV has been accused of stoking a fake controversy after last night's climax to Coronation Street's controversial assisted suicide storyline saw the terminally ill character Hayley Cropper end her own life – without help from husband Roy. Critics accused the ITV ‘publicity machine’ of using a sensitive and emotive issue to generate higher ratings, with some questioning whether the soap had contributed to the debate at all. Other critics have raised fears the episode could prompt copycat suicides by vulnerable viewers, particularly because it was shown before the 9pm watershed. Scroll down for videos . Sparking debate: ITV has been accused of stoking controversy after Coronation Street character Hayley Cropped, pictured right, took her own life without the help of her husband Roy, pictured left . In last night’s episode, the much-loved character explained to Roy her determination to die by her own hand rather than succumb to a lingering death from pancreatic cancer. She warned Roy not to touch the glass containing a lethal cocktail of painkillers to avoid implicating himself in her death. Then, resisting his efforts to take the glass from her hand, Hayley died in Roy’s arms leaving him consumed by grief. However, the episode had been billed as a contribution to the ‘right to die’ debate, brought into the public consciousness by cases such as locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson, who fought for assistance to end his life in the courts. Last night Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘This demonstrates why soap operas are such a bad way to conduct debates on matters of public policy. The episode has instead been billed as a contribution to the 'right to die debate' rather than the assisted suicide debate . ‘They turn it into a highly-charged, emotional issue, but fail to engage with the important details. ‘ITV’s . huge publicity machine has stoked up the debate around this episode . well in advance to get people talking about it and to get people to tune . in. But in fact the storyline is not quite as billed. In the end, it . was not about assisted suicide at all.’ An ITV spokeswoman said the second episode last night, which culminated in Hayley's death, pulled in a peak audience of 10.6 million viewers. More than 100,000 tweets were sent about the programme, with around 8,000 messages being tweeted every minute towards the end of the episode. Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, who has played Hayley, the soap’s first transsexual character, for 15 years, has already been criticised for using the episode to promote her own views. Miss Hesmondhalgh, who is a member of the British Humanist Association, revealed she has ‘strong views’ in favour of assisted dying, and said ‘it’s hard not to be in favour’ of the terminally ill deciding to take their own lives. Emotionally charged: Critics argue the show failed to 'engage with the important details' of the issue . She added: ‘I wouldn’t want to live in that pain and anguish or see my family and friends go through it. I’ve always really understood Hayley’s decision.’ The show’s executive producer Stuart Blackburn also defended the plot, saying: ‘We’re not advocates for Hayley’s decision and her belief that she had a right to choose a time of her dying in any way, shape or form. ‘Will it influence people? I don’t know. People may have the discussion and talk about it. We have a right to have that discussion.’ Hayley’s final scenes, watched by millions last night, have reopened the national debate on euthanasia ahead of a House of Lords hearing on the issue in May. Julie Hesmondhalgh, who played the character Hayley for 15 years, has been criticised for using the episode to promote her own personal views about the right to die . Labour peer Lord Falconer, who hopes to allow patients to end their lives voluntarily with his Assisted Dying Bill, reacted by calling for Parliament to ‘resolve the mess’ of current legislation which makes it a crime to help others take their lives. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands and some US states. Since the Dignitas assisted dying centre opened in Switzerland in 1998, more than 180 terminally ill British people have  travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms. Ex-soldier Reg Crew, who had motor neurone disease, became the first Briton to publicly go to Dignitas in 2003. His wife Win was threatened with legal action when she returned home but was not charged. By . Christopher Stevens . Along the cobbles of Coronation Street, life goes on. As Hayley Cropper was slipping away in the arms of her grief-stricken husband last night, her neighbours were flirting, bickering, fixing cars and minding the shop – much as ever. The BBC’s EastEnders would have milked this storyline for every last teardrop, with one of its trademark two-hander episodes. ITV has tried that format a couple of times, with the camera trained on two actors in a room for the full half-hour, but it’s too melodramatic for Corrie. Instead of a claustrophobic death for Hayley, shut away in the flat above the cafe with her devoted Roy, she first saw her friends and family one last time. She was fervent and weepy. But if they gave it a second thought, they blamed her emotional state on the medication. Only Roy knew that Hayley was determined to take an overdose that evening, choosing to end her life rather than suffer a drawn-out death from incurable pancreatic cancer. Final hours: Character Hayley saw her friends and family one last time before taking her own life . Meanwhile, brassy Gloria was batting her eyelashes at Dennis, Chesney was working up the courage to ask Sinead to move in with him, and Tyrone was looking everywhere for his baby daughter’s toy kangaroo. The first of the double episodes opened with Roy bringing his wife breakfast in bed for the final time. The scene didn’t last more than 20 seconds, as though to stay longer would be intrusive. Even in Hayley’s final moments, we saw her take only the first gulp of the painkillers, before the camera cut away. This was the right approach. Transsexual Hayley might once have been a bloke, and a father at that, but she was no drama queen. She wanted no fuss. She even ironed Roy’s best shirt before she lay down, to make sure he looked his best at the funeral. Julie Hesmondhalgh played it beautifully, conveying a sense that her body was in spasms of agony but her mind was calm. To see that pain was upsetting, because she was so convincing. Anyone who has helplessly watched a loved one suffering  torments at the end of a long illness will know how true her performance was. Upsetting: Julie Hesmondhalgh gave a heart-wrenching performance of Hayley's last moments . David Neilson as Roy was equally affecting. Never an articulate chap, he was speechless with grief for much of the second episode, but his eyes were eloquent. Roy wanted to cry, but he couldn’t. Millions of viewers did it for him. With such sensitive acting, this ought to have been an unequivocal triumph, but the show’s executive producer, Stuart Blackburn, has tarnished it in his eagerness for ratings. A faux controversy was whipped up in the weeks before the broadcast, about the ‘right to die’ debate and euthanasia. In fact Hayley killed herself, with no help from anyone. Her husband even tried to take the tumbler of drugs from her hand at the last moment, but she was determined. Once she had swallowed the draught, he held her as she died. If Blackburn had really wanted to tackle the debate over assisted suicide, he should have let Hayley linger a couple more weeks, until she was too weak to hold the glass herself. Roy could have lifted the drugs to his wife’s lips. That really would have been controversial television, but the producers apparently lacked the courage for it. Speechless with grief: Roy held Hayley as she died after she drank a lethal mixture of drugs .","Terminally ill character Hayley Cropper ended her own life on the soap .

"Thousands of people have flocked to the spot where President John F. Kennedy was shot for a solemn commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his assassination. Crowds gathered along the same route through Dallas that the president's motorcade passed when shots rang out on November 22, 1963. Today's event will feature brief remarks by the mayor, the tolling of church bells and readings from the president's speeches by author David McCullough. Scroll down for video . The flags in Dallas are flying at half mast today as the city holds a memorial service in honor of the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination . Moment of silence: The crowd of thousands bowed their heads out of respect at 12.30pm local time . Emotional: Many Americans, including Barbara Clark, vividly remember where they were when they heard that President Kennedy had been shot on November 22, 1963 . About . 5,000 tickets were issued for the free ceremony in Dealey Plaza, which . is flanked by the Texas School Book Depository building where sniper Lee . Harvey Oswald perched on the sixth floor. The . U.S. Naval Academy Men's Glee Club will perform in a nod to Kennedy's . military service and there will be an Air Force flyover. It is a reverential approach that will be mirrored in Boston, where the JFK Library and Museum will open a small exhibit of never-before-displayed items from Kennedy's state funeral and host a musical tribute that isn't open to the public. In Washington, President Obama will meet privately at the White House with leaders and volunteers from the Kennedy-established Peace Corps program. Legacy: John F. Kennedy was the most popular president in the 20th Century, and he was assassinated during a campaign stop in Texas on November 22, 1963 .

New leading lady: Charlene, like Jackie Kennedy before her, has become something of an international fashion icon . Spectacle: Events in commemoration of the anniversary have been held in Dallas throughout the past year . The President personally visited the . eternal flame created for Kennedy at Arlington National Cemetery on . Wednesday alongside Michelle Obama, former President Clinton and former . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A . number of members of the Kennedy family- including Caroline's son Jack . Schlossberg- were in attendance, and he went on to speak at a formal . dinner that night that was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the . Medal of Freedom- an initiative launched by President Kennedy. The committee convened by current . Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to plan the city's event wanted to focus 'in a . positive way more on the legacy of President Kennedy,' said Ron Kirk, a . former mayor and member of the panel. Numerous . events were held around Dallas this year to mark the milestone . anniversary, including panels with those who were there that day, . special concerts and museum exhibits. The spot: A museum now occupies the space that used to be the Texas Book Depository, and this is the window on the sixth floor that was Oswald's hiding spot . Clear shot: Lee Harvey Oswald was positioned in the Sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository, (the building on the left) when he fired at the motorcade . Moving on: In preparation for today's celebration, road crews on Thursday repaved the area of Elm Street where the President was shot . Through the rain: Thousands are expected to line the route of the motorcade that President Kennedy's car was going along as he was shot . Moments from death: President John F. Kennedy, his wife Jackie sit side by side, as they ride through Dallas moments before Kennedy was assassinated, November 22, 1963 . As press aide for Governor John Connally, Julian Read was in a media bus several vehicles behind the presidential limousine. After . the gunshots, he watched as the vehicle, carrying the mortally wounded . Kennedy and injured governor, sped away. Read released a book this year . recounting his experience and has attended several of the events, which . he called cathartic. 'Even though there are all those . melancholy thoughts, the way it's shaping up ... gives me more of a . comfort than any time since 1963,' said Read, who will be at the . official ceremony Friday. The . Coalition on Political Assassinations, a group that believes Kennedy's . death was part of a conspiracy, usually gathers on the plaza's 'grassy . knoll' for a moment of silence each November 22. Since it'll be blocked off . this year, executive director John Judge - who first came to Dealey . Plaza for the fifth anniversary of JFK's death in 1968 - says he's . reached a 'livable' agreement with the city. The final trip: Jackie and Jack were all smiles when they arrived in Dallas, not knowing what lay ahead . Warm reception: Texas was a difficult state for Democrats to win but the crowds were encouraging for Kennedy . Unexpected: The convertible that the Kennedys were riding in had been equipped with a glass cover but the President felt he was better able to connect with voters without the barrier . Action: Secret Service agent Clint Hill rushed to the back of the limousine and pushed Mrs Kennedy back in the car after she tried to grab a piece of her husband's skull that had flown off . On display: The limousine that Kennedy was riding in was used by a number of presidents after him but it was eventually retired from the fleet and now is part of an exhibit at The Henry Ford Museum in Michigan . Healing old wounds: A number of tributes have been erected in Dallas over the years, including this landmark marker in Dealey Plaza where the motorcade traveled on that fateful day . The . group - which plans to wear specially made T-shirts with an image of . Kennedy's head with a bullet hole and blood and the slogan '50 years in . denial is enough' - will gather a few blocks away and move to the plaza . after the official ceremony ends. President John F. Kennedy's last surviving sibling, 85-year-old Jean Kennedy Smith, has laid a wreath at her brother's grave at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Smith was accompanied Friday morning by about 10 members of the Kennedy family as they marked the 50th anniversary of his assassination in Dallas. They joined hands for a short prayer in silence and left roses at the grave. Evidence: Lady Bird Johnson asked if Jackie wanted to change before Lyndon was sworn in as president on Air Force One (pictured) but Jackie responded 'I want them to see what they did to Jack' Investigation: Conspiracy theories about the assassination, many which persist today. The official version of events concludes that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and used this bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight . Heartbreaking: The President's funeral was held on the same day that his son John F. Kennedy Jr turned three, and the little boy is seen here saluting to his father's casket during the funeral . Bagpipes played, a British cavalry officer stood guard and a flame burned steady as it has for the last 50 years at the grave. A few hundred tourists watched the ceremony, which lasted only a few minutes. Also today, one of President Kennedy's two granddaughters has paid her respects at the British memorial site in his honor. A . stone tablet and ornate garden were dedicated to President Kennedy in .

"Nadya Suleman, the 38-year-old California woman known as 'Octomom', could face over five years in jail for hiding $30,000 in money she earned from stripping and starring in porn on her taxes. The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced today that Suleman was being charged with welfare fraud and is set to be arraigned on Friday. The Octomom, whose real name is Natalie Denise Suleman, became famous in 2009 after becoming the second U.S. woman to give birth to healthy octoplets. She had six children before that, making her the mother of 14 total children. A few mouths to feed: The 38-year-old is mother to 14 children including her octuplets . Prosecutors say that in the first six months of 2013, Suleman applied and received over $16,000 in welfare payments, in addition to $6,667 from the CalWorks financial assistance program and $9,814 from Cal Fresh food aid program. Going to court: Suleman is due to be arraigned in court on Friday, and prosecutors plan to ask for $25,000 bail to be set . While receiving these welfare funds, Suleman failed to disclose $30,000 in income she earned through public appearances and residuals from videos. She was charged on January 6 with one count aid by misrepresentation and two counts perjury by false application for aid. If convicted, Suleman faces up to five years and eight months in custody. On Friday, prosecutors are expected to ask for bail to be set at $25,000. This is just the most recent financial hardship for Suleman, who was threatened with eviction last month. Suleman had been living rent-free in a friend's home but it was sold and the new owner told her she and her brood had to go. New owner Lana El-Jor said she had problems refinancing the building because of her. 'That’s one of the things why we have to ask her to leave. The bank refused to support the loan. She is said to have left her houses abused and everything and it worried the bank,' Ms El-Jor told the Mirror. It's uncertain whether Ms El-Jor followed through on the threats to kick the family out by Christmas. MailOnline's calls to Ms El-Jor were not immediately returned Monday afternoon. Suleman octuplet birth caused controversy in 2009 when it was revealed she was on federal assistance when she was impregnanted by invitro fertilization by Dr Michael Kamrava. Dr Kamrava had his medical license revoked after the birth for not exercising 'sound judgement'. Over the years, Suleman has gotten creative trying to provide for her children. Working mother: Suleman became famous in 2009 after becoming the second U.S. woman ever to give birth to a healthy set of octuplets. She has since resorted to stripping and starring in porn to provide for her 14 total children . She has starred in porn movies, participated in online dating auctions and performed as a stripper. But she recently vowed to never do porn again. In her online diary she said: 'I choose not to give my body sexually to ANYONE. Not even myself. I won’t give what I can control away… I am not for sale. 'I’m to blame. I deserve to be punished. Punish me. Hurt me. Destroy me. As I am now done. 'I focused 100% attention on my family, went back on welfare (I know), and never stripped again. Soon…you will be reading these words. And as soon as you are…we will be off welfare forever.' Nadya won AVN Award for her solo porn tape and has stripped - all to raise funds for her family - but the diary writings reveals the extent of her pain at doing so.","Los Angeles County District Attorney says Suleman, 38, concealed $30,000 in earnings .

"From Felipe Massa’s watery eyes to the stress-lined face of Jules Bianchi’s worried boss, a mood of sombre reflection fell upon the paddock ahead of the Russia Grand Prix. Grand Prix racing drivers — as competitive a breed as exists in sport — thought of their colleague, and in some cases friend, who remains desperately ill after suffering head injuries when he crashed into a recovery vehicle in Japan last Sunday. The words they spoke were measured. They offered no quick fixes. They refused to point fingers. The only driver who broke ranks was Sergio Perez, Force India’s Mexican, who described the accident as ‘totally unacceptable’. Sergio Perez, pictured riding at the Sochi circuit in Russia, has called Bianchi's crash 'totally unacceptable' Ferrari and Lewis Hamilton (right) will carry the message 'Forza Jules' s at this weekend's Russian Grand Prix . Nico Rosberg and Fernando Alonso are among the drivers who will display an 'Everybody With Jules' sticker . Caterham driver Marucs Ericsson sporting the 'Everyone with Jules' sticker on his crash helmets . He added: ‘We have to look for answers from the FIA. We have to make sure they hear us. We will go through the full detail. In future when there is a tractor coming to pick up a car, we need a safety car no matter what the conditions.’ So why did not one of the other 21 other drivers speak even a small fraction as vehemently as Perez about the circumstances surrounding the crash? They were under instruction not to from the GPDA — the drivers’ association — and team bosses. Without doubt it was in part because criticising the FIA has never been politically expedient. That is how Formula One works. There was also, it seemed, a genuine desire not to betray their sport by airing their private concerns in public at such a sensitive time. As Jenson Button, the most experienced driver on the grid, said: ‘I can’t say anything yet. Most of us understand that being massively outspoken now, or letting our emotion get the better of us, doesn’t always help the situation. ‘It’s better to sit down, when you know all the facts, make improvements and speak out accordingly. That’s not the case right now. It’s just a very emotional time, thinking of Jules and his family.’ The scene following the aftermath of Bianchi's horror crash in the closing stages of the Japanese Grand Prix . The 25-year-old Frenchman is fighting for his life after sustaining brain injuries after his crash with the tractor . The GPDA drivers, who number about 18, will instead meet on Friday night in the paddock to discuss their suggestions for safety improvements. Among the issues on the agenda is likely to be whether the safety car should always be deployed when a tractor is removing a car, such as happened on Sunday when Bianchi hit the tractor that was there to remove Adrian Sutil’s Sauber. The timing of races to avoid dusk is likely to be another topic of debate. The usual pre-race driver briefing with race director Charlie Whiting will also be held tonight. FIA president Jean Todt, who has ultimate responsibility for safety, was due to arrive in Sochi on Thursday night and is expected to hold a press conference on Friday, addressing the implications of the crash, after asking Whiting for a full report. The shock of Sunday’s events was no more palpable than at Marussia, where chief executive Graeme Lowdon spoke of 25-year-old Bianchi as ‘not only an exceptional driver, but an exceptional human being’. Lowdon, clearly worn down by events but still lucid, said the team still had not decided whether to race in Russia. Although they met the 4pm deadline to register their drivers — Max Chilton and reserve driver Alexander Rossi — they may yet withdraw one or both. They will be guided in this by the wishes of Bianchi’s parents and, conceivably, by his condition. Another possible consideration is Chilton’s state of mind and readiness to drive after he missed his usual media engagements yesterday. The 21 drivers will carry the message ‘Tous avec Jules’ (All with Jules) on their helmets in Sunday’s race. Their sense of anguish was felt deeply by Williams’ Massa, a friend of Bianchi, who called the Japanese Grand Prix, ‘the worst race of my life’. This from a man who was seriously injured when a spring from Rubens Barrichello’s Brawn hit him in the head while driving a Ferrari in the Hungarian Grand Prix five years ago. ‘I didn’t remember that accident,’ said Massa of his own knockout blow. ‘Maybe tomorrow in practice it will get a little bit better because at least you are working, at least you have something to think about, some issue to put inside your brain.’ Bianchi's name will be above the Maurssia garage ahead of the weekend's race in Sochi . The issue of enclosed cockpits is another subject for the sport to consider. But would even a fighter-jet style canopy have saved Bianchi, when he hit a steel truck at a speed seemingly in excess of 100mph? There is also the question of Formula One’s heritage. ‘There are positives,’ said Button of canopies, ‘but this is Formula One and it has been open cockpits since the start of time.’","Bianchi fighting for his life after freak crash during Japanese Grand Prix .

"Ched Evans has broken his silence to claim he regrets cheating on his girlfriend but continued to express no remorse for the victim he raped in a hotel room in Rhyl in 2011. Sheffield United, the club which employed him at the time of his conviction, are still deliberating whether to re-sign the striker with more than 150,000 people having signed an online petition campaigning against him returning to professional football. However, many Blades fans chanted their support for the striker during United’s 2-0 victory at Bradford City on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to see if Blades fans think Evans should be re-signed . Ched Evans has said he is 'ashamed' of his actions and wishes he could 'turn back the clock' Evans has said cheating on his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, was 'unforgivable' and thanked her for her support . Evans, who was released from Wymott Prison in Lancashire at 5am on Friday, showed a disregard for his victim. ‘I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock. I am very lucky my girlfriend (Natasha Massey) has stood by me,’ he told the Sunday Mirror. ‘She knows I am not capable of rape. She has helped me to cope. I want to play football again but I am determined to prove my innocence. ‘I really thought it would have been thrown out of court and I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong. It was something that should never have happened. And it is something that I will regret for the rest of my life. ‘I cheated on my girlfriend and had sex with this girl —but it was definitely consensual. Although I am ashamed of my actions, she was definitely up for it. I most certainly didn’t rape anyone. Ms Massey has led a campaign to have Evans' conviction overturned; his case review is to be fast-tracked . TV presenter and women’s rights campaigner Charlie Webster, who announced she would quit her role as a Sheffield United patron if Evans is re-employed by the club, lambasted the Wales international’s lack of remorse. ‘Look at the campaign that him and his family have done saying he is innocent,’ she said, ‘He’s not shown any acceptance, no remorse, no responsibility for any of the actions he took that night. ‘We have an incredible justice system which found him guilty. He still thinks he’s innocent, but rehabilitation means accepting you were responsible for what you’ve done and showing remorse and there isn’t anything from him.’ An inquiry into the rape conviction of Evans is to be fast-tracked. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is expected to begin its investigation into the case within weeks. The victim is captured on CCTV at the hotel, where she had initially gone with McDonald . The victim is seen leaving the hotel; Evans' case is being looked at by the Criminal Case Review Commission . McDonald was cleared of raping the victim, above, but Evans was convicted and sentenced to five years jail . In May 2011, Evans had been out with his brother and a friend of his, along with McDonald. The group went to a bar and then had a kebab. Evans said McDonald decided to go back to his hotel and hailed a cab, at which point the victim appeared and asked to go with him. Evans took a separate taxi with his brother and his brother's friend, but then received a text from McDonald saying he had 'got a girl'. He then told his taxi driver to head for the hotel, where he had booked and paid for a room under McDonald's name. Evans said when he entered the room McDonald was having sex with the woman and he asked if he could join in. He claims the woman said yes. When they had finished having sex, Evans said the woman rolled over, so he left. The prosecution's case was that the woman was too drunk to consent to sex. She had no memory of events after 3am and told police she woke up 'confused and dazed'. VIDEO Evans has no place in football - Brady .

"As star names from across the globe gear up for the glitzy World Cup in Brazil next month, spare a thought for the top names who have been left behind. There are only 23 men who can make up each country's squad which has left international managers with plenty to ponder and some tough decisions to make. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the best World Cup Snubbed XI... Maarten Stekelenburg (Holland) The Dutch goalkeeper fell out of favour at Fulham towards the end of their relegation campaign this season and it has cost him a place in Louis Van Gaal's side. Stekelenburg was first choice in between the sticks for Holland when Edwin Van Der Sar retired in 2010 and played in the last World Cup and Euro 2012. Despite winning 54 caps he was not even one of the four goalkeeper's included in the preliminary 30-man squad. Difficult time of it: Maarten Stekelenburg didn't pull up any trees during his first season at relegated Fulham . Alvaro Arbeloa (Spain) The Real Madrid right-back has paid for an inconsistent season with the Spanish giants. He has won 56 caps for Spain and was part of the side to win the last three major international tournaments - Euro 2008 and 2012, plus the last World Cup in South Africa. But the former Liverpool defender made only 22 appearances for Real and has not played for Spain since a friendly versus Belarus in October last year. Domenico Criscito (Italy) The Zenit defender was left shocked by his omission, not even making it into Italy's provisional 30-man squad. He played in Italy's most recent friendly against Spain and was involved in matches against Nigerian and Germany last November. Criscito assumed he was a shoo-in for the team. Left back at home: Domenico Criscito (left) has been snubbed from Italy, while Alvaro Arbeloa isn't with Spain . Joleon Lescott (England) The centre-back is set to leave Manchester City after struggling for a regular starting place, which has meant he was overlooked for Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad. At 31 years old he will know time is ticking for him to regain some form to be considered for the national team again. Ashley Cole (England) Cole was the most high-profile omission from the England team and the toughest decision that Hodgson had to make. Everton defender Leighton Baines is set to start for England at the World Cup and Hodgson opted for Southampton's teenage sensation Luke Shaw to get big tournament experience. You've not played enough! Ashley Cole has struggled for games under new Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho . Samir Nasri (France) France manager Didier Deschamps has divided opinion by leaving out Premier League winner Nasri. Deschamps decided he was a disruptive influence and wouldn't be happy on the bench, but Nasri has notched up 50 appearances for club and country this campaign and won two cups. Unbelievable! Didier Deschamps has caused uproar by not picking Samir Nasri in the France squad . Kaka (Brazil) Once the world's most expensive player when he joined Real Madrid from AC Milan for £55million, albeit only for a few days. Injuries have blighted his career and he has failed to reproduce the kind of form which commanded that fee, since then returning to the Italian club on a free transfer. Philippe Coutinho (Brazil) The tricky Brazilian has been outstanding for Liverpool and was one of the key players in their title charge this season. His stunning winner against Manchester City, curled into the bottom right corner, had many believing this was to be Liverpool's season. But stiff competition, particularly for attacking midfield players, meant he just missed out when Luiz Felipe Scolari named his squad. Ronaldinho (Brazil) Ronaldinho, arguably one of the most gifted players to take to the field, was left out after it was considered he was partying too much and not focusing enough on the game so close to the World Cup. Scolari's assistant Carlos Alberto Parreira said he 'lacked dedication and consistency' to his international career. Aged 34, he has 33 goals in 97 appearances for Brazil, won a World Cup in 2002, and has a glittering trophy cabinet, but this was a step too far. Big surprise! Philippe Coutinho has been overlooked by the host nation Brazil despite impressing at Liverpool . Out: Ronaldinho . Going nowhere: Kaka . Snub: Robinho . Carlos Tevez (Argentina) Never far from controversy, the Juventus striker, who scored 18 goals In his debut season for the title-winning side, told the Argentinian FA last month not to recall him to the national team because he had booked tickets to go to Disney Land with his family. They duly obliged, and ex-Wigan striker Franco Di Santo was picked instead, meaning one of the best forwards in the world, in scintillating form, will not be at the tournament. Dani Osvaldo (Italy) A chequered history of fights and fall-outs with team-mates and managers did not stop Osvaldo earning a big money move to Southampton last summer. And he was a regular as Italy's number 9 since making his debut in 2011. In-different form for the south coast club, then another attack on a team-mate meant he moved to Serie A champions Juventus, but his return of three goals in 18 games has not impressed Italy manager Cesare Prandelli. Too much trouble? Carlos Tevez hasn't been picked by Argentina because of his effect on the dressing room . One major flop: Dani Osvaldo failed to live up to his billing at Southampton before a loan move to Juventus . Substitutes' bench . John Ruddy (England) The Norwich goalkeeper was left devastated after not only being relegated this season, despite being one of his club's best performers, but then being left out of Hodgson's plans.He would only have been back-up to Joe Hart, but it was a harsh omission on a player who has been involved in every squad that he has been available for in the past two years. Gael Clichy (France) The Manchester City left-back was picked for France's previous World Cup and European Championship squads but days after helping his club win the title was told he was not going to Brazil.Paris Saint-Germain's Lucas Digne and Patrice Evra made the cut instead. Looking ahead: Gael Clichy won't be involved for France as they look to win back the biggest prize on Earth . Not too slick: Argentina have preferred Franco Di Santo to PSG's mercurial Javier Pastore . Rio Ferdinand (England) The centre-back pulled out of England's final World Cup qualifiers after a meeting with Roy Hodgson to discuss his long-term injury problems and has not been considered since then. Erik Lamela (Argentina) A disappointing season at Tottenham meant the winger has not been included in Argentina's star-studded squad. He was one of the most highly-rated players in football when he joined Spurs from Roma for £25.7million but, often playing with a muscle problem, he has struggled to live up to that. Javier Pastore (Argentina) The forward has failed to live up to his billing as one of the hottest young players in his teenage years. He was in Argentina's last World Cup squad, aged just 20, but just two goals for Paris Saint-Germain this season has cost him his place in the national team. Standing by!

The Blades, the club which employed him at the time of his conviction, are still deliberating whether to re-sign the striker with more than 150,000 people having signed an online petition campaigning against him returning to professional football. However, many fans chanted their support for Evans during United's 2-0 victory at Bradford City on Saturday. Evans, who was released from Wymott Prison in Lancashire at 5am on Friday, showed a disregard for his victim in his first interview since leaving prison. 'I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock. I am very lucky my girlfriend (Natasha Massey) has stood by me,' he told the Sunday Mirror. Evans, pictured in action for the Blades, wants to restart his career after serving a sentence for rape . Evans has said cheating on his girlfriend, Natasha Massey, was 'unforgivable' and thanked her for her support . 'She knows I am not capable of rape. She has helped me to cope. I want to play football again but I am determined to prove my innocence. 'I really thought it would have been thrown out of court and I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong. It was something that should never have happened. And it is something that I will regret for the rest of my life. 'I cheated on my girlfriend and had sex with this girl —but it was definitely consensual. Although I am ashamed of my actions, she was definitely up for it. I most certainly didn't rape anyone.

McDonald was cleared of raping the victim, above, but Evans was convicted and sentenced to five years jail . In May 2011, Evans had been out with his brother and a friend of his, along with McDonald. The group went to a bar and then had a kebab. Evans said McDonald decided to go back to his hotel and hailed a cab, at which point the victim appeared and asked to go with him. Evans took a separate taxi with his brother and his brother's friend, but then received a text from McDonald saying he had 'got a girl'. He then told his taxi driver to head for the hotel, where he had booked and paid for a room under McDonald's name. Evans said when he entered the room McDonald was having sex with the woman and he asked if he could join in. He claims the woman said yes. When they had finished having sex, Evans said the woman rolled over, so he left. The prosecution's case was that the woman was too drunk to consent to sex. She had no memory of events after 3am and told police she woke up 'confused and dazed'.

"We are still 16 months away from the World Cup and England are serious about putting everything in place to win it on home soil. However, the selection — or non-selection — of Steffon Armitage for the tour of New Zealand has become the litmus test for exactly how serious and to what lengths they are prepared to go to become world champions. This is the biggest call of Stuart Lancaster’s time in charge. And it needs to be made now. Up for the Cup: Steffon Armitage hoists aloft the trophy as Toulon are crowned kings of Europe again . Food for thought: England head coach Stuart Lancaster knows Armitage's qualities . Team and squad selections must never be made on any criteria other than performance and on merit. England players need to know they have been selected on merit and not because some guy playing in Toulon has been declared unavailable by a committee sitting in Twickenham. I am not saying Steffon would walk into the team but will England be better off adding an in-form European Cup winner who offers something totally different from Robshaw, Wood, Vunipola, Croft and Morgan? Categorically, yes. If we lose Robshaw or Wood, with Croft’s ongoing injuries, an area of strength loses its potency. Armitage changes that. There can be no compromise, or it can erode confidence. And surely no England coach can be happy with the thought that he is not putting out the strongest side? Powerhouse: Armitage was named man of the match for his performance on Saturday . Only England and the RFU’s intransigence is making Steffon Armitage unavailable. He is hungry for more international rugby and Toulon are placing no impediment in his way. Every England player will want him in the squad as this group have a chance of a lifetime to do something special. Tough calls need to be made if you are serious about lifting the sport’s biggest prize. On the form he has shown this season, Armitage must be picked by England. Even in a team of galacticos at Toulon, he is one of the go-to players. When World Cup winner and Springbok legend Juan Smith, one of his back-row colleagues, says that Armitage is one of the best and most special back-row players he has ever encountered, England need to listen. Armitage is quick, carries well, is incredible at the tackle and contact area and wins his team four or five turnovers every game. That is gold dust in modern-day Test rugby. He is so good in fact that Toulon have redesigned their pack to accommodate him. Versatile: The former London Irish man wore the No 8 jersey at the Millennium Stadium . Openside flanker is undoubtedly his ‘gun’ position but Toulon have converted him into probably the only 5ft 9in No 8 in the world and it works. My old adversary Bernard Laporte — the crazy professor — has got this one gloriously right. England have the players to win the World Cup next year but you have to get those players on the pitch. Great teams are made of great individuals . The best ever England back row during my time was the famous trio of Neil Back, Lawrence Dallaglio and Richard Hill and I wasn’t too bothered which number shirt they wore. Neil was a specialist openside but both Richard and Lawrence started Test matches in all three back-row positions during their England careers. I just wanted their combination of pace, skill and physicality on the park and a number of high-quality players such as Joe Worsley, Lewis Moody and Martin Corry often missed out. Magic number: Back (left), Dallaglio (centre) and Hill celebrate England's World Cup win in 2003 . Toulon’s Steffon Armitage was man of the match in Saturday’s Heineken Cup final, but he is considerably shorter and lighter than his English back-row rivals Chris Robshaw, Billy Vunipola, Ben Morgan and Tom Wood. STEFFON ARMITAGE Height: 5ft 9inWeight: 15st 10lb . CHRIS ROBSHAWHeight: 6ft 2inWeight: 17st 4lb . BILLY VUNIPOLAHeight: 6ft 2inWeight: 19st 11lb . BEN MORGANHeight: 6ft 3inWeight: 18st 3lb . TOM WOODHeight: 6ft 5inWeight: 17st 2lb . It will be scary next autumn for opponents to confront a back row of Tom Croft at No 8, Armitage at openside and Chris Robshaw at blindside flanker. I am a big Chris Robshaw fan, he’s become a fine captain and has done well at openside but to my eyes he could be an absolutely world-class blindside flanker in the same mould as Richard Hill. Robshaw would have to fight off Tom Wood, another terrific blindside, for the starting spot but that is what elite Test rugby is about: incredible competition for places and harsh selection decisions. Who would have ever thought Brian O’Driscoll could ever be dropped by the Lions last summer? We have to rid ourselves of this prejudice against selecting England players abroad. It’s inherently flawed and I totally support the strong words of Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal after Saturday’s final when he said it was ‘stupid’ and ‘misplaced protectionism’. Mourad makes the point that it doesn’t make them any less English — in fact it enhances their desire to represent their country. Captain fantastic: Chris Robshaw (right) has grown in stature under Stuart Lancaster . Jonny Wilkinson went for lifestyle . reasons and a last great challenge to stimulate the final seasons of his . career. And what a success he made of it. Steffon Armitage simply . wanted to improve his game with a side that placed emphasis on his . skills. His brother Delon — another huge talent who I would seriously consider for any England squad picked purely on merit — also felt the south of France was the environment where his game could flourish. These were huge decisions the Armitage brothers made, uprooting family and tearing themselves away from the familiarity of Premiership rugby to test themselves in a hugely competitive league and to join a club where a First XV start had to be earned every week. There were no guarantees yet here they are with two Heineken Cup winner’s medals apiece. A coach looking on should be very impressed by the independence of mind and spirit, rather than be suspicious. Knocking on the door: Armitage's performances mean he surely cannot be ignored any longer .","Steffon Armitage man of the match in Toulon's Heineken Cup final win .

"The devastating extent of the brain injuries sustained by Formula One driver Jules Bianchi after he crashed into the back of a tractor were revealed on Tuesday. The 25-year-old Frenchman was diagnosed with diffuse axonal injury — a catastrophic head trauma from which he may never fully recover. Bianchi, considered to be among the rising stars of the sport, spent a third night in intensive care at Mie Hospital in Yokkaichi following his 110mph freak accident during the closing stages of Sunday's rain-hit Japanese Grand Prix. Paramedics rush to attend Jules Bianchi after he crashed into a recovery vehicle at Suzuka on Sunday . Nicolas Todt, Bianchi's manager, talks to the media at the Mie General Medical Center on Tuesday . 'He has suffered a diffuse axonal injury and is in a critical but stable condition,' a statement released by British-based team Marussia on behalf of the Bianchi family read. Edward McKintosh - Consultant Neurosurgeon at London Bridge Hospital: . 'A diffuse axonal injury is a complex condition and it is difficult to assess from the outside how a patient will react. 'An axonal injury is different to a blood clot or a tumour in the brain. The brain cells themselves become damaged, often with the connections between cells sheared off. 'That impairs the brain's ability to talk to itself. If deeper parts of the brain are injured this can affect blood pressure and a patient's heart rate, which can be fatal. 'Memory and personality can be affected and if it is severe, people often don't wake up. Bianchi has a chance, but it is an injury with a low recovery rate.' 'The medical professionals at the hospital are providing the very best treatment and care, and we are grateful for everything they have done for Jules since his accident. This is a very difficult time for our family, but the messages of support and affection for Jules from all over the world have been a source of great comfort to us.' 'We are also grateful for the presence of Professor Gerard Saillant, President of the FIA Medical Commission, and Professor Alessandro Frati, Neurosurgeon of the University of Rome La Sapienza, who has traveled to Japan at the request of Scuderia Ferrari. 'The hospital will continue to monitor and treat Jules and further medical updates will be provided when appropriate.' A diffuse axonal injury is one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic brain injury with a low recovery rate. Former Formula One medical boss Gary Hartstein conceded in his  blog that Bianchi's condition is one which is 'usually associated with a sombre prognosis'. Bianchi with his girlfriend Camille Marchetti at the Amber Lounge Fashion Show in Monaco earlier this year . Bianchi's injuries are not dissimilar to the head trauma sustained by Michael Schumacher which left the seven-time world champion fighting for his life following a skiing accident in the French Alps last December. The German, 45, is now recovering at his home in Switzerland after he was in a medically-induced coma for six months. Of Schumacher, Jean Todt, the FIA president, said on Tuesday: 'What we can say is that he will probably never again drive a Formula One car but he fights. 'We really believe that things will get better. He needs time and to be left alone.' Bianchi receives emergency medical treatment after hitting the tractor on lap 44 . VIDEO Bianchi remains in critical but stable condition . The FIA, Formula One's governing body issued a statement on Sunday regarding the Bianchi accident, which read: 'Adrian Sutil lost control of his car, spun and hit the tyre barrier on the outside of Turn 7. 'The marshals displayed double waved yellow flags before the corner to warn drivers of the incident. A recovery vehicle was despatched in order to lift the car and take it to a place of safety behind the guardrail. 'While this was being done the driver of car 17, Jules Bianchi, lost control of his car, traveled across the run-off area and hit the back of the tractor. 'Once the marshals reported that the driver was injured, medical teams were despatched and the Safety Car was deployed. These were followed by an extrication team and an ambulance. Bianchi races alongside Caterham's Marcus Ericsson in torrential conditions at Suzuka . Bianchi looks relaxed as he shelters from the rain just prior to the start of the Japanese Grand prix . Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a frequent result of traumatic acceleration/deceleration or rotational injuries and a frequent cause of persistent vegetative state in patients. In fact, DAI represents approximately one half of all intra-axial traumatic lesions. This lesion is the most significant cause of morbidity in patients with traumatic brain injuries, which most commonly result from high-speed motor vehicle accidents. Any patient with a closed head injury who experiences extensive loss of consciousness and neurological deficits warrants neuroimaging. Source: Medscape . 'The driver was removed from the car, taken to the circuit medical centre and then by ambulance to Mie General Hospital.' It added that a CT scan had shown Bianchi suffered 'a severe head injury' and that he was to undergo surgery before being moved to intensive care. The race, under threat of cancellation in the build-up as Typhoon Phanfone headed towards Suzuka, had already been red-flagged due to torrential rain in the early stages before Bianchi's accident. During a prolonged dry spell in between, Briton Hamilton caught and passed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance. The rain then came down again, driving conditions deteriorated and Bianchi crashed out, prompting the red flags to return and the race to be ended with nine laps to go. Doctors rush to the scene as it becomes clear that Bianchi has been seriously hurt . Williams driver Felipe Massa has said he had been 'screaming' over his radio during the race about the amount of water on the track, but former FIA president Max Mosley believes 'everything was done as it should have been' in relation to safety. Asked if Formula One is doing everything right to secure the safety of its drivers, Mosley told Sky Sports News on Monday: 'I think it is. 'I think what happened in Suzuka was very unfortunate, a freak accident. Felipe Massa says he was screaming for the race to be stopped due to the dangerous conditions . 'But I can't really fault any of the people involved - the marshals or the race director, any of those people. I think everything was done as it should have been.' Massa said he was trying his best to get the race called off in the run up to Sutil and Bianchi's accidents. 'I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous,' the Brazilian said on Sunday.","Jules Bianchi's family confirmed he  suffered a diffuse axonal injury (DAI) on Tuesday .

"Philadelphia has become the first city in America to ban 3D-printed guns amid fears such bootlegged firearms could fuel a surge in violent crime. Lawmakers of America's fifth biggest city passed a bill on Thursday, six months after the blueprint for the 3D gun known . as the Liberator was made available online by the group . Defense Distributed. In May, the State Department demanded the . design be taken offline on the basis that they could violate possible . arms trafficking violations, but not before it was downloaded more than . 100,000 times. 'It’s all pre-emptive,' spokesman Steve Cobb, director of legislation for bill-author Kenyatta Johnson, told Philly Magazine. 'It’s just based upon internet stuff out there.' No toy: It comes six months after the blueprint for the 3D gun known as the Liberator was made available online by the group Defense Distributed . New technology: An Ultimaker 3-D printer. The blueprints, that can be produced on a 3-D printer costing as little as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition . According to FBI crime statistics, Philadelphia reported 331 murders in 2012, ranking it among the most violent cities in the US. The decision comes a week after the Liberator was deemed a serious safety and security concern after a gun printed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exploded before it was even fired. The blueprints, that can be produced on a 3-D printer costing as little as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition. Dangerous city: According to FBI crime statistics, Philadelphia reported 331 murders in 2012, ranking it among the most violent cities in the US . The bureau released the results of its tests on the Liberator after posting a series of videos on the tests to YouTube. The weapon was found to have the power to penetrate several inches of flesh as well as a human skull. 'The . bottom line is, the penetration results demonstrated that the Liberator . is a lethal weapon,' Earl Griffith, chief of ATF's firearms technology . branch told the Huffington Post. 'The .380 bullets fired from the Liberator penetrate sufficiently to reach vital organs and perforate the skull.' The ATF printed several versions of the gun using different materials. Explosive: The Liberator made from Visijet exploded during testing . The gun printed in a plastic material called Visijet exploded during the test. But a gun rendered in a stronger plastic known as ABS shot eight rounds without any problems. '[The . testers] quit after eight rounds, but there was no issue with the . firearm at that point,' ATF spokesperson Tim Graden told Forbes. Authorities . say the guns are a particular concern because they're made of plastic . which is undetectable, meaning they could be brought into areas where . weapons would normally be banned such as airports, schools and courts. Depending . on the metal detector, a bullet might not be enough to set it off, and . the only way the gun itself could be detected would be with an X-ray . machine, which aren't used in many facilities. The gun manages to bypass the . Undetectable Firearms Act by including a metal block in its make-up. However, the metal part of the gun doesn't play any part in its function . and could be removed. Undetectable: Authorities are concerned that plastic 3-D guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors wouldn't find them . New threat: A Liberator pistol next to the 3D printer on which its components were made. The single-shot handgun is the first firearm that can be made entirely with plastic components forged with a 3D printer . The . Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 expires early next month, and there is . a push to have the law updated to account for printed plastic guns.

"England are refusing to rule Manu Tuilagi out of next month's autumn internationals despite Leicester insisting his groin injury will prevent him playing any role. Tigers director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, is adamant Tuilagi will not be involved in any of the Tests against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia after limping off against Ulster on Saturday. The 23-year-old centre was omitted from the 33-man squad for the QBE Series picked by head coach Stuart Lancaster, but tellingly his name was also missing from the list of injured players not considered for selection. England centre Manu Tuilagi could be fit for the last couple of November Tests, insists coach Stuart Lancaster . Tuilagi limped off after 15 minutes of Saturday's 25-18 Champions Cup victory over Ulster with a groin injury . Tuilagi was outstanding against the All Blacks during England's three-Test tour in New Zealand last summer . While the opener against New Zealand on November 8 and the clash with South Africa seven days later are clearly beyond Tuilagi, Lancaster has raised hopes that he may be involved beyond that. 'The reason we brought Jonathan Joseph into the camp is that Manu won't be fit for the start of the series, but we have not shut the door,' said Lancaster, who retains Chris Robshaw as captain for the autumn. 'It could take six weeks but we'll never say never. It's a joint management programme between us and Leicester and between us we have to get it right. 'The most important person in all of this is Manu and we have to make sure we get his rehabilitation right and get him some game time. 'There's no definitive timeline. It's not that sort of injury.' Head coach (centre) named his 33-man England Elite Player Squad on Wednesday . Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni is one of three uncapped players included in the 33, with Lancaster revealing his promotion at the expense of Chris Ashton offers England similar game-breaking ability to Tuilagi. Fijian-born Rokoduguni, a lance-corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, has been devastating at the Recreation Ground this season and Lancaster views him as a contender to start against the All Blacks. 'We're keen to get working with him because he's been outstanding for Bath,' Lancaster said. 'When you lose someone like Manu, Roko comes into the equation because of his impact in collisions, his ability to beat defenders and carry the ball over the gainline. He's a finisher as well.' Even allowing for the raw promise offered by Rokoduguni, Tuilagi's power will be missed next month and his absence leaves a gaping hole in England's backline. Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni has earned an England call-up after scoring six tries in seven matches . Inside centre in particular and the midfield combination in general have long been the source of headaches for England, although Lancaster hints that Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt will be paired against New Zealand. 'I wouldn't say the centres are an area of concern,' Lancaster said. 'Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond have both been outstanding and you have Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees there as well. There's plenty of competition. 'Then there is Jonathan Joseph who is perhaps the form centre of all of them. 'It's about balance - you want a balance of pace, power and footballing ability. 'We will see them head to head (in training) and we will make our decisions on the combinations.' England will be aiming to win the Hilary Shield (left) and the Cook Cup vs New Zealand and Australia . High-profile omissions from the 33 are Danny Cipriani and Freddie Burns with Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler chosen as the squad's three fly-halves. 'I wouldn't say Danny's gone backwards,' Lancaster said. 'Stephen Myler was very unlucky not to start the first Test against New Zealand in June - he would have done had he not played in the Premiership final. 'Stephen Myler has the best skills execution, has played in big games and deserves his chance. 'Freddie and Danny have done well in games this season, but we've gone for the consistency that Stephen has shown and the attacking prowess of George Ford, while Owen's inclusion is merited on what he's done in the past.' Centre Billy Twelvetrees and wing Jonny May are present despite enduring mixed tours to New Zealand in the summer. Northampton flanker Calum Clark features among the six back rows, while George Kruis is included in a senior England squad for the first time.

"Semesa Rokoduguni is a lance corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guard. Read Chris Foy's interview with England's new man from back in May here. England have named Fijian-born solider Semesa Rokoduguni in their Elite Player squad along with uncapped Saracens lock George Kruis ahead of the upcoming QBE Series. Head coach Stuart Lancaster on Wednesday unveiled his core 33-man squad ahead of the four Test series with the uncapped Rokoduguni included ahead of the vastly more Chris Ashton. As revealed in Sportsmail, Rokoduguni’s selection is reward for some sensational form in only his second full season as a professional rugby player while Ashton’s omission is a serious blow to his hopes of featuring in next year’s World Cup.

Rokoduguni is one of four wingers named, alongside Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell and Jonny May while in-form Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani is another notable absentee, with Lancaster opting for the more prosaic skills of Stephen Myler as his third-choice fly half behind Owen Farrell and George Ford. Gloucester’s Freddie Burns also misses out. Jonathan Joseph replaces the injured Manu Tuilagi with Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and Luther Burrell named as the other centres. Explaining his selections, Lancaster said: 'We have had some injuries but I'm excited about the form of those selected. Especially Calum Clark and George Kruis. 'I don't think Danny Cipriani has gone backwards. If you look at Stephen Myler he has executed his skills better than anyone I'm the premiership. We look for consistency and he was unlucky not to start the first test in New Zealand.' Rokoduguni’s inclusion completes an extraordinary transition for the Afghanistan war veteran, who only signed professional papers with Bath in 2012 after director of rugby Mike Ford spotted him playing for the Army in a friendly against Newcastle and brought him to the Recreation Ground on trial the following season. Lancaster said: 'Rokoduguni is an exciting prospect and we've talked about starting him. I know (coaches) Mike Catt and Andy Farrell are looking forward to working with him.' Saracens lock George Kruis has also been called up for the first time by England . November 8 vs New Zealand . November 15 v South Africa . November 22 v Samoa . November 29 v Australia . On, Tuesday, Rokoduguni said: ‘It has been my target over the last two seasons to play international rugby with England. I’m pretty confident with the way I’m playing. I feel ready for the step up. ‘Back in my village I played rugby but I wasn’t the first-choice winger. I trained hard every single day and still didn’t get picked. I was always told there was someone who was a better winger than me.’ Up front, Northampton flanker Calum Clark – banned for 32 weeks in 2012 for breaking Leicester hooker Rob Hawkins’ arm – is one of Lancaster’s back-row selections along with captain Chris Robshaw, Tom Wood, James Haskell, Ben Morgan and Billy Vunipola. Uncapped Northampton flanker Calum Clark (second right) gets a chance to impress .

"Danny Cipriani has every right to feel aggrieved and bewildered by his omission from this England squad - which is otherwise a largely logical selection based on current fitness and form. The Sale fly-half is without question one of the country's three leading No 10s at present, but he has been overlooked despite making a favourable impression when recalled for the June tour of New Zealand. As exclusively revealed by Sportsmail last week, head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants have chosen Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler as their stand-offs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lancaster: England will be ready for Rugby World Cup . Danny Cipriani has been left out of Stuart Lancaster's England squad for the autumn internationals . Cipriani has been one of England's leading No 10s this season but has been overlooked by Lancaster . Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), D Wilson (Bath), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), B Morgan (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens), T Wood (Northampton).

There can be no quibbling with the inclusion of the first two men, although Farrell's lack of game-time this season is cause for concern. He has started just once for Saracens and missed three matches with a hamstring injury, before making a late cameo comeback last Saturday. It will be intriguing to see if his club help England out by naming Farrell in their line-up to face Munster on Friday, or keep him in reserve as Charlie Hodgson is playing so majestically. Of course, there may be a compromise option with Farrell in midfield, which is a scenario the national team may also consider, with Ford as the primary playmaker at 10. The Bath tyro has been mostly very impressive in the early stages of this campaign, but he - along with many of his club-mates, suffered a chastening experience in Glasgow last weekend. Yet, that didn't harm his Test prospects as he had already done enough to make the cut. George Ford (right) has made a good start to the season even though his Bath side were beaten by Glasgow . November 8 vs New Zealand . November 15 v South Africa . November 22 v Samoa . November 29 v Australia . It is the third fly-half place which prompts the heated debate. Lancaster and the rest of the England management team had more or less settled on their selections last week, but the first round of European matches held their thinking up to awkward scrutiny. For 40 minutes in Salford, Cipriani was magnificent in leading Munster a merry dance. Some shaky moments followed, but he will always create more problems for the other team than his own. He has a range of individual skills and a sheer audacity that Myler does not deliver for Northampton. In the first week of the season, the Saints' stand-off was superb against Gloucester - showcasing a greater variety of kicking and distribution than in the past. But he will often act as a steady link-man for his club; bringing in powerful runners around him and kicking his goals. He is seen as steady and reliable, but he missed a crucial kick in Paris on Saturday as Northampton lost, whereas Cipriani's goal-kicking was immaculate for Sale, on a high-pressure occasion. Lancaster's decision to pick Stephen Myler over Cipriani is a conservative and cautious decision . The decision to pick Myler ahead of Cipriani is a conservative, cautious one, which deprives England of the option of turning to a creative player who could pull a rabbit out of a hat when they are chasing a game. This squad announcement was delayed in order for relevant form to be taken into account, but that doesn't appear to have happened in this case. Elsewhere, it has. Choosing Semesa Rokoduguni as one of the wings makes sense as the Fiji-born Bath flier has been the most effective wide-man in the Aviva Premiership this season. The omission of Chris Ashton is harsh on the basis of his fine club form, but comes down to doubts stemming from his tour efforts. Yet, there have also been management doubts about Jonny May, but he is in. Semesa Rokoduguni (with ball) has been the most effective wide-man in the Premiership this season . The loss of Manu Tuilagi to injury is a savage blow to England's autumn prospects, but the inclusion of Jonathan Joseph is the right response. He has been superb for Bath - running with real menace and scoring tries. Midfield is an area of regular concern for Lancaster, but the coaches are right to give Billy Twelvetrees the benefit of the doubt. Up front, a raft of front-five injuries limited the coaches' options, and there can be few arguments with their selections. In the absence of Geoff Parling and Ed Slater, there was a tussle for the fourth lock place and George Kruis of Saracens has won the vote. In the back row, Calum Clark has been excelling for Northampton and his consistency of late has been fairly rewarded.

Powell will make an immediate return by competing on Tuesday in the men's 100 metres at Lucerne in Switzerland. The pair were suspended by a Jamaica Anti-doping disciplinary panel after testing positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine. Boost: Asafa Powell has been given the go-ahead to return to action after having a ban reduced . They . appealed to CAS to have their bans reduced to three months and the . appeals were partially upheld. As the six-month bans have already been . served, they are now eligible to compete. Powell wrote on Twitter: 'Finally this weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Justice has been served. Now let's run!' A statement on CAS' website read: 'CAS has upheld in part the appeals filed by the Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson against the decisions of the Jamaica Anti-doping disciplinary panel imposing a suspension of 18 months on both of them, starting on 21 June 2013. 'The CAS decided to reduce their period of ineligibility to 6 months, which has been already served.

Reason to smile: Sherone Simpson is free to compete again after the Court of Arbitration ruling . 'Both athletes filed appeals at CAS . against their 18-month suspension.

Finally this weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Justice has been served. Now let's run!' The 31-year-old then added he would make an instant return to the track in Lucerne tomorrow. The reduction of the ban - given after he tested positive at the Jamaican national championships last summer - means he can return ahead of his scheduled date of December. Powell, who held the 100 metres world record between 2005 and 2008, had initially expressed his unhappiness at the ban, saying in April: 'This ruling is not only unfair, it is patently unjust. 'Panels such as these, I understood, were . assembled to allow athletes who consciously or unconsciously come into . conflict with the rules of sport a chance at equitable redemption. Unfortunately, this was not the case.' Powell claimed that he took a legal supplement, Ephiphany D1, which was contaminated with oxilofrine. He added: 'I want to reiterate that I have never knowingly taken any banned substances. I did all the necessary checks before taking Ephiphany D1 and it is my hope that the CAS will prove to be a more open and fair avenue for the review of all the facts in my case - facts and truth that were not taken into consideration at my initial hearing.' His wish has now been granted but, like Simpson, he will miss next week's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with the Jamaican squad having already been selected during their suspension. Like Powell, Simpson tested positive in last summer's Championships and blamed the positive result on a supplement given to her by a training partner. She had initially been suspended until December 20.","Powell will make an immediate return to action on Tuesday in the men's 100m in Lucerne .

"Tragedy: Miss Saldanha was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at London's King Edward VII hospital . An inquiry has been launched by Australia’s media watchdog today into a radio station's prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital, which was followed by the apparent suicide of a nurse. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will examine whether radio station 2Day FM and staff were in breach of . broadcasting licence conditions. The station risks being shut down if found to have broken the rules. ACMA is also expected to ask 2Day FM’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, to name those responsible for approving broadcast of the hoax call. ACMA's chairman, Mr Chris Chapman, said it would be examining ‘whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations.’ Miss Saldanha was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at London’s King Edward VII hospital from Sydney DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian. She and another nurse in the ward where the Duches of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness believed they were talking to the Queen and Prince Charles, despite the unimpressive attempts by the DJs to imitate the royals. Although Austero has repeatedly apologised for the ‘tragic, . regrettable death’ of the nurse and has committed at least $500,000 . (£326,000) to a memorial fund for her family, the media watchdog has . shown its determination to dig deeper into the scandal. The radio show's producers and lawyers on duty at the time of the hoax are expected to be questioned. Scroll down for video . Apologetic: Following the death of nurse Saldanha, the two DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian (pictured) appeared on . Australian TV and expressed their sorrow for the tragic consequences of . their hoax call . Following the death of nurse Saldanha, the two DJs appeared on Australian TV and expressed their sorrow for the tragic consequences of their hoax call. The watchdog will be referring heavily to the radio broadcasting code, particular a part which states that it is a breach to record a person in conversation, and also air it, without their knowledge. Section 6.1 of the code states that ‘a licensee must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless that person has been informed in advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be broadcast.’ The section adds that there must not be a broadcast unless, ‘in the case of words which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person, that person has subsequently, but prior to the broadcast, expressed consent to the broadcast of the word.’ The station’s parent company has said it attempted to contact the hospital five times following the hoax call to discuss it, but had not been able to speak to anyone. Mother-of-two Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanged at her hospital apartment last Friday morning, just days after the hoax call and left a note for her family. She . had not told her husband or children that she was involved in the . incident, meaning the letter may provide their only clue to what . prompted the respected nurse to take such a drastic and tragic step. Austereo has since pledged to donate $500,000 (£326,000) from its advertising profits to her family. Condolences: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent their condolences to the Saldanha family following the death of nurse Saldanha who worked on the ward where the Duchess was being treated for morning sickness . Rhys Holleran,the company's chief executive officer said how sorry they were for what had happened. 'It is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with the family. 'We . hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the . Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time. 'The . company reiterates that it is deeply saddened by this tragic and . unforeseen event and offers its condolences to the family of Jacintha . Saldanha.' Austereo also cancelled the 2Day FM's . Christmas party out of respect for Miss Saldanha, and donate the cash to . two Australian charities that handle emotional, life threatening . problems. As much as £8,000 had been set aside . to entertain between 200 and 250 of the radio station's staff, before . executives decided the party would be inappropriate. Before . the nurse's death, Mr Christian said he expected the hoax would be the . highlight of his career, and might have expected jubilant celebration at . the end of year party. Instead, . a company spokesperson said: 'Cancellation of the party was . entirely out of respect for the nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, and her . family. This is not a time for celebration at the radio station.' The . party was due to be held at a trendy nightclub called the Oxford Art . Factory on Sydney's popular nightlife strip, Oxford Street. Bereft: All the profits from the radio station's advertising will be donated to nurse Jacintha Saldanha's family. Pictured centre, her husband Benedict Barboza visits Westminster with their children Lisha, left, 14, and Junal, right, 16 . Lord . Glenarthur, chairman of the hospital where Miss Saldanha worked, . welcomed news of Southern Cross Media Group's donation to the family. He said: 'Jacintha Saldanha was an outstanding nurse who was much loved by everyone at King Edward VII’s Hospital. 'After . discussion with her family, we have established the Jacintha Saldanha . Memorial Fund to benefit her husband and children at this difficult . time. I am pleased to announce that many donations have already been . made from around the world. 'I . have read that Southern Cross Media Group have pledged to make a . minimum donation of $500,000 Australian Dollars to an appropriate fund. We would certainly welcome such a donation.' Meanwhile Family spokesman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, said Mrs . Saldanha's family were demanding answers from the hospital about the . circumstances that led to her death.

"Actress Scarlett Johansson is known for her husky voice and sex appeal. According to the study, women use a lower pitch when speaking to a partner . Plenty of people have noticed how their friends change their voices when they are talking to a partner and now scientists have demonstrated men and women really do alter the pitch of their voice when talking to a person they are romantically interested in. U.S. researchers found the change in tonality was particularly apparent on the phone and that both men and women tried to match or mimic their partner or love interest's voice. According to the study, women will use a lower pitch, while men will employ a higher one when speaking to their romantic partner. The psychologist who led the study believes the change in people's voice variations when they are talking to friends versus lovers, could be used to detect infidelity too. The study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, looked at how individuals alter . their voices, or engage in voice modulation, when speaking to romantic . partners versus same-sex friends during brief telephone conversations. Researchers from Albright College, Pennsylvania, studied the voices of 24 callers who were newly in love and enjoying the 'honeymoon period'. Callers were asked to phone their . romantic partners, as well as a close same-sex friend and in both cases start a conversation that specifically asked 'how are you?' and 'what . are you doing?' Researchers from Albright College, Pennsylvania, studied the voices of 24 callers who were newly in love and enjoying the 'honeymoon period'. Callers were asked to phone their romantic partners, as well as a close same-sex friend and in both cases ask 'how are you?' and 'what are you doing?' Researchers then played the recordings to . 80 independent raters who judged the samples for sexiness, pleasantness . and degree of romantic interest. Raters were exposed to only one end of . the conversation and in some cases, for only 2 seconds. They were able to correctly identify . whether the caller was speaking to a friend or lover, leading . researchers to believe that people alter their voice to communicate . their relationship status. 'Vocal samples directed toward romantic partners were rated as sounding more pleasant, sexier and reflecting greater romantic interest than those directed toward same-sex friends,' study leader Professor Susan Hughes said. The researchers also performed a spectrogram analysis on the samples to examine pitch and found  both men and women mimic or match the pitch of their romantic partners. David Beckham has a relatively high-pitched voice - perhaps helping him appeal to women. Researchers found both men and women mimic or match the pitch of their romantic partners.

Women will use a lower pitch, while men will employ a higher one when speaking to their romantic partner. The study said this effect 'represents desire for affiliation and intimacy' and is a 'way to communicate affection and relational connection - ""I am one with you.""' Interestingly, the scientists also found that when the samples were strippedof their language content while keeping inflection and intonation, raters could sense stress and nervousness in the voices of the study participants who were speaking to their lovers. Professor Hughes said: 'There was vulnerability associated with the voices of those newly in love. Perhaps people don’t want to be rejected.'","U.S. researchers found that both men and .

"It is a costly business looking good and staying up to date with the latest fashion. But growing numbers of women are taking matters into their own hands, resorting to a new trend of buying clothes, wearing them - then taking them back for a refund. Indeed one in six admit to ‘wardrobing’ – with more than one in ten confessing that it’s a regular habit. Weddings, job interviews and black-tie events are the occasions most likely to make a woman consider what is known in America as 'return fraud'. One in six women admit to 'wardrobing', a new trend of buying clothes, wearing them - then taking them back for a refund . The money-saving scam is most often done with expensive clothing - hence the name - but the practice is also common with tools, electronics, and even computers. One in seven women, 14 per cent, explain they buy and return clothes so they have the chance to wear the latest trends just once, and the same number claim when they want to impress they don’t think twice about the price of an outfit, knowing they can get a refund. The process is not for the risk-adverse with snags and spillages holding the potential to spoil a well laid refund plan. However, the most experienced ‘Wardrobers’ have plenty of tricks up their sleeves to avoid awkward questions at the till. Nine per cent of women surveyed seek out clothes that have a safety pin tag – which means the label can be removed and replaced. And one in twenty spray the item with air freshener before returning it. The most experienced 'Wardrobers' have plenty of tricks up their sleeves to avoid awkward questions at the till (file picture) Anita Naik, consumer editor at VoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research, said: ‘Our research reveals that over a quarter of women who admit to ‘wardrobing’ feel guilty about it, but the pressure to look good on special occasions makes it feel like the only option for some to look good on a budget.’ The survey also revealed that those who earn a living in the entertainment industry are the most prolific ‘Wardrobers’ with over a third, 39 per cent, admitting to it. On the other hand, teachers are the most honest in their shopping habits with only 10per cent having returned a worn item. Women of Worcester are the worst ‘wardrobing’ culprits with a third admitting they have tricked local stores this way, whereas ladies of Leicester are the least likely to do it. Department stores in the US have created a new technique to help combat return fraud. American upmarket fashion chain, Bloomingdale's now puts unsightly black tags on the front of garments that cost over $150, and the company won't accept your return without them. It is thought the scam, which stores say is no worse than stealing, is a product of our ‘fast-fashion culture’, where trends are popular for a short time then become outdated and therefore worthless.","One in six women buy clothes, wear them and then return the items .

"HOW WE ARE by Vincent Deary (Allen Lane £16.99) WHAT I KNOW FOR SURE by Oprah Winfrey (Pan Macmillan £14.99) The two books on my desk couldn’t be more different yet they share a similar aim: to nudge readers towards leading a better, happier life. One is big, one is small. One is a first book by a hitherto unknown health psychologist and therapist, the other is by an international media superstar. One is baggy and would have benefited from some pruning and shaping. The other is so distilled I’d have liked more. Vincent Deary’s ideas are dense, sometimes irritatingly pretentious, fascinating, jumbled and often profound. For 14 years, Oprah Winfrey has written a column called What I Know For Sure in her own magazine Oprah, and now they are collected in an appealing book that packs a bigger punch than expected . Oprah Winfrey would probably be happy with the description ‘homespun wisdom’ yet her simply expressed thoughts resonate with the clarity of a small bell. Both are, in essence personal journeys which invite readers to walk a little way in the author’s shoes, then critically examine their own worn-out old footwear. How We Are is the first volume of a promised trilogy with the grandly ambitious title, How To Live. It will be followed by How We Break and then How We Mend. This is, in essence, self-help for literary intellectuals, who love Alain de Botton (as I do) but would probably regard reading Oprah Winfrey as beneath them. Oprah's self-help book is more heartfelt and straightforward . And by the way, I write in the conviction that in encouraging people to re-construct their lives, ‘self-help’ or personal development and inspirational books can do much good. Bring them on, I say. There’s a lot of need out there. Deary’s aim is to make us understand how much of our lives settle into ‘grooves’ of habit, often without us being aware of the fact. From the routes we take to the way we dress (some wonderfully well-observed insights here), our daily lives are circumscribed by set ways of thinking, feeling and acting which can render us ‘stuck’ in an unfulfilling present. Change is terrifying — and yet the discomfort (sometimes agony) of shifting our habits is an essential part of the process. No pain, no gain, as they say. As an advice columnist, I recognise the truth (in terms of my readers’ problems) of this: ‘ . . .if the new is to become our new normal, if we are to get through to the end, we must be, for a while, overwhelmed. ‘These are the moments of truth, where we either give up or push on.’ The end of a relationship, or job, or working life . . . these are just some of the stages in life which require us to change. Bereavement is another. Deary introduces us to some of his family and friends to illustrate points — and lets us into some of the dilemmas of his own life to enable us to see how many small decisions, made each day, add up to cumulative change. For much of the book he appears to be saying, ‘Look at me, I’m neurotic and make mistakes like the best of you and I’m really, really terrified of writing this book, too.’ He writes: ‘May I not falter. I am dedicating myself to this project on transformation in the hope it might be a transformative project.’ 3,000 people... Number of guests Oprah has had on her show since it started in 1986 . In other words, he wants to help himself. Such self-consciousness can grate, but it’s also endearing. Similarly, his range of references might intimidate — or exhilarate. So his writing can be as indigestible as an over-rich meal, yet when he writes simply (from the breath of his professional and personal experience), choosing to communicate directly, he can be uplifting: ‘ . . .improvement happens, people get better. I mean better at living, at being who they are, at handling life with grace, humour and courage.’ Those three qualities abound in Oprah Winfrey’s collection. For 14 years, she has written a column called What I Know For Sure in her own magazine Oprah, and now they are collected in an appealing book that packs a bigger punch than expected. Oprah is more open than Vincent Deary about the traumas of her life; on the other hand, this is to be expected since her traumatic childhood is already in the public domain. Vincent Deary’s ideas are dense, sometimes irritatingly pretentious, fascinating, jumbled and often profound . Yet there’s still something sublime in the way she cuts to the chase: . ‘I know for sure that healing the wounds of the past is one of the biggest and most worthwhile challenges of life. It’s important to know when and how you were programmed so you can change the program. And doing so is your responsibility, no one else’s. That is the irrefutable law of the universe: We are each responsible for our own life.’ Yes, indeed. That thought doesn’t need to be hedged about with theory or quotation. It’s clear that Oprah was determined to heal herself with the practice of mindfulness before it became a fashionable buzz-word. She says her ‘number one spiritual practice is trying to live in the present moment’ and yet there is nothing ’new-age’ about this African-American woman whom both peers and younger women rightly regard as such an inspiration. On the contrary, she revels in material possessions (like her very own plane) and friends and dogs and spending Sundays in pyjamas. She says she lives in a condition of ‘exhilarated contentment’ yet you know it has been hard-won. She’s struggled with her weight and with her memories of childhood abuse. The small book carries many messages, although professional therapists will judge sentences like this as embarrassingly over-simple: ‘The Creator has given you full responsibility for your life and with that responsibility comes an amazing privilege — the power to give yourself the love, affection and intimacy you may not have received as a child.’ Yet there Oprah is writing from the depths of her own life, and her message is one many people want — and need — to hear. Vincent Deary challenges the mind and Oprah Winfrey massages the soul — and all to the good, because both books could change lives.","Vincent Deary’s ideas are dense, sometimes irritatingly pretentious, fascinating, jumbled and often profound .

"ADVENTURES IN STATIONERY by James Ward (Profile £12.99) It seems we just can't get enough of stationery and many of us grow attached to our staplers and notebooks . Ah, stationery. Pens, notebooks, staples, paperclips. Envelopes in countless sizes, files and folders, rolls of white stickers, paper lined and plain. Do I love stationery because I’m a writer? Or here’s a more terrifying thought: did I become a writer because I have a bit of a thing about stationery? Not everyone who writes for a living has a weird and over-arching interest in the tools of their trade, though you can spot many of us loitering dangerously outside Ryman’s most mornings of the week. Muriel Spark, interviewed a few years before her death, revealed that she wrote each of her slender, but pithy novels in a particular type of notebook she had found at a stationer’s in Edinburgh. When she heard that the manufacturers of the notebook were going out of business, she quickly bought up the remaining stock. In her 80s, she had only two or three left. When her supply ran out, she would stop writing. I have often wondered since whether she lived long enough to run out of these books. James Ward understands all this implicitly. He grew up in Worcester Park, Surrey, and used to hang around Fowlers, an independent stationers on the High Street. They had foolscap suspension files. The young Ward was entranced. ‘I would spend long periods of time here studying these objects. Picking them up, turning them over in my hand. Sometimes I’d even buy something.’ Children's author Roald Dahl famously favoured American pencils and sharpened six each morning . Recently, he returned to Fowlers, which hadn’t changed at all, and rooting around on the shelves found a Velos 1377 revolving desk tidy. Remember that? It was a small, round plastic item, with a transparent cover and six compartments. In each section you’d keep drawing pins, paper clips or bulldog clips. The box was covered with dust and obviously hadn’t been touched for years. He had to have it. It was so old it didn’t have a barcode. He thought it might be older than he was. Ward’s book (his first) is a heartfelt paean to stationery, as well as a history of some of its component parts. If you ever wanted to find out who invented Tipp-Ex or how paper clips came to be that shape, this is the place to find out. Foolscap paper, for example, was named after the fool’s cap watermark that particular size of paper used to carry from the 15th century onwards. How much more romantic a name, somehow, than A4. The Moleskine notebook, a beautiful artefact in itself, calls itself ‘the heir and successor’ to the ‘legendary’ notebook used by such notable figures as Van Gogh, Picasso and Hemingway. This does not mean it’s exactly the same thing. When the Moleskine brand was bought by its current owners, the note ‘bound and printed in China’ started appearing on the products. Picasso enjoyed using Moleskine notebooks . There was uproar. Had production of these ancient and important notebooks been moved there? No, they had always been made there. But that didn’t stop some Moleskine aficionados from stockpiling the old, ‘proper’ Moleskines. Stationery can drive people doolally. In the 18th century, Keswick, in Cumbria, was the global centre of pencil manufacture. The highest quality graphite in the world was mined nearby. Roald Dahl favoured American pencils, and sharpened six each morning. John Steinbeck had a huge callus on the third finger of his right hand just from using a pencil for so many hours a day. He favoured Faber-Castell’s Blackwing 602, but acknowledged that, in one sense, his life had been an unending quest for the perfect pencil. Stationery is, according to research, the most effective form of promotional merchandise there is. Give people a free pen and they will love you for ever. In 2007, Ikea customers in the UK used 12,317,184 pencils. Morrissey once described visiting Ryman’s as ‘the most extreme sexual experience one could ever have’. As Ward points out, this probably means ‘the most extreme sexual experience one could ever have with Morrissey’. Which office stationery item lasts longest? Ward thinks it might be the stapler. ‘You’ll move on to another job, but your stapler will remain. Returned to the stationery cupboard, awaiting a new owner, ready to build a new relationship.’ Sometimes, though, the bond becomes too strong. According to Rexel, during the recent recession many staff made redundant took their staplers home. Ernest Hemingway was also devoted to a particular brand of stationery . Ward reveals, en passant, that he worked in libraries ‘for many years’. (His favourite classification number in the Dewey Decimal system is 651: Office Services.) Anyone who can call a chapter ‘Everything I know about people, I learnt from pens’ is likely to have a singular take on the world, and so it proves. Most important of all, in this age of rampant technological advance, he believes that stationery has a bright future. ‘No one has ever needed to borrow a charger because the battery on their pencil has died.’ This is the optimism that created the Post-it note and Pritt stick. Stationery devotees across the globe can only hope he’s right.

"Ruby Jessop was just 14-years-old when she was deemed 'sexually mature' by polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs and forced to marry her second cousin and step-brother and have sex with different men. She was held against her will at the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for the next 12 years, in which time she bore six children and lived under the iron fist of the pervert leader. Ruby Jessop, now 26, managed to escape from the sick and twisted world of Warren Jeffs last month and has now been granted temporary custody of the children aged from two to ten, who were being held 'hostage' by the sect, her sister said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Earlier this month, Ruby Jessop, now 26, . managed to escape from the sick and twisted world of Warren Jeffs, who forced her to marry when she was 14, left, . and was also granted temporary custody of her six children . Arizona attorney general Tom Horne, left, and Ruby Jessop, rear centre, and her six children during the news conference where he announced a probe into a polygamist sect along the Utah-Arizona border . The resolution to her incredible story came to light after police held a press conference on Tuesday to announce she managed to leave the walled compound in Colorado City, Arizona, as a result of a criminal probe of the polygamous sect and and the nearby Marshall's office. Arizona's attorney general Tom Horne spoke today of what happened to Ruby and revealed there were many more in her situation. 'What they do is say, ""Everybody watch her so she won’t run away."" Then she can’t leave. Women who wanted to escape have been forcibly held by the marshals against their will.' Attorneys for the two towns and the Marshal’s Office adamantly denied the charges, calling Horne’s words 'inflammatory'. Lawyer Blake Hamilton said: 'I can’t speak for the FLDS but the bottom line is the Marshal’s Office absolutely does not hold people against their will. The Arizona attorney general, as the highest ranking law enforcement official in Arizona, ought not be making those statements unless he has evidence of it.' Horne was joined at the news . conference by Ruby's older sister Flora Jessop, a vocal critic of the FLDS who fled the . church in 1986, as well as Ruby and her children. Jessop said her sister finally found the courage to run away five months ago after Jeffs imposed even stricter rules on his followers, wielding his influence even from behind bars. 'In the last six months, Warren Jeffs has taken every dietary product away except beans and water. They are to suffer as much as he is in prison.' She was forced to return to the community because the FLDS would not give her her children and that the Colorado City Marshal's Office, which she calls Warren Jeffs' personal 'security force', did 'everything they could to block her getting access to her children'. When they were reunited last week, Flora revealed the children had been brainwashed into thinking their mother was 'wicked'. Hildale, Utah sits at the base of red rock cliff mountains with its sister town, Colorado City. Arizona attorney general Tom Horne says police there work with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to stop women leaving . The FDLS church has seen a massive drop in followers since leader Warren Jeffs was convicted for child sex abuse . But they are now returning to normality and embracing life in the outside world, according to The Republic. 'They . came out of Colorado City with only the long skirts on their backs,' Flora said, referring to old-fashioned dresses worn by women in FLDS . society. 'It’s been interesting and amazing to watch them change from . little soldiers to children...who laugh and play. 'It's like they cannot get enough food in their bellies. They want to taste and try everything.' Flora said her sister, who did not speak on advice of her lawyers, had been held . captive by the FLDS for years, undergoing sexual and mental abuse at the . hands of her cousin husband while not being allowed to leave with her kids. Though Horne didn't go into specifics . about Ruby's escape, he did say that sheriff deputies were . 'instrumental' after law enforcement was beefed up in the area. Ruby was forced to marry her . stepbrother Haven Barlow, then in his early 20s, in a spiritual ceremony in Hilldale, Utah in . 2001, aged 14, and Flora had been trying to reach her ever since. Ruby and Haven were legally married when she turned 16. Ruby's stepfather at the time was Fred Jessop. The Jessops and Barlows are the two founding families of the FLDS. In 2001 Fred Jessop was the top councilor to Warren Jeffs. Fred died in 2005. Warren Jeffs, who was in 2001 the second in . command of the FLDS to the then-prophet, Warren's elderly father Rulon, . officiated Ruby's wedding. Rulon died and Warren became prophet in 2002. Free: Ruby Jessop, who was helped to leave a polygamist sect along the Utah-Arizona border . In 2001 just after the wedding, Ruby's sister Flora approached the Attorney General's office  saying her sister was missing and being held somewhere in Hilldale or Colorado City. Ruby had tried to escape before her wedding but failed. Officials searched at the time and turned up nothing at the time and Flora did see Ruby for more than a decade. Ruby escaped Colorado City just weeks ago. 'I thought this day would never come,' Flora said at the conference on Tuesday. 'It has been amazing to have my sister back with us. She's got amazing children, and it's been so much fun having them at my home.' 'Twelve years ago, I got a call from my sister who has 14 years old and . had been placed in an arranged marriage,' Flora Jessop told ABCNews.com. 'She had managed to get away and I gave her a promise that I would do . everything I could to keep her safe. Then, before I could get to her and . get her help, she disappeared and was taken back into the group.' Ruby's children, meanwhile, are thrilled . to no longer be on an all-bean diet mandated by jailed Jeffs. They are . all staying with Flora. Flora Jessop (left) embraces her sister Ruby as they listen to Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne's concerns over the Mormon church . Meanwhile Jeffs, 56, was convicted of sexually assaulting two minors last year  whom he described as his spiritual wives. At . the trial, prosecutors presented DNA evidence to show he fathered a . child with one of those girls, aged 15. He is serving a life sentence in . a Texas prison. The church . does not have a spokesperson to speak on its behalf, and Jeffs, who is . said to still rule the sect, is jailed for life in Texas after . convictions on child sex and bigamy charges. Horne fought last year for a bill in . the Arizona Legislature aimed at abolishing the Marshal's Office in . Colorado City, and replacing law enforcement there with deputies from . the Mohave County Sheriff's Office. It . failed to pass, so he allocated funds to provide for limited patrols by . deputies but says the money will soon run out, and he is again asking . the Legislature to take up the bill. Mohave County Sheriff Tom Sheahan said his agency also is involved in a criminal investigation of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office. He described authorities there as 'security guards for the FLDS church.'. Polygamist Warren Steed Jeffs before he was sentenced to life in prison on bigamy and child sex charges (left) and in court (right) Terrorized: Female members of the FLDS Church who were forced to marry and have sex with Warren Jeffs when they were teenagers . Warren Jeffs gave specific instructions on the . bed - it should be padded and long enough to hold him and there . should be a plastic cover on the mattress to 'protect from what will . happen' 'They are corrupt and work only for the FLDS and Warren Jeffs,' Sheahan said. He said it's a dangerous situation for his deputies to be patrolling Colorado City without the cooperation of local law enforcement from the Marshal's Office. 'They are not our allies,' Sheahan said. 'I wouldn't trust them as backup for our deputies.' The FLDS Church teaches that a man having multiple wives is ordained by God and is a requirement for a man to receive the highest form of salvation. It is generally believed in the church that a man should have a minimum of three wives to fulfill this requirement. Wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands. The church has come under fire over allegations of sexual and mental abuse of wives and underage polygamous marriages. There are said to be over 30,000 people practising polygamy in Utah, Idaho, Montana and Arizona, even though it is illegal. Another attorney who represents Colorado City called the allegations outlandish, and said the Marshal's Office works well with Mohave County deputies. 'The Marshal's Office welcomes the presence of the sheriff's deputies because it provides them with backup,' said lawyer Jeff Matura. 'The more police service, the better protection for everyone.' Last year, the U.S. Justice Department sued Colorado City and Hildale, claiming discrimination against residents who are not FLDS members. Arizona also has a similar ongoing civil lawsuit against Colorado City. The criminal probe announced Tuesday by Horne and Sheahan mirrors the one that landed Jeffs in prison. After receiving a complaint of child abuse, Texas authorities in 2008 raided the FLDS' Yearning for Zion Ranch. The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history. All of the children were eventually returned but 11 men - including Jeffs and other high-ranking FLDS lieutenants - were arrested on charges of sexual assault or bigamy and later convicted. Members of the sect are escorted onto a bus in Eldorado, Texas after a raid on a compound built by Warren Jeffs, jailed leader of The Fundamentalist Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints .","Ruby Jessop forced to marry second cousin and step-brother Haven Barlow at 14 when he was in his 20s .

"Matt Barlow takes a closer look at the 26 players sent out on loan by Chelsea during the summer transfer window. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay has defended the club's loan system which has seen 26 players shipped out on temporary deals this season. The majority of the 26 are younger players though some higher profile names such as Fernando Torres (AC Milan) have also been sent out on loan. In an interview with the London Evening Standard, Gourlay stressed that Chelsea's focus is on developing and nurturing young talent and not simply stock-piling players.

'What people don't see is that it's a massive development piece,' said Gourlay. 'I'll give you two examples: (Kevin) De Bruyne and (Romelu) Lukaku. 'They were both bought as strong potential future players. We knew they had enough pedigree. Both players were very much in our plans. It didn't work out and the opportunity arose to sell them. Best for the club and best for the players.' Gourlay, who also spoke of his pride at the club falling in line with UEFA's new Financial Fair Play rules, also revealed the extent to which Chelsea monitor their young loan stars. Chelsea sold Romelu Lukaku to Everton for a profit after letting spend last season on loan at Goodison Park . Ryan Bertrand (right) is spending the season on loan at Southampton with a view to a permanent deal . He said: 'The loan system is not just a matter of saying, 'Okay, we'll see you in 12 months.' We've only loaned players out to teams that allow day-to-day communication by our management team. Within 30 minutes of a game finishing, every player reports into someone at the club. Gourlay added: 'That's the reason that these players develop.'","Chelsea sent a total of 26 players out on loan during the summer .

"WELCOME TO JUST A MINUTE by Nicholas Parsons (Canongate, £20) Back in the summer, I made my own wireless debut — Woman’s Hour. I also made the mistake of telling everyone what an absolute piece of cake jabbering on the radio was. Because it is. Writing is what’s hard — facing the blank sheet every morning. I was reminded of all this when leafing through Nicholas Parsons’ ‘celebration of Britain’s best-loved radio comedy’, Just A Minute — because what is that programme, after all, other than the requirement to talk drivel for up to 60 seconds on, say, ‘finding a caterpillar in my salad’. To date there have been 900 editions. Parsons has long been the chairman, and he has a genius for keeping control over the teams, who can get quite temperamental. He was defeated only by Wendy Richard, who was persistently crotchety and guilty of ‘poisoning the atmosphere and inhibiting the audience’. Indeed, Paul Merton refused to go on the show if Wendy was hired. Kenneth Williams in his glory days as a star of the Carry On films, pictured here in Carry on Cleo with Amanda Barrie (left) and with Nicholas Parsons (right) Nevertheless, there is something ineffably English about the whole radio panel game genre that I find faintly depressing. Like many a quiz programme, it is redolent of jigsaws on wet afternoons, flickering coal fires, tinned peaches for tea, dull journeys in the car. It is genial and happily mindless, with, under the surface, considerable competitiveness and animosity. Kenneth Williams was more or less demented when put behind a microphone. Bombastic and impatient, he shrieked his way through 344 episodes. Parsons gives us a moving and perceptive account of Williams’ contributions — and touches on something far darker, which is the notion that the great Carry On star committed suicide because he felt trapped in a panel game hell. Kenneth shrieked his way through 344 episodes of the show . Williams had worked with Olivier and Orson Welles, so in doing all this wireless work he felt he’d wasted his life ‘making a noise that floats up into the air and disappears’. It makes alarming reading now, seeing his comments and interjections in cold print and realising that Williams was making comic capital out of a genuine despair. Though it was mock outrage, it was real at some level: ‘Oh, I’m so bored!’ ‘I don’t care! Shut your row!’, etc. Parsons refers to Williams’ ‘precarious ego’ and says he ‘performed wonderfully, in a mad, anarchic manner’, but if we compare the quotations in this book with the screams and howls found in his diaries and letters, what listeners heard was a man teetering on the edge of an abyss like a porcelain cup about to drop off the shelf. Derek Nimmo, fondly remembered by Parsons, was a panellist of long standing. Though born in Liverpool and raised in a caravan, Nimmo re-invented himself as an affable toff — a sort of sexless Leslie Phillips — who played stammering comedy vicars in sitcoms and at BBC parties had his drinks served in a silver chalice by a personal butler. Having worked with Olivier and Orson Welles (pictured), in doing all this wireless work he felt Kenneth Williams felt he had wasted his life . Nimmo has been reincarnated, and replaced on the show, by the versatile good egg Gyles Brandreth. Gyles can talk about ‘the things in my wallet’ until the cows come home. Indeed, he holds the Guinness World Record for making a 12-hour non-stop speech. He wore a surgical appliance so that he could urinate at the podium. I was fascinated to be told in this book that ‘the Duke of Edinburgh has one’. Keep that in mind when you next see him taking the salute. Just A Minute began in 1967, when the BBC policy was you couldn’t make jokes about lavatories or effeminacy in men. Now they do nothing else. Parsons grasped that ‘the point and fun of the game comes out of those challenges and not from a brilliant exposition of one minute’. True — but it rather dooms this book, because the atmosphere of the programme cannot be captured or evoked on the page. The show is ‘instantaneous comedy’, with no scripts or re-takes. ‘You hear what happened’ — and in truth very little merits preservation, save the late Linda Smith’s description of plastic surgery addict Joan Rivers as ‘a Siamese cat walking into a gale’.","Kenneth Williams was more or less demented when put behind a microphone .

"I wish Roy Hodgson and his staff had stayed out in Brazil at the World Cup because there is so much to learn here. The battle for the future of English football starts straight away and there are so many different tactics and systems to watch and learn from at this tournament. You have to put your disappointment at going out early to one side and find inspiration. Back home: Roy Hodgson returned straight to England after their World Cup exit . It’s not difficult here: it’s like the car show at the NEC, you want to see what the other manufacturers are up to. So it’s good to see  managers such as Roberto Martinez and Arsene Wenger out here lapping it up. Yes, managers might be looking for a signing or two but it’s more about improving tactically and finding out what’s in vogue. Martinez is just the type of man who is brave enough to innovate. And the men given the task of rebuilding England are not here. Let’s hope Hodgson, Ray Lewington and Gary Neville are watching all these games together at home, looking for the system to improve England’s fortunes. Hanging around: Arsene Wenger has remained in Brazil to take in the tournament . Scouting: As has Everton boss Roberto Martinez . It’s important to watch the games as a team so you can bounce ideas off each other and discuss how certain systems could work. These teams are show- casing their systems so our think tank should be here. If they’re not watching, we’re in trouble because we’re light-years behind. These are some of the systems and  tactics that have impressed me . . . CHILE’S MIDFIELD TRIO . The midfield three that Chile used so successfully is based around its flexibility. Jorge Sampaoli used Arturo Vidal, Marcelo Diaz and Charles Aranguiz in the centre of midfield, but unlike an English three, they swapped positions all the time. When you watch Liverpool or England, for example, it is clear that Steven Gerrard is the  holding midfielder and there are two ahead of him. Power trio: Chile midfielders Arturo Vidal and Marcelo Diaz have impressed . Chile’s midfielders just rotate all the time, which makes them very hard to defend against. They offered great protection to the back three, too, which was necessary considering Gary Medel and Francisco Silva were relegated with their clubs last season and Gonzalo Jara has been released by Nottingham Forest. If anyone does try to mimic it in the Premier League, Louis van Gaal is the man to counter it. His Holland side man-marked Chile’s midfield three and they ended up winning the game comfortably. UNDERLAPPING FULL BACKS . England’s full backs were rigid during our three games, generally stuck near the touchline. Watch Colombia and you will see the problems their full backs give the opposition. Pablo Armero — who did not impress during his loan spell at West Ham last season — and Juan Zuniga are key to Colombia’s attack, making underlapping runs inside their wingers. People aren’t sure how to track them. Under-lapper: Pablo Armero has impressed at full-back for Colombia . It’s something Leighton Baines has done for Everton and Glen Johnson for Liverpool so there is no reason England couldn’t use the tactic. France are very good at pushing their full backs forward too. From the off, they are dictating to the opposition, creating a feeling of expression throughout the team. PLAYERS ARE ADAPTABLE . Dirk Kuyt started the game against Mexico on the left wing. Later he moved to the right wing then to right back and excelled in all. Chile’s Vidal played at the front of the midfield three against Brazil but has been a centre back at times for his club Juventus. Adaptable: Dirk Kuyt played in several different roles for Holland . SWEEPER KEEPER . Manuel Neuer got Germany out of trouble so many times against Algeria — again and again rushing out of his box to clear danger. It’s something we have seen  Hugo Lloris do for Tottenham in the Premier League but others may look at it. I can’t see it suiting England, however, as Joe Hart has had trouble coming off his line in the past. Like Neuer, you need to have the pace of a central defender. Sweeper keeper: Manuel Neuer has been quick off his line for Germany this World Cup . Let’s hope Hodgson and his team aren’t missing all this. Those of us lucky enough to be out here have got a window on some of the best thinking in  football as it is played out in Brazil. England’s coaching team really should be here.","Hodgson and his coaching staff should have stayed in Brazil to learn, believes Keown .
England need to find a new system to improve in the future .
Chile's midfield, Colombia's fluidity and Manuel Neuer's goalkeeping are amongst the things to have impressed Keown at the World Cup so far ."
"A toddler has become his mother's hero after using FaceTime to save her from a vicious dog attack. Laura Toone, from Tucson, Arizona, had taken a foster dog she was caring for out for a walk when it attacked one of her own dogs. She tried breaking up the fight but the dog nearly bit one of her fingers off, leaving her covered in blood. Toddler Bentley Toone saved the day thanks to his FaceTime experience . Then two-year-old Bentley Toone stepped in. He ran out of the house with a dish towel from the kitchen to help his mother mop up the blood. Bentley, who is known for making his share of prank FaceTime calls, called a friend on her iPhone. Thankfully, this time the friend didn't think it was a joke. Mrs Toone told ABC News reported: 'I begged my daughters to call 911 . and they're four and they were quite afraid to even touch the phone . because it was covered in my own blood. 'Here . comes my son from the kitchen bringing me our dish towel,' she said. 'He wiped off the blood himself and proceeded to call my friend on . FaceTime.'

All I could see was his little forehead and I said, ""hi, Bentley,£ and it was quiet for a little bit and then I hear Laura screaming.' Guerrero then called 911 and Bentley unlocked the door when firefighters arrived. Mrs Toone said she has since taught their three children how to call 911.
