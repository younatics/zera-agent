"By . Jill Reilly . Two fearless skydivers jumped from an altitude of 33,000ft - high enough to see the curvature of the Earth. Skydivers Fréderic Fugen, 34, and Vincent Reffet, 29, leapt from a plane in the freezing skies above Mont-Blanc in the Alps - the largest mountain in Europe. They jumped from such a height - commercial airliners cruise at an altitude between 30,000 and 40,000 feet on long haul flights - that they had to use a specially designed oxygen system to stop them from passing out.

"By . Jill Reilly . Farmers who shot 28 Bangladeshi strawberry pickers for complaining they were owed six months’ money have walked free from a Greek court. The shotgun attack occurred last year in Manolada, 160 miles southwest of Athens, where mostly Bangladeshi migrants work, and drew international attention to the often appalling conditions facing migrant laborers at Greek farms. The court in the city of Patras sentenced one man to 14 years and seven months in prison and the other to eight years and seven months. Immigrants who work in Greece and Greek protesters take part in a rally outside a court in the city of Patras, Greece . Both were convicted of aggravated assault and illegal use of firearms, but were freed pending their appeal. A lawyer for the victims, Moisis Karabeyidis, was upset that the men had been set free and said he planned to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights at The Hague. 'This decision is an outrage and a disgrace ... The court showed an appalling attitude toward the victims,' he said. An immigrant who works in Greece cries outside a court in the southwest city of Patras . The farm's owner and head foreman were cleared. About a hundred protesters had gathered outside the court building Wednesday, protesting the release of the four defendants. A few were seen crying in disappointment after the verdict was announced. In a rare criticism of a court decision, Greece's largest labor union said the verdict was 'against the public sense of justice and fairness' and argued that the farm supervisors should have faced more serious charges. 'To shoot and injure people ... who dared to ask for six months in unpaid wages cannot be described as a mere assault,' the GSEE union said. 'We express our dissatisfaction with the acquittal of a businessman and his associates who are responsible for the ... mistreatment of 200 workers, mostly from Bangladesh, at the site, who live in squalid conditions and without working rights and who had been left unpaid,' it said.","Shotgun attack occurred last year in Manolada (160 miles) from Athens .

A mother has spoke of her grief after her 17-year-old son died following a single punch to the head. Jared Colon, 17, from Hillsborough, New Jersey, was punched by a 16-year-old boy on Saturday at his home and although he was airlifted to hospital he later died from a head injury. His mother Beth Colon says his death has been torture beyond belief. 'He really was about helping others, great old soul he was,' she said. The boy who punched Jared is charged as a juvenile with reckless manslaughter following Jared's death. Ms Colon said she was at home when  Jared was hit in the yard and remembers her son saying: 'I'm not going to hit you' to the other boy during their argument. 'I hope these kids learn that they need to resolve their problems peacefully,' she said. 'This violence is ridiculous and it's got to stop. I really hope they are able to learn that lesson from this.' Although he was airlifted to hospital he later died from a head injury.  The boy who punched Jared is charged as a juvenile with reckless manslaughter following his death . When Jared was hit it caused bleeding to an area of his brain where doctors could not operate, said Ms Colon, who is a former EMT herself, reported Nj.com.

"By . Jill Reilly . Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner has been accused of spending close to £20,000 a day to have the presidential plane bring her the daily newspapers while she was on holiday. An Argentinian television claims she had the papers flown to the town of Rio Gallegos, in the south Argentinian province of Santa Cruz. Footage aired on the programme shows a paper boy leaving the plane in Santa Cruz airport with the newspapers that were then delivered to the president at her house. Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner has been accused of spending close to £20,000 a day to have the presidential plane bring her the daily newspapers while she was on holiday . Footage aired on the programme shows a paper boy leaving the plane in Santa Cruz airport with the newspapers that were then delivered to the president at her house . The presenter said: 'We want someone to explain why the president spends so much to get the daily paper about a house when she could read it online the same day or have it delivered in the normal way a day later.' He added that it would only be acceptable if the president were to pay for it with her own money, but he doubted she was prepared to spend thousands a day just to have the newspapers delivered. Opposition UCR party politician Anselmo Martinez said: 'I can't say that this is a particular surprise because our country has a history of people using state assets for their own purposes since the time of Nestor Kirchner. Argentinean President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, waves from a balcony at the Foreign Relations Ministery headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela on July 29 . It is a well-known fact that the official aircraft fleet is at the disposal not just a president but of her relatives as well. The allegations came as it was revealed that Argentina could be just hours away from defaulting on its debts for the third time in three decades. The Latin American country has until today to reach a deal with investors who have lent it money - or once again default. Buenos Aires owes interest payments of £318 million to bondholders who agreed to take a 70 per cent haircut on their holdings following the financial crisis that rocked the country in the early 2000s. Bilboard placed along a street in Buenos Aires showing a poster from the government-related movement San Martin supporting the Argentine government in its dispute with the so-called 'holdout' hedge funds . Kirchner fears that granting the 'vulture fund' holdout investors complete repayment could trigger similar claims from other bondholders. Last week, Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the economic cost to Argentina of defaulting again might be 'substantial'. 'I think that for Argentina, if it goes into default and doesn't pay the holdouts, there might be substantial costs in being basically unable to access markets for some time,' he said. But IMF managing director Christine Lagarde last night tried to play down fears that a default would send shockwaves through emerging markets worldwide. 'While default is always regrettable, we do not believe that it would have major substantive consequences outside, on a much broader basis,' she said. Santa Cruz is the home region of her late husband Nestor Kirchner who was her predecessor in the post.","Kirchner was staying in the town of Rio Gallegos, southern Argentinian .

Friends of Kadir Islam, from Rochdale, said he was killed yesterday in an Israeli strike while reportedly delivering supplies to a hospital. Scroll down for video . A British aid worker had allegedly been killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza . The Foreign Office has said it is investigating reports that the man died on Sunday night in the southern city of Rafah (pictured) It was not clear which aid group he was representing, reported The Times. Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government is urgently looking into the news. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm extremely concerned about these reports and we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom (of them) and find out exactly what has happened.

'I don't want to say anything before we've been able to do that but this only reinforces the need for an immediate unconditional humanitarian ceasefire observed properly by both sides. 'This slaughter, this killing has got to end.' Last week three UN workers were killed in the Gaza Strip, the first deaths of the development agency's workforce. The three teachers - two women and one man - were killed by 'incoming [Israeli] fire'. An Israeli-declared temporary cease-fire and troop withdrawals slowed violence in the Gaza war today, although an attack on an Israeli bus that killed one person in Jerusalem underscored the tensions still simmering in the region.

Palestinians remove the body of an eight-year-old from the rubble from a house hit by an Israeli airstrike. The eight-year-old girl was killed and 30 people wounded in a strike on the beachfront Shati refugee camp in Gaza City just minutes into an Israeli-declared truce . Several cease-fires have broken down during the three-week war - including Friday when an internationally negotiated truce collapsed amid violence and mutual recrimination between Israel and Hamas. But with Hamas rocket fire tapering off over the last 24 hours and Israel's ground operation in Gaza winding down, violence in a war that officials say has killed more than 1,880 Palestinians and over 60 Israelis appeared - for the moment - to be waning. The lull was broken by the Jerusalem assault, which saw a man ram the front end of a construction excavator into an Israeli bus. Police described the incident as a 'terrorist attack,' indicating Palestinian involvement. The attack occurred on a main thoroughfare near Jerusalem's light-rail line. The area is located near the unofficial line between Jewish West Jerusalem and east Jerusalem, the section of the city captured by Israel in 1967 and which is home to most of the city's Arab population. Israeli media said the attacker came from an Arab area of the city. Israeli soldiers make their to rest at an army deployment area near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip .

Shortly after the excavator attack, Israeli media reported that a gunman on a motorcycle shot and seriously wounded an Israeli soldier. Police searched for the shooter in east Jerusalem. 'We believe there is a great likelihood this was a terrorist attack,' Piranti said. Before the attacks, a seven-hour Israeli cease-fire in Gaza went into effect. And while Israel continued hitting at selected Palestinian targets, the level of the fighting was much lower than in previous days. However, the Israeli military said the cease-fire would not apply to areas where troops were still operating and where they would respond to any attack. The southern strip town of Rafah, which saw heavy fighting Sunday, was excluded from the truce, the military said. Shortly after the cease-fire started at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), an Israeli strike hit a house at the Shati refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, killing three people and wounding at least 30, Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra said. The Israeli military said it targeted an 'operative threat' and rocket fire in the strike 'around 10 a.m.' A separate Israeli strike killed Daniel Mansour, a commander in the Islamic Jihad group - a close ally of Gaza's militant Palestinian Hamas rulers, the group said. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said his group remained skeptical about the announced Israeli truce. 'We do not trust such a calm and call on our people to take caution,' Zuhri said.

"By . Jill Reilly . British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford lost her Supreme Court bid to get the UK Government to fund her appeal . British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford facing the death penalty for drug smuggling in Indonesia today lost her Supreme Court bid to get the UK Government to fund her appeal. But the five judges while unanimously dismissing her appeal called on the Government to 'urgently' review their policy as she remained in jeopardy and was in urgent need of legal help. Supreme Court justices said the 57-year-old from Cheltenham, Gloucester, 'remains in jeopardy' and needs a 'substantial' sum to continue her legal battle against the sentence, which was imposed after she was found with cocaine worth an estimated £1.6 million as she arrived in Bali on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, in May 2012. The only legal options now available to her to avoid execution are an application to the Supreme Court in Indonesia to reopen the case, and an application to the President of Indonesia for clemency - the time-limit for both expires on August 29. Although the panel of five justices today dismissed Sandiford's challenge over the lawfulness of a Government policy not to provide funding for legal representation to Britons facing capital charges abroad, they said that in the light of new information a further review of her 'extreme' case needed to be undertaken by the Foreign Secretary. Lord Carnwath, announcing the decision of the court, said the Foreign Office was prepared to consider whether the policy should be modified in the circumstances of her case as they were in January 2013 when proceedings began - and the reasons for not making an exception to the no-funding policy were not unlawful or irrational. Supreme Court justices said the 57-year-old from Cheltenham, Gloucester, 'remains in jeopardy' and needs a 'substantial' sum to continue her legal battle against the sentence . But he added: 'Although that disposes of the appeal, Mrs Sandiford remains in jeopardy. 'The evidence now available as to the Indonesian proceedings raises serious issues as to the functioning of the local judicial system and its treatment of her case.' That evidence, which was not considered by the High Court and Court of Appeal when they dealt with her case, 'calls for an urgent further review by the Secretary of State of his policy as it applies to Mrs Sandiford in the light of her present circumstances and her present need for legal help'. Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, was sentenced to death in January 2013 by judges of the District Court of Denpasar in Bali after being convicted of trafficking drugs. Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, was sentenced to death in January 2013 . She has since appealed without success. She admitted the offences, but claimed she had been coerced by threats to her son's life. Following her arrest, she co-operated with the police, leading to the arrest of four others - the prosecution had called for a sentence of 15 years imprisonment in her case. In a written ruling, Lord Carnwath and Lord Mance said: 'Since January 2013, as a result of the surprising course of the Indonesian proceedings, circumstances have radically developed in respects which appear to have been quite unforeseeable. 'However, we have no up to date information as to the department's consideration of those matters. 'As has been seen, those responsible have been willing to consider whether the policy should be departed from or qualified in her case, but that has been on information which is now out of date. 'Logic and consistency, if nothing else, call for an urgent review of the policy as it applies to her in the light of the current information.' They added: 'The evidence now available as to the course of the Indonesian proceedings appears to raise the most serious issues as to the functioning of the local judicial system and its ability to deal justly with the appellant's case. 'In particular, on the material we have been shown, the local courts seem to have ignored the substantial mitigating factors in her case, including her age and mental problems, her lack of any previous record, her co-operation with the police and not least the remarkable disparity of her sentence with those members of the syndicate whom she helped to bring to justice.' They said: 'On the face of it, there is substantial material to support her application to the Supreme Court or the President. 'She needs a competent lawyer to present it.' The judges said: 'It is not, of course, for this court now to express any view as to what the outcome might be of such a review. 'But we note that, even under the old pre-2007 policy, it appears that the Foreign Office did not experience real difficulty in controlling and limiting the financial exposure which it incurred in a very few exceptional cases. 'It is not clear to us that the creation or recognition of an exception for a case as extreme as the present would risk opening a floodgate to future demands for financial support. 'However that may be, the further review needs to be undertaken, and the outcome to be supported by a clear justification of the rationality and/or proportionality of maintaining an absolutely blanket policy covering even the present circumstances.' She is battling against  against the sentence, which was imposed after she was found with cocaine worth an estimated £1.6 million as she arrived in Bali on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, in May 2012 . The Supreme Court said the UK Government had provided 'substantial' consular assistance since it was notified of her arrest and had also made diplomatic representations to the Indonesian Government but it had 'declined to pay for legal help' under the policy. Today's ruling by Lords Mance, Clarke, Sumption, Carnwath and Toulson follows a Court of Appeal defeat for Sandiford in April last year when three leading judges ruled that the UK Government's policy of not providing funding for legal representation to any British national who faced criminal proceedings abroad - even in death penalty cases - was not unlawful. In written submissions opposing Sandiford's appeal at the UK's Supreme Court last month, Martin Chamberlain QC, for the Foreign Secretary, said: 'The death penalty is among the punishments to which the Government is opposed in all circumstances as a matter of principle.' It supported initiatives designed to encourage states which retained the death penalty to change their position and makes grants to charities such as Reprieve, which assisted individuals who were charged with capital offences. In 'appropriate cases' it also made 'state to state representations'. Mr Chamberlain said the statutory legal aid scheme extended only to legal proceedings in the UK, and the Government 'has not established an analogous scheme to cover legal expenses for British nationals involved in criminal proceedings abroad, even where the proceedings may result in the imposition of punishments to which it is strongly opposed'. He told the judges that the policy did not allow funding to be given, even in exceptional circumstances, but added: 'However, that does not mean that the appellant's individual circumstances have been ignored.' Specific consideration was given to the question whether the policy should be changed in the light of those circumstances.

"By . Jill Reilly . A mother whose 11-year-old son died on the fateful MH17 has revealed the night before he was due to fly he asked her what would happen if he was to die. Samira Calehr says she was in a bedroom at her townhouse near Amsterdam, when her son Miguel Panduwinata reached out and said: 'Mama, may I hug you?' Ms Calehr wrapped her arms around her  son, who had been oddly agitated for days, bombarding her with questions about death, about his soul, about God. Scroll down for video . Miguel Panduwinata, right, poses his mother Samira Calehr. Miguel and his brother Shaka Panduwinata were killed aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine . The next morning, she dropped Miguel and his older brother, Shaka, at Schiphol airport so they could catch Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, the first leg of their journey to Bali to visit their grandmother. The normally cheerful, well-travelled boy should have been excited. His silver suitcase was in the living room, ready to go. Jetskiing and surfing in paradise awaited. But something was not right. 59908 . 143802 . 60651 . 71425 . 29443 . Miguel Panduwinata, left, Mika Panduwinata, Samira Calehr, second from right, and Shaka Panduwinata, right, pose for a photo . A day earlier, while playing soccer, Miguel had burst out: 'How would you choose to die? What would happen to my body if I was buried? Would I not feel anything because our souls go back to God?' And now, the night before his big trip, Miguel refused to let go of his mother. 'He's just going to miss me,' she told herself. So she stretched out beside him and held him all night. It was 11pm on Wednesday July 16. Miguel, Shaka and the 296 other people on board MH17 had around 15 hours left to live. The next morning, Mrs Calehr and her friend Aan ushered her sons on to the train to the airport. They were joking and laughing. Shaka, 19, had just finished his first year of college, where he was studying textile engineering, and promised to keep an eye on Miguel. Their other brother, Mika, 16, had not been able to get a seat on the flight and would travel to Bali the next day. A day before the flight Miguel had burst out: 'How would you choose to die? What would happen to my body if I was buried? Would I not feel anything because our souls go back to God?' At the check-in counter, Mrs Calehr fussed over her boys' luggage. Shaka, meanwhile, realised he had forgotten to pack socks. His mother promised to buy him some and send them along with Mika. Finally, they were outside customs. The boys hugged their mother, said goodbye and walked towards passport control. Suddenly, Miguel whirled around and ran back, throwing his arms around his mother. 'Mama, I'm going to miss you,' he said. 'What will happen if the airplane crashes?' 'What was this all about?' she wondered. Samira Calehr, left, poses with her son Shaka Panduwinata . 'Don't say that,' she said, squeezing him. 'Everything will be OK.' Shaka tried to reassure them both. 'I will take care of him,' he told his mother. 'He's my baby.' She watched the two boys walk away. But Miguel kept looking back at his mother. His big brown eyes looked sad. Then he vanished from view. MH17 took off at around 12.15pm on what should have been a flight of 11 hours, 45 minutes. It lasted two hours. Mrs Calehr had just finished buying Shaka's socks when her phone rang. It was her friend Aan. 'Where are you?' he screamed. 'The plane crashed!' A body is carried onto a dutch C130 aircraft during a ramp ceremony at Kharkiv Aiport, Kharkiv, today .

She now grapples with the what-ifs, the astronomical odds, the realisation that the world she knew became alien in the blink of an eye. She thinks about how her baby boy seemed to sense that his time on earth was running short. She imagines the futures that will never be: Shaka's dream of becoming a textile engineer, gone. Miguel's dream of becoming a go-kart racing driver, gone. How could he have known? How could she have known? 'I should have listened to him,' she says softly.

McIlory has put his recent success - which has seen him take his fourth major championship win out of the last 15 played - down to his split from tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. The world number one split from his ex-fiancée at the end of . May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding . invitations. The . multi-millionaire has revealed that what happened was 'for the best . in terms of my golf.' But he was recently romantically linked with receptionist Sasha Gale, who is from Lisburn, County Antrim, a city just the other side of Belfast from where he grew up.

A source revealed the couple got together after meeting five weeks ago and their 'romance is blossoming'. McIlroy, 25, had been spotted out with model Nadia Forde earlier this month, fuelling speculation they were an item.

Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson had been part of a three-way tie for the lead with Mickelson on the back nine but dropped shots on the closing stretch to finish two behind McIlroy on 14 under. A torrential downpour which flooded the course and caused a delay of almost two hours meant it was a race against time to get play finished, so much so that Mickelson and Fowler stood aside on the 18th to allow the final group to tee off. McIlroy's drive finished dangerously close to the water to the right of the fairway, but a closing par was enough for the 25-year-old to become the first player since Padraig Harrington in 2008 to win back-to-back majors, his victories in the Open Championship and US PGA also sandwiched by a first World Golf Championship win in the Bridgestone Invitational last week. Lifting the Wanamaker Trophy for the second time also makes the Northern Irishman the third youngest player after Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus to win four majors, just one less than the total won by the late Seve Ballesteros and two behind Nick Faldo. It was the fourth time McIlroy had held the 54-hole lead in a major, the first leading to heartache in the 2011 Masters when he was four ahead entering the final round at Augusta only to collapse to a closing 80. Two months later he bounced back in spectacular style to win the US Open by eight shots at Congressional before winning the 2012 US PGA by the same margin at Kiawah Island. Last month he led from start to finish at Royal Liverpool, taking a six-shot lead into the final round before going on to win by two from Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler.","The 25-year-old and his entourage tweeted while on flight to New York .

Staff at the EBS said they had been assured that no further action would take place until discussions had been resolved. However, they said contractors returned this at around 8am this morning and began 'hacking' away at the branches of the tree. Mr Haslem added: 'Despite half of the tree residing on half of our grounds, we have not been kept informed of discussions. I came in this morning to see contractors with chainsaws chopping of its branches with no prior warning.'

The lime tree stands on the perimeter of the newly-approved site off Keighley Road, with half of its branches reaching over a stone wall into the adjoining grounds of the EBS on Belton Road.

The mother of a toddler with cerebral palsy was forced to sit on the floor of a bus as she held on to her brain-damaged son when elderly passengers refused to give up their seats in the disabled area. Alisha Frost, 24, was left in tears as she held on to her two-year-old son Jack's pushchair on the Stagecoach bus X4 service from Cardiff to Merthyr. She claims that when she boarded the bus, the pull-down disabled seats were all taken by passengers in their 60s and 70s.

Then when she approached the passengers herself, they too refused to help her, she claims. Miss Frost said she had been on the bus home to Pontypridd, after a rare shopping trip with her son who has brain damage and cerebral palsy. She said: 'They told me they didn't have to move for me and told me to just fold the buggy up and sit my son on my knee.

'I explained that I couldn't do this as my son is disabled and he needs the correct support or he flings himself forwards.' Jack cannot sit on his mother's lap as he needs the support of harnesses in his buggy. She said the driver eventually intervened, but she was still forced to sit on the floor and hold on to her son's pushchair tightly as she did not have enough room to put the brake on. She said she left the bus in tears after no one helped her. She said: 'I'm furious about the whole situation and have been so upset since - it's just wrong that we were treated in this way.' A spokesman for Stagecoach in South Wales said they were investigating the incident. 'All of our drivers receive formal customer care training, so it is extremely disappointing to be told of this lady's and her child's experience, which falls far below the standard that we expect and regularly achieve from the vast majority of drivers employed by us.'","Alisha Frost, 24, was left in tears as she held on to her son Jack's pushchair .

"By . Amanda Williams . Recruitment manager Jennifer Newman, 34, has won a £30,000 payout after her boss groped her, called her 'proper top totty' in front of clients, and then sacked her . A widowed mother of two has won a £30,000 payout after her boss groped her and made lewd comments about her in front of clients. Jennifer Newman, 34, was called ‘proper top totty’ by Steve Hoad and described as dressing like ‘someone who works in a dubious establishment’. Hoad’s wife, who also worked at the firm, accused her of having an affair with her husband before she was sacked as recruitment manager. Mrs Newman said she joined the company, Hydro Cleansing, in April last year and problems began in June when Hoad emailed her a picture of a semi-naked woman in bondage gear, asking: ‘Have you got a suit like this?’ Then, to the laughter of colleagues, he added: ‘She does look like you.’ On another occasion he threw a pen to the floor in front of clients and asked her to pick it up, but when she walked off he said: ‘Look at that, proper top totty’ to laughter from the clients. She said his inappropriate comments increased when she had breast enhancement surgery. The final straw came on July 10 last year when Hoad groped her bottom after she asked for an advance on her salary to take her two daughters on holiday. Mrs Newman, whose husband died in a car crash in 2009, told the employment tribunal in Croydon, South London: ‘I felt absolutely violated, upset and demeaned. 'It was as though Steve felt that by asking for an advance on my salary it gave him the right to touch me.’ The £32,000-a-year executive, who lives in Croydon, reported the incident to HR as a protected disclosure, which employers are bound under British law to treat confidentially. However, the details were leaked to staff including Hoad’s wife, Carol. The tribunal was given an account of a car journey taken by Mrs Newman and Mr Hoad to the Caravanning and Camping Club in Coventry. Mrs Newman said her boss was being unusually quiet compared to his usual 'chatty' self when he would 'comment on his relationship with his wife and how she had been caught having a number of affairs over the years.' 'In his words ""caught with her knickers down""', Mrs Newman added in her statement. Mrs Newman said that despite being previously 'polite and cordial' Mrs Hoad turned hostile towards her on her return to the office and was also seen holding her HR file before having a heated row with her husband. Scroll down for video . Ms Newman - who was widowed when her husband died in a car crash in 2009 -  was harassed by Steve Hoad (right) at work. When the £32,000-a-year executive reported the incident to HR, the details were leaked to Mr Hoad's wife, Carol (left), who also worked for the firm . A Croydon tribunal heard that recruitment manager Mrs Newman, 34, was then accused of having an affair with him by his wife. She was also described as dressing like 'someone who works in a dubious establishment' after she underwent breast enlargement . Mrs Hoad 'had put two and two together' after hearing the allegations and believed the pair were having an affair, the tribunal heard. On returning from her holiday on August 19, Mrs Newman was told 'within an hour' she had been made redundant in a meeting without the Hoads present. Kayleigh Long, representing Mrs Newman, said: 'She had complained about Mr Hoad who usually got away with behaving as he wished. 'They wanted her out and she was pushed out of the company because of her rejection of behaviour by Mr Hoad. It began with comments and it ended with her dismissal.' She added: 'A letter sent during the course of litigation reflects the insulting comments sent during her employment. 'It refers to her wearing tight jeans and a crop top without a bra after having undergone breast enhancement surgery. 'There is a further comment in that letter that says her attire was akin to someone who works in a dubious establishment. 'Miss Newman found this very upsetting and degrading, she says it is a complete fabrication and felt it was the harassment carrying on after she left the company.' The Croydon employment tribunal heard that . the harassment began when Ms Newman received an email from Mr Hoard of a . picture of a semi-naked woman in bondage gear - and said 'she looks like you' Mr Hoad and his firm failed to send representatives to the tribunal where the panel unanimously upheld Ms Newman’s complaints. She was awarded £29,525.06 in damages, while Hydro Cleansing and Mr Hoad were ordered to also pay her legal costs, totalling £12,897. Speaking afterwards, Ms Newman said: 'This means a lot to me and my family - it’s compensation for what this man put me through. 'Hopefully it will be recognised that I’ve made a stand for lots of women out there who are afraid to speak out. 'I took my problem to HR and they broke my confidence, people need to be protected.' She added: 'I’m a youngish single mum. I’ve been through a lot, but I’ve picked myself up and dusted myself down. 'I’ve never experienced working for any company like this. But I’m career-minded and I couldn’t bury my head in the sand. 'It’s a relief, justice has prevailed. The next step is moving on.'","Jennifer Newman, 34, subjected to harassment by boss Steve Hoad .

"By . Amanda Williams . Bosnian Sanel Sahbaz has been allowed to stay in Britain despite a string of convictions because his human rights would be violated if he were to return to his home country . A foreign criminal who used human rights laws to stay in Britain carried out a string of assaults on a woman while his deportation case was being considered, a court has heard. A hearing last August ruled that Bosnian Sanel Sahbaz could stay in Britain because his human rights would be violated if he were to return to his home country. But St Albans Crown Court has since heard that at that time, and then after his court victory, he was subjecting a woman in her 20s to assaults, false imprisonment and was making threats to kill her. Last month a jury at St Albans crown court found Sahbaz, 31, of Hertford, not guilty of raping the woman in a hotel room in Stevenage, between May 16 and May 21 2013. But the nine men and three women were unaware of his violent past or the fact that he had admitted offences of making threats to kill, false imprisonment, actual bodily harm and common assault against his latest victim carried out between July and October last year. On Friday Judge Marie Catterson said that she considered him a dangerous offender who posed a significant risk of harm to members of the public by violent offending. She jailed him for four years with an extended sentence of five years, which means he will be supervised by probation officers on his release if he remains in this country. She was told by prosecutor Will Noble that he has been served with a second deportation notice. The judge told Sahbaz: 'It is a matter for the authorities if you are deported.' But she said it was her understanding that it was usually the case if sentences of 12 months or longer were passed. Sahbaz arrived in Britain as an 11-year-old dependent of his refugee father in 1993. St Albans Crown Court has heard that at that time of his deportation trial, and then after his court victory, he was subjecting a woman in her 20s to assaults, false imprisonment and was making threats to kill her . He has a criminal record which goes back to 2001 and eight convictions for 28 offences - including theft, fraud, assault, damaging property, disorderly behaviour, racially abusive insulting words, failing to surrender, assaulting a constable. On 18 June 2009 he was jailed for a total of 4 years with a year's extension to his licence for causing actual bodily harm between 17 to 18 January 2009. Prosecutor Wayne Cleaver said at the previous hearing: 'The victim of the actual bodily harm was his landlord. 'He had intervened in a dispute between the defendant and his then girlfriend. He was punched to he ground and kicked unconscious.' He received concurrent sentences of 15 months for GBH on 27 June 2008 and affray on 9 June 2008. He was on licence from jail at the time he attacked the woman. Sahbaz faced automatic deportation after receiving the 4 year sentence, but was told he could stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to private and family life. His barrister John Marchant said Sahbaz took 'full responsibility for his actions for which he apologises.' Last year, 200 offenders – including rapists and muggers – successfully . challenged their removal by citing Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights . Act. A Somali rapist, who held a . knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he assaulted her, is among the . many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a . right to family life. Mustafa Abdullahi (right), . 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his . ‘vulnerable’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home. He . was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned . immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of . respect for the law. But . last December he was deemed to have a right to a family life under . Article 8 and released. Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife . in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here. Separately, last August it was revealed Sanel Sahbaz, . a foreign criminal jailed for . various violent attacks, had successfully . argued against deportation because it would violate his human rights. Sahbaz, . 30, a Bosnian who now lives in Hertford, came to Britain as a child in . 1993. Since 2005 he has committed a string of offences including common . assault, handling stolen goods, theft, public order offences and . assaulting police. He . qualified for automatic deportation after he was jailed for four years, . and the Home Office told him he would be sent home. But he was told he . can stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article . 8. His lawyers argued . that if he was sent back to Bosnia it would separate him from his . parents, brother and cousin, who are also in Britain, which would breach . his rights. Learco Chindamo was . jailed indefinitely for knifing to death headmaster Philip Lawrence, a . father of four, 18 years ago outside St George's Roman Catholic School . in Maida Vale, west London, in 1995. The teacher went to help a . 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted. The . former gang member was ordered to serve at least 12 years, but released . in July 2010 after claiming he was a reformed character. The . Government was prevented from deporting Chindamo to Italy, where he . lived as a child, after his lawyers argued it would breach his human . right to a family life. He . was freed and allowed to live in Britain, but returned to jail only . months later for breaching the terms of his parole. He has remained in . prison since but last week the Parole Board approved his release once . again.","Bosnian Sanel Sahbaz allowed to stay in Britain last August because his human rights would be violated if he were to return to his home country .

"By . Amanda Williams . Soldiers returning from fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan will be given a gene mutation blood test to assess their suicide risk. The trial will be carried out on US army soldiers after it was reported that suicides in American  military had tripled. The prototype test measures changes to stress levels in the brain and has already been used on 325 civilian volunteers. Soldiers returning from fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan will be given a gene mutation blood test to assess their suicide risk (stock picture) Between 2004 and 2012, the rate tripled from 9.6 per 100,000 to 29.2, the Independent on Sunday reports. Scientists . discovered stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called . SKA2 and people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the . gene. Picking . up on this change could make it possible for doctors to predict a . person’s risk of suicide using a simple blood test - and monitor people . most likely to harm themselves. The . SKA2 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area . involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive . behaviour. It 'chaperones' stress hormones into a cell’s nucleus so that they can work to suppress stress levels. Yet . if there are not enough SKA2 or it is altered, the stress hormone . receptor cannot suppress the release of the 'stress hormone' cortisol in . the brain  - leading to suicidal thoughts. Professor . Zachary Kaminsky, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . said: 'Suicide is a major preventable public health problem. 'But . we have been stymied in our prevention efforts because we have no . consistent way to predict those who are at increased risk of killing . themselves. 'With . a test like ours, we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying . those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe.' Researchers . looked at mutations in the gene SKA2 in brain samples from mentally ill . people who had died from suicide - and then compared them with healthy . individuals. They discovered levels of SKA2 were significantly lower in people who had killed themselves. And that within this common mutation, there was a modification that changed the way this gene functioned. The modification added chemicals called methyl groups to the gene. Blood tests revealed there were higher levels of methylation in the SKA2 gene for people with a record of suicidal thoughts or attempts. The researchers then designed a model to . predict which of the participants were experiencing suicidal thoughts - . or had attempted suicide with 80 per cent certainty. The SKA2 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour . Those with more severe risk of suicide were predicted with 90 per cent accuracy. In younger people, blood tests enabled scientists to predict whether a person had attempted suicide with 96 per cent accuracy. Professor . Kaminsky said: 'We have found a gene that we think could be really . important for consistently identifying a range of behaviours from . suicidal thoughts to attempts to completions. 'We . need to study this in a larger sample but we believe that we might be . able to monitor the blood to identify those at risk of suicide.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Up to £100,000 of fuel is being wasted by police who leave their car engines running even when they are not in them, it has been claimed. The force cars are fitted with technology which means they have to stay on in order for the in-car computers to work, despite no officers being in the car. The Met Police have a fleet of 700 vehicles with the Runlock technology. It works by linking with a control centre, which remotely controls the lights and radio. Up to £100,000 of fuel is being wasted by police who leave their car engines running even when they are not in them, it has been claimed (stock picture) If the engine is switched off it can take seven minutes to restart the computer. The Sun reports that the BMW cars used by the Met use 1.5 litres of diesel an hour - which for 1,000 cars left on for an hour a week would cost in the region of £104,000. Green party peer Jenny Jones told the paper that more and more homeowners were coming to her with concerns. She said: 'It's polluting our streets and is a potential drain on public money.' The BMW cars used by the Met use 1.5 litres of diesel an hour - which for 1,000 cars left on for an hour a week would cost in the region of £104,000 . It comes as one London council has introduced fines for motorists who leave their diesel engines running, in a bid to cut pollution. Islington council has begun issuing on-the-spot £20 penalties for drivers who . fail to turn their engines off when stationary, and others are likely to follow suit in order to meet European environmental targets. London mayor Boris Johnson has already revealed plans to charge owners of diesel cars £10 extra to enter the centre of the capital from 2020. Officials from Islington Council in North London are to issue the on-the-spot fines, and will target buses, lorries and diesel cars . Communities . minister Brandon Lewis called the fines a way to ‘tax drivers by . stealth’ and warned that they could push people away from high streets. Councils gained the power to issue penalties for idling in 2002 but the rule has not been widely enforced until now. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Short journeys use lots of powered equipment and flatten batteries much faster. 'Most of the fleets are now fitted with a secondary battery. New systems expected later this year will negate the need to leave engines running irrespective of the time away from the vehicle.'","Met Police cars have to stay running for the in-car computers to work .

"By . Amanda Williams . Patients should be charged £200 to see their GP so they 'learn to appreciate the NHS', fertility expert Robert Winston has said. It comes after calls for patients to pay a £10-a-month fee to use health services, and  also be charged £20 for every night they stay in hospital. But Labour peer Lord Winston said the actual value of a hospital was much greater- and the charge would have to be much higher to make it more 'realistic' for those who do not appreciate the cost. Patients should be charged £200 to see their GP so they 'learn to appreciate the NHS', fertility expert Robert Winston has said . He told The Sun: 'The actual value of a hospital appointment is about £200. 'This is for the time of the consultant and the investigations or tests that might be done. 'So paying £10 or £20 is really not an effective way of dealing with that deficit.' There is rising concern that the NHS is running out of money and will . soon have to resort to charging patients or rationing common treatments. Former Labour health minister, Lord Warner, last month warned  the NHS was ‘unaffordable’, ‘out-of-date’ and unable to meet the needs of the population. He said everyone should pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, and he called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment. He said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the Health Service, which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing, unhealthy population. It comes after calls for patients to pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, and also be charged £20 for every night they stay in hospital . It came after members of the Royal College of Nursing called for patients to pay up to £10 to see their family doctor to generate vital NHS funding while also deterring patients from making appointments and then failing to show up, but later voted against it. Senior GPs from the British Medical Association also called for fees arguing that they would encourage patients to go to their pharmacists and keep a supply of medicines at home. In July, Care Minister Norman Lamb told an audience of Liberal Democrats that ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be cut if the Health Service does not spend its £100billion-a-year budget more efficiently. In a letter to the Times, health experts concurred with Mr Lamb on the scale of the black hole. Senior figures including Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, and Dr Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned that by 2020 the NHS will require an additional £30billion to maintain the current level of service provision. ‘The status quo is not an option,’ they wrote. ‘We are already seeing the signs of the system creaking at the seams. ‘All financial options are difficult politically; higher tax spend, co-payments or changes to what is available.’","It comes after calls for patients to pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS .

Mr Karzai and a 12-strong party were in the capital as guests of the UK Government during a series of talks with Britain and Pakistan, and plumped for the Mayfair hotel during their stay . The Sunday Express reports that here were 40 Afghan guests at the hotel last February. British taxpayers paid for 12 of the party and the Afghan government had to pay out . for the other 28. Pakistani guests, led by president Asif Ali Zardari, stayed at the Berkeley Hotel in . Kensington where the bill was believed to have reached £10,000. Afghanistan is one of the most impoverished nations in the world and receives £175million in aid from the UK every year. The hotel’s cheapest accommodation costs around £300 a night - whereas the best suite costs £7,000 a night. The £53,000 bill was footed by the Foreign Office and revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request.

In February, Karzai angered the families of British soldiers yesterday by suggesting the presence of Nato troops over the past 13 years had made his country worse. The US-led invasion in 2001, a response to the September 11 attacks, was launched to drive out Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But describing the Taliban as 'brothers' and America as 'rivals', Afghan leader Hamid Karzai said: 'The mission, in terms of bringing security, has not been successful, particularly in Helmand. 'What they did was create pockets of wealth and a vast countryside of deprivation and anger.' Asked by The Sunday Times whether it would have been better if British troops – many of whom are based in Helmand province – had never gone there, Karzai replied: 'I guess so. Yes.' His remarks were labelled an insult by relatives of some of the 447 British soldiers who have lost their lives there. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Overseas visits are part of international diplomacy but that shouldn't mean UK taxpayers write blank cheques for luxurious hospitality.

(sic)' Then, in reference to an incident in which the young mother was pictured as her baby toppled out of its pram while she was on the phone, she posted: 'Her baby fell out the pram when she was to busy on her phone and now it's reported her... baby was left on its own with her dead body for 17 hours' Finally she added: 'an addiction to drugs is the result of a s**t choice you made whilst being a parent, feeling sorry for her ""addiction"" is pathetic!'

An inquest heard that Miss Geldof died of a drugs overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother Paula Yates. Stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home. An inquest heard that Miss Geldof died of a drugs overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother Paula Yates . Her comments have sparked a furious reaction from fellow Twitter users . Her husband returned from a weekend . away to find her slumped dead on a bed. She had been looking after their . baby son Phaedra, who was left alone for up to 17 hours. Ms Cunningham . shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded operation . to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been . bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest. She . has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by . selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the . NHS for her sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the . chance to appear on Big Brother. Talk . of her latest money-spinner - a possible DVD of her child’s birth - was . announced in May, when she said: ‘By selling DVDs of the birth, people . will get to see my maternal side. I love One Born Every Minute - it'll . be just like that.’ However, it has since been reported that the poundshop chain lined up to sell the video has backed out of the deal. After . receiving backlash when seemingly confirming the deal was over, she . responded by posting: ‘People may laugh, but think about it! 500 stores x 500 copies each equals a s**t loads of £’s! (sic)’ ‘Sadly I can only refer to it as a pound store, if it’s any help.... we can rule out the 99p store.’ Glamour model Ms Cunningham, who posted this scan of her baby on her Twitter feed, was apparently in talks to film a DVD of the child's birth and sell it in pound stores across the UK . The wannabe glamour model has previously caused outrage by posting controversial tweets, including this one . Ms . Cunningham has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her . unborn child is, claiming she fell pregnant while working as a . £1,000-a-night escort. She has also admitted to considering having her unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother. She . said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television . show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy. It was while working as an escort that Ms Cunningham had the breast augmentation which first made her infamous. The . operation was funded by the same NHS trust which refused to fund . surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of . cerebral palsy to walk. After . the enlargement, Ms Cunningham claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she . found them embarrassing, and enraged the nation further by claiming the . NHS should pay for a reduction. She then tried to placate . public opinion by promising to pay back the cash but admitted she could . not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant. She . now continues to soak up public funds and even receives state-funded . transport to take her children to school because of the 'negative . attention' she receives on public transport. It . means that since May, she and her children have been driven in taxis . the two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The . journey would cost around £30 a week by bus.","Wannabe glamour model  has blasted late Peaches Geldof on Twitter .

"By . Amanda Williams . It could have been the story of the year - 'The Queen has tested positive for morphine'. Unfortunately, however, it was little more than a well-timed screen grab. A picture appearing to show the BBC report that the Queen has tested positive for the drug morphine - and not her horse - is provoking much hilarity on Twitter. The screen grab - taken at an opportune moment as the rolling news text scrolled across the bottom of the screen - omitted the crucial first half of the sentence. Really? The BBC appeared to report that the Queen has tested positive for the drug morphine when this screen grab was taken - missing out key words . Estimate owned by the Queen tested positive for morphine, a prohibited substance, Buckingham Palace said . In its entirety, it would have read: 'A racehorse owned by the Queen has tested positive for morphine.' It was revealed last night that Estimate, one of Her Majesty's prize racehorses, had tested positive for the banned drug. BBC . bosses seem to have seen the funny side of the joke - saying that . usually viewers watch the news in whole, and not frame by frame. A . spokesman said: 'The ticker on the BBC News Channel correctly showed . the whole headline ""A racehorse owned by the Queen has tested positive . for morphine"" as it scrolled along the screen. A screen grab has been . taken which omits ""A racehorse owned by"" and only shows the rest of the . sentence. ' Estimate, . a five-year-old filly, failed the test when the painkiller morphine was . found in a sample taken after a race, Buckingham Palace said. Trained . by leading flat racing trainer Sir Michael Stoute, Estimate won the . Ascot Gold Cup last year - the first royal horse to win the prestigious . race. A screen grab is doing the rounds on Twitter - causing much hilarity . She came second in this year’s Gold Cup last month, when the test is believed to have occurred. The . revelation came five days after the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) announced that at least five horses, from various trainers, had tested . positive for banned drugs following race meetings. It has begun an investigation. Morphine is a permitted medication for racehorses but is banned on race days. Initial . indications are that Estimate’s positive test was caused by her eating . contaminated feed, the Palace said. The Queen has been informed. Following . the BHA’s announcement, Northamptonshire-based feed manufacturer Dodson . and Horrell, which has held a royal warrant since 1985, said its . suppliers had informed the company of possible contamination and it . destroyed all of its stock of a feed called Alfalfa Oil Plus. Estimate is pictured left on its way to winning The Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2013 . The Queen watched Estimate win the Gold Cup on Ladies Day with her racing manager John Warren in 2013 . John . Warren, the Queen’s bloodstock and racing adviser, said: ‘Sir Michael is . working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the . product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables. ‘As the . BHA investigates this matter, including potential links between the . different cases, Sir Michael continues to offer his full co-operation.’ Once . investigations are complete, the cases will be put before a BHA . disciplinary panel which will decide if any should be taken. This could include disqualifying the horses involved from the races they had competed in.

"By . Amanda Williams . A former rent boy has claimed that he was blackmailed into having sex with senior Conservatives in the 1970s - including late MP Charles Irving . A former rent boy has claimed that he was blackmailed into having sex with senior Conservatives in the 1970s. The man said he was threatened by two 'pimps' when he arrived in London from Northern Ireland - who told him they would send compromising pictures of him back to his parents if he tried to escape. He also claims they threatened that an 'accident' might befall his parents if he refused to have sex with their clients. The man - who is now 59 and is identified only as David - told the Sunday Mirror he was plied with alcohol by MP Charles Irving. He said we was then forced to have sex with the Tory in exchange for £30. He also claims that he had to perform a sex act on a Lord while he was driving around London, and that he was given a fountain pen in return. He decided to come forward after reports surfaced of the Tory activist who supplied boys to ministers in Margaret Thatcher’s government. David, now a married father-of-four, said that he also attended parties where Conservatives celebrated their first year as MPs by having sex with boys as young as 12. He claims his descent into prostitution began shortly after he arrived in London in 1975, after he left Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. David claims he was picked up by a man in his 20s called Kevin who introduced him to another man called Alan. He said he was raped twice after an evening of drinking and was later told that graphic images had been taken of him. He said he was then blackmailed into prostitution. David claims he had sex with Charles Irving, then Tory MP for Cheltenham, who died in 1995, at a country house in Essex, and was later taken to parties with senior Conservatives, where he was forced to perform sex acts. He is now considering giving a statement to the Government inquiry into alleged abuse at the heart of Westminster, announced by Theresa May . He said: 'One night I was taken near the House of Lords and picked up by a peer. We were driven around London while I performed a sex act on him. He gave me a fountain pen.' He said at one party he saw a boy of around 12 being taken into a room. He said: 'I assumed he’d just been ""delivered"". He looked at me. I saw fear in his eyes. That look will always haunt me.' His health later suffered so much that his 'pimps' allowed him to go home. He is now considering giving a statement to the Government inquiry into alleged abuse at the heart of Westminster.

"By . Amanda Williams . A football referee has been banned for life after allegedly headbutting another official after a youth match. Julian Workman, 43, was coaching an under 11s side at  Redditch United’s Valley Stadium when he was accused of assaulting the referee. He was originally fined 'for misconduct' by Birmingham County FA after the incident which took place on the car park at the non-league club. Julian Workman, 43, was coaching an under 11s side at Redditch United's Valley Stadium when he was accused of assaulting the referee in the car park after the match . But now the regional FA’s Referee Disciplinary Panel has imposed a lifetime refereeing ban. A Birmingham County FA spokesman said: 'The referee committee have imposed a ban on him refereeing and that is subject to an appeal. 'He didn’t have a personal hearing so he now has the opportunity to come along and puts his side forward.' Mr Workman had been promoted to a Level 6 official in April last year - meaning he was able to referee county level matches. He also works as a junior and senior football development officer at Redditch United FC. It comes days after a junior footballer was banned for seven years by FA bosses after allegedly wiping spit on a referee's back. Jake Schofield, 15, reportedly spat on his hand and smeared it on the official at the end of a game between his side Moston Valley and Failsworth West Juniors in Manchester. He was reported to Manchester FA and was stunned to later find out he had been banned from playing football until August 2021. He was originally fined 'for misconduct' by Birmingham County FA after the incident which took place on the car park at the non-league club (pictured) Redditch United Chairman Chris Swan added: 'The first I became aware of this ruling was on Wednesday (July 9) as I was leaving the country. I intend to discuss it fully with Mr Workman on my return. 'It should also be stated that he protests his innocence and that he will be appealing. 'The club does not condone aggressive behaviour or any deviation from the high standards it sets for all it’s officers, on or off the field, at any level.' One parent is now calling for the Southern League side to take disciplinary action against Mr Workman, who is also the club’s Junior Secretary. The father-of-one, who did not want to be named, said: 'I hope that the club takes appropriate action . Redditch United Chairman Chris Swan said that Mr Workman insisted that he was innocent . 'He oversees all of the youth teams and is supposed to set a positive example to the youngsters. 'It’s ridiculous that you can be banned from refereeing, but can continue to hold official positions at the football club. 'If somebody like Luis Suarez can get banned from all football related activities for violent conduct, how can somebody who has been banned from refereeing be allowed to stay involved with the club? 'Being a referee himself you would think he would have respect for officials and what a tough job they have.

"By . Amanda Williams . A mother took her ten-year-old son to court to watch the moment a driver was sentenced for killing his father so he wouldn't grow up with 'unanswered questions'. Lewi Sharp, the youngest of three children, was given permission to attend the hearing after a request from his mother Angela Sharp. His father Garry was killed when his motorbike was hit by 80-year-old John Wigfield Elvin's car on the A684 Garsdale Head, near Sedbergh. Ten-year-old Lewi Sharp has been allowed to sit in court to watch the moment a driver was sentenced for killing his father on this road . Lewi listened for more than two hours as 53 pages of his mother’s diary - which told how she had suffered terrible nightmares and flashbacks since her husband’s death - were read to magistrates in Kendal, Cumbria. The diary also documented how Mrs Sharp, of Flookburgh, Cumbria, had taken Lewi several times to the scene of the fatal accident, where they found remnants of 48-year-old Mr Sharp’s sunglasses and jacket. Explaining . her decision to let Lewi sit in the court hearing, she said: 'Lewi and I . didn’t want any unanswered questions - we’ve dealt with it all together . and he’s been mature about it all. 'He has had to grow up fast and his life has been devastated.' Mrs Sharp has hit out at what she sees as the leniency of the sentence handed down to 80-year-old John Wigfield Elvin, who was given a community order of 200 hours’ unpaid work and a two-year driving ban after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving. His father Garry was killed when his motorbike was hit by 80-year-old John Wigfield Elvin's car on the A684 Garsdale Head, near Sedbergh. Lewi , the youngest of three children, was given permission to attend the hearing after a request from his mother Angela Sharp (pictured) He crashed into the father-of-three’s motor-bike on the wrong side of the road on the A684 Garsdale Head, near Sedbergh. 'He only has to serve community service in a charity shop,' said Mrs Sharp. 'The sentence was insufficient for the value of a life.' The court was told that on October 24 last year Mr Sharp met his friend Andrew Bell on the A590 at 11.30am before setting off for Sedbergh on his yellow BMW motorbike. Lisa Hine, prosecuting, said Mr Sharp, who used his bike to travel to work and was wearing a high visibility jacket, was riding at no more than 40mph 70 feet in front of Mr Bell in ‘effectively dry’ conditions. She said that in a split second Mr Bell could see Elvin, of Godwin Close, Bourne, Lincolnshire, who was travelling with his wife to Milnthorpe, was about to come onto their side of the road. The gap became narrower and narrower before Mr Bell saw a ‘wobble’ of the car and then heard the impact of the bike and Elvin’s car throwing Mr Sharp over his handlebars. Despite attempts to resuscitate Mr Sharp, an HGV driver for Milnthorpe-based Canute, he died at the scene at 2.07pm. Richard Clews, for Elvin, said in mitigation that the former regional manager and distribution manager for Trebor confectioners, whose son has a cottage in Sedbergh, was an ‘experienced driver’ and the accident was caused by a ‘momentary lapse’. 'John Elvin is not a cold-hearted person; he is the same as you and I. He has thought about little else since it happened and it has troubled him deeply,' he said. Mrs Sharp said in her victim statement. Lewi with older brothers Luke, left, and Josh together with their father.  Mr Sharp was killed when his motorbike was hit by 80-year-old John Wigfield Elvin's car on the A684 Garsdale Head, near Sedbergh. The sons' tribute at scene where Mr Sharp died. Elvin was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work in the community after admitting death by careless driving . She said: 'Garry’s death is something that has changed our lives forever and we will never forget him. I only hope our story brings it home to other drivers the importance of taking more care on the roads. I would hate for anyone else to go through what we have.' After the hearing, she said: 'I really wanted him to be charged with dangerous driving because it would have been more for a life. The sentence doesn’t send out a message which will make others think twice about their actions.' The National Cycling Charity’s Road Justice campaign is calling for tougher sentences and a tougher response to bad driving. Campaign co-ordinator Rhia Weston said: 'We believe it should be ‘dangerous’ if danger has been caused to someone - too many incidents are classed as careless. We want longer driving bans of five to ten years as well as education.' Martin Hill, regional head of magistrates prosecutions for the CPS, said: 'John Elvin was charged with death by careless driving after careful consideration. 'The evidence was reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and CPS guidance on charging offences arising from driving incidents.' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said a review of driving offences and penalties would be carried out by the Department of Transport and the Ministry of Justice in the coming months. Elvin was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. This would have been 300 hours but Mr Benning said he was ‘obliged’ to give Elvin credit for his early guilty plea. Elvin was disqualified from driving for two years and will have to reapply for his licence and pass an extended retest when this period is over. He was also ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.","Lewi Sharp was in court to watch John Wigfield Elvin sentenced .

"By . Amanda Williams . A school has come under fire after asking parents to spend up to £400 on an iPad for lessons. Gryphon School, in Sherborne, Dorset, sent a letter home 'explicitly recommending' that parents purchase an Apple tablet in time for the next academic year in September. It said it is aiming for every pupil in years . seven, eight and nine to be equipped with an iPad, and has written to parents explaining three options for purchasing the device, which it says is 'entirely optional'. Juliana Atyeo and parents who are concerned at the 'strong recommendation' that they will have to purchase iPads for their children before next term . Gryphon School, in Sherborne, Dorset, sent a letter home 'explicitly recommending' that parents purchase an Apple tablet in time for the next academic year in September . The school does not have funds to pay for them and has offered long-term price plans, but is encouraging parents to make a one-off payment of £424 or £306 for an iPad Mini. Parent Giles Bennett said: 'Having an expensive, desirable and portable device upon a child's person creates a threat situation for them from both inside and still worse, from outside the school. 'Bringing up a family is hard these days, nothing is getting any cheaper. Why the school thinks that most parents have hundreds of pounds to available for these things is a bit of a mystery. 'It worries me that the school is so divorced from the realities facing many of its pupils' families.' The school has laid out three payment options. Option One - described as 'the one the school would recommend' - involves an outright purchase for £424 for a full-sized iPad or £306 for a Mini including a cover and insurance. The school said it is aiming for every pupil in years seven, eight and nine to be equipped with an iPad, and has written to parents explaining three options for purchasing the device . Option Two is £300 and £197 respectively without a cover or insurance and Option Three involves monthly installments ranging from £10.50 a month to £21 per month which can be spread between 24 and 36 months. Angered parents have set up a Facebook page to discuss the proposals in which one mother suggested it was not fair for state schools to expect them to part with so much cash. Juliana Atyeo, whose son Oskar is in Year 7, wrote: 'State education should be free for all. Asking parents to part with this amount of money so that their children can access the curriculum inherently contradicts the principle of state education. 'Even though the school has proposed a monthly payment plan it is unfair to ask parents to sign up to what is essentially a credit scheme. 'Demanding that all students have access to an iPad in order to participate in exercises centrally set by the teacher may have a long-term negative impact on the students' attitudes to learning. 'The message being sent out is that students require a specific technological device in order to learn.' Gryphon School is rated 'good' by Ofsted and has over 2,000 pupils including the sixth form. In a joint statement, headteacher Steve Hillier and chairman of the governors Nigel Rees said: 'There is no requirement for students in any year to acquire an iPad, but it is widely felt that there is a clear benefit in the student being able to use any tablet, small laptop or mobile technology as an additional route to learning.'","Gryphon School, in Dorset, 'explicitly recommended' parents buy tablet .

"By . Amanda Williams . A beautiful Scottish glen which featured in the James Bond film Skyfall is being blighted by fly-tippers and litter louts. Tents, mattresses, and pile upon pile of rubbish is left strewn around Glen Etive, in Lochaber, in the Scottish Highlands. Residents are cataloguing the problem with a series of pictures showing the mess left by climbers and campers along the 14-mile glen to the head of Loch Etive. It featured in the 2012 Bond blockbuster Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench, and also in two Harry Potter films, The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Order of the Phoenix. The breathtaking scenery featured in 007 movie Skyfall is being 'destroyed' by fly-tippers and litter louts . Residents are cataloguing the problem with a series of pictures showing the mess left by climbers and campers at Glen Etive, in Lochaber, in the Scottish Highlands . The stunning scenery and locations along the 14-mile glen to the head of Loch Etive featured in the 2012 Bond blockbuster Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench . The glen also attracts huge numbers of 'wild' campers each year, who leave behind full campsites, prompting the launch of a Facebook campaign. Mark and Phillipa Shone who have lived in the glen for the past two years, set up a Facebook community page called 'Glen Etive - The Dirty Truth' to document the behaviour of some campers and day-trippers who drive away leaving bags full of rubbish, tents, camping equipment, broken bottles, drinks cans and - in some instances - drugs paraphernalia. Mr Shone, 29, said: 'It's just baffling the mentality of these people, who show no respect for such a gorgeous part of the country. The area was also used in two Harry Potter films, The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Order of the Phoenix . The glen attracts huge numbers of campers each year, many of whom leave behind vast amounts of litter . Mark and Phillipa Shone who have lived in the glen for the past two years, set up a Facebook community page called 'Glen Etive - The Dirty Truth' to document and expose the selfish behaviour of some campers and day-trippers . 'It's the festival mentality that some people seem to have, rocking up on a Friday and partying all weekend. We see whole campsites left - tents full of dirty nappies. There's broken bottles and even supermarket trolleys which appear to be used for cooking food on the fire.' The Shones set up the Facebook page just two weeks ago and have been amazed at the positive response, with 1,347 likes so far. 'The Facebook page has sparked a good debate and discussion about what the possible solutions might be. There have been just one or two negative comments but that is probably from people just looking for an argument,"" Mark said. ""We don't want people to stop coming here, we just want people to respect the place and not trash it, because it is just sickening what is happening. 'There are signs in the glen telling people to take their litter home yet I find black bags full of rubbish piled up under them. There is no logic to it!' He added: 'Maybe we need to take a . leaf out of the United States' book and have dedicated countryside . police or wardens who patrol our glens and could tackle the problem head . on. I do challenge people but sometimes you have to step back if it's . 10 against one. 'It seems . that people just don't care. It can be all sorts of people too - I've . seen people draw up in Range Rovers, and I think they surely won't leave . rubbish, but they do. There's no way of telling who are going to be the . messy ones.' Mr Shone said the constant mess means he is now considering moving away from the area. The couple said some campers drive away leaving bags full of rubbish, tents, camping equipment, broken bottles, drinks cans and - in some instances - drugs paraphernalia . The couple said some people left full campsites behind, complete with tents and bedding . The couple said that trolleys were often abandoned at the site, and had appeared to be used to cook food on fires . Local Highland councillor Andrew Baxter has called for a meeting between the various landowners, public bodies and police in a bid to tackle the on-going problem of fly-tipping in Glen Etive. He said: 'I am angered that such a beautiful glen might as well be renamed 'Glen Midden' because of the lazy and selfish actions of those who think it acceptable to simply drive away, leaving their mess behind. 'This isn't real wild camping. What is wild about leaving your car blocking a passing place, emptying the entire contents of its boot and carrying it less than a hundred metres from the road side? The only thing that is wild about this camping, is how it leaves me and many others feeling when we see how the glen is being destroyed. There's no doubt, it has got even worse since the ban on camping around Loch Lomond was introduced. 'Practical action is needed, that's why I have asked for an urgent meeting with the various landowners, public bodies and police. That meeting should take place in the very near future. 'I've been in touch with councillors in Perth and Kinross, who have experienced similar problems around Loch Rannoch. They solved the problem with a proactive approach, which included police patrols, the recording of number plates and the direct threat of prosecution. We also need to consider what would happen if camping was banned within a set distance from the road.' The northern half of Glen Etive is tidied up regularly by landowners, the National Trust for Scotland (NTS). A Trust spokesperson said: 'This is undoubtedly an issue for us. We share concerns about the mess left behind by irresponsible campers in Glen Etive. The Trust takes responsibility for tidying up our land - every year we remove hundreds of bags of rubbish. This work, while clearly vital, diverts staff from important conservation work in the area. It also leaves our charity with the costs for disposing of this rubbish.' She added: 'Over the years, we have tried various approaches to tackle the issue and to try to encourage responsible behaviour and, of course, we talk regularly to our neighbours and relevant agencies about how best to tackle this. However, there are no straightforward solutions.'","Tents, mattresses, and piles of rubbish is left around Glen Etive, in Lochaber .

"By . Amanda Williams . Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos brokered a cocaine deal after she was drugged by an undercover reporter and then offered £3.5m to star in a Hollywood film, it was claimed today. The singer, 26, is accused of setting up an £820 drug deal between the reporter, who she believed to be a 'big shot' film producer, and her friend Mike 'GLC' Coombs. But today Southwark Crown Court heard that Sun on Sunday investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood spiked her drink, and was asked if he had touched her thigh 'on one or more occasion' to 'create a . friendly and inviting' atmosphere during the recorded conversation. Scroll down for video . Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos (pictured outside court today) brokered a cocaine deal after she was drugged by an undercover reporter and then offered £3.5m to star in a Hollywood film, it was claimed today . 'Fake Sheikh' Mr Mahmood, who used the name Samir Khan when setting up the singer, admitted using subterfuge but denied claims he spiked her drink as 'outrageous.' Tulisa first met Mr Mahmood in Las Vegas last March. He told her he wanted her to play the lead role in a 'Slumdog Millionaire' type film alongside someone like Leonardo Di Caprio, the court heard. The pair met again two months later at the Metropolitan Hotel in London on May 10 . Giving evidence from behind a screen Mr Mahmood was today asked whether he or his associate, known only as 'Nish' had spiked the singer's drink or offered her any money. Jeremy Dein QC, defending, asked: 'At the Metropolitan Hotel, by the time Miss Contostavlos had left the Metropolitan Hotel had she been drinking.' Mr Mahmood replied: 'Yes she had, but she was not drunk.' Mr Dein continued: 'You and Nish spiked her drink didn't you?' The witness firmly responded: 'That is absolutely outrageous.' Mahmoud told her he wanted her to play the lead role in a 'Slumdog Millionaire' type film alongside someone like Leonardo Di Caprio, the court heard . Mr Dein continued: 'You spiked her drinks to get her to incriminate herself.' The reporter replied: 'That is complete and utter nonsense.' Mr Dein also asked whether the journalist, posing as a Bollywood producer, had offered the singer millions of pounds to star in his bogus film. He said: 'I make it clear that I suggest that Nish left her tape recording device, led Miss Contostavlos to the lavatory and offered her £3.5m before anything was said about cocaine.' Mr Mahmood said he could not remember, but it was possible that money had been offered. The journalist was also quizzed about tactics he employed to pull off the sting. When asked if he knew the meaning of the word 'subterfuge' Mr Mahmood replied it was an approach employed by some journalists to 'elicit the truth'. Reading the Oxford English Dictionary definition to him, Mr Dein said: 'Deceit used to achieve one's goal.' 'Would you agreed with that definition?' Mr Mahmood replied: 'That would imply there is some malice involved. The purpose of this deceit is purely to establish the truth.' When it was put to him that he had acted dishonestly, Mr Mahmood disagreed, saying that would be the same as suggesting undercover police officers acted dishonestly. Mr Dein suggested that Mr Mahmood and Nish had only befriended Tulisa in a bid to get her to . Rapper: Mike GLC, whose real name is Michael Coombs, 36, pleaded guilty on Monday to supplying half an ounce of cocaine for £860 . incriminate herself. The witness replied: '(It was to) establish whether or not she was involved in supplying cocaine to her friends.' Mr Dein suggested: 'You manipulated her by making her believe that what she was saying to you was for the purposes of an audition, when in fact you were going to use it as evidence against her?' Sitting in the glass encased dock, Tulisa smirked as the reporter replied: 'I disagree.' Wearing a dusty pink dress cut just above be knee, a black blazer, black kitten heels and sporting a low ponytail and pale yellow manicured nails, Tulisa sat in the dock clutching a small image of religious idols. Mr Dein asked Mr Mahmood whether his colleague Nish discussed a £3.5 million fee for the film role with Contostavlos. Mr Mahmood replied: 'I can't remember but it's possible.' He added: 'I remember she asked for £3 million for this film part through her accountant on May 23.' The . undercover reporter denied that his colleague Nish had spoken earlier . to Contostavlos about the film deal in the toilets of Nobu restaurant, . the popular celebrity hangout in London, without her recording device. Mr Mahmood said: 'She's a celebrity. You don't have a conversation like that in a toilet in a restaurant like Nobu.' He said he discussed . Contostavlos's fee for the film with her PA Gareth Varey at the . Metropolitan hotel on May 10 last year. Mr . Varey said the singer was expecting £2 million for the next series of X . Factor after previously being paid £1.5 million and she would want £3 . million for the movie, the witness said. Mr Dein said the film would tell the story of a female character from a 'ghetto background' and that Mr Mahmood had given the impression that he wanted a 'bad girl' for the part. Mr Mahmood said: 'The part in the film was a bad girl. I didn't want a bad girl to play it.' The jury was shown footage of the meeting in Las Vegas in which Contostavlos discussed the X Factor and told the undercover team she 'wanted to get away from that'. Shortly afterwards, Nish - which is not her real name - pretended she was on the phone to Hollywood star Cameron Diaz, the court heard. Mr Mahmood, who was accused by Mr Dein of 'lying to the jury' during parts of his evidence, denied that it was later suggested to Contostavlos that she may lose the part to Keira Knightley. The court has heard that Contostavlos spoke about being able to get 'white sweets' and 'green sweets' - allegedly code for cocaine and cannabis - while at the Metropolitan Hotel with Mr Mahmood on May 10 last year. The singer was also said to have bragged that she used to be part of a gang who sold crack cocaine and that her ex-boyfriend was a cocaine dealer. Mr Dein said: 'The plan from the beginning was to get Ms Contostavlos very heavily under the influence of alcohol.' Mr Mahmood replied: 'I had absolutely no intention of getting Ms Contostavlos drunk, nor was she drunk.' Mr Dein asked the witness whether he touched the singer on the thigh 'on one or more occasion' to 'create a friendly and inviting' atmosphere during the recorded conversation. Mr Mahmood replied: 'No, not true.' He told the court that Mr Varey was 'visibly drunk' at the end of the night but denied that Contostavlos was in the same state. Contostavlos started giggling in the dock and put her hand over her mouth as a video was played of the pair returning to Mr Mahmood's hotel suite shortly after 2am. Tulisa, who is being tried under her real . name Tula, denies one count being concerned in the supply of class A . drugs between May 10 and May 23 last year. The trial continues.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Internet users searching Google for a small Yorkshire village were left surprised when the online results revealed a very rude image of a semi-naked man. The former coal-mining village of Skellow, near Doncaster, had no previous claim to fame, until one Twitter-user posted the search engine findings showing a naked man as a screen grab which has now gone viral. Posting the unfortunate image on the social network, David Firth wrote: 'Don’t think the people of Skellow, South Yorkshire would be happy with how Google pictures them.' Shock: Internet users searching Google for the Yorkshire village of Skellow were greeted with this very rude image of a naked man next to the map of the area . Origin: The search engine had confused the image in its results, using the picture which had been submitted to an online blog instead of a photograph of the village . Mr Firth, 31, said he normally uses Twitter to promote his work as an animator but couldn’t help share the screen grab with his followers. 'I was watching a previous video I made with a friend, in which he mentioned Skellow in conversation,' said the cartoonist from Leeds, West Yorkshire. 'For some reason I decided to Google it. 'I looked it up and there was the image. I’ve seen stuff like this before where the search engine confuses images with search results but this was something else.' Amused Tweeters have since shared the picture more than 1,500 times. One user replied: 'Maybe Google thinks it accurately portrays the citizens of Skellow'. Spot: Cartoonist David Firth came across the search engine error when he Googled the village . Writer Charlie Brooker, who Mr Firth used to work for, also shared the bizarre search engine results with his followers, writing: 'Reckon that @DAVID-FIRTH Skellow tweet needs wider distribution.' It was later discovered that the image had come from an online blog, Housequake, and was sent in by a user called ‘Jo’ from Wigan, Greater Manchester. The photograph, which had appeared next to a map of the village, has now been removed from the search results. Historically part of the West riding of Yorkshire, rural Skellow - which takes its name from the River Skell - is located around six miles from Doncaster, alongside the A1 road. During the English Civil War a cannon battery was set up in the village by Oliver Cromwell to protect the Great North Road, now the A1. The mounds that once held the cannon still remain in the village. The village is also home to Skellow Hall, which was built as a country manor house in 1642, and is now used as a residential care home for older people. Until the mid-1980s, the village was home to many employed in the coal mining industry, and the remains of the former Bullcroft Colliery's winding wheel can still be seen in neighbouring Carcroft.","Users searching for former mining village greeted by picture of nude man .

"By . Amanda Williams . A property tycoon and Labour donor tried to withdraw £2.5 million from his son-in-law’s joint bank account with his daughter after the couple split up, court documents have claimed. Sir David Garrard, who is said to be worth more than £100 million, has been accused of trying to take money from the account of son-in-law Alexander Salter and daughter Alanah. After Mr Salter started a relationship with Ms Garrard, the men jointly set up LX Capital, a venture capital . business. Sir David Garrard, who is said to be worth more than £100 million, has been accused of trying to take money from the account of son-in-law Alexander Salter and daughter Alanah . They then used it to buy a second firm, SamKnows, . which measures broadband internet performance, the Telegraph reports. But a dispute arose between the men when the couple split up in November, 2012. In papers lodged at the High Court, Sir David claims he treated Mr Salter 'as his own son'. He claims he gave him a £2million loan to buy the company SamKnows and then £747,000 more. Mr Salter, however, claims 'the claimant sought to remove the sum of £2.5 million from . the joint bank account of the defendant and Alanah without the authority . of the defendant or, to the best of the defendant’s knowledge, Alanah'. Sir David is also suing Mr Salter after he vetoed the appointment of Labour peer Lord Mendelsohn as a director of their two companies . It is not clear from the papers why the alleged withdrawal attempt occurred. Sir David is also suing Mr Salter after he vetoed the appointment of Labour peer Lord Mendelsohn as a director of the two companies, claiming that he had 'been involved in . corruption scandals involving cash for access to government ministers . and secret loans made to the Labour party' and was a 'politically . exposed person'. Sir David said Mr Salter's objections were unreasonable, as Lord Mendelsohn had been the 'victim of inaccurate smears.' The case has been lodged at the High Court and is expected to be heard later this year. Sir David loaned Labour £2.3 million before the 2005 general election. In 2005, he was put forward for a peerage but asked for his name to be withdrawn. Three years later, he turned £300,000 of the loan into a donation.

"By . Lucy Crossley . 'Flirting': Saheena Tegally, 26,  is accused of swapping numbers and sending an uninsured Porsche 911 driver flirty texts after pulling him over on the road . A police officer accused of flirting with an uninsured Porsche told a court today that a text he sent telling her she should dress only in underwear while at work was 'flattering' and 'just banter'. Saheena Tegally, 26, is accused of telling her colleagues to let Richard Myerson off the hook after the pair swapped numbers and he asked her out on a date. It is alleged she flirted with Myerson . after he was stopped behind the wheel of his Porsche after reports of . an altercation with a cyclist in Highgate, north London last July. The court was told the pair had swapped numbers and over the next few days texted back and forth. In the days after Myerson was pulled over in his 911 turbo by Tegally and two colleagues, he sent her a text which read: 'It’s far too hot to be in uniform. You could sit by that desk in your underwear. 'Then people would take bad news much easier.' Tegally then texted back saying that she . was on duty and wasn’t behind a desk, Wood Green Crown Court heard. Later Myerson had sent Tegally a . picture of himself posing in a 1940s outfit. Giving evidence today, Tegally, who worked at West Hampstead Police station said it was 'nice' to receive the attention from Myerson but it did not mean she wanted to meet up for 'a drink or even chicken.' She is accused of concealing the fact that Myerson was uninsured, not revealing an entire email chain showing that the insurance had expired, and encouraging a fellow officer to rip up his notebook containing evidence. Tegally of London Colney, near St Albans, Hertfordshire, denies one charge of perverting the course of justice and has been suspended from duty pending the outcome of the trial. Asked by prosecutor David Markham whether she thought it was appropriate for a professional investigator to exchange messages of this type she said: 'It wasn’t professional. None of it was professional. 'I had completely switched off… his messages were just banter.' The court heard that they exchanged a chain of jokey texts and emails over the next few days, and over text when asked if he would beat her in a race, Mr Myerson had said: 'I don’t know I’m very competitive.' Suspended: Tegally of London Colney, near St Albans, Hertfordshire, denies one charge of perverting the course of justice and has been suspended from duty pending the outcome of the trial . Tegally responded: 'I would still win,” to which Mr Myerson replied: 'Lol we’ll see I have met my match at last. At least we’ve got a great story for how we met.' She told the court how she had received Myerson’s insurance forms and told officers that she believed Mr Myerson to have been insured. However she admitted that she had not checked the date of expiry for the policy and hadn’t realised that it expired in May. Giving evidence, wearing a dark blazer and suit trousers and an orange top with her hair tied back, she said: 'I believed it was covered by misreading the date.' 'I only actually read that email properly the day after I was arrested.' Getting emotional in the dock, she said: 'I worked hard to become a police officer and as much as I am struggling that job is my life. I wouldn’t have done that and I have no reason to cover up absolutely anything.' Fast car: Richard Myserson was pulled over in his Porsche 911, similar to the one pictured, in Highgate, north London last July (file photo) Banter: Tegally told Wood Green Crown Court that Mr Myerson's text messages were 'just banter' She added, speaking about the attention from Mr Myerson: 'It was flattering, it was nice, but that doesn’t for a minute mean I was going to meet with him for a drink or even chicken. 'I didn’t plan on meeting Mr Myerson. 'The fact that he’s got a Porsche, it’s a sports car. Cars don’t actually mean that much to me.' The court was also told that Tegally had boasted to her friend that Mr Myerson had offered to take her on a date, and that she and the businessman had joked about meeting up to arrest pickpockets. The jury heard Mr Myerson texted her saying: 'What day are you working so we can go look for pickpockets?' She had replied: 'I’m not working tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday. Lol. X' Later she said: 'I wish sometimes I got two days off.' Tegally also texted her best friend on July 12 bragging about having seized a Porsche. She said: ' seized a Porsche off a 25 year old. He is minted and asked to take me out. He has got his Porsche back as it was seized by mistake.' She denies one count of perverting the course of justice on July 11 2013. The trial continues.

"By . Amanda Williams . The death of a British tourist in a Vietnamese hotel room remains a mystery after local doctors blamed alcohol consumption but a British pathologist insists he had not drunk enough to kill him. Student nurse Jake O’Grady, 26, was found in his hotel room while on a backpacking expedition in Vietnam at the end of last year. He had been travelling for just over a month with friends Katie Benefer and Ciara Desmond when he became unwell while celebrating the New Year in the city of Hanoi. Police later entered his room Hong Ngoc Hotel and found his body in bed after his friends raised the alarm. Student nurse Jake O'Grady, 26, was found dead in his hotel room while on a backpacking expedition in Vietnam at the end of last year . A post mortem examination was carried out by Vietnamese doctors who found Mr O’Grady had died on January 1 from acute respiratory failure as a result of alcohol abuse, adding that there was a slight blood clot to the left of his forehead, suggesting violent contact with a hard object. But Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour was unable to confirm the cause of his death and said that the 212 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood was not in the fatal range. The legal limit for driving is 80mg. No drugs were found and there was no suggestion of violence or suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. The details emerged at an inquest in Preston, held after Mr O’Grady’s body was flown back to the UK. In . a statement read to the court Dr Armour said: 'There is no evidence of natural disease to cause or accelerate . death. 212mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood would cause a moderate degree . of intoxication but is not within the fatal range which is nearly . 400mg. In my opinion it is insufficient to cause this man’s death. 'I can’t contribute this young man’s death to the abuse of alcohol. Death should be regarded as unascertained. He had been travelling for just over a month with friends Katie Benefer and Ciara Desmond when he became unwell while celebrating the New Year in the city of Hanoi . 'I . disagree with the cause of death from the post mortem in Vietnam. There . are no marks of violence to the body, no evidence to support the view . that he had been the victim of an assault.' The coroner heard Mr O’Grady, from Morecambe, Lancashire was an 'outgoing friendly guy who was loved by many people.' He and his friends had travelled from the UK on November 20 2013 to go back packing around the Far East. They had visited Thailand and Cambodia before arriving in Vietnam on December 19 and had checked into the hostel on December 29, 2013. But on December 31, the friends became separated after a night drinking in bars. The two girls left Mr O’Grady at around 3.30am at the Lighthouse Bar to go home but Miss Benefar had become concerned about his wellbeing after he failed to respond to her text messages. In a statement read from Det Insp Beverley Foster of Lancashire Constabulary, Miss Benefar confirmed that she was notified by police on New Year’s Day that her friend was dead. A post mortem examination was carried out by Vietnamese doctors who found Mr O'Grady had died on January 1 from acute respiratory failure as a result of alcohol abuse . Miss Benefar was asked to identify his body and she confirmed her friend looked 'peaceful'. Area . coroner Simon Jones recording an open conclusion into his death said . that he had two conflicting autopsy reports on Mr O’Grady’s cause of . death. But he said he preferred the conclusion of Dr Alison Armour in view of her accreditation by the Home Office. He . said: 'Dr Armour, she found no explanation for this young man’s sudden . death, no evidence of any natural disease to cause death or collapse. 'She disagrees with the conclusion of the Vietnamese post mortem. In her view the alcohol level was not at a level where fatality occurs, which is normally around 400mg. I prefer the conclusion of Dr Armor in view of her accreditation as Home Office pathologist. 'I’m satisfied that the cause of death must be recorded as unascertained rather than acute respiratory failure due to alcohol abuse, given the comparatively low level of alcohol which would lead to a moderate degree of intoxication but would not contribute to death. Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour said that the 212 microgrammes of of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood was not in the fatal range . 'There is no explanation for this man’s death and I formally record as unascertained. Cause of death could not be established.' Mr O’Grady was a former pupil of Our Lady’s High School in Lancaster and was a student at Preston College at the time of his death. Headteacher at Our Lady’s Catholic College, Mr Brendan Conboy, said: 'The community of Our Lady’s is deeply shocked and saddened by the untimely death of a popular and fondly regarded young man. 'Jake will be remembered for his vibrancy, his caring nature and for his friendly, outgoing manner. His family are in our thoughts and prayers.' A spokesman for Preston College: said: 'Jake had ambitions of being an adult nurse. He studied a Health and Social Care Level 2 course followed by an Access to Health professions course at Level 3, which would usually lead to further training in nursing or care work. 'Jake was a considerate, warm and passionate individual who was always supportive of other learners in the group both in their academic life and personal life. He studied with us for two years, progressing from a Level 2 diploma with a distinction star and then achieving a distinction in his Level 3 course. 'Jake made such a positive impact on his fellow students and his tutors, his ability and determination would have made Jake a top class nurse and he will always be in the memories of those who knew him. Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Jake’s family.'","Jake O’Grady, 26, was found in hotel while on backpacking expedition .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Mastermind: Adam Simmons was jailed last year for his role in a scam where gem dealers conned elderly victims into buying diamonds for up to thirty times their actual worth . A gang of gem dealers made £1million by conning elderly victims into buying diamonds for up to thirty times their actual worth, a court heard today. As part of the alleged boiler room fraud, the gang cold-called investors, many of them pensioners, before sending them glossy brochures for bogus company No1 Gems, based in Hove, East Sussex. Among the victims was a retired police officer duped into using up . the last of his savings to buy coloured stones for £140,000 which were . worth little more than £10,000. Mastermind Adam Simmons, his father . Michael, brother-in-law Adam Leach and Lee Miller were jailed in . September last year after being convicted of fraud, while alleged conspirator John Bishop, 32, denies heading up one of the sales offices for the scam in Marbella, Spain, . the Old Bailey was told. Bishop was arrested in October last year after returning to the UK from Spain. Adam Simmons set up No1 Gems, based in Hove, East Sussex, in late 2011 and conned investors for the best part of a year, the court heard. By the time the company was raided by police in September 2012, they had closed down their operation and were preparing to start a similar firm called Pinnacle in nearby Eastbourne. 'Basically, No1 Gems were engaged in what is known as a boiler room fraud,' said David Durose, prosecuting. ‘It is a specific type of fraud in which individuals are targeted with cold calling and pressured into making purchases of items such as shares, equities or financial instruments - or in this case, diamonds. Location: Alleged conspirator John Bishop, 32, denies heading up one of the sales offices for the scam in Marbella, Spain (pictured) Gang members: Adam Leach (left) and his brother-in-law Simmons (right) were convicted of fraud for their parts in the boiler room fraud which targeted a retired police officer, among other victims . ‘They marked up the price by eight, ten or even up to nearly 30 times in order to determine the price they would be sold for.’ Mr Durose told the court that glossy brochures were sent out boasting employees at No1 Gems had more than 100 years’ experience in the jewel business. He said the gang had also lied about the closure of diamond mines and a potential £15million deal to sell jewels to HSBC to get customers to part with their cash. Family: Adam Simmons's father Michael (pictured) was also sentenced in September last year . Retired William Doorbar, from Stoke, Staffordshire, was one of those targeted, the court heard. He . initially agreed to buy one 0.26 carat green diamond for £5,598 in . March 2012 after a No1 Gems representative told him he could make annual . returns upwards of 20 per cent. ‘It sounds like a good investment,’ said Mr Durose. ‘But the 20 per cent is how much the value of the diamond would go up, not how much he paid for it would go up. ‘Even if the rate came through, if the diamond was originally purchased for £350, after three years it would still be worth less than £1,000. ‘This was not an investment - this was a scam.’ Mr Doorbar was told that HSBC had agreed to buy the firm’s entire stock for £15.5million and offered the chance of buying three jewels to make a £38,000 profit in one month. He was also told the Argyle diamond mine in Australia would shortly be closing and this would push up prices. ‘He was told it would only be a small amount of time before there was a huge return,’ said Mr Durose. ‘They suggested he consider taking out a loan if he could not afford it.’ Mr Doorbar bought a total of nine stones from the firm and used the last of his savings for his final £9,000 purchase. No1 Gems agreed to refund him £3,000 when he raised suspicions - but the money never materialised. Bishop, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, denies conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading between 31 October 2011 and 10 September 2012 and transferring criminal property. The trial continues.

"By . Lucy Crossley . With wedding prices enough to make any couple wince, a charity stepped in to help 90 Turkish couples tackle the cost of tying the knot by organising a mass ceremony at a football club. Attended by 3,500 guests, the enormous Muslim ceremony was held at a stadium in Reyhanli, Hatay Province, and organised by non-profit organisation the Konya Mehir Foundation as well as the local government. The happy couples, all of them from low income families, were also given gifts of donated furniture, bedroom linens, crockery, clothing and even large household items such as refrigerators to help get their new lives together off to a good start. Newlyweds: Two Turkish couples pose for a wedding photograph after taking part in a charity-funded mass marriage ceremony at a local football stadium for 90 brides and grooms . Tackling the cost: The couples all came from low-income families and would have been unable to afford to get married without the help of charity Knoya Mehir Foundation and the area's local government . Many of the brides and their new grooms had been forced to postpone their nuptials because they had been unable to afford to get married. Traditionally, Turkish weddings are attended by hundreds of guests with the celebrations stretching on for days, while the costs - usually met by the bridegroom's family - can reach into thousands of pounds. Each of the 90 couples, who were also provided with flowers and food, had been chosen by the charity due to their financial situations. Most of the brides wore white wedding dresses, paired with an array of headscarves, veils and tiaras, while many also wore a red sash around their waists - traditionally worn by Turkish brides as a symbol of virginity. Making it official: Each of the couples, including this pair pictured signing the register, said their vows individually in front of the town's mayor . From this day forward: The couple are presented with their marriage license after making their vows in front of Reyhanli mayor Huseyin ¿anver . Among those making their vows were refugees who had been forced to leave their homes in Syria due to civil unrest in the country and flee to Turkey. Those in attendance included relatives of the couples, Orhan Karasay from the local branch of Turkey's ruling AK Party, and the region's governor Yusuf Güler, while Foundation president Mustafa Özdemir gave a speech wishing the 90 couples well. 'Everything you need for the establishment of a nest was considered,' he said, telling them about the 20 items each couple were given as presents, according to Turkish news website Haber7. First dance: After saying their 'I dos' the couples and their loved ones were then treated to musical entertainment courtesy of celebrated Turkish musician Gökhan Güney .

Time for a selfie: One happy groom takes a selfie on his phone with his new bride - who wears a traditional red sash around her waist as a symbol of virginity . Mr Özdemir told the assembled guests that the charity had so far been able to help 12,000 couples to marry, while the Reyhanli mayor Huseyin Şanver said that mass weddings had been held in the area since 2004, when 45 farmers took part in a ceremony. Each of the couples said their vows individually in front of Mr Şanver, as in Turkey all legally-binding marriages must be civil ceremonies performed by an authorised wedding officer.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Football referee: Gary Connor, 40, hanged himself the day after bailiffs hounded him for money he did not believe he owed, an inquest heard . A football referee hanged himself the day after bailiffs hounded him for debts he did not believe he owed and was close to clearing, an inquest heard today. Gary Connor, 40, was becoming 'overwhelmed' by his financial worries, and the day before his body was found he was visited by debt collectors in relation to his car. However, at the inquest into his death doubts were raised over whether the debts amassed by Mr Connor, from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, were as bad as he feared. His body was discovered in a field near to his hometown on the morning of September 28 last year. His former girlfriend, Stacey Gallagher-Hammond, told the hearing in Hatfield that the former footballer and qualified referee had seemed stressed and nervous at the time of the bailiffs' visit. She said she thought Mr Connor was around £1,600 . in debt, but the inquest heard he may have been . close to sorting his financial issues. Detective Constable Steve Blackie told the hearing a PPI claim Mr Connor made should have been enough to clear his debts. Graham Danbury, deputy coroner for Hertfordshire, recorded a verdict of suicide. Recording . his verdict, Mr Danbury said: 'We have had quite a bit of evidence . about his financial affairs, which appear to have been in something of a . mess, although the overall picture seems to be that it wasn’t as bad as . he thought. 'On that day Gary appears to have been overwhelmed by a combination of mainly financial issues. 'This was his way out.' The family of Mr Connor, a qualified referee and former footballer, said after the hearing that banks and companies he supposedly owned money to were not sure what cash they were due. They described him as 'a wonderful man, kind and generous and loved by many, many people', but criticised the pressure debt collectors put on people. Worries: His former girlfriend, Stacey Gallagher-Hammond, told the hearing at Hertfordshire Coroner's Court in Hatfield that the former footballer and qualified referee had seemed stressed and nervous at the time of the bailiffs' visit . 'The hole left in our lives by his loss will never be filled,' the family said in a statement. 'It has been a complete shock to us that Gary felt driven to do this. 'It is clear that he was being chased for debts that he did not believe he owed. 'As his family has continued to deal with his bank and their debt management company, it has become clear that those institutions do not themselves know whether any debts are owed. 'We do not know how much this confusion and the demands affected Gary’s decision, but the stress that people are put under by financial institutions that do not understand their own demands must be immense.” The family added that they were unhappy at the 'lack of communication and contradictory information' from police during the investigation.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A 'modern-day Talented Mr Ripley' has been accused by a Marchioness of defrauding her animal welfare charity out of a £4,000 bronze statue of a pig. Tracy Ward, the Marchioness of Worcester, claims convicted conman Matthew Brown stole the statue, which was due to be auctioned to raise money for her ethical farming campaign group Farms Not Factories. Brown, 29, successfully bid for the piece, named the Dittisham Lady, at the fundraiser in March - but the Marchioness says he paid for the item with an 'uncashable' cheque, likening him to the con artist character in The Talented Mr Ripley. Allegation: Tracy Ward, the Marchioness of Worcester, (right) claims convicted conman Matthew Brown (left) stole a statue due to be auctioned to raise money for her ethical farming campaign group Farms Not Factories . In both Patricia Highsmith's novel and the 1999 film staring Matt Damon, Tom Ripley manages to worm his way into a high society circle using forgery and impersonation. Brown denies behaving fraudulently, and says he lawfully bought the 12in-long statue, created by sculptor Nick Bibby. The Marchioness, a former actress who starred in 1980s TV detective series CATS Eyes and as Miss Scarlett in Cluedo, has reported the matter to police after she turned investigator - searching CCTV footage from the event to try to establish what happened to the prized artwork. She alleges that Brown, who has a string of convictions dating back to when he was a teenager, was last seen leaving the event in a taxi with the pig. According the the Marchioness, the pair met at the fundraiser held at London’s exclusive No.41 Mayfair club for her charity, which is supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Sir Paul McCartney and Tom Parker Bowles, and is behind campaign film series The Pig Business. She says that Brown told her he was a Monaco-based millionaire named Sebastian Von Anhalt, and the boyfriend of one of her acquaintances. Character: The Marchioness likened Brown to Tom Ripley, played by Matt Damon (left, with co-stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law) in 1999 film The Talented Mr Ripley . She said she did not know who she was, but that he pledged to raise £100,000 for her charity with the help of his rich friends. At the auction he then bid £4,000 for the statue before handing over a cheque for $18,000 Canadian dollars, with the instruction that the money be taken from that sum, according to the Marchioness. 'I absolutely would not have let him take the pig until the cheque had cleared but he left with it that night,' she told The Sunday Times. The Marchioness alleged that after she found she was unable to cash the cheque and although Brown initially agreed to transfer the money to the charity's account, he then ceased all contact with her. She then spoke to the man Brown had said was his boyfriend. Sleuth: Tracy Ward starred in 1980s TV detective series CATS Eyes with Leslie Ash (right), and as Miss Scarlett (left), with Stephanie Beacham in the television series Cluedo . 'He told me it was a lie and that he'd known this man for a very brief period of time before discovering he ""isn't what he claims to be"",' she said. 'I spoke to more people and found out he's actually this Talented Mr Ripley-type who just goes round wrecking lives.' In 2004, aged just 20, Brown admitted deception charges after posing as an aristocrat to get a credit card, running up bills of thousands of pounds. He had posed as a lord and City worker, using credit cards to fund a lavish lifestyle including visits to top hotels and trips in limousines, but in reality was unemployed and had no intention of paying the £18,000 in bills, Middlesex Guildhall Crown Court was told. Philanthropist: The former actress is now behind campaign group Farms Not Factories, and charity film series The Pig Business . Brown was given a three-month rehabilitation order after he admitted nine charges of obtaining services by deception. In 2009 he was given a 30 month jail sentence after being convicted of further fraud and deception counts. He is still under investigation over allegations he defrauded former Lincolnshire police commissioner candidate Mervyn Barrett. It is alleged Brown, who was acting as Mr Barrett's campaign manager, ran up thousands of pounds of debts without his permission. Mr Barrett stepped down from his 2012 campaign after he discovered money was apparently missing from his bank account. Brown denies any wrongdoing in the matter of the statue. MailOnline was unable to reach solictors for Brown at the time of publication, however, a statement issued by Brown’s lawyers in April said: ‘He categorically denies he behaved fraudulently’ and that he ‘lawfully purchased’ the pig.","Tracy Ward claims Matthew Brown stole bronze pig statue at charity auction .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Rejected: Former Lostprophets singer and convicted paedophile Ian Watkins has had his appeal bid against his sentence turned down . Former Lostprophets singer and convicted paedophile Ian Watkins has had his appeal bid against his sentence turned down, despite arguing his sex crimes were 'not the worst'. The 37-year-old singer's defence lawyer had told Court of Appeal judges sitting at Cardiff Crown Court that Watkins had been unfairly treated when he was given a 29 year jail term. The 13 sex offences he pleaded guilty . to last November included the attempted rape of an 11-month old child as well as . encouraging a fan to abuse her baby via webcam. Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself. Originally, Watkins had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite a damning video evidence. He . changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then . complained he had not realised that his guilty plea had made him 'look . guilty'. While awaiting . sentencing last December, he was recorded by prison officials saying the whole thing . was 'megalolz' during a telephone call to a friend. Although 37-year-old Watkins did not . challenge his 13 sex offence convictions, the disgraced rock star . complained he was treated too harshly by sentencing judge Mr Justice . Royce when he was handed a 29 year jail term as well as an additional six years on licence. As he sentenced the singer, the judge called him a dangerous sexual predator and told the now grey haired Watkins: 'The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you.' Sally O'Neil QC told the court that Watkins had spared witnesses and jury members from taking part in what would have been a 'distressing' trial, but had not been given enough credit for his guilty plea. She said: 'This case causes a very . disturbing reaction for anyone who has has anything to do with it. We . accept these matters are very serious. Scroll down for video . Argument: Sally O'Neil QC had argued on Watkins's behalf that he had not been given enough benefit for pleading guilty . 'But by pleading guilty my client . averted the need for a most distressing and unpleasant trial for all . those concerned, especially a jury. 'He did not have to plead guilty and if he had done so the consequences would have been shocking. 'I . am not trying to minimise the gravity of these offences, just simply . make the observation that a sense of proportion needs to be maintained. 'These offences, however bad, are not the worst.' However, the appeal judges failed to be swayed by the argument and ruled they would not grant leave for appeal. Watkins' two female accomplices, who can only be referred to as Woman A and Woman B for legal reasons, were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively. Woman B also had her appeal bid turned down. Hearing: Court of Appeal judges (left - right) Mr Justice Griffith Williams, Lord Justice Pitchford and Mrs Justice Simler turned down his appeal and said his 29 year jail term had been appropriate . 'Shocking': Lord Justice Pitchford said that Watkins's offences had been of 'shocking depravity', and required a lengthy prison sentence . But Lord Justice Pitchford said the sentences handed to Watkins and his female accomplice were appropriate. Although . a full judgment will be handed down in writing next week, Lord . Pitchford said: 'These offences against children were of shocking . depravity...a very lengthy prison sentence was demanded.' The . Court of Appeal also said Watkins did not demonstrate that his 29 year . prison sentence was “not unduly manifestly excessive” and the sentencing . judge had “reached the appropriate conclusion”. Watkins was not present at the hearing and also chose not to appear from HMP Long Lartin via video link.

The plush Hymer van had been parked outside the family home in Oswestry, Shropshire when it went up in flames shortly after 4.50am today, causing one of two gas canisters on board to explode. The force of the blast, likened to a bomb, sent the canister hurtling into the air before it landed 100m away down the street, while the vehicle was completely destroyed in the blaze.

Before: A neighbour said the family had been preparing to take the Hymer van, pictured on Google Streetview before the blast, on holiday when it caught fire . Fire investigators were tonight treating the fire, which also spread to the porch and second floor window of the house, as a suspected arson attack. The owners of the motorhome, who had been preparing to take it on their summer holiday, were inside their home at the time of the explosion but managed to scramble to safety. 'It must have been about 5am when there was this almighty bang, like a bomb going off,' said Malcolm Parry, 70, who lives opposite the house. 'I looked outside the window and could see a huge fireball rising into the air. The flames were higher than the house and the motorhome was just engulfed in flames.

'I rushed out the front because I know the chap who lives there is called Taff and he was getting his motorhome ready to go away. 'Luckily I saw him running out the house. There were clouds of black smoke billowing up everywhere. I opened the door to get out and I could feel the heat then. 'A young lad was out passing on his way to work and he was on the phone ringing up the fire brigade. 'In about 10 minutes or so the flames were higher than the bungalow itself. It was a huge fire. 'It was lucky someone was coming along to see the fire when they did, or they might not have noticed it until it was much bigger. 'I spoke to the firefighters at the scene and they said it looked like a possible arson attack but it might be too early to tell for sure.' Destruction: One neighbour said he saw plumes of black smoke coming from the home, while another called the fire brigade . Probe: Fire investigators were tonight treating the fire, which also spread to the porch and second floor window of the house, as a suspected arson attack . The road was cordoned off for the rest of the morning while fire fighters from Oswestry, Ellesmere and Baschurch tackled the blaze and cleared up the area. 'There were two people in the property who both made their escape,' said Ian Leigh, Fire Service station manager and fire investigation officer for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service. 'They were awakened by two passers-by. 'The damage to the house is fairly significant. There’s damage to the front roof section and crews continue to work to make sure that’s as safe as possible. 'There were two gas cylinders, one of which exploded. We’ve got debris up to 100m away. 'It highlights how dangerous gas canisters can be when involved in a fire - they can go bang.' The fire service confirmed they were not ruling out an arson attack.","Hymer van was parked outside house as family prepared to take it on holiday .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The Man Booker prize longlist was revealed today with American authors in the running for one of literature's top honours for the first time. David Mitchell, David Nicholls and past winner Howard Jacobson are all among the authors vying for the prestigious award, as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to British writers. A rule change has now opened the award to more international writers, enabling Americans to be included for the first time with four U.S. authors among the list of 13 announced. In the running: David Mitchell (left) and David Nicholls (right) are among the authors vying for the prestigious Man Booker Prize, as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to British writers . The remaining places go to Australian Richard Flanagan and two Irish writers Joseph O’Neill - who lives in New York - and Niall Williams. They would have been eligible under the previous rules which allowed authors from the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland. Organisers of the UK’s best-known fiction award - worth £50,000 to the winner - announced last year they were opening up the 46-year-old prize to writers of any nationality writing in English. Among the Brits in contention is Paul Kingsnorth whose debut novel The Wake, written in his own made-up language based on Old English - was published by independent publisher Unbound after being financed through online crowdfunding. Past winner: Howard Jacobson, who won the Man Booker in 2010 for his novel The Finkler Question, has made the longlist again with his new work J . The . list features celebrated writer David Nicholls, whose novels One Day . and Starter For 10 were adapted into movie hits, with his latest work Us . earning him a place. David Mitchell - in the running for his book The Bone Clocks - and Ali Smith - represented by her novel How To Be Both - have each made the shortlist on two previous occasions. Jacobson, who won the Booker in 2010 for The Finkler Question, has made the 2014 longlist for his book J. The other British writer to be included by the six-strong judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, is Calcutta-born Neel Mukherjee for The Lives Of Others. Joshua Ferris (US) - To Rise Again at a Decent Hour . Richard Flanagan (Australia) - The Narrow Road to the Deep North . Karen Joy Fowler (US) - We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves . Howard Jacobson (Britain) - J . Paul Kingsnorth (Britain) - The Wake . David Mitchell (Britain) - The Bone Clocks . Neel Mukherjee (Britain) - The Lives of Others . David Nicholls (Britain) - Us . Joseph O’Neill (Ireland) - The Dog . Richard Powers (US) - Orfeo . Ali Smith (Britain) - How to Be Both . Niall Williams (Ireland) - History of the Rain . But it is the inclusion of American writers for the first time which will fuel much of the discussion about this year’s list. The tipped Donna Tartt book The Goldfinch failed to make it, but To Rise Again At A Decent Hour author Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler who wrote We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, Siri Hustvedt's The Blazing World and Orfeo by Richard Powers have all made the list. 'This is a diverse list of ambition, experiment, humour and artistry,' Mr Grayling said of the nominees. 'The novels selected are full of wonderful stories and fascinating characters. 'The judges were impressed by the high quality of writing and the range of issues tackled - from 1066 to the future, from a PoW camp in Thailand, to a dentist’s chair in Manhattan, from the funny to the deeply serious, sometimes in the same book.' The announcement last year that the Booker was dropping its geographical borders came in the wake of the launch of the Folio Prize - seen by many as a rival award - which attracted an international field. There were also changes to the number of books which publishers could enter. Jonathan Taylor, who chairs the Booker Prize Foundation, said: 'Our new model, in recognising literary achievement, should encourage the traditional publishing houses while ensuring novels from new green-shoot publishers continue to be included. Popular: The list features celebrated writer David Nicholls, whose novel One Day was adapted into a film starring Anne Hathaway (pictured), with his latest work Us earning him a place . 'By . including writers from around the world to compete alongside . Commonwealth and Irish writers, the Man Booker Prize is reinforcing its . standing as the most important literary award in the English-speaking . world.' Salman . Rushdie - who won the prize in 1981 for Midnight’s Children - said of . the expansion of entry: 'I think it’s a really great thing that finally . we’ve got an English-language prize that doesn’t make a distinction for . writers who are writing from a particular country.' Last year’s prize was won by New Zealander Eleanor Catton, who became the youngest victor at the age of 28 and her book The Luminaries, at 832 pages, was also the longest winner. Missing out: Donna Tartt's hotly tipped The Goldfinch failed to make the prize's longlist . Kingsnorth, a former deputy editor of The . Ecologist, has previously written non-fiction books which have included . an examination of the negative impact of globalisation as well as . poetry. He has said of The Wake: 'I constructed, . almost by accident, my own language: a middle ground between the Old . English that would have been spoken by these characters and the English . we speak today. 'The result is a book which is written in a tongue that no-one has ever spoken, but which is intended to project a ghost image of the speech patterns of a long-dead land: a place at once alien and familiar.' Bookmaker William Hill makes O’Neill the favourite to take the prize at 4/1, while Mitchell is the top British hope at 5/1 second favourite. It puts Flanagan at 6/1, Smith 7/1, Jacobson and Powers at 8/1, Fowler and Williams on 9/1, while Mukherjee and Nicholls are 10/1 and Ferris, Hustvedt and Kingsnorth are at 20/1. 'After all the fears about a US-dominated list, the number of British writers comes as a surprise, although the absence of any authors from Africa or Asia is perhaps the more striking aspect of the spread of nationalities,' said Jonathan Ruppin, of Foyles bookshops. 'The omissions of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch and Ian McEwan’s The Children Act are indications of what an outstanding year for fiction 2014 is turning out to be. 'I doubt anyone would have predicted the appearance of Karen Joy Fowler or David Nicholls, but their books are by no means the only longlisted ones with the potential to appeal to very broad readership.' He added: 'With more well-known than most years, sales should be very strong. David Mitchell will probably be the favourite, and he’d make a very deserving winner - but Richard Flanagan is probably the dark-horse bet.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . A couple were told their monthly electricity payments would be increasing from £87 to £53.5million after a computer error led to a power company sending them a £500million bill. Grandparents Nigel and Linda Brotherton were told by energy suppliers npower that they had run up the huge bill - and if they did not pay it off their monthly direct debit would rise to £53.5million. The problem arose when the couple's previous supplier, Scottish Power, installed a new meter at their 16th century home in the village of Roughlee, near Burnley, Lancashire. Scroll down for video . Ouch! Grandparents Nigel and Linda Brotherton . were told by energy suppliers npower that their monthly direct debit payments would be rising to . £53.5millionfrom August 5 this year . Error: Grandparents Nigel and Linda Brotherton were told by energy suppliers npower (pictured) they had run up a £500m bill . Their electrician connected one of the wires the wrong way round, so . that instead of recording the number or units used it didn’t register . any and continued showing zero. Mr Brotherton, 62, and his wife, 59, did not notice the problem as they paid their bill by direct . debit each month and were never asked to give a reading. However, after they switched suppliers to npower in May, a workman was sent round to read their meter. When . he entered a reading of 'zero', npower’s computer wrongly assumed the . dials must have gone all round the clock - and automatically flagged up . the huge bill. The Brothertons were told they didn’t need to do anything because the money would be taken automatically from their bank. But . accountant Mr Brotherton said: 'There was just one problem with that - I . didn’t quite have £53million in my current account at the time.' Cause: The problem came after Scottish Power, which has its headquarters (pictured) in Glasgow, installed a new meter at the couple's home - but it was wired incorrectly . Bizarrely, the online bill also showed that the couple had actually overpaid and were in credit by £1,362.69. Despite repeated phone calls to npower, and contacting the regulator Ofgen, the couple are still waiting for a refund and written confirmation they won’t have to fork out the £53,480,062.00 a month. 'It’s a good job they didn’t actually try to take all that money from my bank account,' Mr Brotherton said. 'Not only would it have gone way over my overdraft limit, but it could have brought down the bank and sparked another global financial crisis. 'The electricity board have admitted it is a mistake and told us we don’t need to pay the money but we are still waiting for the refund they owe us.' Alice Nutter, one of the notorious Pendle witches who was hanged 400 years ago, is reputed to have once lived in the couple’s historic cottage. 'Perhaps she put a curse on the meter,' joked Mr Brotherton. 'But if the electricity board doesn’t sort this out quick I’ll get her to put a curse on them and turn all their bosses into toads.' A spokesman for npower apologised yesterday and said: 'This was clearly a mistake. 'Mr Brotherton’s meter was incorrectly wired by his previous supplier and not npower, which had a knock-on effect to how we billed the account. 'His payments are set at £87, so no extra money will be taken and we have processed a refund which should be with Mr Brotherton on Tuesday.' A spokesman from Scottish Power told MailOnline he was looking into the incident.","Nigel and Linda Brotherton's electricity meter was wired incorrectly .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Two families ended up in a violent brawl after their 13-year-old daughters fell out in a playground row over One Direction tickets, a court heard. The families of Lucy Brough and Chloe Warley had previously been close, but after the teenagers argued at their school in Hessle, Hull, East Yorkshire, their parents fell out. The dispute eventually escalated into a street brawl between both sets of parents in which one was badly injured, and the three others later convicted of assault. Spat: Lee and Kerry Warley (left) were convicted of assault after a fight between their daughter Chloe, 13, and her friend Lucy Brough over One Direction tickets escalated and ended up in a brawl involving the couple and Lucy's parents Nicola (right) and Gary . Mrs Brough and her husband Gary (pictured) had decided . to go to Hessle High School for a meeting, hoping to resolve the . dispute between the girls but it didn't go well and the row between the families then escalated . Hull Crown Court was told that Lucy and Chloe had been good friends who attended dance classes together, but had become 'enemies' after a falling out. The court was not told the . origins of the playground squabble, but as it rumbled on insults were . traded and there was a row about tickets to a One Direction concert. Jane Bryan, prosecuting, said: 'Unfortunately, as often happens with 13-year-old girls, they fell out. 'They became enemies and were causing each other trouble at school. 'And because of the deterioration in the girls’ relationship, the families also fell out.' The dispute came to a head on June 5 last year when Lucy called her mother, Nicola Brough, 40, from school in 'immense distress'. Mrs Brough and her husband Gary decided to go to Hessle High School for a meeting, hoping to resolve the dispute, but it did not go well and they decided to take Lucy home. Scuffle: The court was not told the origins of the playground squabble, but as it rumbled on insults were traded and there was a row about tickets to a One Direction concert . However, Lucy wanted to go back to . school later that afternoon for a production of Beauty And The Beast and . as she and her mother arrived at the school gates they saw Chloe, and . the girls began fighting. Mrs Brough said she pushed both of the teenagers into a bush to break it up. However, Chloe then went home to tell her parents Lee and Kerry Warley, and all three got in their car and went to the Broughs’ home in Hessle, the court was told. Mr Brough was in the garden putting up some hanging baskets with a hammer, and 'before he knew it' the girls were fighting in the street, and their mothers fighting in the garden. He said he had tried to intervene, but was prevented from doing so by Mr Warley, who told him: 'Let them have it. It’s been coming for a while.' Action: When Mr and Mrs Warley (pictured) were told how Mrs Brough had pushed Chloe into a bush to break up a fight with Lucy, they rushed to the Broughs' home in Hessle . Assault: Mr Warley, 33, (right) from,west Hull, denied causing grievous bodily harm but admitted a lesser charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the second day of his trial . Mr Warley then took the hammer Mr Brough had been using and threw it over the house. Mr Brough told the court: 'The next thing I knew, I was seeing stars. I’d been punched.' The blow fractured his cheek and eye socket and cost him his job as a plant fitter because of the eight weeks he needed off work. 'I kind of blacked out for a couple of seconds,' he said. 'I’ve never felt pain like it before.' Mr . Warley, 33, from,west Hull, denied causing grievous bodily harm but . admitted a lesser charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on . the second day of his trial. He was given a three-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. Mrs Warley, 34, was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work for the assault on Mrs Brough. Mrs Brough was discharged conditionally for 12 months for the assault on Chloe. Sentencing Mr Warley, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'What a disgraceful day, wasn’t it, with more than one person involved? Sentence: Mr Warley was given a suspended prison sentence and told to carry out community service. His wife was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work, and Mrs Brough was given a conditional discharge . 'I very much hope there will now be peace restored, at least on the face of it, between these two families.' Mrs Brough told how she had bought One Direction tickets for her daughter and friends before Lucy and Chloe fell out. Speaking from her home today she said: 'The girls fell out after we'd bought tickets for the 1D concert. 'So we decided we didn't want their daughter to come along with us so we offered to buy their ticket from them. 'In the end we managed to swap some tickets so we didn't have to sit together so we all got to go.""I wouldn't mind but the girls don't even like 1D any more. They're into 5 Seconds of Summer now.' She added: 'But I much prefer David Cassidy.' Mrs Brough told how the girls became friends when they were just four years old after they went to the same ballet class together. The parents had also come close over the years and were also good friends, but this came to a head last year when the girls had a huge argument - bringing their parents into the fallout. Mrs Brough said the girls had argued about a number of issues and said they were still not reconciled.","Lucy Brough and Chloe Warley fell out and argued over concert tickets .

"By . Kelly Strange . and Lucy Crossley . A woman who was sold for sex by her own mother has revealed how she suffered a decade of rape from the age of five by men who would pay just £5. As a young girl the 48-year old from south London, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was subjected to sex with paedophiles, with her mother receiving money or alcohol in return. Even after she was taken into care the . abuse continued during weekend visits home and only stopped when . Claire* ran away for good at the age of 15. Speaking out: A woman (left) who was sold for sex by her own mother (right) has revealed how she suffered a decade of rape from the age of five . She remained silent about the abuse for years but suffered a breakdown aged 41 after learning more about her mother’s deplorable crime. It was only after her mother died that Claire felt brave enough to contact police and report what had happened. However, because her mother was dead no action could be taken and instead Claire . decided to talk about her shocking experiences to help other abuse . victims find a voice. Hidden torment: 'Claire' (right), pictured with her mother as a teenager, remained silent about her abuse for years . 'When I heard my mother had died I actually laughed,' she said. 'That might sound awful but words cannot describe the hatred and fear I had for that woman after what she forced me to do. ‘I remained frightened of her my whole life. I regret not reporting her while she was still alive because there can be no greater act of evil for a mother than to sell the body of her own daughter. ‘But it was only when she died that I felt free. The police couldn’t do anything of course but it felt like a weight had gone just to report it. ‘People think things like this don’t happen on our streets but I’m living proof and I want to use my story to save other children from a life like mine.’ Claire was just five years old when she remembers her mother taking her to a man for the first time. She had no idea of what was about to happen when her cruel mother ordered her to get dressed that day. 'I remember mum taking me to a block of flats and her knocking the door,' she said. 'She spoke to the man and then pushed me inside the door. ‘I was so young I just did what I was told. I knew it felt wrong but I was scared and confused and after he gave me a lollipop.’ After their encounter, the man sent Claire back outside to her mother on the street and she started to cry. ‘I remember mum telling me to stop sniveling. There was no comfort or emotion from her at all.’ Stolen innocence: Claire as a baby with her mother. Just a few years later the older woman would arrange for her daughter to be raped in return for money or alcohol . Relief: Claire found out in 2011 that her mother had died, and says she felt 'a huge sense of relief that she had gone' However, back at their council house it was . just the beginning as men started calling round more frequently to . abuse Claire and her sister Pauline*. Her . mother would allow them to take Claire and Pauline to a . disused factory behind their house where they would be raped in exchange for . payment. Claire said: 'Mum would just sneer at me after. I had no idea why she hated me so much. She barely fed us and made us sleep on the floor. I lived in fear of knocks at the door.' Cruel: Claire was just five years old when she remembers her mother (pictured) taking her to a man for the first time . Aged . seven she was taken into care and moved into a children’s home. Appallingly, while she was there she suffered even more abuse, but weekend visits home were . even more terrifying. On one occasion while she was being raped her mother remained in the room with her, and even told her daughter to be quiet when she screamed. It was only a matter of time before one of the sisters fell pregnant, with Pauline learning that she was expecting a baby at just 14. Desperation: Claire aged 15, just before she ran away from home in an attempt to escape her torment . 'When my sister fell pregnant we knew the father must have been . one of the men mum sold us too because neither of us had had any other . relationships,' Claire said. 'Despite that my sister wanted to keep the baby but mum forced her to give the child up for adoption.' Claire says she was so afraid that the same would eventually happen to her that when she was 15 she made the decision to run away, spending the first two weeks away from home sleeping rough in a public toilet. 'It was awful but no where near as bad as what I had left behind,' she said. Eventually she was offered a place to stay by a taxi driver she befriended. The couple soon fell in love and married when Claire was 19. They . went on to have six children together and Claire did her best to push . the horrors of her childhood to the back of her mind and focus on being a . good mother. 'My children were my . world, my everything,' she explained. 'Having them made it harder to understand how mum . could have treated us the way she did.' Claire refused to have anything to do with her mother, and came to suspect that her father was likely a punter who paid her mother for sex. She . said: 'I had nobody at all. Not having any parent was something I had . to come to terms with. But my children gave me all the love I needed and . I managed to move forward.' However, soon after she turned 40, Claire’s world was turned upside down when . she was introduced to the niece her sister had been forced to give up . all those years ago. She . explained she had tracked down her biological father who had admitted . paying her birth mother’s mother for sex with her daughter. Parent: Claire, pictured with one of her own children, suspects that her father was likely to have been a punter who paid her mother for sex . Shock: When she was 40, Claire, pictured with one of her own children, was introduced to the niece her sister had been forced to give up all those years ago . He had also revealed that Claire’s mother was herself working as a prostitute and known to sell her daughters for just £5 a time. The . sickening revelation brought the memories she had buried to . the surface and shortly after Claire suffered a breakdown. She was admitted to hospital and spent months recovering. Claire . said: ‘The baby my sister had been forced to give up had been adopted . by a wonderful loving family and that was the only good thing to come . out of it all. Motherhood: Claire and her husband went on to have six children together and Claire did her best to push the horrors of her childhood to the back of her mind and focus on being a good mother . Moving forward: Claire with her own daughter. She describes her children as the ;love and light of her life' ‘She was an incredible, beautiful, . bright young woman thanks to the adoptive parents that had raised her so . well but it was too painful to stay in touch with her. ‘I couldn’t cope with any reminders of my past and neither could my sister.’ As she recovered, Claire moved home from hospital but her marriage crumbled under the . strain. Years had passed when she heard her estranged mother was gravely . ill with heart problems. She . said: 'My brothers had remained in contact with her and urged me to . visit her before she died and because I needed answers I agreed to see . her. 'She was old and frail but I was still terrified of her.' Exploited: Now a mother herself, Claire says she can not forgive her own mother for what she did . Claire asked her mother outright why she had forced her to have sex with men but the older woman just laughed at her. 'I knew I wasn’t going to get what I needed so I just walked out and that was the last time I ever saw her,' said Claire. Months later in 2011 she heard her mother had died. 'I started to laugh because I felt a huge sense of relief that she was gone.' It was then she decided to go to police. 'I didn’t know if they could help me trace the men that had raped me but they said without mum it was impossible,' she said. 'They were very kind and sympathetic and I wished I had gone to them while she was still alive. She did attend her mother’s funeral, but not to mourn. 'I just needed to make sure she was really gone,' she explains. 'There is no way I could forgive her for what she did. She exploited me in the sickest way possible and I now realise she was not my mother. She was an abuser. 'My children are the love and light of my life and I can say with 100 per cent certainty I am nothing like her. 'But she should have paid the price for her crimes. I’m just sorry I didn’t find the strength to report her while she was still alive.' Claire now hopes to find peace by writing a book about her ordeal, which she hopes will help other victims find the courage to speak out. 'I regretted not acting sooner and in time I decided to start writing about what I had been through. I hope reading my story will help other victims make their voice heard. 'What she put us through was unspeakable. But it happened right here in out country and it saddens me to say it is probably happening to another child now. 'Victims need justice and I want my story to help other victims find that courage to go to the police.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A woman who was beaten so badly by her boyfriend that she needed a new nose has turned her life around since the vicious attack to become a beauty queen. Lacy Lund's nose was so badly broken in the attack at the hands of Dean Campbell, 22, that the 19-year-old from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, needed rhinoplasty to rebuild her face. Miss Lund's relationship ended soon after the attack, while her new look gave her so much confidence she has rebuilt herself as a beauty queen - and she hopes her story will help other domestic violence victims. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Lacy Lund's nose was so badly broken in the attack at the hands of her boyfriend that the 19-year-old needed rhinoplasty to rebuild her face. Her new look gave her so much confidence she has rebuilt herself as a beauty queen - and she hopes her story will help other domestic violence victims . 'It was so horrific being attacked by someone I’d fallen madly for, I didn’t see it coming,' she said. 'I remember the force he inflicted on my face, I felt my nose burst. 'I was shocked when the surgeons said they would completely re-build it. 'My ex left me completely broken on both the inside and out. 'But now, I’ve finally got my confidence back and I’m becoming a beauty queen - I’m determined to move on from this. 'I want to share my story to help other women who are victims of domestic violence.' 'I didn't see it coming': When the couple first met, Miss Lund was swept off her feet by Campbell (right), who showered her with gifts and flowers . Miss Lund said she had been at a friend's birthday party when Campbell, who had been drinking, arrived and became abusive towards both Miss Lund and fellow guests. She said she wanted to leave, only for Campbell to take her to his home where he hit her. After the attack, Miss Lund was rushed to hospital where surgeons revealed the full damage to her nose. 'Doctors told me I would need surgery and a brand new nose,' she said. 'My nose was too badly broken, with the cartilage hanging off - it was the only option - but I would have to wait a year before it could be operated on. 'I had to live with the nose that was a constant reminder of the attack. 'It was a long wait but it was well worth it. 'When I walked out of surgery with my new nose I felt like a completely new person and a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. 'I have been finally able to live my life again and move on from what happened. 'My new nose gave me such a confidence boost.' However, Miss Lund says she was left mentally scarred by the attack at the hands of her violent ex-boyfriend. The teenager had been swept off her feet by Campbell, who showered her with gifts and flowers. Campbell . appeared at Grimsby Magistrates Court last summer where he admitted . assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was handed a community order . and a £250 fine. 'I met Dean when I was 16 when I was . out with some friends and it was his 20th birthday,' said Miss Lund, who . works as a fish packer. 'We spoke all night and got on like a house on fire, I didn’t hear from him the next day but out of the blue he contacted me. 'Our . relationship started then, he would tell me everything I wanted to . hear, sent me flowers and champagne and seemed like the perfect . gentleman. Damaged: Doctors told her that her nose would need to be rebuilt - but she had to wait a year for her operation . 'My parents worried from the start, especially my mum, she was concerned when Dean refused to meet them. 'The longer I was with him the more people warned me he was bad news, but I was under his spell and he was my sweetheart.' The couple were together for six months before Campbell’s behaviour began to change. Miss Lund said: 'He would call me names, towards the end I even felt like he stopped me seeing friends and family. 'I always felt guilty if I did something without him or I was happy for any reason. 'But still I wanted to save him, I thought I’d be able to change him but I was wrong. Confidence: Following her surgery, Miss Lund found the confidence to begin to rebuild her life and go out with her friends. She was then approached about becoming a model . New life: After she was asked if she had ever modelled during a night out, Miss Lund went on to enter the Miss Hull beauty pageant . 'The night when he attacked me I just kept thinking about my mum, I really thought I was going to die. 'I felt so small and useless I couldn’t stop him, he was so heavy and forceful. 'I remember feeling a huge blow to my face and my nose felt like it burst.' The force of the blow to Miss Lund's face left her with a badly broken nose. 'He . seemed so nice in the beginning with great prospects, a good job, great . hobbies, good looks, I just don’t know what happened. 'I was rushed to hospital where I was treated for my injuries, and doctors broke the news about my nose.' Support: Miss Lund with her mother Michelle (left) - who had been worried about her teenage daughter's relationship with Campbell . Close bond: Miss Lund with her mother. The 19-year-old says she hopes to help other victims of domestic violence by sharing her story . After recovering from surgery, Miss Lund found the confidence to start rebuilding her life, and was approached by a model scout during a night out with friends. 'I’d . finally decided I couldn’t let the attack and surgery hold me back . anymore so I agreed to go out with my friends,' she said. 'It was one of the first times I’d been out, and a woman come up to me and asked me if I’d ever considered modelling before. 'I couldn’t believe it, it was such a confidence boost. After that, I went onto enter the Miss Hull beauty pageant. In the spotlight: Miss Lund says she hopes to continue modelling, and that she is lucky to be able to 'get up on stage and smile' 'It’s been amazing.' Miss Lund says she hopes her experiences will give courage to other woman under threat from abusive relationships. 'Now, I want to share my story to help other vulnerable women to speak about domestic violence,' she said. 'Just talk to someone before it’s too late. I want to continue modelling but I also aspire to help other women one day with my story, I want them to find the confidence I have.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A woman has won a six-year fight to have the name of the man she thought was her father removed from her birth certificate after he admitted in an argument she was conceived using donor sperm. Paramedic Emma Cresswell, 26, and her two brothers had grown up in Northampton thinking that their mother's former partner Geoffrey Faint was their father. However, during an argument with Mr Faint when the triplets were 19 he told them they had been conceived using donor sperm. Ruling: Paramedic Emma Cresswell, 26, has become the first donor-conceived person in Britain to have the name of the man she thought was her father removed from her birth certificate . Now, after a six-year legal battle, Miss Cresswell has become . the first donor-conceived person in Britain to have the name of her 'social father' removed from her birth certificate. Miss Cresswell managed to persuade a district judge at Bristol County Court to allow her to have a new certificate with a blank space where Mr Faint's name was, and change her surname to that of her mother's maiden name. The ruling could pave the way for the 70,000 people conceived using donor sperm or eggs to do the same, and has sparked debate over whether both a child's genetic and legal parentage should be included on birth certificates. Miss Cresswell's mother Susan and Mr Faint had turned to artificial insemination using donated sperm after they struggled to conceive naturally. Miss Cresswell and her brothers, Ben and Daniel, were born in April 1988, but soon afterwards the couple's relationship broke down, with the children raised by their mother. Legal fight: Miss Cresswell persuaded a district judge at Bristol County Court to allow her to have a new birth certificate with a blank space where Mr Faint's name was, and change her surname to that of her mother's maiden name . Figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) for 2010 show in that year there were 547 babies born in the UK after donor insemination, from 513 births. In August 1991 the register of fertility treatments, donors and recipients held by the HFEA was introduced, and children born after this date can be given non-identifying information about their donors after they turn 16. This information includes physical description, ethnicity, and how . many children they had at the time of donation - although not every . donor will have provided this information. Prior to this date, records for parents' treatments would most likely have been destroyed, although they were unlikely to have contained details about the donor used. People born before 1991 via donation, or those who donated, can sign up to The Donor Conceived Register to exchange information with, or contact one another. On reaching 16, children born after April 2005 can find out information including the donor's name, date of birth and last known address, as well as medical history. The first donor conceived person entitled to find out this information will turn 16 in 2022. Anonymity . was removed because it was  recognised by law that many donor-conceived . people have a desire and a right to find out about where they came . from. Sperm donors should be between 18 and 41-years-old and must undergo screening tests before donating in order to reduce the risk of passing on hereditary diseases or conditions. Payment of donors is prohibited, although donors can receive compensation of up to £35 per clinic vist to cover losses such as travel. Donors who donate through a HFEA-licensed clinic are not the legal parent of any child born as a result of donation, have no legal obligation to that child, will not be named on the birth certificate, will have no rights over how the child will be brought up, and will not be asked to support the child financially. When Miss Cresswell was a teenager she began to rebuild her relationship with Mr Faint, and moved in with him so she could be closer to college. However, during an argument with Mr Faint after her first day at Coventry University, where she was studying paramedic science, she and her brothers learned the truth about how their parentage. 'In the middle of an argument, Geoff decided to tell one of my brothers and me that we were actually donor-conceived and that he wasn't our father,' she told The Sunday Telegraph, adding his confession had come as a shock. She is now estranged from Mr Faint and began using her mother's maiden name soon after the argument. 'I had thought I was one person for so long and then I found out that a . whole side of that wasn't true. So I changed my name to represent who I . actually was,' she said. Children born via donor sperm or eggs after 1991, the year in which the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority was set up, can be provided with non-identifying information about their sperm donor, while children born after 2005 can get identifying information once they turn 16. However, unlike changes to adoption law allowing children to get information about their parentage, the 1991 and 2005 rulings were not applied retrospectively, meaning Miss Cresswell has been unable to find out the identity of her biological father. She said that, unlike her brothers, she was uncomfortable at having to produce her birth certificate containing Mr Faint's name, as she did not feel any connection to him. Miss Cresswell was assisted in her legal battle by assisted reproduction expert Dr Marilyn Crawshaw and research consultant Julia Feast, who works with the British Association for Adoption and Fostering. Her mother and Mr Faint had to submit documents to the county court confirming they had used artificial insemination, before the judge agreed the change could be made in June last year. Like Dr Crawshaw and Ms Feast, Miss Cresswell is a member of the Birth Registration campaign, and believes that birth certificates should show whether a baby was conceived naturally or not, as it would encourage parents to be more open as to their child's heritage. She says that had her birth certificate contained such details, her mother and Mr Faint may have spokem to her about the donor earlier, and she might not have found out during an argument. 'If you tell them from the beginning, that can be a part of a stable family relationship,' she said.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Pay hike: West Midlands Ambulance Service chief executive Anthony Marsh is now earning £232,000 a year, getting an extra £50,000 for taking on East of England Ambulance Service . An ambulance boss is now earning £232,000 a year after landing himself a £50,000 pay rise for taking on another service. West Midlands Ambulance Service chief executive Anthony Marsh gets the extra money as he now splits his time working for East of England Ambulance Service. The additional pay means he now earns almost £90,000 more than the Prime Minister's £142,500 salary. West Midlands Ambulance Service has . defended Dr Marsh's pay, saying it was cheaper than the cost of hiring . another boss to run one of the organisations full time. However, Tom Watson, Labour MP for West Bromwich . East, has criticised the Government for giving public servants 'banker style' increases. 'This man is probably the highest paid public servant in the West Midlands and nobody has ever heard of him,' Mr Watson said. 'He is receiving banker style top-ups to his huge salary whilst taxpayers are struggling to pay their monthly bills. 'It's not fair, it's not right and ministers should stop it.' Dr Marsh took over the troubled East of England Ambulance Service, which serves a population of 5.8million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, at the beginning of 2014. He had initially been commissioned to write a report because of . concerns over its performance, and had recommended cutting back on . management to pay for more emergency crew. In a statement, West Midlands Ambulance Trust, which covers 5.3 . million people Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, . West Midlands and Worcestershire, said paying Dr Marsh to perform both . roles saved the taxpayer approximately £130,000 on the cost of a having a substantive Chief Executive in each ambulance trust. 'Mr Marsh is now responsible for the running of both organisations, . doing the job of two Chief Executives,' said the statement. 'He is not, however, earning the . salaries of two Chief Executives. On average, Mr. Marsh works at least . 70 hours a week to ensure both areas receive his full attention.' The spokesman added that West . Midlands and East of England Ambulance Services have a combined . workforce of almost 9,000 staff, answer approximately 6,000 999 calls . every day and cover an area of over 12,000 square miles. New role: Dr Marsh took over the troubled East of England Ambulance Service, which serves a population of 5.8million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, at the beginning of 2014 . Dr Marsh started his career in the Ambulance Service in 1987, working his way up to chief executive level at the Essex Ambulance Service, before coming to the West Midlands in 2006, and taking over at the EEAST at the start of 2014. The EEAST has been accused of poor performance, which may have contributed to . patients' deaths, while a report this year found that its response times . were unacceptably slow. Figures from 2011, which were released in June, rated the service as the worst in the country for response times of 36 minutes or longer for top priority calls. The trust also came in for criticism in April, when it was revealed that nearly £250,000 had been spent on PR staff to respond to criticism and promote the service's image. Earlier this year, NHS figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 'serious incidents' since April 2010. Of . those, 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - . although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths. After . the trust was publicly criticised by MPs at a Parliamentary hearing, . five non-executive directors resigned and new plans to improve the . service were put into place. Areport in January concluded that the service had got better in some . ways, but ruled that its response times were still unacceptably poor. After taking over Dr Marsh announced . that more ambulances would be introduced and resources shifted from the . back office to frontline services. The trust's total budget came to £226million during the fiscal year 2012/13. 'East . of England Ambulance Service was a failing trust. Since his appointment . as interim Chief Executive, Mr. Marsh has brought in brand new . frontline vehicles and almost 400 new staff. The organisation has turned . a corner,' said the West Midlandsspokesman. 'West Midlands Ambulance Service is meeting its . performance targets this year in very difficult circumstances and . despite massive increases in demand. The West Midlands Trust is . regularly seeing demand at 10 per cent above that commissioned, but the trust is . still performing thanks to the hard work of staff. 'For 2014-15, . Anthony Marsh’s total salary for his work at West Midlands Ambulance . Service and East of England Ambulance Service is £232.226. This includes . the £50,000 uplift for his additional duties for the East of England . trust. 'By comparison, within the same two areas, there are 11 Chief Fire Officers and ten Chief Constables.' Only a handful of Whitehall civil servants were paid more than Dr Marsh's salary in the past year. Sir David Nicholson, the former chief exec of the entire NHS, was on between £255,000 and £259,999. Others include cabinet secretary and Had of the Civil Service Gus O'Donnell who was on between £235,000 and £239,999.","West Midlands Ambulance Service chief executive Anthony Marsh earns £90,000 more than the Prime Minister .

A motorist who abandoned this luxury Ferrari after losing control of the supercar during a police chase and ploughing it into a pile of rubble was being hunted by officers today. Other cars had to swerve to avoid a head on crash with the Ferrari F430 as it lurched across the road into oncoming traffic, before smashing into a construction site. The driver then allegedly fled the scene of the crash, which took place on a road between Prelouci and Pardubice in the east of the Czech Republic, and caused more than £20,000 worth of damage. Supercar-nage: The driver of this Ferrari F430 fled the scene after crashing the supercar into a pile of rubble during a police chase . Prior to the crash, the car had been involved in a late-night police chase, and it is thought the driver lost control of the vehicle during heavy rain. With the black car lodged atop a pile of rubble, and large parts of its front torn away in the impact of the collision, the driver abandoned the vehicle, prompting a police search. 'The driver doesn't appear to be injured as he ran off after crashing,' said spokesman Eva Maturova. 'A tracker dog picked up his trail, but then lost it after a few metres because of the weather conditions.' Hunt: With the black car lodged atop a pile of rubble, and large parts of its front torn away in the impact of the collision, the driver abandoned the vehicle, prompting a police search . Ms Maturova added that a sample of blood picked up by the dog turned out to have belonged to a worker who had cut his hands working on the construction site a short while earlier. Police have not disclosed if the driver was the owner of the car, or if it had been stolen. The F430 model was unveiled during the 2004 Paris Motor Show, and was in production until 2009 when the Italian car giants replaced it with the 458 Italia. When new, the car cost around £119,500 in Britain, and was capable of reaching speeds of 196mph, and accelerating from 0 to 100km per hour in 4.4 seconds thanks to its 4.3litre V8 engine. In February 2009, Ferrari recalled around 1,950 convertible Spider  F430s made between 2005 and 2007 due to fears that heat from the engine could cause the soft top hydraulic hoses to fracture and leak flammable fluid onto engine.","Black Ferrari F430 swerved across road in heavy rain during police chase .

"By . Lucy Crossley . This is the moment a student gave his mother the surprise of her life by telling her about the degree he had secretly studied for over four years just minutes before he graduated. Support worker Liam Blair kept the fact he was studying for a psychology degree at Dundee University from his mother Rhonda, constructing an entire fictional identity to cover his tracks. The 31-year-old eventually came clean after taking his mother out to lunch and changing into his graduation gown in a pub bathroom before revealing he was graduating that afternoon. Scroll down for video . Shock: This is the moment Rhonda Blair, 56, learned that her son Liam, 31, had been secretly studying for a degree, and was about to graduate . Secretive: Support worker Liam Blair kept the fact he was studying for a psychology degree at Dundee University from his mother, and constructed an entire fictional identity to cover his tracks . Proud moment: Ms Blair cries in disbelief as her son, dressed in his graduation gown, reveals his big secret . Mr Blair's confession was captured on video camera, as was his mum's shocked, but delighted expression. The secrecy started with a decision not to tell Ms Blair that he was applying for the course at Dundee University. But as his studies continued he decided not to tell her, and as the situation snowballed Mr Blair found himself living a bizarre double life - even telling his mother he was working at a fish factory in Perth. 'Originally it was just until I was accepted but then it just went on,' he said. Plot: Mr Blair filmed the surprise on YouTube, and the clip starts with him explaining how he had kept his degree a secret for the past four years .

Disbelief: Ms Blair initially did not believe her son, and thought he had been playing a joke on her . 'The lies got more convoluted. I said that I was working, in many different jobs, and staying in a hotel in Perth.' Mr Blair said he struggled to hide the truth from his mother, particularly when she arranged to meet him in Perth - as in reality he was living in a flat in Dundee - or asked him questions about his fictional colleagues. After four years of pretence Mr Blair, of Crieff, came clean to his mother on his graduation day last month and posted footage of the big reveal on YouTube.

His former craft and design teacher at Crieff High School, John McGarry, was in on the secret and provided one of the references Mr Blair needed for his university application. Mr McGarry often met Ms Blair at the recycling centre where he now works and found it hard to maintain his vow of silence. 'Crieff is a small place and everyone tends to know each others’ business,' said Mr McGarry. 'Liam was in contact with me throughout the course and I never thought he would manage to keep the secret for four years. 'She hadn’t a clue about what he was doing until the last month when, under the pretext of him treating her to lunch, he sprung the surprise that it was his graduation.' Ms Blair said tonight that her son had tricked her into going to Dundee, telling her that they would be celebrating her birthday a week early.

She also revealed that Mr Blair's younger sister Dawn Menzies, 24, had been in on the secret because half way through his course she was also accepted at Dundee University where she is studying community health nursing. 'He’d told me he was working in a fish factory in Perth,' said Ms Blair. 'I think the reason he didn’t tell me at the start was that he’d been to college before for three years after he left school, but dropped out to concentrate on his music - he’s a very talented electric guitarist. 'So when he tried again he kept it a secret just so he could see my face. It worked - I was absolutely shocked.' Liam’s grandmother, Agnes Garrow, 78, said: 'Rhonda was amazed - for four years she’d been saying ""all that education, and he’s wasting it working in a fish factory"".

"By . Lucy Crossley . HMS President (1918), one of the last remaining First World War warships, has been transformed with a 'camouflage' paint job by a German artist to mark the centenary of the start of the conflict. The anti-submarine ship's makeover was inspired by dazzle camouflage, in which glaring colours and geometric shapes were used to mislead enemy U-boat captains during the First World War. Artist and sculptor Tobias Rehberger transformed the boat, which is permanently moored on the Thames, near the Victoria Embankment, as part of the 14-18 NOW project, a cultural programme commemorating the war. Paint job: HMS President, one of the last remaining First World War warships, has been transformed with a 'camouflage' paint job by a German artist to mark the centenary of the start of the conflict . Artist: Tobias Rehberger (pictured) transformed the boat, which is permanently moored on the Thames, near the Victoria Embankment, as part of the 14-18 NOW project . Design: The anti-submarine ship's makeover was inspired by dazzle camouflage, in which glaring colours and geometric shapes were used to mislead enemy U-boat captains during the First World War . Also called razzle dazzle, or dazzle painting, dazzle camouflage was used not to conceal British and American ships, but to make it difficult for the enemy to estimate their range, speed and route. Each ship was given a different dazzle pattern so that German attackers would struggle to determine the class of vessel. As one of the last three surviving First World War Royal Navy warships, HMS President (1918) was itself . painted in dazzle camouflage during the conflict, when it was . deployed as a submarine hunter tracking down German U-boats. Designer: Rehberger, who has used similar visual techniques in his previous works, has designed a new unique pattern for the ship, which was revealed today . Historic: As one of the last three surviving First World War Royal Navy warships, HMS President (1918) was itself painted in dazzle camouflage during the conflict . Artwork: The ship has been covered entirely in 'dazzle camouflage' print as part of the 14-18 NOW special commissions programme to mark the centenary of the First World War . Dazzle camouflage, used during the First World War, was an example of the collaboration of art with national defence. Inspired . by cubist and vorticist artworks, painter Norman Wilkinson proposed . painting ships with jagged stripes and lines in a bid to cut down on the . number lost to the Germans. Although the camouflage did not actually disguise the ships, it distorted their shape when seen from far away. This . made it harder for the Germans to work out how fast they were sailing . and in which direction, reducing the accuracy of their guns. A . total of 2,000 ships from the Royal Navy and the U.S. fleet were . repainted in a dazzle design in 1917 and 1918, with each one being . unique so the Germans could not identify classes of ship by their . markings. The camouflage fell out of favour by the 1940s, because it was rendered useless by the introduction of radar. Dazzle camouflage was originally inspired by modernist artworks, making it a poignant choice for the national art project. Now Rehberger, who has used similar visual techniques in his previous works, has designed a new unique pattern for the ship, which was revealed today. 'One of the most . respected European artists of his generation, Rehberger is a German . sculptor whose work blurs the boundaries between design, sculpture, . furniture-making and installation,' said a 14-18 Now spokesman. 'These eye-catching vessels remind . local people and visitors of the crucial role ships played in the . country’s wartime survival.' HMS President (1918) was one of two ships given a dazzle makeover as part of the project, which aims to acknowlege the contribution made by artists during the war. The other vessel is the historic pilot ship, the Edmund Gardner, which is docked in Liverpool, and has been decorated by Venezuelan artist Carlos Cris-Diez. 'Perceptions of the war have been shaped . to a great extent by the artists of the time, including poets, writers, . painters, sculptors, photographers and film-makers, many of whom served, . and who reflected on the war and its effects,' said the spokesman. 'Their work had a profound and lasting impact. 'Now, . one hundred years later, we are inviting contemporary artists from the . UK and around the world to explore the resonance of the First World War . today.' Other . initiatives run by 14-18 NOW include a letter-writing project and an . hour's darkness across the UK on the night of the centenary. Razzle dazzle: HMS President (1918) was one of two ships given a dazzle makeover as part of the project, which aims to acknowledge the contribution made by artists during the war . Eye-catching: A passerby stops to photograph WWI warship HMS President (1918) which has become a public art work on London's Embankment . The .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Tragedy: Aaron Dugmore, nine, was found hanged after he was sent to his room following an argument with his younger brother, an inquest heard . A nine-year-old boy was found hanged after he was sent to his room following an argument with his younger brother, an inquest heard. Aaron Dugmore was found by his 16-year-old older brother in his bedroom in Erdington, Birmingham on February 12, last year and although he was taken to hospital he died the following day. A coroner today ruled that Aaron's death had been an accident, as she could not be sure if the the schoolboy had intended to kill himself, and he was too young to know what he was doing. At the time of his death, Aaron's mother Kelly-Marie Dugmore, 30, and stepfather Paul Jones, 43, said he had been teased for being white by Asian bullies at school. However an inquest at Birmingham Coroners Court heard today that police had found no evidence of any bullying at Erdington Hall Primary School, Birmingham, where Aaron had recently started. The hearing was told that on the night he died, Aaron had argued and kicked his younger brother, before being sent to his room. Giving evidence, Ms Dugmore told the court of the circumstances leading up to Aaron's death. 'I collected him from school at 3.20pm,' she said. 'When . I arrived he had a bit of an argument with another boy at the school, . there was a bit of pushing and shoving and I called him away. 'We went home and he was just not happy, he had not been happy since he had been at that school any way. 'He asked if he could have some sweets and I said I didn't have any change and he could have some after tea. 'When we got home he asked me if he could go and play outside, but I said he couldn't, it was snowy and cold. 'He wasn't happy, he argued with (his younger brother) and kicked him in the leg, I told him to go upstairs to calm down. 'I carried on making tea, I was making his favourite. His brother went upstairs to check on him and said he was asleep. 'I . gave the other children their tea and then send (his older brother) to get him, I . didn't want him sleeping now and staying up all night and causing . trouble at school. Cirmcumstances: An inquest in Birmingham heard that Aaron, right, had argued and kicked his younger brother before being sent to his room . '(The brother) went upstairs and I could hear him screaming ""what have you done""?.' Ms Dugmore said she had initially thought Aaron had messed up his room, or broken his phone, but when she went upstairs she discovered what had really happened. 'I was trying to get breath into him and we were waiting for the ambulance to come,' she said. 'He had never mentioned harming himself before, you never think a nine year old child would know about that. 'I considered that maybe one of the children at the school told him to do something.' Dr Nicholas Hunt, a forensic surgeon . told the court Aaron had died of a hypoxic-ischemic brain injury at . Birmingham Children's Hospital. 'We were given evidence that he suffered from learning difficulties.' he said. 'There were no signs of natural illness that may have contributed to his death.' At . the time of Aaron's death Ms Dugmore had raised suspicions that her son . had been bullied, and that it made her 'feel sick to my stomach'. His family also said Aaron had been threatened with a plastic knife by one Asian pupil - who warned him: 'Next time it will be a real one.' Parents: The coroner said that Aaron's mother Kelly-Marie Dugmore, 30, (left) and stepfather Paul Jones, 43, (right) had done all they could to save Aaron . However, Detective . Inspector Richard Scott, from West Midlands Police, told the hearing that an . investigation into Aaron's death had found no suspicious circumstances, and no evidence of bullying. 'We carried out videoed interviews with the family and everyone was consistent with their account,' he said. 'We visited the school and there were some reports of a number of incidents with different individuals. 'But our investigation found they were dealt with appropriately and there was no evident of systematic bullying.' According . to staff at the school, where 75 per cent of pupils come from ethnic . minority backgrounds. he had already 'settled in quickly' with his . classmates after joining the previous September. The school, which caters for 450 pupils aged three to 11, received an 'inadequate' rating by Ofsted inspectors last year. Coroner . for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt said she could not be sure . Aaron had meant to kill himself - because he was too young to know what . he was doing. Recording a verdict of accidental death, she said: 'His mother and step father tried everything they could. Probe: Police found no evidence of any bullying at Erdington Hall Primary School, Birmingham, where Aaron had recently started . 'That must have been difficult I give you call credit for what you tried to do. 'Birmingham Children's Hospital managed to successfully resuscitate him, probably as a result of the actions you took. 'By that time it was already confirmed there was damaged due to oxygen starvation. 'In order to consider suicide I have to be sure he meant to take his own life. 'I am not sure of those facts. It seems to me a boy I that age could not know the consequence of his actions. 'A verdict of accidental death would be suitable.' Addressing Aaron's parents, she added: 'His death was a tragedy, it is clear to see what effect it has had on you.' Speaking after the today's hearing, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Following Aaron's death, police carried out a thorough investigation and took a number of statements from the school but no evidence of any bullying was found.' Jane Held, Independent Chair of Birmingham's Safeguarding Board, said: 'This was a tragedy for Aaron and his family. 'Our heartfelt sympathies go to his family and all who knew him. 'Whilst the Board has nearly completed a Serious Case Review we are waiting for the details from the inquest before completing it as we could not pre-empt the Coroner's findings. 'After completion, we will share the report with Aaron's family and will consider how best to use the findings to help other children and families so they don't have to face a similar tragedy.'","Aaron Dugmore, nine, from Erdington, Birmingham, died in February 2013 .

"By . Sara Smyth . and Luke Salked . and Lucy Crossley . Ryan Matthews, pictured centre, has been remanded in custody accused of the murder of healthcare worker Sharon Wall . A man has been remanded in custody accused of the murder of a healthcare assistant who died after being stabbed while at work in a psychiatric hospital. Ryan Matthews, 61, of Wotton Lawn hospital, Horton Road, Gloucester, faced magistrates in Cheltenham charged with Sharon Wall's murder. He spoke only to confirm his name, address, date of birth and that he understood the charge he faces during the three minute hearing. Matthews is accused of the murder of Ms Wall on July 9 at the hospital, which is run by the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust. The court heard that as the charge was so serious, the case and any bail application could only be dealt with at the Crown Court. Emma Davies, representing Matthews, did not make any representations on her client's behalf. No formal plea was entered and Matthews, who was wearing black t-shirt, was remanded in custody to appear at Gloucester Crown Court before Mr Justice Teare on July 15. Peter Martin, chairman of the bench, told him: 'Mr Matthews, you have heard what has been said. You are being sent for trial at the Crown Court sitting on July 15. 'You should be there for 9.30am. Do you understand.'Matthews replied: 'Yes.' Ms Wall, 53, died in hospital shortly after being stabbed in the back at Wotton Lawn Hospital on Wednesday. The family of the grandmother-of-two, . from Tuffley, Gloucester, have issued a statement saying: 'We would . like to thank everyone for their support and such kind words that have . been said about Sharon. 'She was nothing less than one in a . million and to say that she will be missed is an understatement. 'We . would ask for people to respect our privacy and allow us to grieve for . her at this difficult time.' Ms Wall lived alone in Tuffley, around three miles from the unit. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've lived here for 12 years and she was here then. 'She was caring - especially with animals. We both had lurchers and that's how we got talking. 'When mine got run over she came to the vets with me. She took in stray cats too. The neighbour added: 'I feel sorry for her family going through this.' Tragedy: . A 61-year-old man has been charged with murder after Sharon Wall was . stabbed to death at the Wotton Lawn psychiatric hospital . The 88-bed Wotton Lawn facility, in . Gloucester, has a low-security unit for male patients who have a history . of serious mental illness and must be kept in a secure environment. An . intensive care unit at the hospital has ten individual en-suite . bedrooms, to which patients are referred for short periods of time. Ms Wall would have been responsible for washing, dressing and feeding patients, as well as taking them to the toilet. Last night the Health Secretary Jeremy . Hunt said: ‘The events in Gloucestershire are devastating and our . thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of the staff member . involved.’ A . Gloucestershire police spokesman were called . at around 7.30am on July 9 to Wotton Lawn Hospital following reports that a woman had been stabbed.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A huge recovery mission was underway tonight after a Cambodian air force helicopter crashed into a flooded rice field, killing all on board. Two generals who led the force's helicopter unit and two pilots died in the crash, which happened in a village around six miles south of the capital Phnom Penh this morning. Cambodia's defence minister Tea Banh, who rushed to . the crash site in a muddy lake surrounded by rural land and rice fields, said a fifth person . who had been on board the aircraft was seriously injured. Recovery mission: Rescue workers gather around a part of a crashed helicopter retrieved from the site where Cambodian air force helicopter crashed, killing four of those on board . General . Um Phy, deputy chief of staff of Cambodia's air force, confirmed the . casualty count and said the aircraft was a Chinese-made Z-9 helicopter. Authorities had previously said five people were killed. It . was not immediately clear what caused the accident, which police said had occurred during a training mission for new pilots. More than six hours after the . crash, only two bodies had been recovered, and divers were still . looking for the other two. According to Phnom Penh deputy police chief Chuon Nari, one of the dead men was a major general while the other was a  brigadier general. Search: Rescue workers dive into the muddy lake where they helicopter crashed as they conduct a search operation . Circumstances: It was not immediately clear what caused the accident, which police said had occurred during a training mission for new pilots . An incident report filed by police at the scene said the generals were the commander and deputy commander of the helicopter unit, and the other two men were pilots. Military officials confirmed the men's ranks, but not their positions. The survivor has not yet been identified. Defense Ministry Secretary of State Moeung Samphan said 300 military personnel were sent to take part in the recovery operation. Chhay Bunna, chief of police at Phnom Penh's nearby international airport, said the flight had been a training exercise, while Tea Banh said the area where the crash took place has been used for similar purposes for several years without incident. One witness said she saw helicopters flying the same route almost every day, but the doomed flight seemed to be flying lower than usual, and had almost struck her house in Prey Sar village. Ath Neang, 48, who lives just a few yards from the small lake, said that as one of the craft's rotor blades hit the bank, one man jumped out into the water. At about the same time, she heard what sounded like an explosion from the aircraft, which then sank in the murky water.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Shamed: Rolf Harris, pictured arriving for his sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court, was reportedly fast-tracked to a softer prison instead being held at Wandsworth . Disgraced Rolf Harris was reportedly fast-tracked to a 'soft' prison in Oxfordshire, and did not spend a single night in tougher Wandsworth amid suggestions he was given preferential treatment. It had been expected that the shamed entertainer would go to tough Wandsworth Prison in south west London after he was sentenced to five years and nine months behind bars for a string of sex attacks. However, the 84-year-old was taken straight to the softer HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults - prompting speculation he had been given special treatment. Harris's prison sentence has already raised eyebrows. He could be out in less than three years, and  following complaints from the public, the new Attorney General Jeremy Wright will . investigate whether it is too lenient. At the time of his sentencing, it was believed that Harris was taken to a healthcare unit in London’s Wandsworth . prison – where fellow convicted paedophile Max Clifford also had a cell . after he was jailed for eight years in May for indecent assault. He had been expected to spend several weeks at Wandsworth for assessment, before potentially being moved elsewhere. However, it has now been claimed that Harris did not spend a single night in the category B prison and was instead taken to Bullingdon, a category B/C prison near Bicester, which is known for its work with older prisoners. A source told The People newspaper that Harris starting his jail stretch at Bullingdon was unusual, as prisoners were usually moved their later on in their sentences as a reward for good behaviour. 'If you're convicted of a serious crime at Southwark Crown Court, you'd always get sent to Wandsworth, no questions asked,' the source said. Scroll down for video . Softer: Harris was taken straight to the softer HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire (pictured) after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults - prompting speculation he had been given special treatment . Held: Harris was taken to Bullingdon, a category B/C prison near Bicester, which is known for its work with older prisoners . 'There . should be no special treatment on grounds of age and there is a . hospital at Wandsworth so even prisoners in poor health can be treated . there.' Currently around . 1,000 prisoners are held at Bullingdon, which opened in 1995, compared . with the 1,900 at Wandsworth, which was built during the Victorian era . and once held inmates including Charles Bronson, Great Train Robber . Ronnie Biggs, and Ronnie Kray. It . is also where former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne started his sentence . for perverting the course of justice, having been sent there from . Soutwark Crown Court, before he was moved to HMP Leyhill in . Gloucestershire. The . source suggested Harris was sent to the smaller institution to make it . easier for guards to observe him, and potentially prevent attacks from . other inmates. Institution: At the time of his sentencing, it was believed that Harris was taken to a healthcare unit in London¿s Wandsworth prison . Tough: Wandsworth was built during the Victorian era and once held inmates including Charles Bronson, Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs, and Ronnie Kray . Another source told The Sunday Mirror that Harris is sharing a cell at Bullingdon with another pensioner inmate, and has been very withdrawn. 'He . is doing all right but spends hours drawing. It takes his mind off . things,' the source said. A Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline that the department does not comment on the whereabouts of individual prisoners, and could not comment on where prisoners are usually sent after they have been sentenced at Southwark Crown Court. Harris was sentenced earlier this month, after travelling part of the way to Southwark from his home in Bray, Berkshire by boat  - where he was seen kissing and joking with friends. He showed no emotion as Mr Justice Sweeney said the . shamed star was a committed sex offender who had taken advantage of his . celebrity status to assault four women aged between eight and 19 in . plain sight between 1969 and 1986. Mugshot: Harris was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault after an eight-week trial . Through victim impact statements, the court was told that his . daughter Bindi’s best friend – abused by him from the age of 13 – said . he made her feel ‘dirty, grubby and disgusting’, while another . woman said Harris stole her innocence at the age of eight. 'You took advantage of the trust placed in you because of your celebrity status to commit the offences,' the judge told Harris. 'You clearly got a thrill from committing the offences whilst others were present or nearby. ‘You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. 'Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame  but yourself.’ It alleged that Harris had not revealed a collection of child . pornography on his home computer showing children under the age of 13 . naked from the waist down posing suggestively beside teddy bears. He . was charged with making indecent images but prosecutors . dropped the charges for fear of being seen as ‘oppressive’ to the sexual . predator who was said to be living on borrowed time. Harris was . convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault after an eight-week . trial that heard how he hid the dark side of his Jekyll and Hyde . personality. He carefully concealed the ‘demon lurking beneath his charming exterior’ as he used his fame to beguile innocent young fans. Since his conviction, a number of other women have come forward in Australia and New Zealand and claimed he molested them. Singer Linda Nolan, 55, and television presenter Vanessa Feltz, 52, have also claimed they were assaulted by the disgraced star. Feltz said Harris put his hands up her dress during a live broadcast of The Big Breakfast in 1996, while Nolan alleged Harris attacked her when she was a 15-year-old during a tour of South Africa.","Harris, 84, was expected to spend several weeks in HMP Wandsworth .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Three women nicknamed the 'Desperate . Housewives' have been jailed for helping their partners and family members run a £500,000 drug trafficking empire from a leafy spa town. Mother-of-one . Fay Read, 24, trained nurse Victoria Clayton, 54, and mechanic’s wife . Julie Scruton, 45, were key figures in a major family-run drugs ring based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Read’s . long term partner Joseph 'Big Joe' McIntyre, 37, was head of the racket . and she would enjoy the proceeds of his crimes including exotic . holidays, flash cars and designer clothing - all paid for in cash - . despite them being on benefits. 'Desperate Housewives':  Mother-of-one Fay Read, 24, (left)  and nurse Victoria Clayton, 54, (right) were jailed for helping their partners and family members run a £500,000 drug trafficking empire from a leafy spa town . Role: Mechanic's wife Julie Scruton helped her brother Russell Baker, 35, store, mix and repackage large quantities of drugs behind the locked doors of her husband David's garage . Clayton . would accompany her husband Martin, 50, on deals and often assisted . him in the mixing and repackaging of drugs at their home. Scruton also helped her brother Russell Baker, 35, store, mix and . repackage large quantities of drugs behind the locked doors of her . husband David’s garage. The women, who neighbours dubbed the 'Desperate Housewives' after the trial, were . arrested after North Yorkshire Police’s Organised Crime Unit seized . £561,000 worth of heroin, cocaine, and amphetamine from various address . in Harrogate as they investigated the operation, which ran between February . and December 2012. Police . found £30,000 worth of drugs buried at in the town’s Stonefall Cemetery, . and during the investigation officers found an incriminating text . message on . Clayton’s phone from her husband saying ‘Get the kitchen ready to do a . big mix’, which officers suspected referred to he adulteration of drugs. However, she tried to claim he had made a typing error and said it related to a . Mexican-style meal that they would enjoy together and insisted it should . have read: 'Get the kitchen ready to do a big Mex.' Police . said the drugs found were just the stock held by the gang at . the time of the searches and represented only a 'fraction' of the total . amount of drugs bought and sold by the McIntyre enterprise. At . Teeside Crown Court, Read who has a four year child with McIntyre was . jailed for four years, Clayton was jailed for five years and Scruton got . six years. McIntyre was jailed for six years whilst Scruton’s brother Baker was jailed for four and half years. McIntyre’s . younger brother Thomas McIntyre, 31, who would stand in for Joseph as . the head of the operation whenever he was on holiday, was sentenced to . six years’ behind bars. Clayton’s husband and McIntyre’s sister . Philomena McIntyre, 36, will be sentenced at a later date . All . were convicted by a jury or pleaded guilty to a range of offences . including conspiracy to supply Class A and Class B drugs and money . laundering. A jury could not reach verdicts on Scruton’s husband David, . 47. James . Kenny, 30, of Bootle, Merseyside was sentenced to 30 . months in jail after becoming a ‘gopher’ in the operation for a . Merseyside drug-dealing syndicate which traded supplies with the . Harrogate crime gang. The court heard how the drugs racket began after McIntyre’s wheelie bin cleaning business was shut down. Police . said he and his gang used various cutting agents to bulk out the drugs . in order to maximise their profits. McIntyre, the gang’s 'director' usually distanced himself from the drugs but was caught during a major . surveilllance operation in which police saw him hide . 3kg of methlamphetamine in undergrowth at the cemetery on November . 2, 2012. Brothers: Joseph 'Big Joe' McIntyre, 37, (left) was jailed for six years for his part in the racket, along with his brother Thomas McIntyre, 31, (right) who would stand as the head of the operation if Joseph was on holiday . Martin Clayton was one . of McIntyre’s most trusted couriers and was regularly sent to Bootle, . near Liverpool to carry out drug deliveries or cash collection. His wife . joined him on at least one trip and was involved in cutting the drugs . with bulking agent dextrose in their kitchen, the court heard. During . a raid at the Clayton home officers found 5kgs of heroin worth . £284,810, 1kg of 44 per cent pure amphetamine worth £80,000 and . half-a-kilogram of cutting agents. Police also found a drugs press and . two pairs of digital scales containing traces of heroin. The court heard that Scruton . allowed drugs to be stored at her home and at her husband’s car repair . business and she was seen visiting the garage outside opening hours 73 . times between August and December 2012. McIntyre his sister Philomena . and Read, were also spotted visiting the garage outside business hours. During . a raid of the garage, officers recovered 1.5kg of heroin worth £95,830 . from under the floorboards in the loft, and 53.9 grams of . cocaine, with a street value of £2,160, was found in a filing . cabinet. Sentenced: Russell Baker, 35, (left) was jailed for four and half years and James Kenny, 30, (right) was sentenced to 30 months after becoming a 'gopher' in the operation . Another raid at Scruton's home uncovered cocaine worth £1,330 and heroin worth £7,740 in . the kitchen and dining room. Officers found 6kgs of amphetamine worth £60,000 in a bedroom and the garden shed. Bulking agents were also found . in the shed. Three days . after the raid on the graveyard, Philomena McIntyre was seen rummaging around the . cemetery to try to find the drugs along with her two brothers, the court was told. David Gordon, prosecuting, said: 'There must have been considerable involvement to . deal with these very large quantities of drugs. There was evidence of . high living and there must be considerable sums of money still concealed . to this day. 'The . conspiracy was run by Joseph McIntyre, known to some within his . organisation as ""Big Joe"". He employed a variety of tactics to keep his . actions hidden from the police, such as the use of more than 10 ""dirty . phones"" during the course of a year, couriers to transport his drugs and . safe houses for the mixing, re-packaging and storage of drugs. Base: The drugs ring operated out of the leafy spa town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire . 'He . and his partner, Fay Read, lived well on the proceeds of his . drug-dealing organisation. Whilst on benefits or without any legitimate . income they spent thousands of pounds on foreign holidays, vehicles and . expensive living, mainly dealing in cash in an attempt to stay under the . radar of the authorities.' Mitigating, Read’s lawyer Christopher Smith said: 'She will miss . being a mother in those wonderful early years of raising a child. She . entered into this with a degree of naivity and was under the influence . of others due to her relationship with someone with more criminal . experience.' Clayton’s . lawyer Denise Breen-Lawton said: 'It is clear that her husband, . Martin Clayton, brought the drugs into her home and her life. There was . no high living, she was naïve and didn’t know the value of the drugs or . the drug chain. She has been ostracised by her family and is scared to . go to prison.' After the hearing, Det Insp Mark Pearson, of North Yorkshire Police’s organised crime unit, said each member of the gang played a part in the operation. 'Joseph McIntyre was undoubtedly the main . man at the head of the operation and went to great lengths to ensure . that he had little contact with the drugs, instead getting other people . to store, cut, and courier the drugs for him,' he said. 'He also reaped the benefits of the conspiracy enjoying expensive foreign holidays and buying cars, which he paid for in cash. 'But . every member of this gang played a significant part in the conspiracy . and their involvement in this organised crime group cannot be . underestimated either. Without their commitment to bulking out the drugs . to enhance McIntyre’s profits and their willingness to use their own . homes and businesses to stash the supplies the conspiracy wouldn’t have . continued for as long as it did.'","Fay Read, 24, Victoria Clayton and Julie Scruton key figures in drugs ring .

"By . Dan Bloom . A row has broken out after a Miss Birmingham beauty queen was forced to share her title - with another woman who won an identically-named gong three months later. Construction worker Katie Stamps, 21,  swapped her hard hat for a tiara to accept the prize organised by Miss England, the organisation whose winners go on to enter Miss World. But she must now share the Miss Birmingham name with 26-year-old Kris'ina Jagpal, who won it on Thursday from a rival organisation called Miss Great Britain. Battle of the tiaras: Construction worker Katie Stamps (left) was crowned Miss Birmingham three months ago - but must now share her title with Kris'ina Jagpal (right), who won the gong from a rival organiser last week . Katie said she 'cannot believe something like this would come to jeopardise all the hard work' that she put in . The Miss Great Britain camp insist the city is big for the two of them, but Katie and Miss England's organisers said they were furious. Katie, from Kidderminster, said: 'Since winning the Miss Birmingham title I have put my all into representing the city and to change perceptions of what a beauty pageant means. 'With charitable and intelligent girls such as the Miss England finalists I met, I cannot believe something like this would come to jeopardise all the hard work.' Miss England regional director Rachael Barker has now declared she wants to challenge the decision at the High Court. 'I am livid,' she said. 'We could not afford the £25,000 to challenge this through the courts. New winner: Kris'ina Jagpa, 26, won last week - and is planning to marry former Mr Birmingham Eli Coley (right) Queen: Katie (centre) during her ceremony three months ago arranged by the body Miss England. Regional director Rachael Barker said: 'I am livid. We could not afford the £25,000 to challenge this through the courts' 'They have no right to use the term, but unless we take them through the High Court in a costly battle we can't do anything.' She added the row has resulted in widespread confusion among would-be entrants. 'I had Katie on the phone utterly confused, asking if she's still Miss Birmingham,' she added. Kris'ina, from Edgbaston, Birmingham, won her Miss Birmingham crown at a ceremony in Leicester last week. She was a previous winner of the rival Miss England-arranged title in 2012, but later switched to the competition organised by Miss Great Britain. The beauty queen, who made headlines last week when she revealed she is marrying former Mr Birmingham Eli Coley, said she was taken aback by the reaction. Prestigious: Katie (third from left) with other entrants in the Miss England-arranged contest in May . Match made in heaven: Kris'ina, who met her husband-to-be on a wedding shoot where they were both models (pictured), said she had no problem sharing the role and the city was big enough for two Miss Birminghams . 'When you win a pageant the last thing you want is all this,' she said. 'I was shocked to be honest. I'm a nice person, I get along with everybody. 'I'm happy to work with another Miss Birmingham.' Kate Solomons, the national director for Miss Great Britain, insisted there was nothing stopping her from holding the competition - and it was not the first time there had been two Miss Birminghams. She told MailOnline she would be happy to fight in the High Court over the brand. 'I came second in Miss England in 2004 and was an organiser for seven years before being headhunted to join Miss Great Britain, so I know the rules,' she said. 'Our competition is very inclusive. There's lots of pageants out there and the girls should be able to enter whatever they like. 'Miss England like to see themselves as an exclusive competition and they're very well recognised but Miss Great Britain has been around since 1945. I don't think they have any authority over the regional title.'","Construction worker Katie Stamps given her tiara by Miss England in May .

"By . Alan Roden, In Edinburgh . and Dan Bloom . No Plan B: Mr Salmond hinted that not keeping the pound would be like settling for second best . Alex Salmond has admitted there is no acceptable 'Plan B' if an independent Scotland is barred from using the British pound. The First Minister said dropping the pound 'implies settling for what's second best' - but still insisted there will be a deal on a currency union with the rest of the UK. His admission came as Labour leader Ed Miliband revealed he will campaign again a currency union in the event of a 'yes' vote. In an open letter to voters, Mr Salmond set out why he has not yielded to calls to disclose a back-up plan, if his favoured option of sharing the pound and the Bank of England fails. The letter, published in the Sun, declared: 'It is revealing that our opponents in the No camp like to talk about a ""Plan B"" on currency. 'It's revealing because it says it all about what they think of Scotland. 'Plan B implies settling for what's second best. And neither myself, my colleagues in the SNP, or the wider Yes campaign will ever settle for second best for Scotland. 'The last thing I would do is back a plan which wasn't the best one for Scotland.' He said Scotland would be 'willing and able' to take on its share of national debt, but could not be expected to do so if it does not get a fair share of the Bank of England. 'That means taxpayers in the rest of the UK would be lumbered with up to £5billion a year in debt interest payments,' he wrote. 'And Scotland would start life as an independent country debt-free. That's just one of the many good reasons there will be a currency union.' Scroll down for video . Forthright: The independence debate has been hotting up after this week's live TV debate (pictured) The First Minister's stance is at odds with the three main parties at Westminster, who have already ruled out the prospect of a formal currency union. Ed Miliband has revealed he will make a . manifesto commitment to block a ‘currency union’ with a separate . Scotland as voters urgently demand a ‘plan B’ from Alex Salmond. Mr Salmond's preference would see Scotland retain the Bank of England as its lender of last resort. A new . Survation poll for the Scottish Daily Mail has revealed that a . staggering 69 per cent of Scots want the Scottish Government to draw up . alternatives to keeping the pound before September’s referendum. Four-fifths . of respondents said the choice of currency is important to them in the . case of separation, demonstrating the scale of the crisis now facing the . SNP. Following . Tuesday’s bruising TV debate with Alistair Darling, when Mr Salmond . failed to answer questions about his ‘plan B’, the First Minister has . since childishly claimed ‘it’s Scotland’s pound and we’re keeping it’. Veto: Ed Miliband has revealed he will make a manifesto pledge to block a currency union with Scotland . On . Thursday, he bizarrely argued that the rest of the UK would have to . accept a deal because it would be the ‘sovereign will’ of the people of . Scotland following a Yes vote. But . on a visit to Glasgow yesterday, Labour leader Mr Miliband said that . should Scots vote to leave the Union, he would stand on a platform in . next year’s General Election to rule out a deal. If he won the election, that would give him a clear mandate from the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish . Finance Secretary John Swinney yesterday said the cross-party refusal . 'will crumble after a Yes vote' in the face of higher costs to UK . businesses to trade with Scotland. 'If alarm bells were ringing after Tuesday night, they should be ringing . much, much louder when you’ve got them saying we’re going to default on . our debts' - Ed Miliband . But . Mr Miliband said only 10 per cent of UK trade goes to Scotland and . pointed out that 40 per cent of UK trade goes to Europe, which has not . compelled Britain to join the euro. Former . Labour chancellor Alistair Darling also said the UK Treasury would be . 'phlegmatic' about paying Scotland’s share of the debt – around . £5billion a year from the Treasury’s £700billion budget. Mr Miliband said Mr Salmond has had ‘40 years to come up with an answer, and with 40 days to go he still has no answer’. He . added: 'If alarm bells were ringing after Tuesday night, they should be . ringing much, much louder when you’ve got them saying we’re going to . default on our debts'. Asked if he . would include a pledge in his 2015 General Election manifesto to veto a . currency union, Mr Miliband replied: 'Yes. I’m ruling it out now.' Plans: Labour leader Ed Miliband speaks to   Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont in Glasgow yesterday . The . new Survation poll shows that 56 per cent of Yes voters want Mr Salmond . to draw up a ‘plan B’, with only 35 per cent content for the First . Minister to remain silent. The . alternatives are a separate Scottish currency – either pegged to the . pound or with a flexible exchange rate - joining the euro, or using the . pound unilaterally in the way that East Timor and Panama use the U.S. dollar. Keeping . the pound is by far the preferred option for Scots, but if a deal is . ruled out a separate currency pegged to the pound is the most popular, . according to the poll. Mr . Salmond has gambled his political future on convincing voters that . Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems are bluffing when they said they . would rule out a currency union. The poll shows that 40 per cent agree with this, and 39 per cent of Scots believe they are telling the truth.","First Minister made admission in an open letter to voters in today's Sun .

"By . Dan Bloom . An NYPD officer was caught trying to fast-track a woman's recruitment in return for sexual favours, it is claimed. Prosecutors say Delfin Lantigua contacted the budding police officer on Facebook and said he could get her hired - but only if she gave him 'multiple instances of sex', $1,000 and her underwear. Shocked by the alleged offer, the woman told police who fixed her up with a wire tap and met the Lantigua at a Brooklyn branch of Dunmkin' Donuts on March 11. Arrest: Prosecutors say 34-year-old Delfin Lantigua demanded sex, $1,000 and the woman's underwear in exchange for getting a budding female police officer hired to the NYPD. He could face seven years in jail . Lantigua, who has been with the NYPD for nine years, was arraigned yesterday on charges of third-degree bribe receiving, second-degree coercion and official misconduct. He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said: 'This defendant shamefully violated his duty to uphold the law by demanding sex from a woman who simply wanted to become a police officer. 'He will now be prosecuted for his outrageous conduct.' DA Thompson said according to the investigation, Lantigua, who worked with the Brooklyn North Task Force, contacted the applicant on Facebook on February 9, 2014. Haunt: The officer allegedly told the woman to meet her at a Brooklyn branch of Dunkin' Donuts (file photo) Officers claim that during the follow-up meeting at Dunkin' Donuts he demanded regular sex, $1,000 and 'other conditions', which are believed to refer to her underwear. She agreed to meet Lantigua, who lives in Kensington, New York, at a motel two days later where he thought they were going to have sex. But instead, when he arrived he was arrested by officers from the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau. Lantigua reportedly worked in the applicant processing department of the NYPD, where he handled candidates' details. His defense attorney Stephen Flamhaft suggested he would contest the case, telling theNew York Daily News: 'It’s my belief that this entire thing appears to have been orchestrated by the police department.'","Prosecutors say Delfin Lantigua, 34, contacted the applicant on Facebook .

Scientists say the water has reached a seven-year high of 20.4C at Start Bay, Devon - warmer than Santa Monica beach in Los Angeles, where the water temperature is 19.4C. Researchers at Plymouth Marine Laboratories say strong sunlight and light winds are responsible for the balmy seas. Dr Tim Smyth said: 'We were looking at an average year until June but over the last six weeks temperatures have risen quickly.

"By . Dan Bloom . and Annabel Fenwick Elliott . France's . most famous brothel madam claimed John F Kennedy asked her for a . prostitute who looked like his wife Jackie - 'but hot'. The . former President joins a host of famous names said to have visited . Madame Claude, the infamous owner of a high-class escort ring who . employed hundreds of women in 1960s Paris. Claude, . now 91 and living in France, specialized in procuring call girls - whom . she referred to as her 'swans' - for the rich and famous, servicing . everyone from the actors Rex Harrison and Marlon Brando to the Libyan . dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Sensational . claims: France's most famous brothel madam was allegedly approached by . former U.S. President John F Kennedy (left) who wanted a lookalike of . his first wife Jackie, the fashion and style icon (right) - 'but hot' Surprising: It comes despite Jackie, nee Bouvier, being one of the most enduring fashion icons of her age . Famous: Pictured during her self-imposed exile in Los Angeles in 1985, Madame Claude was a cult figure . Acclaimed . biographer William Stadiem, who penned the famous book on Marilyn . Monroe, persuaded Madame Claude to co-author a tell-all book in the . 1980s. Although it was never published, he has now has opened up about . Claude and her roster of powerful clients. Despite . Jacqueline Kennedy being venerated as one of history's most elegant . women, the explosive claims do not just involve her first husband. Her . second husband, the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, was also . said to have visited Claude, along with his former lover Maria Callas; . 'showing up with depraved requests that made Claude blush.' 'There . was John Kennedy requesting a Jackie look-alike ""but hot"",' Mr Stadiem . wrote in Vanity Fair, describing Claude as being 'tiny, blonde, . perfectly coiffed and Chanel-clad.' 'There . was Marc Chagall giving the girls priceless sketches of their nude . selves, Gianni Agnelli taking a post-orgy group to Mass, the Shah and . his gifts of jewels. 'There were such disparate bedfellows on the client list as Moshe Dayan and Muammar Qaddafi, Marlon Brando and Rex Harrison.' Iconic: Jacqueline and her first husband formed one of the most recognizable couples in U.S. history . Second husband: Aristotle Onassis pictured (right) after his marriage to Jackie (left) in August 1968 . Mr . Stadiem also reveals that the C.I.A. once hired Claude's women to keep . up morale during the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, which aimed to end . U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. 'There are two things that people will always pay for, food and sex. I wasn't any good at cooking' One of . Claude's former loyal clients during the 50s and 60s was London's . then-Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopulos, who pointed out that . 'going to a hooker' wasn't frowned upon in the days 'before the pill.' Claude . is said to have chosen mainly tall, stunning, 'failed actresses and . models' - many of them Christian Dior couture models -  and favored . foreign girls, especially Scandinavians. The . brothel madam is quoted as saying: 'There are two things that people . will always pay for, food and sex. I wasn't any good at cooking.' Arresting: The claims about the lovers of Jacqueline (left) are revealed in the new edition of Vanity Fair (right) The . article investigates the fascinating journey of Madame Claude, born . Fernande Grudet in 1923, and how she allegedly turned from a . convent-raised resistance agent in the Second World War - who spent a . stint at a German Nazi concentration camp, and apparently has the 'camp . number tattoo' to prove it - to the head of France's biggest prostitute . ring. Many . of the elaborate claims Claude made about her past, however, have been . labeled as 'lies' and 'fantasy' by various sources who knew her. 'She reduced the entire world to rich men wanting sex and poor women wanting money' Ironically . given the X-rated nature of Claude's career, the eccentric character - . mother to one daughter -  claimed to have 'hated sex,' and was of the . opinion that people over 40 'shouldn't have it.' She was, however, a . huge fan of plastic surgery, having had everything but her breasts . 'done.' Having . made herself a small fortune with her prostitution ring, Claude was . forced to flee France for Los Angeles in 1977 when French authorities . began hounding her over alleged tax evasion. Though . she continued working as a madam in the U.S., Claude was described as . being 'totally alone and adrift' there. She lived in a small apartment . in West Hollywood 'filled with wardrobes full of glamorous French . clothes no one would ever wear in LA.' Infamous: Madame Claude after her return to France . During . her time in Los Angeles, Claude once attempted to enlist legendary . actress and author Joan Collins as one of her 'swans.' In Ms Collins' 1997 memoir Second Act, she described Claude's proposition. 'Your . husbands don't have to know, and I believe you could make enough money . to buy yourself a few little extra baubles,' Claude allegedly said. Some of the associates Mr Stadiem spoke with were decidedly scathing when describing Claude. In . one account, Françoise Fabian - the actress who played Claude in the . 1977 film of her exploits - said she 'was like a slave driver on a . plantation in the American South', who pushed the women who worked for . her into debt. Another . account, from former-Hollywood based journalist Dany Jucaud was as . follows: 'She was vicious... She reduced the entire world to rich men . wanting sex and poor women wanting money.' Eventually, . Claude returned to her home country of France, endured a short jail . term, and now lives a life shielded from the world.","Madame Claude employed hundreds of call girls for stars in 1960s Paris .

"By . Dan Bloom . An American man who loved Romania so much he wrote books about it has been deported from Romania. Sam Reames left his native Orlando, Florida, for Romania's second largest city of Cluj a decade ago and became an unofficial ambassador, appearing on TV and running a website called kingofromania.com. But in April Romania's Immigration Office began proceedings to remove him after saying his stay had not been legal for six and a half years. He lost a court appeal, making national headlines as offcers drove him to the border with Hungary and told him not to come back until 2017. Deported: Sam Reames (left with his girlfriend Rodica Cangea and right) moved to Romania 10 years ago from Florida and loved it so much he talked about it on TV. Now he has been told to leave and barred from returning . Cross: The 41-year-old said: 'I couldn't believe it when they turned up at my door and told me I was being deported. At first I thought they were Jehovah's Witnesses due to the way they were standing with paperwork' The 41-year-old insisted he had simply fallen foul of red tape, forgetting to renew his visa, and wanted nothing more than to stay with his Romanian girlfriend and his possessions. He was known in local media as 'Sam Cel Roman' (Sam the Romanian) because of his passion for the country, appearing on national television and joking: 'I'm more Romanian than you are'. His wrote tourist guides and blogs about his adopted home for several years, including a 'Complete Insider's Guide to Romania' in 2011. But the Romanian immigration service said that by forgetting to extend his stay, which would probably have been automatically approved, he qualified for a ban. Joke: The American citizen posted memes like this one about his adopted home on his Facebook page . That meant armed officers dragged him from his home for violating immigration law. He complained he was not given time to arrange for anybody to care for his pet cats. 'I couldn't believe it when they turned up at my door and told me I was being deported,' he said. 'At first I thought the two people at the door were Jehovah's Witnesses due to the way they were standing in front of my door with paperwork in their hand. 'But when they identified themselves as immigration officers and said they were there for me, I thought it was a joke. It was only when they started to cart me off that I realised they were serious. 'I was told it was a minor matter but as soon as they got me in the car and took me to the police station, I was banged up in a tiny cell where I was surrounded by immigration officers including one guy that was shouting at me and demanding to know why was breaking the law. 'To be honest they treated me like a child molester, not just somebody who'd forgot to extend his visa. I was kept there for five hours and they wouldn't even let me go to the bathroom.' Mr Reames complained that during his appeal - which he lost at the end of June - he was given a translator who did not speak English. His pleas that he intended to marry his Romanian girlfriend Rodica Cangea also went unheeded, he said. Explaining the alleged mix-up, he said: 'I came into the country on a tourism visa and then became part of a local company that gave me a permanent visa, but my trouble started when that got stolen. 'I guess what happened after that was lost in translation and now I suddenly find myself evicted.' Popular: Mr Reames, left and right signing what he said was his last autograph before leaving the country . The self-appointed Romania expert is now staying with friends in southern Germany. Marius Ludusan, the chief commissioner of Cluj's immigration service, said: 'He legally entered the country six to seven years ago and forgot to leave. 'In order to stay in the country for so long, he should have contacted any local office and requested the extension of his stay. 'Anyone that comes here needs to obey the law. Those that don't obey the law have to face the consequences.'

"By . Dan Bloom . The square where Ukraine's national crisis began has erupted into violence again as the few hundred remaining protesters clashed with riot police. Black smoke billowed from burning tyres and activists threw stones in Kiev's Independence Square today as officials tried to remove barricades which had remained since President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in February. The violence came as Nato warned Russia could be planning to invade the east of the country as it once again massed 20,000 troops on the border. Scroll down for video . Erupting into violence again: Smoke rose once more today from Independence Square in Kiev, the same place which saw the pro-European protests which toppled Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych in February . The protestors - who said they were remaining on their barricades to ensure the government did not row back on promises of reform - threw missiles and set alight to heaps of tyres as authorities tried to remove them . All walks of life: Even an Orthodox priest got involved, clashing with the government's Kiev-1 volunteer battalion . Confusion: The riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes . Activists - including an Orthodox priest - threw bottles and paving bricks at municipal workers who had been dispatched to dismantle the tents and barricades in the square this morning. Armed riot police moved onto the square to fight club-waving protesters in combat clothes and masks. The riot police and workers eventually withdrew - leaving the situation unresolved in chaotic scenes. The square, known as the Maidan after its name in Ukrainian, was the focus of pro-European protests which ignited Ukraine's political crisis at the end of last year. Pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown and replaced by the more pro-European Petro Poroshenko, largely thanks to the violent protests. Bloody: There were injuries between the self-defence activists (pictured) and government volunteers . Clashes: The eyes of the world had since shifted from Kiev to pro-Russian rebels in the east of Ukraine . Violence: At one point there were thousands of protesters in the square, but now only a few hundred remain . Historic: The square is in the centre of Kiev and has been crucial to the country's political crisis . But that sparked the anti-Kiev feeling among pro-Russians in eastern Ukraine, spiralling into a civil war and the takeover of cities like Donetsk and Luhansk by militants. Many protesters, including self-defence militias, had taken down their tents and returned to their homes since Poroshenko was elected in May. Other barricades remained in place along with makeshift shrines to the 100 or so protesters killed by police sniper fire during the protests. A few hundred protesters are estimated to still be in the square, saying they wanted to ensure the new government kept its promises of reform. But Kiev's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely ahead of an expected parliamentary election at the end of October. Anger: The clashes were sparked when city employees tried to clear remaining tents from the square . Yury Kovalchuk, a 43-year-old businessman, complained: 'There are practically no normal people left' Makeshift: The barricades in Independence Square, known as Maidan, have been up for several months . Improvised armour: An activist in a camouflage jacket, a cycle helmet and novelty lab goggles looks on . They had already tried to negotiate with the stragglers but all attempts to forge a deal fell through. 'It's like seeing everything that went on in winter coming back: tyres are burning, the police are here and so are people with clubs,' said Vitaly Lyakh, a 37-year-old Kiev resident. 'It's not right - especially since the most decent people have gone off to fight in the war (against separatists in the east). Civilised countries don't behave like this'. One protester wearing a Ukrainian cossack uniform, Mykola Bondar, declared his resistance to attempts to take down the encampment. A group of young masked protesters stood nearby atop a truck, banging on the roof of the vehicle with clubs. 'They tried to kill us today. They set fire to us,' he said. Explosives: An activist in the square throws a Molotov cocktail today at a burning tyre barricade . Improvised: The protesters built up everything they could as their defences, including large outdoor bins . Battle: Kiev's new authorities said they wanted the city to go back to normal with traffic moving freely . Chaos: Just as the clashed happened in Kiev, Russia was mounting troops along the eastern border . But Yury Kovalchuk, a 43-year-old businessman, said: 'It's the right thing to do. 'I was here from the start of the Maidan and I believe it's right now to take down what there is here. There are practically no normal people left here.' Hundreds of miles away in the east, fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels has continued - leaving crash investigators unable to attend the scene of the MH17 disaster. And Russia announced more military exercises near the border this week, prompting a warning from Nato that the Kremlin could be planning a ground invasion. Nato officials warned Moscow had 20,000 troops near the border who could move into Ukraine under the pretext of launching a humanitarian mission. Putin has rallied Russians with relentless nationalist campaigns in state media against Ukraine and in support of the rebel cause, and Western officials fear he might invade to prevent a rebel defeat.

"By . Associated Press . and Dan Bloom . At least 69 people have been killed in an explosion at a Chinese factory that supplies the western car company General Motors. The blast in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, left at least 180 more workers injured including many with severe burns, their clothes stripped off their backs. Footage shot by residents showed huge plumes of thick, black smoke rising from the plant as the blackened and scorched bodies of victims were lifted onto the back of large trucks. It is believed fine dust used to polish car hubcaps caught alight in the air, sparking a fatal blast which rippled across the factory floor. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Rescue: Burns specialists were drafted in from Shanghai and emergency blood donor centres were set up . Burns: Many of the victims lost large parts of their skin in China's most serious industrial accident this year . Victim: Medics tend to one of the more seriously injured workers in the factory, which employed hundreds . Broken windows at the factory blast site in Kunshan, China, where at least 69 people have been killed . The bodies of victims killed in the explosion at the factory of Kunshan Zhongrong Metal Products Co are placed on a truck in Kunshan city, east China's Jiangsu province . Many of the bodies were blackened by burns or a covering of soot. Some survivors were seen sitting on wooden cargo platforms on the road outside the factory, their clothes apparently burned off and skin exposed, or being carried into ambulances. The factory is operated by the Zhongrong Metal Products Company, a Taiwanese enterprise that according to its website was set up in 1998 and has a registered capital of £5.2million. Its core business is coating and polishing aluminium alloy wheel hubs for General Motors and other firms. At least 69 workers died and up to 180 were injured after an explosion and fire ripped through the factory . Workers injured in the explosion wait for medical treatment at the gate of the factory . Residents donate blood on a voluntary blood donation vehicle (left) and (right) staff prepare blood plasma . Zhou Xu, 26, who worked nearby, said: 'We heard a really loud blast at about 7 a.m. this morning so we rushed out of our dormitories. 'First the ambulance came, then as the news surfaced in the media, many families - especially the wives - rushed to the site to see if their husbands were okay.' One security guard said the blast shattered the windows of his guard house half a kilometre away. Medical staff transfer a victim of the factory blast to a hospital in Kunshan following the factory explosion . The explosion occurred at 7.37am (12.37am UK time) at a workshop in the factory that polishes wheel hubs . Bodies: Victims were piled onto the back of a flat-bed truck (left) as firefighters doused the factory itself (right) Distressing: The scene outside the factory, captured on witnesses' mobile phones, was one of chaos . Help: It is believed the explosion happened when fine hubcap polish dust caught fire on the main factory floor . There were more than 200 workers at the site when the blast occurred, the city's government told the state-owned Xinhua News Agency. More than 120 people who were injured have been sent to hospitals in Kunshan and the nearby city of Suzhou. Burns experts were drafted in from Shanghai 40 miles away to aid in the disaster and the authorities are believed to have set up four emergency blood donation centres. The explosion occurred at 7.37am (12.37am UK time) at a workshop in the factory that polishes wheel hubs. Rescuers pulled out more than 40 bodies and around 20 other people died in hospital, Xinhua said. Cordon: As victims were rushed into emergency wards, two company executives were reportedly held . Treatment: Authorities are investigating the cause of the blast at the factory which supplied western car firms . At least 180 people were injured in the blast alongside the 69 who died. An estimated 200 were inside the plant . Hospital: There was an anxious wait for hundreds of relatives in the city as the workers were treated . Donation: Locals have been urged to give blood to top up supplies for treatment of the factory disaster's victims . It is believed the explosion was caused when fine particles of the dust and powdered metal used to polish hubcaps caught alight in the air. They could have to come into contact with a spark,  an overheated surface or electrical discharge from machinery. If the air was dense with dust, the explosion would have rippled across the factory floor. Kunshan is about 600 miles south east of Beijing. Calls to the city's government, police and the firm by the Associated Press went unanswered this morning. General Motors confirmed the factory is part of its network of suppliers. Authorities have held five senior employees to assist in the investigation, it was reported. Standing guard: Policeman blocked a road near the blast site as residents and relatives waited for news . Investigation: An image released by the state-owned Xinhua news agency showed firefighters at the scene . Factory: Scorch marks could be seen on the walls of the building and the roof appeared to have collapsed . Horror: The explosion happened in the city of Kunshan in eastern China, about 40 miles away from Shanghai . Workplace safety is a major problem in China - the world's second-largest economy - where regulations are often ignored. The blast is the country's worst industrial accident since June last year, when a fire at a chicken slaughterhouse in the northeast province of Jilin in June 2013 killed 119 people. Thought to have been started by an ammonia leak, it was blamed on poor management, lack of government oversight and locked or blocked exits. Sixty-two people were also killed and scores injured in the eastern port city of Qingdao in November when a pipeline exploded. Investigators said the blast was caused by sparks from a jackhammer being used to repair a manhole cover following an oil leak.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Dan Bloom . A Bitcoin ATM has been wrecked by a lightning bolt just days after it was introduced. The $1,000 machine was the first in its state when it went into service with much fanfare two weeks ago at a used books and music store in Tucson, Arizona. But only about a dozen people bought any of the virtual 'crypto-currency' before nature intervened - striking Bookmans Entertainment Exchange and creating a power surge on Friday. Out of service: This Bitcoin ATM, pictured during its launch last week on a local TV station, has been knocked out of action after lightning struck the used books and music store which hosted it in Tucson, Arizona . Devastated: Brian Williams, the founder of Javelin Investments LLC, insisted no accounts were compromised. Mr Williams is pictured during the launch of the automated teller on local network Tucson News Now last week . Since then the machine has been out of action and its owner Brian Williams is devastated. The entrepreneur, who founded the machine's owner Javelin Investments LLC, had hoped the teller would prompt a digital currency revolution in the southern state. He told AZ Central: 'It's kind of like getting punched in the face. I'm trying to pick up the pieces, trying to figure out where we are at.' To use the machine, which Mr Williams hopes to get back up and running within a week, customers had to download a Bitcoin app to their phone. The app presented them with a QR code which matched up to their unique 'digital wallet' and simply had to be scanned by the teller to gain access. Customers then fed dollar bills into the machine to convert them into the currency - which critics warn is highly unstable as it has no centralised controls. Virtual currency: Bitcoin was founded in 2009 using open-source software and has risen hugely in value. The 'coins' pictured - created to popularise the currency - are merely tokens. The real value is in the virtual world . The virtual money's value is determined by no government, instead being set by a peer-to-peer network of mainly anonymous users. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, part of the reason many established investors distrust it. The currency was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 but that is not his real name - he was anonymous. The inventor released the coding for his currency in open-source form, and users can now create their own bitcoins. This happens through a process called mining, which forces computers to solve algorithms so complex that the amount of power they take up limits how much currency can flood the market. Its value works just like any undefinable commodity, with the same potential pitfalls. In one of the most famous price bubbles, tulips took on enormous value in 17th Century Amsterdam with lovers of the flowers remortgaging their houses before the price suddenly collapsed. One bitcoin is worth around $580, but most of the customers in Tucson withdrew only small amounts. For the one customer who bought an entire Bitcoin, Mr Williams had to abandon his normal process and conduct the sale using laptops, according to AZ Central. The lightning bolt prompted amused reactions on Bitcoin forums. One lover of the virtual currency wrote: 'That's it boys, Bitcoin is done. Zeus has weighed in on cryptocurrency and found it not worthy. Time to sell.' Another put simply: 'I think we can blame the Illuminati.' Mr Williams insisted no accounts were compromised by the lightning strike. Founded in 2009, the virtual currency has created a small circle of young millionaires who invested early on. But it is highly controversial because of its lack of controls and dramatically volatile value. Its origins in anonymous peer-to-peer networks prompted it to be used on the less respectable side of the web - including the 'Deep Web' drugs and weapons trading site Silk Road. Bitcoin's price stayed relatively low for its first three years but soared towards the end of last year, making headlines around the world. At its peak at the beginning of December, a single Bitcoin was worth $1,147 - up from $13 a year earlier - prompting the launch of an array of trading and analysis sites. The price has since stabilised, but the attention enjoyed by the virtual currency also attracted the wrong kind of fans. A series of websites reported their Bitcoin stores had been raided by hackers as cyber-criminals sought to took advantage of the currency's raging popularity. Spike: Bitcoin's price rocketed in the last three months of last year, earning it headlines around the world . The world's first Bitcoin ATM was launched in October in Vancouver, Canada, and more than 100 are thought to have sprung up around the globe since. It is now accepted by dozens of firms including Amazon, Subway, Victoria's Secret, OkCupid, Whole Foods and Sears. But regulators in the U.S. and Europe warn the currency's days as a free-flowing, unmonitored entity are numbered. Gareth Murphy, of the Central Bank of Ireland, told a major summit this month that Bitcoin's creators and traders would have to follow rules similar to those faced by banks. He said: 'I would urge this industry to work actively to address the concerns of financial authorities rather than ""playing cat and mouse"" and eventually, and inevitably, being drawn into the regulatory net.'","Machine introduced days earlier at used bookshop in Tucson, Arizona .

"By . Dan Bloom . A bystander who was hit round the head with a torch by an enraged Domino's Pizza driver has been offered compensation - in the form of £200 worth of pizza. John Murray shouted at 25-year-old Guy Swansborough to slow down after he saw him driving fast towards two young men who were crossing a road in Caversham, Reading, Berkshire. Swansborough shouted back at Mr Murray before grabbing a large torch from his car, stepping onto the pavement and whacking him over the head with it. Attack: John Murray (left) has been offered £200 of free pizza by Domino's after he was attacked by delivery driver Guy Swansborough (right) - but he said his jaw had been hurt in the attack and the offer was an 'insult' Now the pizza franchise's head office has offered Mr Murray £200 in vouchers as compensation. But he told The Sun on Sunday he had broken his jaw and the offer caused him 'even more pain', adding: 'It's an insult'. Reading magistrates heard Swansborough was wearing a Domino's Pizza uniform when he attacked 35-year-old Mr Murray, who was with his fiancée Julie Wilkes, on May 15. The attack only stopped when Mr Murray ran at Swansborough and rugby tackled him to the ground, the court heard. Hurt: Mr Murray was accidentally given £200 in vouchers which all expired at the end of August . Claire French, prosecuting, said: 'Driving down the same road at speed and wheels screeching was the defendant who nearly lost control of the car, and as two young males crossed the road the car was driven very close to them, in Mr Murray's opinion it was at them. 'After telling Swansborough to ""slow down, mate,"" Swansborough reacted by stating ""You ******* talking to me mate?"" with Mr Murray replying ""Slow down there are kids about.""' The prosecutor said Mr Murray 'was left feeling dizzy and numbness to his hand' after the attack, while The Sun on Sunday reported Mr Murray had broken his jaw and could not eat solid food for a week. Ms French added: 'He saw the man, who he had never seen before, coming at him again and he ran towards him and the pair toppled backwards onto the floor where they tussled before another man arrived at the scene to help.' A Domino's Pizza spokesman Sarah McGhie said the gift of free pizza had been a 'gesture of goodwill'. But the offer went sour when it emerged Mr Murray had only until the end of August to use all of his vouchers - which the firm admitted was an error and later rectified. Ms McGhie told MailOnline: 'The driver was instantly dismissed. That is without a doubt behaviour we do not tolerate. 'After the driver was dismissed, one of the directors at head office gave Mr Murray a call to express that that's not how we expect Domino's drivers to act. 'He offered him some vouchers as a gesture of goodwill. It was nothing like ""here, have some pizza and let's hear no more of it"". 'Unfortunately those vouchers were short-dated to the end of August, which was an error. We hold our hands up over that and we changed when it was pointed out to us. Sacked: A Domino's spokesman said Swansborough, pictured outside court, was dismissed after the incident . 'The same director called Mr Murray over the mistake and he said it was okay and laughed about it.' Swansborough, from Caversham, admitted assaulting Mr Murray and possessing of cannabis during a hearing at Reading Magistrates' Court. In police interview he told officers he had been 'hot-headed' on the day of the attack.

"By . Dan Bloom . A chef says he has been inundated with orders for fried brains, stomachs and decapitated heads despite serving them in a busy hospital. Milorad Djordjevic chose a working hospital in Nis, Serbia, for his Mace Restaurant because the premises were cheaper then opening up on the high street. He insists his offal dishes have been popular - despite doctors having to operate on organs such as brains and stomachs straight after lunch. Chef Milorad Djordjevic says he has been inundated with orders for fried brains (pictured), stomachs and calves' heads at his Mace Restaurant - despite serving them in a busy hospital in the Serbian city of Nis . Mr Djordjevic's menu includes boiled or fried brains, devilled kidneys, tripe (stomach) and tripe soup, along with entire heads of veal calves. His specials board, an A4 sheet of paper sellotaped to the hospital wall, promises: 'Very good prices. You will not regret.' The emergency room is on the same floor, and local newspapers pointed out the dishes could offend patients. But the chef insisted: 'I can see that it makes a . few headlines but at the end of the day I serve good quality food and . I'm always busy. 'If it's not doctors and nurses queueing up then it's . patients or their visitors, and I haven't had any complaints despite the . newspaper headlines.' Gruesome: A whole calf's head on the menu at the restaurant, where the chef insists business is booming . He insisted that just because he was in a hospital, he should not be barred from serving 'gourmet' foods. And he said the only . difference between his restaurant and others was that medics often leap up and rush off halfway through to answer urgent calls. 'When that happens, we simply put the . half finished meal to one side and if they want, heat it up for them . again when they come back', he said. 'The hospital's emergency department is on the . same floor so we are used to people not having a lot of time to eat' - Chef Milorad Djordjevic . 'The hospital's emergency department is on the . same floor so we are used to people not having a lot of time to eat.' With business booming, Mr Djordjevic said the decision to offer . exotic foods from his restaurant at the heart of the hospital clearly made good . economic sense. 'We are full all the time and the overheads low, so what could be better,' he said. The brains and stomachs on his menu mostly come from pigs, but occasionally from sheep too. Offal . and innards are not unheard of on menus in the Balkans, where meat . dishes are similar to Greek cuisine or other eastern European dishes. Serbian . dishes include mainstream offerings like moussaka and wiener schnitzel - . but also a traditional soup made from pigs' innards. The menu reads: 'Restaurant in the emergency building: Soups, cooked dishes, grilled specialties, salad etc. The house specialty: calf's head, beef tails, fried tripe, fried brain... very good prices. You will not regret' It involves parboiling the animal's liver, lung, head and intestines in salt water before adding spices, including a bay leaf. Philip Evans, who researches and imports Balkan food to Britain through his firm Pelagonia, told MailOnline: 'The region was under the Ottoman empire for a long time so a lot of the food traditions are Turkish, and offal is pretty common. 'It's definitely more usual to see offal across the Balkans than it is in the UK. 'In the travel I've done in the region every country has a different take on it.

Margit Tall did not even scream during the 150m plunge from a crane near her home in Helsinki, Finland, after saying she was determined to make the leap before she died. Employees of the bungee jumping firm assumed she was joking when she told them she was born in 1919 and asked if there was an age limit. Scroll down for video . Never too late to learn: Margit Tall has become one of the world's oldest bungee jumpers after leaping off a 150m crane near her home in Helsinki, Finland, at the age of 95. Pictured: Mrs Tall just before the jump . Geronimo: Organisers ensured Mrs Tall took part in a tandem jump so there would be less stress on her body . Unfazed: The 150m crane (left) from which fearless Mrs Tall (right) completed her jump near Helsinki, Finland . Mrs Tall is now thought to be the world's oldest female bungee jumper, beaten only to the title of world's oldest by 96-year-old Mohr Keet, who leapt from South Africa's Blaukrans Bridge in 2010. The previous record for the oldest woman is believed to have been held by Frances Gabe, who celebrated her 91st birthday in 2011 with a solo jump in Fresno, California. Daredevil pensioner Mrs Tall went ahead with her jump despite concerns from staff at Skybreakers, who ensured she did a tandem jump to lessen the impact on her body. Organiser Taneli Fils said: 'She wasn't scared at all. She didn't even scream during the jump. 'When she came to buy a ticket she asked if there was an age limit and we all thought she was joking. Dramatic: The pensioner was then lowered onto a landing area in the lake below. Organiser Taneli Fils said: 'She wasn't scared at all. She didn't even scream during the jump. She told us she was born in 1919' Money for old rope: The 95-year-old bungee jumper is cut free after completing her tandem feat . 'She told us she was born in 1919 and at first we tried to convince her not to jump because we didn't want to kill her but she was determined. 'We asked her what her children thought of her doing this and she told us she just had one child who was already 70, so we didn't need to worry about them.' The jump was believed to be the highest in Finland. Mr Fils added: 'We decided she should do a tandem jump with one of our heaviest guys. If she had jumped alone the free fall which would have been too much for her body. 'Some of our customers start shaking before the jump and some are shaking after the jump. Some go up but are too scared to jump so we have to bring them back down. Emotional: Mrs Tall, pictured with her jumping partner, said she wanted to take the plunge before she dies . Daunting: At 150 metres, the crane jump is believed to be the highest on offer in the whole of Finland . 'You reach a speed of nearly 75mph when you jump and when the rope pulls you back up for the first time, the speed is almost 50mph.' He added: 'Margit did a tandem jump with our heaviest guy because the total weight was almost the maximum possible, the rope was stretching more than usual and the ride was smoother. 'During a bungee jump you are fighting against yourself because brains are telling you don't jump, this isn't safe, the rope can fail, you are too high but if you can overcome your fears you'll feel great.

The Honduran child - named only as Aimee - put a human face on the crisis of undocumented minors when border guards asked where her mother lived and she replied in simple Spanish: 'In the States'.

Aimee was filmed by NBC's Mark Potter as part of a report on the strained resources along the 1,954-mile border.

"By . Dan Bloom . One of Britain’s richest men is being sued by a maintenance worker who claims he was sacked from his vast country estate after injuring his foot. Derren Jones claimed he was forced out of his job of two and a half years at the sprawling Oxfordshire estate of Swiss financier Urs Schwarzenbach, 61, and his wife Francesca. Today an employment judge ruled the case against Britain's 115th richest man should go ahead - despite he and his wife claiming they did not own the management firm for their own estate. Sued: Urs Schwarzenbach (left) is being sued by Derren Jones (right), who claimed he was forced out of his job of two and a half years at the tycoon's sprawling Oxfordshire estate after snapping a tendon in his foot . The tycoon, who owns a polo team and is friends with members of the Royal family, founded Switzerland's largest foreign exchange dealership Interexchange. He has lived in Britain for 25 years and is listed as the 115th richest person in Britain with a wealth of £860million by the 2014 Sunday Times Rich List. He owns vast amounts of land near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire including a sprawling 3,500-acre estate. In 2007 that estate famously grew to take in the entire Buckinghamshire village of Hambleden, which was the backdrop for the ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders. Mr Jones said he worked for the couple from June 2011 as an estate maintenance worker, first at their Thames Side Court estate and then at Culden Faw Estate, which employs 47 people, before he was asked to leave without notice in January this year. His claim filed today at a preliminary hearing in Reading, Berkshire, said his redundancy came just two months after he snapped his Achilles tendon and had to wear a specialist boot. Sprawling: The tycoon's vast mansion on the Culden Faw estate in Oxfordshire, which employs 47 people . He . told how managers’ attitudes 'changed' towards him, and he was called . into a meeting with Vanessa Vernon, the Thames Side Court Estate . administration manager, on his return to work after Christmas to be told he was 'no longer needed'. 'I asked her (Miss . Vernon) if there were any other jobs on the estate because I would . rather be in work than out of work, opening the doors for some sort of . negotiation,' his statement said. 'Vanessa said . she would advise me if anything came up and I would be the first person . they would consider and contact me, but there were no current roles. 'I . had to leave at 9.30am to take my company van to my home and empty all . of my tools. 'I didn’t even have time to say goodbye to my work . colleagues who I’ve worked with for over two and a half years. I . received a letter the following day confirming I was no longer . required.' 'I didn’t even have time to say goodbye to my work . colleagues who I’ve worked with for over two and a half years. I . received a letter the following day confirming I was no longer . required' - Former maintenance worker Derren Jones . But a week after he left, the estate took on the son of his line manager Andy Scott, he said. And later that month his job was advertised in the local press and online without him receiving a phone call, he added. 'This was very upsetting bearing in . mind Vanessa Vernon said she would contact me if any jobs arose,' he said. 'I’ve . subsequently found out they have taken on another person in place of . me.' Mr Jones said his former employers refused . an appeal to review his dismissal, and said he has remained out of . work since despite attending three job interviews. 'I am trying to secure work but I am finding this extremely difficult and am now suffering from depression,' he added. Lawyers for Mr and Mrs Schwarzenbach unsuccessfully attempted to get the case thrown out at today's preliminary hearing - by claiming they had never directly employed Mr Jones. The judge heard the couple were directors of Culham Faw Estate Limited, but the sole shareholder was Hambleden Estate Inc registered in the British Virgin Islands - a 'well-known tax haven'. In turn, the sole shareholder of Hambleden Estate Inc was Black Bear Holdings SA - a foreign firm, the provenance of which remained a mystery. But the couple did not attend the hearing to explain who owns which companies, earning them stern criticism from employment judge Robin Lewis. Extensive: Another set of buildings on the Swiss tycoon and polo player's large estate near Henley-on-Thames . Today he said their failure to attend 'could be viewed as an attempt to defeat the ends of justice.' He ruled that they did employ Mr Jones, adding: 'No matter how far the chain (of companies) goes, there will eventually be a human hand operating it and pulling the strings. 'Culden Faw is owned by a chain of companies - we don’t know how many, we don’t know where they are, we don’t even know the names of all of them. 'We know two at least are offshore and one is in a well-known tax haven. I have no reason to doubt all of those arrangements are nothing other than proper and lawful. 'However, it is reasonable to infer all those arrangements have been put in place for the benefit, ultimately, of human beneficiaries.' There was 'no evidence' of those beneficiaries being 'anyone outside the Schwarzenbach family', the judge added. The estate (pictured) is owned through a chain of companies including in a 'well-known tax haven', the judge said. There was 'no evidence' of beneficiaries being 'anyone outside the Schwarzenbach family', he added . Mr Schwarzenbach owns an array of luxury properties across the world, including in Scotland and Australia. He lives in a grand mansion at Culham Court, part of the Culden Faw estate, with his wife Francesca. She is a former Miss Australia and a godmother of Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter of the Earl of Wessex. The multi-millionaire also bankrolls his own successful polo team, the Black Bears, which is based on his sprawling 3,500-acre Culden Faw Estate, comprising of the Culham Estate, Hambleden Estate and a deer park at Henley Park, Fawley.

Mr Kennedy, who was not at home at the time, is said to have phoned the house to check on his 16-year-old son - but instead was met by a stranger's voice. Police rushed to the house and arrested 53-year-old James Lacroix. He was charged with breaking and entering and was held overnight by police pending arraignment this morning. Neighbours in the small village community told police they saw the man pull into the driveway in a black Corvette about three hours earlier. When the officers arrived, they found the intruder inside the kitchen. Sergeant . Thomas Bird, of the Barnstable Police Department, told MailOnline: .

He also reportedly asked to speak to the Kennedys themselves and said he was disabled, according to the news channel WDHD. It is believed he may have got inside through an unlocked door.

The compound on Cape Cod has been in the Kennedy family for almost 90 years and includes three large homes on six acres of land. John F Kennedy's father, Joseph P Kennedy, bought a summer cottage near the plot in 1928. The home at which the intruder was found, in Irving Avenue, was bought in 1956. It was used as a base for John F Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign and later as a retreat, where he enjoyed spending time with his family until he was assassinated in 1963. It was also a favoured home of Ted Jr's father, Sentator Ted Kennedy, before his death in 2009.

"By . Dan Bloom . You had one job, ground crew. Staff at New York's Yankee stadium tussled with a storm cover for 13 minutes - leaving the infield so drenched that a win had to be declared for the home team. Thunder and lightning hit last night when the Yankees were leading 2-1 in their fifth innings against the Texas Rangers, and the protective tarp should have taken 60 seconds to roll out. Scroll down for video . Starting well: When thunder and lightning lashed New York's Yankee Stadium last night, the ground crew starting rolling out their protective tarp - but within seconds the situation had turned into an amusing farce . Bring backup! As the tarp was being rolled out, it became too weighed down to drag across the infield . But it became so drenched in the few seconds it took to unfurl that it was too heavy to drag the rest of the way across the field. As fans fled the torrential rain, chaos ensued as the ground crew first folded the tarp back over itself, then called for reinforcements. Minutes ticked by as they pulled at the sides of the gigantic cover, but it was in vain - it just wouldn't budge. Almost instantly the loose dirt in the stadium had turned to mud, splashing up onto the legs of the dejected crew and sucking down the tarp even harder. Commentators observed how crews practice bringing on the tarp time and time again to get it right, but what they were left with was a 'mess'. Dejected: A member of the ground staff pulls in vain at the giant sheet. Eventually the ball boys got involved . Chaos: Most fans didn't stick around to see the sodden crew struggle with the tarp, as they were soaked too . Eventually . more than 25 people including ball boys heaved the heavy sheet over the . infield, with some of them clambering underneath to prevent it getting . stuck to the ground. An ironic cheer went up around the 50,000-capacity baseball stadium as the Yankees themselves looked on from the dugout, bemused. It did not escape anyone's notice that the umpires then had to declare Yankees the winner - because the infield was so wet they could not continue playing. Fans on Twitter accused the crew of sabotaging the game deliberately to secure a win for the Yankees, who lost 4-2 in a game on Tuesday which included rookie errors by pitcher Shane Greene. @_rallycap tweeted: 'A tarp has helped the Yankees more than A-Rod this year.'

Now some of the most arresting 'forgotten' shots will go on display in New York after art researchers took more than two years to track them down. The images of the actress relaxing during filming breaks were taken in the mid-1950s, just as she cemented her reputation as one of the west's most enduring sex symbols . Rare: Some of the most arresting 'forgotten' shots of Marilyn Monroe will go on show in New York after art researchers took more than two years to find them.

Modelling work: This image by Mischa Pelz, a friend of the rising film star, was taken when he was hired to shoot lawn furniture with her as the model soon before the release of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes in 1953 . Taken by five photographers, they show her leaning on a helicopter and posing jokingly with a Canadian Mountie as she made films including Niagara and River of No Return. But it was not easy for photographers to capture the world's most sought-after model - and some resorted to unorthodox means. One, Lani Carlson, famously pretended he was a Chicago Tribune photographer in need of urgent Associated Press shots to gain half an hour of the film star's time. In reality he was not a newspaper photographer at all - just a sound engineer for Capitol Records with a hidden talent.

'We see a very relaxed, casual Marilyn. She was more herself in these pictures and did not portray the image that she later worked so hard to depict' - Curator Pierre Vudrag . 'It . was very exciting - I was finding photos that in many instances the . photographers themselves had not seen since they were originally taken . over 50 or 60 years ago. I was one of a few people that had ever seen . these images. 'Because .

"By . Dan Bloom . With the amount of booze flowing in Germany this week, it's surprising anyone noticed at all. As the nation toasted its first World Cup final victory for 24 years, it emerged a gang of thieves had broken into a warehouse and stolen enough beer to fill 10 trucks. The raiders prised open a small gate at the back of the building, in the western city of Krefeld, and stole 300,000 litres of beer - worth around £1.7million. Now that's a hangover: A day after Germany toasted its first World Cup final victory for 24 years, a warehouse owner in Krefeld discovered thieves had broken in and stolen enough beer to fill 10 trucks (file photo) Caught by the fizz: Police are investigating after the theft from an industrial area in Krefeld (centre) It is believed no one had checked on the warehouse's contents for almost four days. The theft was only noticed on Monday, as workers across Germany nursed hangovers from Sunday night's historic win. Police said the brazen raid could have happened at any time between 5pm on Thursday last week and noon on Monday. The beer was arranged in several pallets on the warehouse floor, said officers, which was in an industrial area on the outskirts of the city. The thieves tried a back door to the warehouse but could not get in, so went in through the front door instead and reached the beer through an office block. Witnesses saw . tractors loaded with trailers on the premises which later disappeared, but many did not assume the sight was suspicious. Toast: After the World Cup win on Sunday night, Germans had more than enough reasons to celebrate . The tractors then came back to the warehouse at regular intervals to reload before vanishing, police said. A spokesman said: 'From there, the offender transported diverse beer pallets in an amount of about 10 trucks. 'Other witnesses claimed to have seen those trucks on the A40 in the direction of Duisburg. 'It is believed that the trucks were unloaded in Duisburg and then drove back to the [warehouse].' With prices at around €3.50 (£2.77) for half a litre, the beer would have been worth around €2.1million (£1.66m). Police have not revealed what brand or brands of beer were stolen. They are, however, looking for more witnesses, or anyone who can provide information about where the beer might be stored.

"By . Damien Gayle . Former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira is to build a new 'iceberg' home in Hampstead after he was granted permission to demolish the £3million mansion in its place. Vieira's three-storey property in the leafy north London district will be torn down and replaced with a four-storey, five-bedroom palace over more than 9,000sq/ft, plans show. Camden Council has given them go-ahead after months of wrangling to accommodate neighbours who feared not only months of disruption but also that the new house would overlook their homes and gardens. Scroll down for video . How Patrick Vieira's new house, left, will look in the context of its neighbourhood in Hampstead, north London . Plans were lodged with the council more than a year ago under the name of Vieira's Trinidadian wife, Cheryl Plaza. The new home, built in dark brick, will be a 'very private space' which is 'set into the gradient of the hillside' and boasts 'views across the treetops'. The basement level will include parking for two cars - reached by a car lift and assisted by a mechanised turntable - as well as a cinema room and extensive storage space. The ground floor will have a gym, games room and bar, swimming pool, solarium and two guest suites; the first floor will have a large open plan kitchen and dining area, as well as a raised lawn area; and the third floor will have the master bedroom and two further bedrooms, all en-suite, and another balcony. According to reports, Vieira decided to demolish the existing building, which was built in the late 1980s and already includes an indoor pool, after he discovered it was riddled with damp. The proposed development as seen from another angle. Neighbours objected to the plans saying that the new house could overlook their homes, cause light pollution and that building work could damage nearby properties . But a flurry of objections, which raised fears that the new property would ruin the character of the conservation area and overlook nearby homes, made planning officials think twice about granting permission. One neighbour objected to a 20m-long window planned for the main stairwell of the home that he feared would 'spoil the quite (sic) and dark rural character of the area at night'. 'I accept that this will not result in overlooking but I am very concerned about the light spill to me and my neighbours,' he wrote. 'The glazing would light the main stairwell which feeds all rooms and is therefore likely to be lit at ALL times.' Another raised fears the plans for the excavations, which would delve nearly 5m below the foundation level of the property's north-west corner, could cause damage to nearby buildings. A third accused Vieira and his wife of failing to consult with any of the nearby neighbours in what the objection called 'this very sensitive environmental and conservation area'. 'This lack of prior neighbour consultation is extremely rare in this Conservation Area,' the objection said. 'We can only surmise that the applicant ... never intends to live in the new house proposed and so could not care about neighbourhood sentiments.' Patrick Vieira and his wife Cheryl: The couple also have a £2.2million home in Alderly Edge, Cheshire . The house as it currently looks. It dates back to the late-1980s and is being torn down now after Vieira discovered that it was riddled with damp. Neighbours suspect he wants to then sell on the new development . Following months of negotiations, the couple have made concessions, including axing plans for a roof terrace and, according to reports, agreeing to pay £48,000 towards community infrastructure. The Evening Standard quoted a planning official as saying: 'The applicant has supplied a satisfactory construction management plan to show that the proposal would not harm the local transport network, and the basement impact has been independently assessed and considered to comply with the relevant policies.' Vieira, 38, was born in Senegal but moved to France with his family when he was eight. In a glittering football career he won three Premier League titles with Arsenal, and four Serie A titles with Juventus and Internazionale. He has 107 caps for France, playing in their 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000-winning sides. He finished his career at Manchester City, where he is now manager of the club's Elite Development Squad.

A woman was forced to watch her own rape in a room full of mirrors in a swingers club, a court has heard. Jeremy Frazier Newsome Smith, 45, is alleged to have assaulted the woman after he performed a kinky show while dressed up as sitcom character Herman Munster. The woman - who was also in costume - told the court she endured the sex attack in a room lined with mirrors, so that no matter where she looked she was witnessing her own rape. 'I could see everything that was happening,' she said in videotaped testimony. 'I tried to look away but the walls were covered in mirrors so I had to watch everything.' Smith denies the allegation of rape, saying the two had consensual sex and claiming that she had 'been flirting with him throughout the evening'. The pair met at La Chambre private members club in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, at an event last October. Charlotte Baines, prosecuting, told the jury: 'This was a private members club commonly known as a swingers’ club. 'It opens its doors to members with a view to them watching or participating in sexual activity, if they wish to do so. 'Upstairs in this club there are rooms commonly known as ""play rooms"" for individuals who want to engage in sexual activity. 'The night the incident took place was the weekend before Halloween. The defendant was there with two friends, Luke Williams and Robin Colville, performing a cabaret act. 'He was dressed as Herman Munster, known as the Frankenstein monster, while he friend Mr Colville was dressed in drag as Mrs Munster, and Mr Williams was dressed as Harry Potter.' The court heard that during the night, Smith had invited the woman to take part in kinky games involving her being put into stocks and having her underwear pulled down. She said the act was 'really embarrassing' and later in the evening the defendant plied the woman and her two friends with drinks, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Miss Baines said the defendant had asked the woman to go with him upstairs, which she did at the request her friend came with her. The woman’s and defendant’s mates chatted upstairs throughout the evening, during which she told her friends 'I think he’s going to try something with me'. Miss Baines said: 'As they all left down the stairs, the defendant and the complainant were at the back of the group. 'The defendant put his arm across the stairs on the stairwell to stop her and indicated to her he wanted to go for a cigarette. 'She told him she didn’t smoke but didn’t want to kick up a fuss. The two went to an indoor smoking area in the club, which is an open air room in the club were people are permitted to smoke.' Once there, Miss Baines told the jury, the defendant began to kiss the alleged victim. The court heard that during the night, Smith had invited the woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, to take part in kinky games involving her being put into stocks and having her underwear pulled down . In a video given as evidence in court, the complainant told police: 'I just felt as though I was paralysed. I was so scared I didn’t even know what to do. I knew what was going to happen.' The complainant described how the defendant began to touch her and then raped her, while she was forced to watch in the mirror-covered walls of the club. She said that afterwards he refused to give back her underwear. Soon after, she was reunited with her friends and told them what had happened. The group alerted staff at the club before going to make a complaint at a nearby police station. Smith claims the pair add consensual sex. Miss Baines said: 'The defendant claims she was willing to enter the upstairs area of the club with him, and that they were looking through the windows of the rooms.' She added: 'The defendant says they had consensual sex, and that he kept her underwear to save her from embarrassment when her friends came into the room.' The trial continues.

"By . Dan Bloom . Changing times: Famous for going door-to-door, Jehovah's Witnesses have taken to the streets . It's a practice that's been the butt of jokes for decades: a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses turning up suited and booted on your doorstep. But the days of the 140-year-old religious order's members trudging door-to-door in the rain could soon be numbered. Thousands have switched tactics to stand on street corners in more than a dozen cities across Britain - and unusually for public preachers, they are staying almost completely silent. Leaders believe it is a better tactic in modern Britain, where people do not like being approached directly and prefer browsing as if in a shop. Three years after the same tactic was introduced in New York, witnesses have been standing on pavements in at least 13 cities across Britain and handing out tens of thousands of magazines. Unlike other evangelical preachers, they do not shout or call attention to themselves - instead standing in near-silence until someone approaches them. 'I guess that's just not our style,' said Mark O'Malley, a spokesman for the Jehovah's Witnesses at their London headquarters. 'We have used inventive approaches down the years. We used ""sound cars"" in the 1930s which would relay lectures in the street from megaphones on the roof. 'Radio was used a lot later on and our members wore placards and sandwich boards. But now it's more organised, particularly in larger cities where there's tremendous footfall. 'I think this method is effective because it allows individuals to take the initiative rather than us approaching them. 'People find certain approaches more appealing to them. If you go into a shop some people prefer to browse and then at the right time they'll be asked if they'd like some help.' Jokes: There are 8million members of the movement around the world, but they often have front doors slammed in their faces. Leaders say door-to-door work will continue but people are often not at home . Grumpy commuters already spend their time batting away free newspapers, magazines, leaflets and charity collectors - but Mr O'Malley said: 'People tell us that for them, they prefer that approach. Other cultures are similar.' Some former believers claim door-to-door preaching - which has been widely parodied for decades - is unpopular with members who earn a hostile reception on the doorstep. Former member of 14 years Scott Terry, who wrote The Truth: How a Gay Child Was Saved from Religion, said hitting the streets could be the only way to 'clock up' enough hours of service. He said: 'Jehovah's Witnesses require a certain amount of ""field service,"" or time spent recruiting, in order to maintain their standing in the congregation. 'Anyone who does not fulfill those requirements will receive admonishment from the elders, and could also be considered ""inactive"". There is a tremendous amount of pressure within the congregation to fulfill the hourly requirement.' Print run: The organisation wants to build a new headquarters the size of seven football pitches near Chelmsford, Essex, which could print 184,000 copies an hour of magazines such as The Watchtower . Mr O'Malley insisted 'nothing's changed' with the movement's stance on doorstepping, which still takes place. But he admitted: 'We find a lot of people might not be home, especially during the week. 'People we might not find door-to-door, we find in the street.' The new recruits in the street include 1,000 in London alone, with others in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Manchester, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield. There are also street 'Witnesses' in Dublin, Ireland. Media-savvy: Leaders are now analysing which themes shift the most magazines . They come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and more are women than men, but Mr O'Malley said this was because many believers have husbands who work full-time. The movement was founded in the 1870s by Charles Taze Russell, a Presbyterian from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and now has around 8million members. They adopted the name Jehovah's Witnesses in 1931 to reflect the fact that they believe only in direct worship to God (Jehovah) and not the traditional Christian Trinity of 'father, son and Holy Spirit'. Certain beliefs - including refusal to salute flags, fight in armed services or accept blood transfusions, even for children - have brought 'Witnesses' in to direct conflict with governments. They are also not accepted as a doctrine by mainstream Christianity and former members such as Mr Terry claim they are like a 'cult'. But the organisation presides over vast numbers of members worldwide and millions of pounds in funding. Next month 50,000 believers will descend on Twickenham stadium in south west London for a convention in more than a dozen languages. And in January, the global movement announced its plans to open a new British headquarters the size of seven football pitches on the outskirts of Chelmsford, Essex. If built the centre could provide a base for 800 believers, several acres of gardens and a printing room capable of churning out 184,000 magazines every hour. Jehovah's Witnesses - whose celebrity members include the singer Prince and tennis champion sisters Serena and Venus Williams - are also becoming more media-savvy. Leaders say the May issue of Awake!, their main magazine alongside The Watchtower, shifted record numbers because it was themed around stress, a general topic with which everyone could connect. In response the movement is repeating almost exactly the same theme in its September issue, which will be about 'burnout'.","Religious movement founded in U.S. became famous for knocking on doors .

"By . Dan Bloom . Lenient: Craig Real, 21, was spared jail despite previously being convicted of manslaughter . A youth stole a TV weeks after he was released from prison for manslaughter - but was spared jail because it was his first burglary. Craig Real was 16 when he and two friends beat Big Issue seller Ralph Millward to death outside a . Waitrose store in Bournemouth, Dorset, because he would not give them cigarettes. The trio were convicted of manslaughter and handed almost five years' jail each. But two months after leaving prison this year, Real broke into a garden summer house in nearby Poole and stole a TV worth £250. Bournemouth magistrates referred the case to the town's crown court because they thought their sentencing powers - of six months' jail - were not enough. But instead a judge said Real, now 21, could be spared prison and sent on a 'Thinking Skills' programme instead. Recorder Richard Onslow, said: 'You are 21 and whatever else you have . been convicted of you have no offences for burglary on your record. 'Do not regard this as a let off. You should regard it as a chance to change your life.' The two Conservative MPs for Bournemouth are now asking the Attorney General to review the sentence. Tobias Ellwood, for Bournemouth East, said: 'I am astonished. The . magistrates had clearly determined a minimum sentence of six months and . were looking for something stronger. 'This . was clearly not his first crime. You don’t somehow move into a . different category of crime and have your past misdeeds wiped clean.' Conor Burns for Bournemouth West added: 'This . young man was very lucky that he wasn’t eligible for an adult sentence . for the despicable crime he committed in [2009]. 'The . fact that he has emerged from prison and is clearly addicted to a life . of crime shows the criminal justice system is not working.' Real (left) was 16 when he and two other teenagers kicked Big Issue seller Ralph Millward (right) to death . Sentencing: Real outside a previous hearing at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court, where his case was referred to the town's crown court because magistrates decided their sentencing powers were not sufficient . Real was the eldest of three friends who were convicted of manslaughter in 2010 after a five-week trial at Winchester Crown Court. Together with Warren Crago, 16, and Jimmy Ayres. 15, he was caught on CCTV jokily re-enacting . the attack on 41-year-old Mr Millward as the trio made off from the scene. Minutes after the attack Real returned to the scene with a shopping trolley which he rammed into Mr Millward’s body. The Big Issue seller's injuries were so horrific they were compared to that of a car accident victim. Despite being under 18, the boys were named by the court after their actions were deemed so 'frankly appalling' that it was in the public . interest to know what they had done. Real was jailed to four years and nine . months. He served half that time before being released but . failed to keep to set conditions, and was rearrested to serve his full . sentence. Despite being under 18, Real - pictured this year at 21 - was named by a judge in 2010 after his actions were deemed so 'frankly appalling' that it was in the public interest to know what he had done . He was then released at the end of his term in February this year before committing the burglary on April 16. Bournemouth Crown Court heard the owners of the house in Poole, where Real lives, said they had felt 'violated' by the crime. Police discovered Real was the culprit after they found his fingerprints at the scene. Robert Grey, mitigating, pointed out . that there was no damage to the property. Real had pleaded guilty and said he only went into the . summer house because he was homeless. Recorder Onslow handed Real a 12-month community order and told him to attend a ‘Thinking Skills’ programme, which teaches young offenders basic problem skills and develops the way they think and behave. He was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to the TV's owners. A spokesman for the Attorney General said the case has not yet been formally referred to their office, but lawyers have up to 28 days to make the application. If the Attorney General deems it worthy of consideration it will be put before three Court of Appeal judges. The spokesman added: 'It only takes one person to refer a case to us and all cases are considered.'","Craig Real was 16 when he and two friends beat Ralph Millward to death .

"By . Damien Gayle . Charged: Oelwein mayor Joseph Manus, who was arrested yesterday by sheriff's deputies after a month-long investigation into alleged sexual abuse . The mayor of a Midwest town is facing a potential 125 years in prison after he was charged with the alleged sexual abuse of two young girls. Sheriff's deputies swooped on the home of Joseph Manus, mayor of Oelwein, Iowa, acting on warrants charging him with five counts of second-degree sexual abuse. The 36-year-old is accused of abusing a 14-year-old girl four times and a nine-year-old girl once between July and August 2010. Each count carries up to 25 years in prison. The investigation was not initiated by the city's own police department, according to reports. Manus was arrested by deputies from Fayette County Sheriff’s Office. A statement from the sheriff's office said some charges could not be filed because of Iowa's statute of limitations on sexual offences. Oelwein is a small , mainly white city of just more than 6,400 people in north-east Iowa. A former 'railroad town', its population has been in slow, steady decline since the 1980s when most railroad tracks around it were abandoned. City officials told the Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier they didn't know the specifics of the investigation, but they pointed out the incidents were alleged to have happended before Manus became mayor. 'The Oelwein City Council, administration would like to express our deepest concerns for those involved in today’s development,' said City Administrator Jamie Letzring in the statement. During an initial court appearance, Manus was ordered held on a $125,000 bond. He said he anticipated retaining attorney Craig Ament, who didn't immediately return a message left by the Associated Press. After moving to the town only six years ago, Manus narrowly defeated the incumbent mayor, Larry Murphy, in November 2013 and took office in January after the tally was upheld by a recount. Mr Murphy told the WCF Courier: 'If it’s true, it’s sad for the community. 'Obvious, it was a close election, and I think the people of the community were ready for a change. But I think there’s always a risk voting for someone who, I would say, most of the community didn't know very well.' Local people were shocked to hear of the accusations. Sarah Lewis, who has lived in Oelwein for 12 years, told CBS2 Iowa: 'Obviously it strikes harder than it would in a bigger town. 'It's a very unfortunate thing but it's things like this that brings the community together.' Pedro Velez, another local, worried that the allegations might 'tear this town apart'. 'There are gonna be people who say he couldn't have done it. There are others that are gonna say hang him, get rid of him,' he told CBS2. Sheriff Marty Fisher said his office launched the investigation a month ago after receiving information from the Iowa Department of Human Services.","Joseph Manus charged with five counts of sexual abusing two girls in 2010 .

"By . Damien Gayle . Behind bars: Timothy Walker was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole after pleading guilty to the murder of police Sergeant Derek Johnson . A methamphetamine addict who was living out of his car has been jailed for life for shooting dead a police officer who came to check on him when he had broken down. In a courtroom in West Jordan, Utah, Timothy Walker pleaded guilty to the murder of Sergeant Derek Johnson, 32, and was immediately sentenced to life with no possibility of parole. The family of Sergeant Johnson, a married father of one, had considered asking prosecutors to push for a death sentence, but said they were happy with the penalty handed to his killer. Randy Johnson, Sergeant Johnson's father, told KUTV: 'Today the streets are safer, because the man that shot Derek is now off the streets and can't hurt anyone else.' Walker, 34, had been by the sitting in a broken down Volvo by the side of the road with his girlfriend, Traci Vaillancourt, also 34, when Sergeant Johnson had pulled over to check on them on September 1 last year. Sergeant Johnson had not even stepped out of his patrol car when Walker shot him in the right side of his torso with a 9mm Glock pistol. The bullet pierced several of his organs, including his heart, KUTV reported. Walker continued to fire as the Sergeant Walker drove away, the court heard. Critically injured, the policeman eventually veered off the road and smashed into a tree. He later died in hospital. Walker then turned the gun on Vaillancourt, shooting her in the back, before trying to kill himself with a bullet to the head. He missed and the bullet ended up going through his jaw and mouth. Vaillancourt also survived and was left with a bullet lodged in her sternum. She still faces two counts of obstruction of justice after allegedly lying to officers investigating Sergeant Johnson's death. As well as the aggravated murder of Sergeant Johnson, Walker also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of Vaillancourt, three counts of third-degree felony discharge of a firearm, and third degree felony possession or use of a firearm by a restricted person. He apologised to the court for his actions. Sergeant Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a six-year-old son, Bensen. Walker and Vaillancourt also have a child together, a daughter who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother. Sergeant Johnson, who had stopped to check on Walker and his girlfriend Traci Vaillancourt, had not even stepped out of his car when Walker shot him. The father-of-one is pictured right with his son Bensen . Walker continued to fire as the Sergeant Walker drove away, the court heard. Critically injured, the policeman eventually veered off the road and smashed into a tree. He later died in hospital . Speaking last year in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King revealed her sister's downward spiral from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend. After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister said. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' Ms King told KSL.com last year. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. Ms King last saw her sister and Walker the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behaviour. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. Walker then turned the gun on Vaillancourt, left, shooting her in the back, before trying to kill himself with a bullet to the head. He missed and the bullet ended up going through his jaw and mouth, right . The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ""I never pictured my life turning out like this"",' Ms King told the newspaper. Vaillancourt, pictured right in an old family photo, had slipped into a downward spiral from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend before the killing happened . According to Ms King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. She says the pair had been living in and out of motels and, at the time of Sergeant Walker's murder, were living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' Ms King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. After yesterday's sentencing, Mr Johnson, Sergeant Johnson's father, said: 'There's a finality in this that was very difficult to deal with, but there's also comfort that we're reaching to that point where we can say, ""Yes, we can now move forward."" 'We can find those things that bring us comfort, that help us to celebrate Derek's life and also to pay back to the community.'","Family of Sergeant Derek Johnson say they are satisfied with the sentence .

"By . Damien Gayle . Appeal: Kester David, whose badly burnt body was found, behind a Travis Perkins building in Bloomfield Lane, Palmers Green, London on July 7, 2010 . The 80-year-old mother of a man burned to death four years ago is pleading for witnesses to help unravel the mystery surrounding her son's death. Kester David, 53, a bus driver, was found badly burned beneath a railway arch in Palmers Green, North London, in July 2010, but the circumstances of his death have never been explained. The Metropolitan Police initially insisted he took his own life but, after an inquiry revealed a 'catalogue of errors' in the investigation, his family accused its officers of failing to fulfil their duties because he was black. Now Mr David's mother, who has asked not to be named, is imploring anyone who knows anything about her son's death to come forward to help the investigation. 'When the detectives informed me that the burnt body of a bus driver had been found, the one thing I hoped in my heart was that he was already dead when he was set alight,' she said. 'No mother should have to bury their child under such horrifying circumstances. 'I appeal to anyone out there who may have heard his cry for help or seen anything unusual on the night of 6-7 July 2010 to come forward however small the information. 'I am sure a third party was involved and they must be stopped from doing this again.' Mr David worked part-time for Arriva from their Wood Green depot, and was also a DJ, using the stage name DJ Bain. He worked for an internet radio station in Stoke Newington called Lynx Radio for a short time before he died. The fitness enthusiast, who was killed by burns and inhalation of fumes, was found under a railway arch at Broomfield Lane in Enfield that can only be reached by climbing over a metal fence. CCTV from a nearby Travis Perkins yard captured a bright light coming from under the arches in the early hours of the morning before Mr David was found, and witnesses heard screams at that time.

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, said: 'Kester was a hard working, well-respected individual in his local community and I am committed to finding out why he died. 'Despite continued efforts to identify the circumstances surrounding Kester's death, it remains unexplained and we appeal to anyone who can assist with information to come forward. 'Kester's mother is now 80 years of age and one can only imagine the agony she has endured since July 2010 not knowing why her son died.' His family have been fiercely critical of the initial bungled inquiry into his death, and have accused Scotland Yard of racism. A report into the way officers handled the investigation found that they missed CCTV footage which has since been lost, botched DNA analysis and failed to secure crucial mobile phone data. Two witnesses who came forward the day after Mr David's death were not interviewed for more than a year. One of them said they heard screams of fear. Another said he saw a van near to the scene and two white men, an unusual sight in the area at 4.20am.

"By . Damien Gayle . Toronto's controversial mayor Rob Ford last night vowed to have another 'crack' at nixing his city's land transfer tax at his first campaign debate since leaving rehab. The quip provoked raucous laughter from a spirited audience at a church in the Toronto's Scarborough district, which was split between vocal supporters and opponents of the mayor. Seeking re-election after a term marred by scandal, including being forced to admit smoking crack cocaine, Mr Ford faced rival candidates as the race began for October's municipal poll in earnest. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford at a campaign debate in Scarborough, Ontario, last night where he attempted to portray a stellar track record in office as the race begins for the next mayoral election in October . 'I have proven in the last 14 years in government that I’ve watched every single one of your tax dollars,' said the mayor, to a chorus of cheers and jeers, according to Global News. 'I have created jobs, I have worked with youth, nobody’s worked with youth closer than I have ... folks, my record speaks for itself. It’s a record of success, success, success.' Mr Ford, 45, only returned to work a fortnight ago after spending two months at the Greenstone rehab centre in Bala, Ontario. He sought help after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford admitted last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' after reports of a similar video, following months of denials. Even since returning to the mayor's office, a largely symbolic role after his powers were stripped by the city council, he has admitted that he can't guarantee that he'll never relapse. But Mr Ford's proclivity for crack, a highly addictive derivative of cocaine, seems to have had little impact on his supporters, who booed each time one of his rivals mentioned their man's drug use. Supporters dressed in 'Ford Nation' T-shirts, pins and flags heckled his political opponents and yelled in support each time he spoke on stage. Mayoral contender Olivia Chow, left, applauds during the debate, where she pointed out that, contrary to Mr Ford's assertions to have created jobs, one in five young people in the area are out of work . Mr Ford's opponents came armed with sharp barbs, directly contradicting his claims to have looked after public spending and increase employment. Olivia Chow, of the New Democratic Party, said: 'Mr. Ford, your record is clear: one out of five young people cannot find a job. How is it that Scarborough is booming?' Progressive Conservative candidate John Tory pointed out that two municipal renovations, of Union Station and Nathan Phillips Square, had run over budget. 'Project after project after project, on your watch, when you’re the mayor,' he was quoted by the Toronto Star as saying. 'We know what you were doing — it wasn’t managing the taxpayers’ money!' Mr Ford's activities while in office have earned him global notoriety, something which Mr Tory commented on as candidates left the hustings last night. 'He’s a laughing stock. People all over the world know who Rob Ford is, but they know it in a bad way,' he was quoted by Global News as saying.","Mr Ford came back to work a fortnight ago after two months in rehab .

As Luis Suarez waits to find out if he has a future in football, rival players in Brazil are continuing to mock his alleged bite on the shoulder of an Italian defender.

The grinning Juventus centre-back posted a picture of a hotel maid biting his shoulder, in much the same way as Suarez appeared to on Tuesday night.

An . adidas spokesman said: ‘adidas is aware of the issue involving Luis . Suarez. We await FIFA’s full investigation into this matter and will . respond accordingly.’ Gambling . company 888poker have Suarez as a brand ambassador and said: ‘Following . recent allegations made against Luis Suarez, we are reviewing our . relationship with him. We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’ Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez . emerged from the Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio de Janeiro shortly after . midnight local time to say the hearing would continue on Thursday. Valdez . said: 'We know they met for a long time but we don't know if that means . a good or a bad situation. They will continue in the morning.' Suarez's . lawyer Alejandro Balbi, who is also a Uruguay FA board member travelled . to Rio to defend the Liverpool striker and claimed there is a European . campaign against him led by England and Italy. An . outcome is expected well ahead of Uruguay's match with Italy on . Saturday and Suarez's sponsors are keeping a close eye . on the verdict. Step 1: Suarez approaches Chiellini from behind during a Uruguay attack . Stage 2: The Liverpool striker moves his head close to Chiellini's shoulder as he prepares to attack . Stage 3: Suarez appears to clamp his jaws down and bite Chiellini's shoulder . The video evidence appears damning and one senior FIFA official with experience of disciplinary cases, who asked to remain anonymous, believes the biting should be judged to be at least as serious as spitting, which carries a minimum six-game ban which would see Suarez's World Cup brought to an abrupt halt. However there are influential voices who are trying to bring pressure to bear for the player to be dealt with more leniently. According to Uruguay newspaper Subrayado, the most powerful figures in South American football gathered in the Copacabana Palace to try to secure a much less severe sanction. Shocking: Chiellini displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident, but the referee wasn't swayed . These included Argentina's long-standing vice-president Julio Grondona who is second only to Sepp Blatter in the pecking order, the president of CONMEBOL Eugenio Figueredo and his predecessor, Nicolas Leoz, who are both Uruguayan. The independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, has a range of sanctions available up to 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all football. A worldwide ban would impact on his playing for Liverpool but there is no precedent for such a sanction happening. Trouble ahead: FIFA will continue to discuss disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez on Thursday . It remains unclear whether Suarez's . previous biting bans - 10 games for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic . and seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal - would be . taken into consideration, but the panel do have that power if they wish. A . FIFA spokeswoman said: 'They can take in all elements they deem . necessary.' Suarez has not appeared in person at the disciplinary . hearing. There are also reports that the Uruguay FA are claiming pictures of teeth-marks on Chiellini's shoulder were digitally altered.","Giorgio Chiellini furious after Luis Suarez appeared to bite him on Tuesday .

"By . Damien Gayle . Flaming hot: Actress Karen Gillan who, like 650,000 of her fellow Scots, has red hair, a trait scientists claim could be threatened by climate change . Global warming could lead to the extinction of Scotland's redheads, expects have claimed. Experts believe that Scotland’s gloomy climate has led to a red hair emerging as a genetic adaptation to help exploit rare sunny days and boost Vitamin D production. But as the world warms up, some predict that the change in climate will lead to more sunny days for the Scots - meaning they will no longer be so well adapted to their environment. Only about 1-2 per cent of the world’s . population has red hair but in Scotland the figure is much higher, with . about 13 per cent, or 650,000 people, with flaming locks. Alastair Moffat, managing director of genetic testing company ScotlandsDNA, said the country’s dull weather was responsible for a larger number of flame-haired men and women being born. Dr Moffat told the Daily Record: 'We think red hair in Scotland, Ireland and the north of England is adaptation to the climate. We do not get enough sun and have to get all the vitamin D we can. 'If it was to get less cloudy and there was more sun, there would be fewer people carrying the gene.' Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16, which causes a mutation. That means a person who does not have red hair can still produce red-haired children if they and their partner is a carrier of the gene. Despite concerns that red hair dying out, many experts say it is likely to continue for many generations. Research publised last year by BritainsDNA found that 20million people in the UK and Ireland have ginger genes. The . most red-headed part of Britain and Ireland is the South-East of . Scotland with Edinburgh as a red-hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of . the three common red hair gene variants. But . the biggest surprise revealed by the research is just over 34 per cent . of the population of parts of the north of England are carriers, making . Yorkshire and Humberside as red-headed as Ireland. Football boss Alex McLeish, another Scot: Many experts say red hair is likely to continue for many generations . The findings are ironic in the light of research by the Centre for Equality Policy Research think tank which claimed that redheads suffer more discrimination per head of population than ethnic minorities. They conducted an experiment and found that 'a job applicant with ginger hair is seven times more likely to be rejected than a dark-haired applicant, and eight times more likely than a fair-haired applicant.' Barbara McNulty, lecturer in psychology at the University of the Western Isles, and herself a redhead, said: ‘Red hair still gives out deep cultural signals. 'Women, for example, are wild and quick-tempered, while ginger-haired men are unattractive and geeky.’","Experts believe Scotland's gloomy climate is behind emergence of red hair .

Police stepped in to escort Wanyama to safety after the Southampton midfielder was targeted by fans. Kenya's coach, Adel Amrouche, was sacked immediately after the game. Lesotho will now join Uganda, Botswana, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Mozambique and another surprise, Rwanda, in the final group stage of the qualifiers. Rescued: Southampton's Victor Wanyama had to be saved from angry fans by police after Kenya's match . The seven will now compete with seeded teams like Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana for the 15 places in the tournament, to be played in Morocco early next year. Morocco has already qualified as host. The Kenyan federation said hours after the second leg against Lesotho in Nairobi that Algerian coach Adel Amrouche and his staff had all been sacked due to Kenya's 'disastrous elimination.' 'They have let the country down and as such they can have no further role to play in the affairs of the national team with immediate effect,' Football Kenya said. Amrouche had already been banned for a year by the Confederation of African Football for spitting at a match official in a qualifier earlier this year, a punishment the Kenyan federation was appealing. Lesotho, a southern African nation of around 2 million people, has never qualified for Africa's top tournament. It'll now compete with Burkina Faso, Angola and Gabon for one of two automatic places at the finals from that group.

For Jimmy, all the lads can rally around him – he’s a stalwart of our side, an outstanding bowler with a fantastic record. ‘It’s probably a tactic a little bit from India if we’re being honest, and we just can rally around him. Hopefully he can get this ball swinging at certain times in this Test match and Jimmy can let his cricket do the talking.’","Anderson had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Gary Ballance for seven .

The Liverpool winger saw red following a clash with Antonio Valencia, who reacted furiously to a wild lunge by the 19-year-old. Valencia also walked for his part in the incident. Sterling was consoled as he walked down the tunnel by Steven Gerrard - who, as it happens, is one of the other 12 players to be sent off while on England duty. Seeing red: Raheem Sterling is sent off for England after his grapple with Antonio Valencia (below) Stranglehold: Valencia grabs Sterling round the throat before the pair are dismissed .

Wayne Rooney, July 2006 vs Portugal . Rob Green, October 2009 vs Ukraine . Wayne Rooney, October 2011 vs Montenegro . Steven Gerrard, September 2012 vs Ukraine . The first player to see red as an England player was Alan Mullery, in 1968 against Yugoslavia. Alan Ball was next, in Poland five years later, and then came Trevor Cherry, the only other England man apart from Sterling to be shown a red card in a friendly. Ray Wilkins was the first England player to be dismissed at a World Cup, against Morocco in 1986 and he compounded the offence by throwing the ball towards the Paraguayan official and hitting him with it. That was it until the most famous red card in England's international history. In St Etienne in 1998, David Beckham was felled by Diego Simeone and instinctively and petulantly flicked his leg back at the Argentine, who went down rather theatrically. Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen sent off Beckham, England went out on penalties and effigies of the Manchester United star, who would go on to captain his country with distinction, were burned. That began a spate of sendings-off (in relative terms) at the end of the 1990s. Beckham's former United team-mate Paul Ince was dismissed against Sweden in 1998 and a year later Paul Scholes saw red against the same opponents and should have seen red earlier in the match for an horrendous challenge on Hakan Mild. David Batty met with the same fate later that year against Poland. We were two years into the new millennium before the next England player was sent off, Alan Smith for a ludicrous late challenge during a draw with Macedonia. End of the World (Cup): David Beckham is sent off against Argentina at France 98 . Red mist: Wayne Rooney (second right) reacts incredulously to being sent off against Portugal . Off you go: Steven Gerrard (second left) cannot believe it after being sent off against Ukraine . Three years later Beckham had the dubious honour of being the first England player to be sent off twice for his country when he had to go after picking up two bookings in two second-half minutes against Austria. Next came another famous case of the World Cup red mist. A barely-fit Wayne Rooney saw his frustration boil over against Portugal and he went after stamping on a sensitive area of Ricardo Carvalho - with a wink from Cristiano Ronaldo to send him on his way. The next sending-off was nowhere near as crucial, as Rob Green was given his marching orders within the first 15 minutes of a dead rubber in Ukraine, which the home side won 1-0. He did, however, become the first England goalkeeper to be dismissed. Horror tackle: Paul Scholes was only booked for this challenge on Hakan Mild but was later sent off . Walk of shame: Alan Mullery trudges off after becoming the first England player to be sent off . Rooney joined Beckham in the double red card club when he famously and ridiculously kicked out at Montenegro defender Miodrag Dzudovic during a turbulent time in his personal life. The dismissal meant Rooney missed the first two matches of Euro 2012. And finally, Gerrard was given two yellow cards against Ukraine in 2012. Now Sterling has become the unlucky 13th - at least he is in some illustrious company.","Sterling dismissed following a clash with Antonio Valencia .

"By . Phil Gradwell . Follow @@GraddersOnline . When a young footballer receives his first wage packet, you would expect them to treat themselves to something nice and maybe expensive. But Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden did something a bit different - he paid for his dad Brian to have cancer treatment. In a Facebook Q & A with fans on Thursday night, the 28-year-old was asked what he did with his first wage. Generous: Stuart Holden, pictured as a Houston Dynamo player in 2006, gave his first wage packed to his father to fund his cancer treatment . Fans' favourite: Holden (left) is well liked by supporters at Bolton . Joy: Just after his latest injury, Holden announced his engagement to Karalyn West . His answer was: 'Gave it all to my dad for his cancer treatment', which elicited the response 'God bless you Stuart Holden'. Holden's father Brian battled pancreatic cancer for six years before his death in 2009, which prompted the USA star to say: 'He was my best friend. It’s such a cliché, but if I could be half the man he was, I will have lived a good life. He always put his family first no matter what.' It wasn't all sweetness and light in the Q & A, however, as the midfielder did manage to have a sly dig at Manchester United defender Jonny Evans, who broke his leg with a reckless challenge in 2011. Despite having previously said he forgave the Northern Irishman for the tackle which put him out for six months, when asked if he liked Evans, Holden replied: 'Hmmmmmmmmmm!' Holden, who has played just nine matches since that tackle at Old Trafford, is currently out for six to nine months after a knee operation for an injury sustained in a reserve match against Everton. However he has rejoined the Bolton first team for training and will hope that his contract, which is up in the summer, will be renewed.

"By . Liam Blackburn, Press Association . Corry Evans wants Blackburn to be sitting top of the Sky Bet Championship on Friday night and hopes that is a position they never deviate far from throughout the season. Rovers entertain Cardiff, who were one of the three sides relegated from the Barclays Premier League last year, at Ewood Park to kick off the new domestic campaign. The top tier is a division Blackburn have not been in since 2012 but, after ending the previous season on a 12-game unbeaten run and experiencing a much-welcome summer of stability, the belief is that they can follow their east Lancashire neighbours Burnley in winning promotion. 'We're wanting to get promotion, be it automatic or through the play-offs; that's our goal,' Evans told rovers.co.uk . On the up! Corry Evans wants to help Blackburn back to the Premier League this season . 'It's really everyone's goal in this division because anyone can beat anyone. But I think the experience we had as a team last year gelled us well. We know our style and we know the way we want to play. Hopefully we can put that into good practice this year.' Although Rovers finished the 2013-14 season with a flourish, they ultimately left themselves too much to do when it came to creeping into the play-offs. Evans, therefore, knows that it is crucial Gary Bowyer's side begin on a brighter note this time around. 'It sets out a marker to the rest of the league as well,' he said. 'We're the first team to open the season on a Friday and, who knows, we could be sitting top of the table come Friday night. It's important we start with a bang and put a marker down for where we go from there.' Blackburn discovered just how difficult the Championship can be when they first dropped out of the top flight, and they would have experienced back-to-back relegations were it not for Jordan Rhodes' goals. Top boyo! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Cardiff are favourites to be promoted from the Championship . However, several bookmakers have Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Cardiff as favourites to win the Championship title, just as they did two seasons ago. 'I think it's a good bet,' Solskjaer, speaking at his Thursday morning press conference, said of the Bluebirds being tagged favourites. 'I hope so, but then again this league is tough. There's at least five or six that can look at themselves as candidates to go up. 'Blackburn, Fulham and Norwich - there's at least five or six that can go up and we play a few in the first eight games so let's see.' The Norwegian has presided over a period of change ahead of his first full campaign in the hot seat, with Federico Macheda and Adam Le Fondre adding to a bevy of attacking options. The likes of Fraizer Campbell, Jordan Mutch and Steven Caulker have departed, though, with Chile's World Cup star Gary Medel expected to follow suit. Mutch ado about nothing: The Cardiff manager insists he was right to release several star players . And Solskjaer is adamant Cardiff made the right decision to cash in on those players. 'When they don't want to sign a new contract I don't want them here anyway,' he said.

England has never been a country synonymous with penalty success, but the women's hockey team went some way to making up for years of hurt by winning their shoot-out to reach the Commonwealth Games final. Bronze medallists in Delhi four years ago, they are guaranteed to go at least one better in Glasgow after edging a tense semi-final with New Zealand to set up a gold medal match with favourites Australia. It had looked for a long time like teenager Lily Owsley's first-half goal would be the difference for England at the Glasgow National Hockey Centre, only for Katie Glynn to snatch a last-gasp leveller. Silver: England have guaranteed themselves a medal with a 4-1 penalty shoot-out victory over New Zealand . Draw: The match was all-square at 1-1 on the whistle but England scraped through and they will face Australia . England were not to be denied, though, with goalkeeper Maddie Hinch performing heroics in the shoot-out, denying three Kiwi penalties to help secure a thrilling 4-1 penalty win. 'I think in hockey we tend to do alright with penalties, so we had a bit of confidence going into it,' said Hinch. 'It is a case of the girls putting the goals in as well, so the fact they took them gave me some help as well. 'I am renowned for being a bit of geek when it comes to these things. I had done a lot of homework before, so I knew what they would probably resort to doing under pressure. 'I felt ready and it was just a case of going out and executing.' Hinch laughed when it was suggested she could teach the footballers a thing or two and was understandably delighted after the match.

The Hockeyroos have won three of the four Commonwealth tournaments and head into the match as reigning champions, yet Hinch is confident of causing an upset.

Out: De Jong was certain to miss the rest of Holland's World Cup campaign with a groin injury . Game over? The defensive midfielder is an important part to Louis van Gaal's side in the World Cup . A post on Holland's official Twitter account, KNVB, said: 'Nigel de Jong has a tear in his groin muscle. He’s probably out for two to four weeks. De Jong continues rehabilitation with Oranje.' Even in the best case scenario, given the final is on July 13, the AC Milan midfielder would almost certainly not have enough time to recover. Van Gaal described De Jong’s absence from Saturday’s quarter-final as a 'big setback' so the full severity of the injury will be an even bigger blow. 'An MRI examination at hospital confirmed that Nigel de Jong is struggling with a tear in his groin muscle,' the KNVB said in a statement.

The 18-year-old left-back is one of the hottest prospects in world football, with Manchester United pushing to take him from Southampton this summer. That deal could reportedly see Shaw become the most expensive teenager of all-time - a lofty price tag which comes thanks to his fine performances for club and now country.

'It was unbelievable to play in a World Cup game - the biggest stage in football,' Shaw, who turns 19 on July 12, said. 'It is something I will learn from but, on the other side, I am devastated we didn't get the win. 'We created a lot of chances - that is something that happened in the other two games we played. 'We created a lot of chances but we have just been a bit unfortunate not to put them away. 'Whether you play or not, you gain massive experience.

VIDEO England have bright future - Juninho . Shaw has taken to the pressures of international football impressively, with his performance against Costa Rica one which belied his tender years. 'I've had that a lot but I just focus on my main game and what I do for my club,"" the Saints left-back said when his on-field maturity was brought up. 'I spoke to Frank Lampard before the game and he just said 'do what you do for your club'. I took that on board and tried to play my normal game.

Looking forward: Roy Hodgson knows England realistically need something from the game in order to progress . Oscar Tabarez's side are in the same boat after suffering an embarrassing 3-1 loss to Costa Rica, meaning defeat would all-but end either sides' hopes of making it out of Group D. 'It's massive for us,' England midfielder Lallana said. 'We have to go all-out, but we know we need the win and we're confident. 'There were signs the other night that we're close and the lads know that it's all-or-nothing really. 'We've got great confidence in the camp and I'm certainly confident that we're going to get the win. 'We knew from the start that we'd be in a tough group and the Uruguayans are a tough team, but we're a strong team and we've got a great group of players. 'With just a few tweaks we can get this result.' Those adaptations were worked on during a closed training session at England's Rio de Janeiro training base on Tuesday. That's better! Wayne Rooney is expected to play in a more central role against Uruguay on Thursday . It appears those changes will see Wayne Rooney return to his favoured number 10 role against Uruguay, with Danny Welbeck playing on the left and Raheem Sterling wide right. 'Roy's had a day with the whole squad, working on a few things that he wanted to get across to the group, but as I said there were positive signs,' Lallana, likely to start from the bench again, said. 'We know we need to improve on the result, definitely, and on the performance if we can. 'If our performance is up there like it was the other night - and if we maybe work defensively on a couple of issues - then we're certainly confident of getting the three points.' Watching brief: Lallana is expected to start the game on the bench and come on as it progresses . In-form Daniel Sturridge completes England's exciting attacking quintet and, with more exciting talent waiting in the wings, Lallana believes they will soon defeat a top side. 'People have been talking about our creative play but I think it's maybe about that final pass, final cross or final finish,' the Southampton captain added. 'You can see that it's there but it's just about getting it over the line. One of these days we're going to put three or four past a top team. 'I see it in training, I see it in games, we just need that rub of the green and extra bit of confidence and then I think we will get that result.'","Southampton captain likely to start on the bench this Thursday .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Under-fire Wayne Rooney remains a 'world-class player' in the opinion of Raheem Sterling and one who the England teenager is honoured to be learning from every day. The 28-year-old Rooney knows all too well about the scrutiny that comes with representing the Three Lions, having been the focus of national team's hopes since bursting onto the scene at Euro 2004. But Sterling is also mindful of taking to the field opposite Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez, who is a doubt for Uruguay's match with England on Thursday following knee surgery. Praise: Raheem Sterling (left) insists that England team-mate (right) Wayne Rooney remains 'world class' Smiles: Sterling believes Rooney could still perform a big role for England but is happy to keep playing at 10 . He said: 'I'd rather not see him on the pitch, really. 'He is a great player, but I don't think we really need to talk too much of his qualities because we all know what he can do. 'All the lads have played against him before, know what he is about. 'We know he has scored some spectacular goals and we will do our best to keep him at bay.' Rooney's standing meanwhile saw him dominate the build-up to England's World Cup opener against Italy, as well as the fallout to Saturday's promising, if frustrating, 2-1 defeat. A muted performance in an unfavoured wide role in Manaus have led to calls for him to dropped, whereas at the other end of the spectrum the talk surrounding Sterling has intensified following an exciting performance. The 19-year-old is all-but certain to start the crunch encounter with Uruguay - a match he approaches without the burden of expectation thanks to Rooney's words of wisdom. Teacher: Sterling (left) says he learns things every day from Rooney (right) in training . Under pressure: Rooney was poor in an unfamiliar position on the left for England against Italy in Manaus . 'I speak to him a lot,' Sterling said. 'He just says to relax, express yourself and enjoy the game, really, and not to think too much about what is going on and to just play your normal game and you'll be fine. 'Some of the stuff he does with the ball, you try to take little clips out of his play and try to really learn from that. 'He is a world-class player, I've watched him growing up. He is someone I looked up to so to have trained with him at this camp has been a real honour, really. 'He works really hard and is always improving as well, so for someone like that for me to look up to I am really glad to have him the team.' Rooney's advice is clearly working, with Sterling shaking-off the understandable pre-match nerves to create havoc within the Italian ranks. The teenager was quick to insist that anxiety was down to the occasion rather than the position he was playing, given his role down the middle saw Rooney shunted out wide. Decisions: Roy Hodgson (right) is contemplating whether to keep Rooney (left) on the left . Feared: Uruguay's Luis Suarez (right) is not a player who Sterling wants to see line-up against England . A winger by trade, it meant Sterling was also playing out of position and led one reporter to ask whether it would work if they swapped roles for the Group D clash with Uruguay. 'It is up to the manager to decide, at the end other day,' Sterling said. 'That is my normal position out on the wing, so with his vision and his passing abilities and my running abilities, it could be a really, really good thing. 'But, as I said, it is down to manager at the end of the day.' Fitness battle: Suarez has been training following knee surgery but is a doubt to start against England .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Leighton Baines does not believe England's World Cup preparations could have gone any better, thanks not only to the acclimatisation process but the club-like bond that it has helped create. The Three Lions are now just a day away from their Group D opener against Italy in the suffocating humidity of the Amazon jungle. Roy Hodgson's side have spent time in the Algarve, Miami and Rio de Janiero to prepare for the tough conditions of Manaus, while warm-up matches against Peru, Ecuador and Honduras have shown them first-hand the kind of opponents they could face in Brazil. Team spirit: England left-back Leighton Baines says the World Cup squad have a 'club-like' spirit in Brazil . Smile! The England team pose for a photo on the bus ahead of their opener against Italy on Saturday . Furthermore, Baines says the preparations have helped the Three Lions cultivate the kind of togetherness normally only seen at clubs. 'I don't think it could have gone much better to be honest,' Baines said. 'It's been really enjoyable, we've got some really good work in and spent some good time together. 'The preparation in terms of the heat and the opponents has been really good.'For the time I've been involved with England, this is as good a group as there's been. 'There's a real good spirit throughout the camp and part of that is probably down to the preparation we've been doing. 'We've been working hard but have obviously been spending a few weeks together that has enabled us to get that kind of club feel to the international set-up.' While the preparations may have been impressive, Baines knows now they have to translate that positive work onto the field. Warm up: Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Baines gear up in Miami . There are few tougher opening opponents than four-time World Cup winners Italy, but England enter the match with an air of confidence just two years after exiting the European Championships to the them. 'We're looking at [Italy] and being prepared for what they may have, but we're focusing more on what we can do,' Baines told www.thefa.com . 'I think they'll be doing similar things. There will be a lot of players in our squad that they'll be doing their homework on and trying to make sure they've got ideas on how to stop them. 'You know what to expect from a side like Italy, they are one of the top sides in the world, full of good footballers and they've tended to play in a certain style for a number of years, so we are preparing for that. 'We're looking forward to the game. We were talking before about the weather and things like that, but I don't think there's anyone who is really going to get an advantage from the weather. It's going to be more or less the same for both sides.' England may, though, have gained a small advantage from the fact they arrived in Manaus a day earlier than the Azzurri. No fear: Baines says England are focusing on their own strengths, and not what Italy can do . Hodgson's side made the long trip over from their Rio de Janeiro base on Thursday morning, whereas Italy will only arrive in the Amazon on the eve of the game. 'It was about a three-and-a-half hour flight down to Manaus,' Baines said after the 1,774-mile journey. 'After arriving here at the hotel, we had a bit of work on the bikes to get the journey out of our legs and then watched the [Brazil v Croatia] game. 'There was a good reception, young kids I'm sure were excited to see some of their idols, people like Stevie and Wayne. 'It's great to get down here to Manaus and it puts us closer to being in match mode. It's exciting.' Baines is all-but certain to start at left-back for England on Saturday, playing alongside Everton team-mate Phil Jagielka. The other Evertonian in the 23-man squad is far less likely to start but has certainly made an impression, with many comparing 20-year-old Ross Barkley to the Wayne Rooney that burst onto the scene at Euro 2004. Team-mates: Everton duo Baines and Phil Jagielka are both expected to start in Manaus . 'We know plenty about Jags because he's been around longer than Ross has,' Baines added. 'He's unbelievable for us as a club, he's our captain and has been amazing over the years, he just gets on with his job. 'He's the type of player we always trust if we're on attack and it breaks down, and you see someone coming up against him, you would always back him in any situation like that. He's a terrific defender. 'Ross we're starting to see him develop and it's exciting to watch him grow. 'He's one of the exciting players we've got in the squad, he comes on in games, or if he starts a game, he can produce something out of nothing and get people of their seats.'","Baines says England's preparations couldn't have been much better .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . First it was a blood clot, then a broken jaw, but at last Gary Cahill can look forward to his first major international tournament with England. The 28-year-old centre-back has come a long way since the 2010 World Cup, when his chances of making the squad were extinguished by a blood clot in his upper chest. At that time Cahill was an outside bet, but when the European Championship came around two years later he was a sure thing until sustaining a double fracture of the jaw in a warm-up match against Belgium. VIDEO: Scroll down for Cahill: World Cup sweeter for me after Euros jaw fracture blow . Ready: Gary Cahill is set to start in the heart of defence for England at the World Cup in Brazil . Battler: The defender collides with Honduras forward Jerry Bengston during their match in Miami on Saturday . Now, though, the 28-year-old centre-back is heading to the World Cup, having come through Saturday's 0-0 ill-tempered draw with Honduras unscathed, and it feels particularly special. 'It does, because it is my first tournament,' Cahill said. 'I have waited a long time to come and I was really excited previously. 'The World Cup before I was an outside shot of making the club and I had my blood clot. 'Then I was one game away and I broke my jaw - it was like, 'Is this not for me?'. So for me to be involved in this is massive. 'It's been good of late. Not that long ago I wasn't really in the frame or I was grafting to get in the squad and just be a part of it, but now I feel like I'm a big part of it, which is pleasing. 'It shows how far I have come and I am obviously really happy.' Cahill is not only part of the squad but an almost certain starter at centre-back alongside Phil Jagielka in the Group D opener against Italy on June 14. Overcoming the four-time World Cup winners will be no mean feat for Roy Hodgson's men, given Italy have the likes of Gianluigi Buffon, Daniele De Rossi and Andrea Pirlo at their disposal. Partners in crime: Cahill and Phil Jagielka (left) have become England's regular centre back partnership . Starting line up? England's 11 from their final warm-up game looks set to be their first choice team for Italy game . Furthermore, the Azzurri will have former Manchester City man Mario Balotelli leading the attacking line. Balotelli is capable of everything from the sublime to the ridiculous, and Cahill said: 'That's dangerous isn't it because you never know - will he turn up, will he not? 'He's got potential to stick it into the top corner from 30 yards. He's an unpredictable player but on his day obviously one of the best. 'I played against him a couple of times at City and he's been tough. I played against him another time when he came off after 60, 70 minutes.'He is unpredictable. At times he can be world class. But he's certainly one to watch out for.' While at times erratic, Balotelli was one of the Premier League's most exciting characters during his time at the Etihad Stadium. The league is set to lose another big character imminently, with David Luiz set to join Paris St Germain for a fee in the region of £40million. Key men: The performances of Mario Balotelli and Andrea Pirlo will be pivotal to Italy's World Cup chances . The Brazil international found starts hard to come by at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho last season, with his exit reflecting well on Cahill and the way he has impressed alongside John Terry in central defence. 'He is a fantastic player, good luck to him,' Cahill added. 'People don't pay that sort of money for average players, they pay that money for the top players and he is in that category.'","Cahill ready to make his bow on the major international stage .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . England captain Steven Gerrard insists the team will not become obsessed by the prospect of another World Cup penalty shoot-out. Exiting six of their last 10 major tournaments on penalties means there is an undercurrent of trepidation that Gerrard understands. The defeat to West Germany in the 1990 World Cup semi-finals began a nightmare run of spot-kick defeats that last struck at Euro 2012. Back of the mind: Steven Gerrard insists England will not become obsessed by the prospect of penalties . Heartache: Gerrard missed a penalty during the World Cup defeat against Portugal back in 2006 . Gerrard netted two years ago as England exited to Italy, but six years earlier the England skipper saw his penalty saved in the World Cup quarter-final exit to Portugal. 'It's difficult to describe what it is like,' Gerrard told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Unfortunately for me I failed in that situation when I took a penalty in a World Cup environment and it was a difficult atmosphere to be in. 'I learnt my lessons from that and a couple of years ago I scored the penalty I was asked to take. 'We are going to practise penalties a lot but it is a difficult situation to put into words and describe it. There is a lot of pressure. 'You have an awful lot more time to think about your penalty and what is at stake is a lot bigger and it is a pressure situation. 'A penalty shoot-out is a more pressurised situation than any one penalty in a league game.' So that's what I hit? Raheem Sterling talks to club skipper Gerrard during a training session in Miami . Train hard: Leighton Baines, John Stones, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw warm-up before a session in Florida . England last won a penalty shoot-out at a major tournament during Euro 96 but the current squad have been working hard to prepare for the situation occurring in Brazil. Roy Hodgson has brought sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters away with the team and the players have been working hard in training to avoid such issues this summer. 'I can understand the fixation because we have failed in quite a few shoot-outs but I would say don't get carried away with it because it might never come about,' Gerrard added. 'As players hopefully we perform well enough in 90 minutes or 120 minutes to prevent it going to a shoot-out. But we will be ready for a shoot-out if it comes around.'","Liverpool captain missed in a shoot-out against Portugal in 2006 .

The Three Lions endured a miserable time four years ago in South Africa, despite Fabio Capello's men getting off to a wonderful start as Gerrard netted after four minutes against the United States.

This has been another stop-start season for the 22-year-old, with injuries restricting the midfielder to just 19 starts in the Barclays Premier League. Wilshere made a further five appearances from the bench, including his second-half appearance in Sunday's season finale at Norwich - his first match since breaking his foot nine weeks earlier. Making an impression: Jack Wilshere, at Arsenal's training ground today, will be fully-fit for the World Cup .

His return is a welcome boost for Arsenal ahead of their FA Cup final appearance against Hull this weekend, although Wenger was coy when asked whether he was fit to start. However, the Gunners boss was more forthcoming when it came to Wilshere's World Cup chances after the midfielder was named in England's 23-man squad on Monday. 'How has he been this week?

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Chelsea's future number one Thibaut Courtois played a key role in their Champions League downfall on Wednesday, producing a display for Atletico Madrid that highlighted to Mark Schwarzer what a ‘very special’ goalkeeper he is. Having established himself as Genk's first-choice goalkeeper when only a teenager, the Blues paid a reported £7.9million to sign the highly-rated Belgian in 2011. Courtois has yet to feature for Chelsea three years on having been farmed out on loan to Atletico, where he has established himself as one of the best young goalkeepers in the world. Scroll down to watch Mourinho explain how Courtois changed the game . Special: Courtois made a stunning stop to deny Chelsea skipper John Terry . Beaten: Schwarzer could do nothing to stop Diego Costa putting Atletico ahead from the spot . Chelsea found that out first-hand on Wednesday as the 21-year-old helped knock his parent club out of the Champions League at the semi-final juncture, with Jose Mourinho highlighting his save to deny a second-half John Terry header as the key moment given Diego Costa netted moments later. Opposite number Schwarzer went and congratulated Courtois after Atleti's 3-1 win and the 41-year-old believes Chelsea have an exceptional player on their books. ‘He is very special and it is no surprise that Chelsea signed him a couple of years ago,’ said the Australian, who made his first-team bow two years before Courtois was born. ‘There has been a lot spoken about him and he has been outstanding. He was outstanding (against us) and he has a huge, huge career ahead of him. ‘If we'd been a bit more lucky, and him a bit unlucky, we could have possibly got back into the game and created a few more nervy moments at the end for them. It wasn't the case. ‘He did very well and it was no surprise that Chelsea signed him and want to keep him at the club. I wouldn't be surprised if they give him a new deal. Despair: Courtois was unable to stop Torres' strike putting Chelsea ahead but responded brilliantly . Has it covered: Courtois was on form as he took on his parent club . Dilemma: Jose Mourinho will have a decision to make if Courtois returns to Chelsea this summer . ‘He's had a fantastic season, as has Atletico. They're top of La Liga and vying to win the championship and now the Champions League final too.’ Schwarzer became the oldest player to ever start a Champions League knockout tie against Atleti, playing after an injury to Petr Cech. The 31-year-old Cech has been undisputed number one at Stamford Bridge for the past decade, but Courtois' fine displays is making that position look weak for the first time. ‘It's a very tough decision and I'm glad I'm not the one that has to make it,’ Schwarzer said with a smile. ‘I don't have a clue what they will decide it on. They are both world-class keepers. ‘I wouldn't even say they are at different ends of their careers because Pete still has a long way to go in his. He can improve at 31.’ Cech is likely to miss the rest of the campaign with a dislocated shoulder sustained in the first leg, meaning Schwarzer will again be between the sticks when Chelsea turn to domestic action this weekend. Old and new: Cech (left) is out for the season and faces a challenge from Courtois for his place next year . Mourinho has given his side Friday off ahead of the penultimate game of the season against Norwich on Sunday - a match they approach two points off the top after their smash-and-grab 2-0 win at leaders Liverpool last weekend. ‘We need to put the others under pressure,’ Schwarzer said. ‘We put ourselves back in the race with the win at Liverpool and we have to make sure we maintain it. We could still have something to play for in the last game at Cardiff. ‘There is still a chance so we can't be sorry for ourselves. Down and out: Schwarzer was beaten three times as Chelsea crashed out but insists they fight on . ‘We have to pick ourselves up from this disappointment and realise we must keep banging on the door with the game against Norwich on Sunday. ‘We must make sure we pick up three points so we can capitalise on any slip-ups.’","Courtois saved brilliantly from Terry to turn the match .

Rodgers could not help joking when asked about the state of the surface. ‘I thought three-quarters of it was excellent,’ said the Liverpool boss. Multi sport: The part of the pitch used for the baseball quadrant was not in the best of conditions (left) Poor show: Part of the Yankee Stadium pitch (left) was in bad condition for the friendly . ‘There was a patch over on the right-hand side which I presume might be where the pitcher stands. But I thought you saw a very good game of football.’ Pellegrini admitted that the surface was too dry, saying: ‘Maybe it was not the best pitch to play football, but it wasn’t so bad. We didn’t have any problems with the players. ‘It would be better to play with the pitch in better condition and maybe more wet. Maybe it was a little bit dry and that’s why the ball didn’t run so fast, but there wasn’t any problem for both teams.’ Meanwhile, Rodgers challenged Jordan Henderson to hit double figures for the season after seeing him score Liverpool’s first goal in a 2-2 draw. The England midfielder was also on target in the penalty shootout as he gave a man-of-the-match performance. Asked if Henderson needs to produce more goals, Rodgers said: ‘Yes, I think that was the objective when I spoke to Jordan this year because he has the quality. That finish for the equaliser, he does that day in day out in training. He’s so fit and strong, and such a team player, he does a lot of unselfish work for the team, but this year we’re asking him to get into the box more. ‘I thought he had more opportunities when he played just round the corner in the last 20 minutes and then he was able to time his runs forward better going forward. He got in a few times and was unlucky. That’s his strength. He can really penetrate the defensive line and he’s an athlete who can run all day. More like this: Brendan Rodgers has called on Jordan Henderson (left) to find the net more regularly . Get in: Henderson (left) celebrates after drawing Liverpool level against Manchester City in New York . ‘I would expect him to get upwards of 10 goals this season because he has the quality and the tactical nous to arrive in the areas to do that.’ Rodgers was delighted with his team’s performance as they came from behind to win after Stevan Jovetic twice put City ahead. Victory in Saturday’s last game against AC Milan in Charlotte, North Carolina, will guarantee Liverpool a place in the final of the International Champions Cup in Miami on Monday. ‘I thought overall the players were excellent,’ he said. ‘We scored two goals and could have scored three more. Joe Hart made three outstanding saves. And then we showed composure to finish the penalties. ‘For us at this moment in pre-season it was a great game. Manchester City are a wonderful team and they will go close in the Premier League again this year. ‘What we’re overall is a trademark of this team over the last 18 months and that’s character. Even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive, the players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was a really good game. More to come: Rodgers (centre) has promised to make more signings before the transfer window closes . ‘I thought the goals we conceded were unfortunate. Jovetic is very bright and alive in the box. We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Steven Gerrard and he got a toe on it. The second goal as well was something similar. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. They’re a top side, one of the best teams in Europe.’ Rodgers confirmed that he expects to being in more new signings before next month’s transfer deadline despite a busy summer in the transfer market. ‘We still have some business to do,’ he added. ‘We have some positions that we want to fill so by the end of August we’ll have a strong squad to go forward with. ‘We’ve brought in specific players for specific roles, players who have the profile of how we work. Of course it will them take a bit more time than normal in terms of their induction but the transition has been very smooth. ‘They’re good characters with good personality who fit the criteria we want in terms of the model of our game. That should make the adjustment that bit easier. But of course some of them are young and coming from a different country like Emre Can so that will take a little bit of time.’","Manchester City and Liverpool drew 2-2 in New York .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A leopard sparked panic in a north Indian city when it strayed inside a hospital, a cinema and an apartment block while evading captors and injured at least two people. Authorities closed schools and colleges in Meerut, 60 kilometres (37 miles) northeast of the Indian capital, after the leopard was discovered prowling the city's streets on Sunday, a senior city official said. ‘Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to track the leopard down. We have launched a massive hunt for the beast,’ said additional district magistrate S.K. Dubey. Scroll down for video . On the loose: A shocked man watches a leopard leap past him in Meerut . The cat was found inside an empty ward of an army hospital on Sunday before wildlife officers were called and managed to fire a tranquiliser dart into it, Dubey told AFP. ‘But despite that he managed to break (out through) the iron grilles and escaped. He then sneaked into the premises of a cinema hall before entering an apartment block. After that we lost track of the cat,’ he said. Authorities have urged the closure of markets in the city of 3.5 million until the animal, which has left six people injured, was captured, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency. The leopard squeezes through a hole in the wall of the Meerut Cantonment Hospital as an official approaches with a baton . Police, soldiers and wildlife officials were trying to hunt it down but their efforts were being hampered by large crowds keen to catch a glimpse of the cat, PTI said. Photos showed the beast pushing its way through a lattice wall at the hospital as a policeman in riot helmet, stood ready to hit it with a baton. The leopard was also pictured leaping off a building site as people scrambled out of the way. The leopard looks through a window the Meerut Cantonment Hospital as an official gingerly approaches with a stick . Escape: The leopard runs past a member of the security forces . Teams of wildlife experts and police have been drafted in to tranquillise and capture the leopard, which has since been spotted in a shopping district called Abulane. Sushant Sharma, divisional forest officer, said: 'We received calls about the animal's location in Abulane market. We are visiting the area with a team of wildlife experts to tranquilise the leopard.' Reports on the number of injured vary, with some Indian news outlets suggesting up to seven have been harmed. Others are reporting at least two have been injured, mostly with cuts or scratches. Onkar Singh, senior superintendent of police, said: 'We urged the public not to go near the animal, but they went close out of curiosity and the animal attacked them, inflicting minor injuries.' Last week another leopard killed a five-year-old boy in the central state of Chhattisgarh, the latest in a string of incidents raising concerns about depleting habitats for big cats which is forcing them into populated areas. Video footage from Mumbai last year showed a leopard creeping into an apartment block foyer and snatching a small dog. A tiger on the prowl in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh since last December is believed to have killed some ten people, and wildlife officials are still trying to hunt it down. And earlier in February a homeless man was repeatedly bitten and clawed by a mountain lion at a Southern California encampment.

Some of their corridors are getting blocked so there is bound to be an interface,’ Deepankar Ghosh of WWF-India told AFP. ‘We can't put all the leopards into cages. We can't remove all the people living near forested areas. We have to manage the situation the best way we can.’","A leopard was discovered prowling the streets of Meerut, near Delhi .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sitting on the pavement next to his dog and sleeping bag, Simon Wright looked to all the world like a homeless beggar. But what the passers-by who gave him cash didn’t know was that he was earning over £50,000 a year and living in a £300,000 council flat in west London. At the end of every day he would pick up his handwritten sign and head back to his Fulham home.Locals say he regularly went into bookmakers and amusement shops to change up his loose coins. The homeless man... with a home: Simon Wright (left) has been given an Asbo after it emerged he had been begging for years despite living in a plush £300,000 flat in this block (right) in Fulham . On many occasions they added up to . between £200 and £300. Magistrates have now imposed a two-year Asbo . banning him from begging anywhere in London. PC Oliver Strebel, who brought the . case to court, said: ‘He had a reputation for getting a lot of gifts . while begging. 'He used a sign saying he was homeless and people gave him . money on that basis, which is clearly fraud. He would take the money . from his cup and change it over at a local betting shop or amusement . arcade. ‘He worked pretty much every day, and had done so for about three years. He certainly put in the hours.’ Wright proved Putney High Street in . south-west London was such a lucrative venue that he attracted up to . nine other beggars. Since his arrest, they have all but disappeared. Wright . would sit wearing ragged clothes outside NatWest bank in Putney High . Street, near Putney station, with his dog and ask the public for money. But after a hard day’s begging Wright . would pack up his sleeping bag and, instead of heading to a shelter, he . would make his way across Putney Bridge to his comfortable flat in Simms . Court, Fulham High Street. Commuters who fell for his bad luck story said they were shocked to learn Wright had duped them. Chris Faversham, from Putney, said: 'I . definitely gave him money over the years. Probably about £20. I wonder . if I can get that back?' In December 2012 suspicious residents were suggesting that something was not quite right about Wright’s predicament. Some said he changed up his donations . in Greggs in Putney High Street while others said he lived in a tent on . Putney Embankment. But Wright’s days of fleecing the . public are over after magistrates slapped an Asbo on him banning him . from visiting the SW15 area (Roehampton and Putney) and from begging . anywhere in the capital. Wimbledon Magistrates' Court, sitting . on May 14, also ordered him to keep his dog muzzled and under control at . all times in a public place after magistrates were told it had bitten . at least one person. Banned: Wright, 37, would sit wearing ragged clothes outside NatWest bank in Putney High Street, near Putney station, with his dog and ask the public for money . The Asbo will remain in place until . May 2015 but if Wright, who admitted fraud and begging, breaches any of . its terms he could be sent to prison for up to five years and face an . unlimited fine. The council’s community safety . spokesman Cllr Jonathan Cook said: 'Anyone who lives, works or shops in . and around Putney High Street will be mightily relieved to see this . unpleasant individual given his marching orders. 'He deliberately targeted people . making cash withdrawals from this cashpoint and was extremely aggressive . and abusive to anyone who refused to give him money. 'Many people felt frightened and . intimidated by him and there is some evidence to suggest that he used . his dog to threaten and pressure people into handing over their cash. 'His behaviour was an absolute . disgrace. The fact that he was actually living in a comfortable flat in . Fulham, something that many of his victims can only dream of, just adds . insult to injury. 'Everyone who has been appalled by Mr . Wright’s behaviour will I’m sure wish to congratulate the Thamesfield .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Negligent? Dr George Fielding, the weight loss surgeon who performed Chris Christie's bariatric surgery has been sued by families of patients who have died following his procedure . The doctor who performed Chris Christie's 'lap band' weight loss surgery has been named in a handful of malpractice lawsuits and sued by the families of three patients who died following surgery on his operating table. According to the New York Post, Dr George Fielding, the chief of NYU Langone's Weight Management Program, has also been sued in Australia, has been named in 12 malpractice suits in New York and is currently involved in a whistleblower case after a former colleague told patients his practice was unsafe. The New Jersey Governor sought bariatric surgery at NYU after receiving a referral from Jets coach Rex Ryan and claims that he has been feeling in fine since Dr Fielding operated on him in February. Avoiding the question of whether he knew of the doctor's spotty patient history, he told the Post: 'He appeared from my research to be the foremost expert on it in the country. He told me he's done over 5,000 of the surgeries and he had the surgery himself. He kinda sold me in this respect.' Dr Fielding, a pioneer of the life-changing obesity procedure who married fellow weight loss surgery superstar Dr Christine Ren, was accused of having an 'entrepreneurial approach' to his work by a coroner who reported on the 2003 death of Shannon Tang, 21. An investigation found that the surgeon only met the 381lb Singaporean one day before his scheduled procedure and neglected to carry out a preoperative workup or warn his patient of the risks involved. In the case of Rebecca Quatinetz, 27, from New York, her family recalled that she was in pain for six weeks after her lap band surgery with Dr Fielding before passing away in her Stuyvesant Town apartment in 2009. A lawyer for the family explained that the band placed at the top of the stomach to restrict food intake had been placed too tightly and was not spotted in either of the six follow-up appointments. Jovial: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie underwent the lap band procedure under the hand of Dr Fielding in February and has lost 40lbs . 'She was starving,' Karyn Schiller told the Post. 'She couldn't get or keep anything down.' Eventually she died of a heart condition that had shown up in preoperative tests but of which Ms Quatinetz had not been informed. 'We believe Dr. Fielding did not review the results of his own tests,' Ms Schiller said. 'So Rebecca, who met him once, three days before surgery, did not give informed consent or get treatment that could have saved her life.' Thinner: The governor did not respond to questions over whether he knew about his doctor's history but said that he had been referred to him and after research concluded that he was the foremost expert in his field . Another lawsuit points the finger at Dr Fielding for the death of Anne Marie Harrington, 45 from Brooklyn. The charges claim the doctor and his NYU team failed to notice an esophageal perforation. One doctor who became troubled by such cases was Dr Neelu Pal. After Rhonda Freiberg suffered a heart attack 36 hours after her bariatric surgery with Dr Fielding in 2006, Dr Pal began to tell his patients to go elsewhere. In 2010, court papers revealed that Dr Pal would pose as an operating-room nurse and tell patients that she 'had watched many patients die from the procedure'. The science: During lap band surgery an incision is made through the belly button and a silicone tube is tied around the top of the stomach to restrict food intake . A review by the State Department of Health following Ms Freiberg's death, found that doctors did not adequately monitor her following her surgery. NYU paid her family a $973,000 malpractice settlement. Chris Christie underwent lap band surgery with Dr Fielding in February. He told the New York Post that he met twice with the weight loss expert before agreeing to the procedure which has already helped him shed 40lbs. 'I went in at 7 a.m. He met me in the lobby, walked me upstairs, and I had the surgery at 7:30,' said Mr Christie. 'I was out of surgery by 8:10 and home by 5.'","Dr George Fielding is the chief of NYU Langone's Weight Loss Management Program and the pioneer of 'lap band surgery'

According to Lewis, when three police officers and two security guards attempted to question Mr Rodriguez, he was uncooperative. He was handcuffed and placed on the ground. That’s when his family say police beat him to death.The entire incident was captured by Mrs Rodriguez on her cellphone, which she says officers then seized from her as evidence without producing a warrant. Lewis says police are reviewing the recording. The three officers involved in the deadly confrontation have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the internal investigation. Nair Rodriguez told the station News9 the family emerged from the cinema shortly after midnight, at which point she and her daughter, Luinahi, got into a heated argument and the mother slapped the teen before storming away. Her husband went after her to calm her down, but he was stopped by police asking him for his ID. According to the mother and daughter, Mr Rodriguez tried to walk around the officers in order to prevent his wife from getting behind the wheel in such an emotional state.

"By . Jenny Hope . A simple blood test that checks copper levels in the blood may help predict whether senior moments will develop into forgetfulness (library image) A simple blood test can help predict whether senior moments of forgetfulness will eventually develop into Alzheimer’s. The test checks for copper levels in the blood, with higher amounts suggesting a greater risk of the disease. Italian researchers who devised the method say some people may be able to reduce their chances of developing Alzheimer’s by cutting back on copper found in certain foods and drinking water. The study looked at levels of copper circulating in the blood of 141 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a common form of forgetfulness in older people often jokingly referred to as ‘having a senior moment’. Researchers checked specifically for ‘free copper’ that circulates in the bloodstream rather than being bound to carrier proteins in food and other substances. High levels of free copper have been linked to cell damage in previous research. The study, published online in Annals of Neurology, found patients with high levels of free copper had a 50 per cent chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease within four years. But those with low levels had  less than a 20 per cent chance of their forgetfulness turning into  the condition. Researcher Rosanna Squitti, of the Fatebenefratelli Hospital in Rome, said: ‘This simple test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and they may be able to do something about it.’ In Britain, around 820,000 people have dementia, with most suffering from Alzheimer’s. It is marked by telltale signs of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain and it is thought high levels of free copper may contribute by making it harder for the brain to get rid of these toxic proteins. Previous studies by Dr Squitti and colleagues found free copper levels were higher in patients with Alzheimer’s compared with healthy people of a similar age – and the level predicted how well patients would do on tests of memory and cognition. Decreasing scores were found in patients with high amounts of free copper in their blood. A Chicago study found a high intake of copper, along with a high intake of saturated and trans fats, was linked to markedly accelerated cognitive decline. Dr Squitti said around 5 per cent of healthy people in the recent tests had high levels of free copper in the blood and that her research suggests they are ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s than those with normal levels. Some older people may be able to reduce their chances of developing Alzheimer's by cutting back on copper found in certain foods, researchers say . Copper enters the body from drinking water carried in copper pipes, foods such as shellfish, nuts, red meat and many fruits and vegetables. It is essential for health, but copper deficiency is very rare. Dr Squitti said it was relatively easy to reduce copper levels, for example by taking zinc supplements. But she does not advise people to do so unless they have high levels of free copper confirmed by testing. It is likely these patients have a faulty biological mechanism for processing free copper, she added, which interacts with genes to produce a higher Alzheimer’s risk. ‘I believe by reducing the intake of free copper these people can reduce their Alzheimer’s risk – but I have to prove it’ she said. Neal Barnard, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University . Dr Squitti is bringing together 17 leading European experts in  Alzheimer’s disease and copper to work on a study that will test whether giving zinc supplements to people experiencing ‘senior moments’ affects the number who develop Alzheimer’s. Neal Barnard, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University and president of the US Physicians Committee, said: ‘This is an important advance for attacking the Alzheimer’s epidemic. It gives people at risk – and their doctors – a way to spot the risk and change it.’ Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘This very small study suggests a possible way to detect Alzheimer’s disease early, but more work is needed to confirm these findings in much larger groups of people. ‘This study adds to some earlier research suggesting a possible role for copper in Alzheimer’s, but it’s not clear whether the increased levels seen here could be a consequence of other biological processes involved in the disease. But he added: ‘Understanding why some people with mild memory problems develop Alzheimer’s and others don’t could be key for unlocking ways to prevent the disease, and it’s crucial to invest in research in this area.’","New simple test checks for copper levels in the blood .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The cities of New York and Los Angeles have been the backdrop for countless movies, with their iconic skylines lit up on the big screen. But the look that has inspired generations of directors is about to be changed for good as LED street lighting is brought in. While the switch to LED lighting means Los Angeles will save at least $7 million in electricity bills each year, the change iconic city settings seen in films like Collateral will be lost forever. The signature urban glow captured by . director Michael Mann has been replaced with a more clinical-looking shine after LA . replaced more than 140,000 street lamps with LED lighting. New York and several American cities are following suit, while in Britain areas of Manchester, London and Glasgow already have some LEDs installed. Scroll down for video . Before and after: The color change caused by a change in street lamps can be seen in images of the same Los Angeles street with the old lighting, above, and LEDs, below . Up until now, the artificial orange glow of street lamps has been a distinctive feature in films such as Collateral, where the eerie glow added to the tense thriller. Director Michael Mann had experimented with HD cameras during the making of the Tom Cruise thriller in 2004, as he tried to capture the essence of the city at night. Lamps made from light emitting diodes - LEDs - are essentially filled with tiny light bulbs that, unlike traditional ones, don't have filaments that can burn out. LEDs have a far longer life that regular bulbs, outshining them by thousands of hours. However, some have an incomplete color spectrum, affecting how objects bathed in the light appear. Filmmakers already know how to compensate for changes in artificial light, but the spectrum of LEDs will create new challenges. Another big change is that LED lamps shine white, which is great for night driving but not so useful if you are trying to shoot moody scenes like the ones in Collateral. By switching to LED street lamps, Los Angeles and New York City will save $7 million and $14 million a year respectively. He was so enamored with the way the city looked in the dark that he went to great lengths to capture it, even having a special coat of paint added to the central character's taxi to reflect the sheens found in various parts of LA. Mann found the orange glow of street lamps and the HD footage were the perfect combination. 'He wanted to use the format to create a kind of glowing urban environment; the goal was to make the LA night as much of a character in the story as Vincent and Max were,' the film's director of photography Paul Cameron told The American Cinematographer. But the signature urban glow captured by Mann has been replaced with a more clinical-looking shine after LA replaced more than 140,000 street lamps with LED lighting. New York City is following suit, with former Mayor Michael Bloomberg announcing a plan in October to replace 250,000 street lights in the city, in a move to save $14 million a year in running costs. The change means that filmmakers will need to make the change to LED lighting, and begin an experimental phase of finding which ones work best. 'Every cinematographer is going to have their own taste for how something should look, and right now, there are still questions about how different brands of LED lights will interact on a set,' Chris Rogers, of rental company Cinelease, told Variety. One of the obstacles facing lighting crews is how to make the LED glow look natural. Iconic: Los Angeles at night has inspired countless directors, including Michael Mann who shot Collateral, above, there .

'More simply, you can’t really put colors back . in that weren’t there to begin with, even by gelling such a light source . or color correcting in post.' Once directors have come up with the perfect light balance for LEDs however, it is possible they will find them easier to work with. 'Whether the new look is . visually preferable is a subjective matter, but you probably won’t find . as many proponents for the old one,' Kendricken said. ''Especially considering that many of . these LED fixtures lean toward a daylight balance, they may not only . offer better overall color rendition, but also better conditions under . modern cool-native sensors.'

"By . Robert Verkaik . and David Rose . Accused: Former policeman Pavel Karpov was linked to the death of Sergei Magnitsky but is now bringing a libel action against the British businessman who named him as a suspect . A former Russian police officer banned from travelling to America after being accused of torture and murder has been allowed to bring an explosive libel claim against a British businessman in London’s High Court. The case, which will cost the UK taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds, is likely to be one of the most expensive ever heard in Britain. It is being brought by Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Karpov, one of the men accused of involvement in the arrest, torture and murder of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who died in Moscow in 2009. And it follows a high-profile campaign led by Mr Magnitsky’s former boss, William Browder, who wants more than 60 Russian suspects held to account for the lawyer’s death. But Mr Karpov has hired top UK lawyers to sue Mr Browder for defamation in a trial that opens on July 24. The case is cited as one of the worst examples of libel tourism – where foreign nationals with little or no connection to the UK use the High Court to settle their disputes. Last night senior Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It is absolutely ludicrous a man I hope will never set foot in this country except to face criminal proceedings himself is able to abuse British libel law in this way.’ It comes after a Moscow court last week posthumously convicted Mr Magnitsky of tax fraud and convicted Mr Browder in his absence, sentencing him to nine years in jail. Mr Browder, a British citizen who was born in the US, is chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management – the firm Mr Magnitsky was working for before his death. He has denied the charges and claims the trial is politically motivated. His defence team have said they will appeal against the verdict. Deceased: Lawyer Sergei Magnitsky (pictured in a frame held by his mother Nataliya Magnitskaya) died in prison in 2009 after he accused officials of conducting tax fraud . Mr Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 after accusing officials of a massive tax fraud, but was later himself accused of the crime. In libel papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Karpov insists he had nothing to do with the fraud, subsequent cover-up or the arrest, torture and death of Mr Magnitsky. He says the allegations made by Mr Browder have caused ‘serious hurt, embarrassment and distress’. Libel case: William Browder, a businessman who was Mr Magnitsky's boss, is being sued for defamation after linking Karpov to his death . Mr Karpov’s lawyers insist that while Mr Browder’s quest to pursue those who killed Mr Magnitsky might be legitimate, his campaign has wrongfully made false claims against Mr Karpov. Lawyers for Mr Browder, including Geoffrey Robertson QC, have stood by the claims and say they will show in court Mr Karpov is a prominent figure in a Russian organised crime ring, the Klyuev Group, that specialises in complex financial frauds. The papers also question how Mr Karpov is funding the case, which already includes more than £100,000 paid into court to provide security of costs. His legal team is being led by top QC Andrew Caldecott instructed by high-profile media lawyer Geraldine Proudler. The papers say: ‘Until recently .  .  . [Karpov] was living with his grandmother and mother-in-law in a modest apartment of 54 square metres. In spite of the relatively modest level of salary paid to claimant under the terms of his employment by the Ministry of the Interior, he has acquired very substantial assets and enjoyed an upmarket lifestyle which it would be impossible for him to have earned legitimately through his official position.’ Mr Browder’s team detail how Mr Karpov is a frequent flyer – allegedly spending 225 days travelling outside Russia on 47 trips to 17 different countries from 2004 to 2012. They also reveal how he often travelled on flights with others who have been accused by Mr Browder of belonging to the Klyuev Group. A spokesman for law firm Olswang confirmed Mr Karpov’s libel claim is proceeding, adding he was ‘not banned from travelling to the UK’.","Former Russian police officer Pavel Karpov is suing British William Browder .

"By . Tracey Cox . When was the last time you had sex so good, you didn't stop grinning at each other for days? OK, how about reasonably good sex that left you with a rather smug post-coital glow? Hmm. Then how many of you fantasise more about sleeping in your bed than bouncing around on it? Tracey says that a low libido can effect us all from time to time but there are plenty of ways to get yourself back in the mood . Stressful jobs, fractious relationships, parenting, that monotonous commute - all combine to rob us of desire. If sex is just another chore rather than something you look forward to, chances are one or more of the following is to blame. Pinpoint the problem, then keep reading for some practical solutions. Reasons why you're not frothing at the mouth . Physical . Emotional . Tracey says that even the smallest adjustments such as getting a good night's sleep, can help increase a couple's sex drive . How to get back in the mood: . Get a good night's sleep. Disturbed sleep leads to a reduction in the male hormone testosterone, which boosts both your libidos. Take responsibility for your libido. Don't expect your partner to turn you on, do it yourself! Make it your mission to pinpoint what gets you in the mood for sex then do more of it. Let your imagination loose. Don't be ashamed of your fantasies and refuse to feel guilty if having sex with someone other than your partner is one of them. Being unfaithful in reality isn't on but it's OK to do it in your head. Really. One survey found around 75% of us do it to keep sex fresh. Meet halfway. If you don't want intercourse, what about oral sex? If you don't want oral sex or any sex yourself, do you mind pleasuring them? At the very least, you can and should be able to offer the physical intimacy of a cuddle. Tracey says that it's important to approach the subject rather than avoid it . Focus on sex, don't avoid it. If you're constantly being hassled for it, sex is often the last thing you want to watch or read about. Low libido people often avert their eyes when they see nudity, a sexy scene on telly or in the movies or flip the page if they hit a story in the newspapers or glossies. Don't. It's just as easy to think yourself into sex than it is to talk yourself out of it and the more often you expose yourself to sexy literature and images, the sexier you'll feel. Know what you want and need to be satisfied sexually. And I'm talking both in, and out of, bed. If you need to relax first, don't be scared to ask for a massage. Or for them to do the dishes while you take a bath or shower. Give sex a high priority in your life. If you're avoiding it or not interested, chances are it's the last thing you do, last thing at night. Well – Gosh! – funnily enough, even high sex drive people sometimes wonder if it's worth the effort when they're exhausted after a long day at work. Get into a routine where you and your partner have chat-time then sex before you start dinner and switch the TV on. Or if you really are too stressed during the week, have breakfast in bed on the weekends and make that sex time. Get your body clocks in sync. A morning person matched with a night time one? If this is you, take turns on the time of day you make love. And try sex mid morning, midday and mid afternoon, not just morning or night . Sex does NOT equal intercourse. Plenty of people (women especially) don't orgasm through intercourse alone, so tend to find penetrative sex quite boring. If sex is boring, it's no wonder you're not desperate to dive into bed! The more you mix up what you do, the higher the interest. Don't relax! Instead, focus on the erotic sensations you're feeling. Tighten the muscles of your thighs, bottom, lower tummy and pelvic floor muscles to help trigger an orgasmic reflex. Set up a craving cycle. Without wanting to point out the obvious, orgasms feel good. If something feels good, our body – quite logically – says 'more please' and sulks if we don't obey by developing either psychological or physical cravings when denied its high. The more sex you have, the more you want. We quickly forget how great sex can be. Have good sex often and you're constantly reminded of all the physical and emotional pluses.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A trainspotter was killed after being struck by a steam engine while trying to take pictures - and may have miscalculated its distance as he looked through his camera lens. Gregory John Duncraft, 50, was thrown into the air and suffered head and leg injuries after being hit by the train, which was travelling at 28mph, near Greymouth, New Zealand. Witnesses said the meat freezer worker appeared to ignore two long whistle blasts as engineers tried to warn him of the approaching danger during the incident on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Gregory John Duncraft, 50, who was hit by the train near Greymouth, New Zealand, appeared to ignore two long whistle blasts given by engineers as he took pictures (file image) He was airlifted to nearby Grey Base Hospital by the NZCC Rescue Helicopter but died later. Mr Duncraft was trying to photograph the steam train Ka942 as it made its way through Kokiri, and was standing on or near the tracks when he was hit, according the New Zealand Herald. One witness said he seemed distracted by his camera and could have thought the train was further away than it appeared. Photographer Stewart Nimmo said: 'It's really hard to know what happened, but sometimes things do look further away than they actually are.' The 200 passengers onboard were unaware as the tragedy unfolded, while horrified engineers who witnessed the accident have been offered counselling. One passenger, who was on the train for its return journey between Christchurch and Greymouth, said the driver did everything he could to warn Mr Duncraft. The unnamed woman told TVNZ: 'I feel for the deceased's family... but he was trespassing and shouldn't have been on the tracks. There were two whistles but he still didn't move. 'You can get a good picture without putting your life in danger.' Rare: Mr Duncraft's death is believed to be the first steam engine fatality in  in New Zealand since the 1990s (file picture) Michael Tollich, operations manager . at the Mainland Steam Heritage Trust, insisted Mr Duncraft's death was a . stark warning to stay clear of train lines. He . said: 'I think that people need to understand that . tracks are for trains. They are not for people to walk on. You should . stay off the railway line. 'This is a tragedy because someone didn't do that.' Fatalities involving steam engines in New Zealand are rare. The last person killed by a locomotive was in the 1990s. Grant Craig, president of Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand, said: 'It's an absolute rarity because rail travel is inherently safe and the heritage operators around the country have an incredible track record.' Mr Duncraft's death comes just 18 months after his wife Sharon lost her battle with cancer aged 53. Police and the New Zealand Transport Agency are continuing their investigations, while his death has been referred to the coroner.","Gregory John Duncraft was hit by locomotive in Greymouth, New Zealand .

"By . Rob Cooper . A council blew taxpayers' money organising a course in how to look after hamsters - then were forced to cancel it because no-one signed up to go. Northamptonshire County Council was planning on running a two-hour adult learning session which was titled 'Meeting The Welfare Needs of Hamsters'. The evening course led by rodent expert Sophie Hacking was designed  to teach pupils how to feed their pet 'a balanced diet' and assess their 'social needs'. Hamster course: Northamptonshire County Council were organising an adult learning session to teach people how to look after hamsters . The session, which would have cost £5.90 to attend, was due to go ahead on March 4 but has now been scrapped. In the advert, the council said the event had been designed to help owners 'evaluate the extent to which different . types of housing meet the needs of hamsters'. It also helpfully pointed out that . 'no existing knowledge or qualifications will be assumed.' Today local residents, campaigners and politicians criticised the authority for wasting resources as they try and slash budgets by £128million over the next five years. The council hurriedly pulled adverts for the course off their website today after the media phoned up to ask about why they were spending money on it. Hamsters: The two-hour session in caring for the welfare needs of hamsters that the council was organising . Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'The council have got better things to do than worry about the welfare of hamsters. 'It’s absurd that the council is wasting taxpayers’ money on talking about hamster housing and social needs when families struggle with their own household bills. 'Last I checked there wasn’t an urgent shortage of hamster wheels in Northampton so maybe the council should rethink its priorities.' Labour councillor Mary Butcher, who represents the Oakley ward in Northampton, said. 'That is absolutely ridiculous, I can’t believe they would spend money on that and that they could be so frivolous. 'Why can’t people just buy a book to find out how to look after their hamster. 'Why are they wasting money like this when we are trying to save the children services and save domestic violence refuges across the county.' 'Waste of money': Northamptonshire Council hurriedly pulled adverts for the looking after hamsters course after they had calls from the media today . Conservative Councillor Stan Heggs, for Corby, added: 'Well we have enough things to be looking at like the kids services rather than this. It is not up my street anyway.' Butcher Paul Robinson, 30, said: 'That’s the most absurd thing I’ve ever heard - what an absolute waste of time, money and energy.' A previous hamster course had been scheduled to take place at Caroline Chisholm School on October 23 last year. It was also cancelled because of a lack of interest. On the council website, under a heading 'What do I need to bring?' the authority helpfully points out 'Paper, pens. Glasses if required.' They also say the course content will be presented via tutor lecturing, guided discussion and small group activities. A spokesman for Northamptonshire County Council confirmed that they had cancelled the course. 'We love hearing people's suggestions for courses and we're happy to test out new ones, as we've done with the hamster care course,' he said. 'In this particular case, we actually haven't had any bookings so this course won't be going ahead.

"By . Sam Webb . and Rob Cooper . Jobless Benefits Street 'star' White Dee admitted she rakes in £200 a week in handouts and knows workers left with half as much money to live. The 42-year-old single mother attacked the government for creating a claimant culture - and said it is not her fault how much she is given. White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - also accused Channel 4 of manipulating the residents of James Turner Street, in Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Anger: White Dee, from Channel 4's Benefits Street, appears on a live debate on Monday evening . The Benefits Street matriarch has been living off handouts after being sacked from her job as a council administrator seven years ago. She narrowly avoided prison after being caught stealing £13,000. She claims she is unable to work because she is 'depressed' - but has faced accusations that she appears to be living it up on handouts. After starring on television, she has been tipped to appear on Celebrity Big Brother and would be in line to receive a £60,000 appearance fee - which would mean the end of benefits. White Dee said that she receives around £200 per week in handouts. As a mother-of two she is entitled to £33.70 child benefit per week, a maximum of £106.50 in Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) payments because she is 'depressed', plus £115 per week child tax credits. In order to get her ESA benefits for depression, White Dee will have been assessed by Atos workers who would have signed her off as unfit to work. During the process, she may have provided a GP's note confirming that she is sick. During a live debate, hosted by Richard Bacon on Channel 4, she said the broadcaster had painted a distorted picture of life living on handouts. 'You (Channel 4) spent up to 18 months, up . to two years, to film people that were working, you filmed old age . pensioners, you came to parties, you filmed open days, community spirit . and boom (you showed)... five of us.' The single mother - who chewed gum during the live show - added that on-screen life on handouts was made to look like fun. Show stars: White Dee puts her arm  round fellow James Turner Street resident Tich during a benefits debate on Channel 4 . White Dee admitted that she receives 'about £200 per week' in state handouts to live off. The money she receives consists of child tax credits, child benefit and Employment Support Allowance (ESA). As a mother-of-two, she receives £20.30 per week for her first child 16-year-old Caitlin plus £13.40 for her second child Gerrard, aged seven. She is also eligible to receive £5,995 per year in child tax credits - which works out as £115 per week. Finally she receives ESA, which is paid to people who are sick. White Dee could receive up to £100.15 per week. However, this can be reduced if the individual does not attend support group sessions or interviews. White Dee has insisted that depression means she cannot work - because she would be forced to take regular days off sick. During a recent television interview on Channel 5, she said: 'I haven't been on benefits my whole life. At the moment I am not in a place where (I can work). I suffer with depression and I am being assessed for bipolar disorder. 'I have a good day, I have three bad days and then I have two good days. What sort of employer would I ring up and say ""sorry I can't come in for three days - I'm low"". 'I would prefer to be working.' 'It looks great, it looks like a right barrel of laughs. It looks like you are having a great crack,' she said. 'Obviously it is just a programme that they put together into 40 minutes that they had spent 18 months filming.' Accusing the government of creating a claimant culture, she added: . 'I don't create the benefit system it's the government. They say how . much I should get, how much you should get, how much child benefit. 'Not me - I don't go down to my local MP and say this is what I should get. 'The actual government is the one that sets the precedence for how much money I should get so it's not my fault.' Benefits .

The . world's media has descended on James Turner Street, with journalists . arriving from Germany, France, Russia, North Africa and Australia. Channel 4 has been criticised for demonising those living . on the breadline, while some of the residents claim they were misled . into appearing. White Dee . added: 'I couldn't actually believe how big it had become and how much . it had opened up a big can of worms, basically.' Asked by Mr Bacon what reaction people had to her, the show's most recognisable face said it was '90 per cent positive'. In . a new documentary shown before the debate, White Dee told filmmakers . that she receives ‘about £200’ a week in benefit payments. White Dee took issue with the programme's portrayal of life for those on benefits, claiming it made it look like a 'right barrel of laughs' She . has admitted stealing £13,000 from her former employer, Birmingham City Council, in 2007 - and claimed in an article in The Spectator last week . that she plans to run for Parliament. She . said: 'I am a single parent, I get child benefit, I get child tax . credit and I get ESA (Employment and Support Allowance). I'm not raking . in thousands. 'I probably . get a weekly income of about £200. I know people that work there a****s . off who haven't got half of that a week to live on. It is what p***** . people off but it's not my fault unless I become an MP.' Labour . MP Chris Bryant, Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform, accused Channel 4 . of presenting a partial picture of life on the street. 'There are 99 houses in that street and you would expect 50 of them would be pensioners,' he said. 'We . didn't see them in the programme we just saw the people who were . shoplifting. My experience of people on benefits is they are not . shoplifting they want to work.' In Benefits Street: The Last Word, a new documentary shown before the debate, Fungi told film makers that politicians are unaware of the reality of his lifestyle. 'They wouldn't understand what it's like to go ""There's a tenner, make that last three days""' Conservative minister Mike Penning also accused the broadcaster of being unrealistic in their portrayal of life on benefits. 'You were very selective in your cuts. You were very very selective about what you did there,' he said. 'You . picked on a certain group of people and you didn't really tell them the . full truth about what you were going to do, I don't think.' Benefits .

"By . Tim Shipman . Updated: . 07:45 GMT, 8 February 2012 . David Cameron gave the green light to a three point plan to force Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to quit yesterday, approving plans to train spindoctors to help the Syrian opposition win support. British officials will help opposition leaders draw up a joint platform for the future of their country and then train them in how to win over the Syrian people. Details of the plan were signed off yesterday when the Prime Minister chaired an hour-long meeting of the National Security Council. Scroll down for video...

Mr Cameron vowed to back fresh . sanctions by the European Union to freeze the assets of key regime . figures and ban them from travelling. He also said Britain would back Arab . League efforts to finalise a deal which would see Mr Assad hand over . power to a national unity government ahead of elections. The crunch meeting came as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov travelled to Syria in a bid to strike a deal. He said Mr Assad was ready to end the . bloodshed, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives over the last 11 . months, and hold a referendum on constitutional reforms.

"By . Carolyn Brown . There has been constant speculation about footballer Luis Suarez’s career after he bit an Italian player in the World Cup – but little concern for his victim, Giorgio Chiellini. Yet being bitten isn’t just painful and unpleasant, it can have serious health implications. ‘The bite of a human can be an extremely dangerous wound,’ says Professor Stanislav Dusko Ehrlich from the Dental Institute of King’s College, London. Scroll down for video... Bad bite: Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez holds his teeth after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, left, during the FIFA World Cup 2014 last week - something he later admitted had been intentional . ‘There are more than 700 different strains of oral bacteria and a healthy human mouth typically contains between 100 and 200 at any time. ‘If the bite pierces the skin,  this bacteria will enter the body and has the potential to pose a serious threat.’ Grandmother Wendy Thomas suffered a bite in much more innocent circumstances, but knows only too well the  serious implications. She was hospitalised and nearly lost a finger after a playful bite from her grandson turned toxic. The two-year-old accidentally bit her during a bathtime tussle over a flannel he had clamped between his teeth. ‘It looked no worse than a  pin prick and I thought nothing more about it at the time,’ says Wendy, 67, a retired lab technician from Milford-on-Sea in Hampshire. ‘My grandson Jake’s not a biter. I know some youngsters are while teething, but this was purely in play.’ Banned: Uruguayan footballer Suarez was suspended for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini . The finger felt slightly tender the next day but it wasn’t until the following night that she realised something was wrong. Wendy recalls: ‘I woke in the night as my finger was really painful. I tried to get out of bed but was so dizzy and faint that I barely made it to the bathroom before I started throwing up.’ The next thing she remembers is her husband Chris, 67, pushing her into A&E at Lymington Hospital in a wheelchair. When Chris said the symptoms started with a bite, she was immediately seen by doctors and put on intravenous antibiotics. They . explained that her body was trying, and failing, to fight off a . streptococcal infection as bacteria in the mouth – even a . two-year-old’s – can turn a wound toxic. Danger: Chiellini's injury could have exposed him to hundreds of different strains of oral bacteria . Plastic surgeon Philip Geary, locum consultant at Salisbury hospital, says: ‘People fondly expect that the human mouth is cleaner than an animal’s, but we have to disappoint them.’ He deals with people who have been bitten by pets and livestock – but forty per cent of the bites he sees are human, and typically on young men who get into drunken fights. Many people don’t seek treatment at all as they assume human bites aren’t serious, or stay away out of guilt and embarrassment, says Mr Geary. ‘We see a lot of “fight bites”, as we call them, but there is often a delay as guys don’t want to say that their knuckle started bleeding after they punched someone in the face.’ The hands are the most commonly bitten part of the body and the most susceptible to complications, because there is so little flesh around the joints and it’s easier for teeth to penetrate the protective casing around nerves and ligaments. That’s what happened to Wendy: Jake’s bite punctured Wendy’s flesh and the flexor sheath around the ligament on her finger. This meant the infection became trapped inside the sheath, where there is no blood flow – the body’s normal way of flushing out the poisons. Wendy spent four days on an intravenous drip before being sent home, but a week later there was no improvement so she was transferred to Southampton General Hospital for surgery to ‘irrigate’ the finger and flush out the infection with saline solution. This involved inserting a thin plastic tube into the sheath round the ligament. By now her hand and forearm were red and swollen. ‘The anaesthetist told me that if the procedure didn’t work, I may lose the finger,’ says Wendy. ‘It seemed unreal.  I burst into tears.’ Wendy spent 14 days in hospital, having two operations to flush out the toxins and remove ‘necrotic’ or dead tissue from the wound, followed by 12 weeks of physiotherapy. ‘It could be a year before it feels normal again,’ she says. ‘People can’t believe it was all caused by a bite from my grandson. We need to be more aware of how dangerous a human bite can be.’","Uruguay's Luis Suarez bit Italian Giorgio Chiellini during a game .

"By . Paul Thompson In Bunkersville, Nevada . A rancher involved in a tense stand off with federal agents has warned that he will never back down down from his fight. Cliven Bundy said he expects officials with the Bureau of Land Management to make another attempt to seize his cattle. 'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.' Scroll down for video .

Ammon Bundy, Cliven Bundy's son, speaks during a prayer ceremony at a supporter camp located near the Virgin River Sunday. Meanwhile, Robert Crooks, right, of the Mountain Minutemen, speaks to the media . He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada. He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.' Bundy, 67, won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada. Fears of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call off their operation on Saturday. Supporters of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at any moment. Many of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared to take on the federal agents in a fire fight. One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down.' With the threat of violence so close federal officials took the decision to pull out their agents and return the estimated 300 cattle they had rounded up back to Bundy. Bundy, second from right, a rancher who owes the federal government over $1 million in unpaid grazing fees, has been in dispute with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management .

Bundy, a rancher who owes the federal government over $1 million in unpaid grazing fees, has been in dispute with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management . The move diffused the situation, but on Sunday more than 100 people were still at a roadside command center where a banner read: 'The West has now been won.' An emotional Bundy thanked a small crowd of 50 people who sat in blustery conditions with desert sand swirling around the small encampment. Bundy, a Mormon father of 14, said he had been 'humbled' by so much support. 'What we did was necessary but we are just at the begriming. This fight will go on.' Around him banners proclaiming hatred towards the Federal Government flapped wildly in the wind. The noise from flapping flags was often so loud in drowned out the procession of speakers who came to pledge their support to 'fight for freedom.' One banner read: 'Putin took Ukraine. Obama couldn't be outdone, so he had to take Nevada.' Others had quotes from the US constitution and warnings for the Government not to interfere with the rights of people. One car parked at the site had a warning that anyone born after 1980 could have had a chip implanted in their body by the US Government. An armed civilian waits nearby in some bushes .

Despite not a single police officer being present when Bundy got up to speak he was flanked by two armed bodyguards. When MailOnline attempted to reach Bundy's ranch they were stopped by four heavily armed members of a militia. One carried an AR-15 rifle with telescopic sight and a hunting knife strapped to his chest. Others in full camouflage clothing patrolled the road seemingly on the alert for an unseen enemy. Asked why Bundy needed armed bodyguards, a militia member said brusquely: 'The Government are out to get him. We do not know what they are capable off.' When it was pointed out that all federal agents had left the area 24 hours ago he replied: 'They could be spying on us from a drone.' At the prayer service members of a so called 'Anonymous Security' milled around. Their faces were obscured by masks taken from the film V- for Vendetta. Others wore T-shirts with the words: 'Tyranny Response Team.' As Bundy left the service a procession of people lined up to shake his hand and thank him.

One woman with tears in her eyes hugged Bundy and said: 'It is a privilege for me to be here.' Most of those who had turned out in support of Bundy appeared to be from Arizona. Others had traveled from Montana and Utah. Among them were several politicians, including state representative David Livingstone. He said: 'Make no mistake this is just the beginning. This is not about Mr Bundy and his cattle but about the Federal Government and their land grab. 'For many people this was the tipping point. The Government will be back here in two weeks and so will be. This issue is not going away.' Mr Livingstone, who represents Peoria, Arizona, said he estimated the cost of the Bureau of Land Management round up operation to have cost between $2m and $5m. 'That is just ludicrous,. They say Mr Bundy owes $1m yet they have just spend almost five times that in a failed operation to seize his cattle. 'Where is the sense in that. It is just federal government wasting more of the taxpayers money.' Tyler Lewis, from St. George, Utah, stands in the middle of north bound I-15 with his gun while supporting the family . Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years . The dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave Desert tortoise. Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle. Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2m he owes to the Government. The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region. The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals. The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.","Cliven Bundy said he expects officials with the Bureau of Land Management to make another attempt to seize his cattle .
