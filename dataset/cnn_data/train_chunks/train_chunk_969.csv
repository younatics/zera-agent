"Shadow warrior: 'Ninja' Neil Duffield strikes a pose in the Seaworld car park, where armed police pounced with Tasers after someone dialled 999 . When Neil Duffield found out his work was to hold a superhero fun day, he decided it would be a great chance to dress up as that classic villain of Japanese history - the ninja. So, when the day came, he donned the shadow warriors' distinctive black apparel, face covered in the manner of the medieval assassins, strapped a plastic sword to his back, and hopped on his bike. But as he pedalled the Southend, Essex seafront on his way to work at the Sealife Adventure Centre, a startled member of the public took fright and dialled 999. It was then, as Mr Duffield entered the Sealife car park, that Essex Police's Armed Response Unit pounced. They ordered him to freeze, with 50,000 volt Taser stun guns pointed squarely at his chest. Stunned Mr Duffield, of Southchurch Road, Southend, said: 'I was told to stay where I was.  I had no idea what was going on. 'I was then told to raise my hands and keep them in the air. By this time, I had a rough idea of what was going on because of my outfit. 'I just said ""it’s a costume, it’s a toy"" while I had my arms in the air. The officers were from the armed response unit, they had tasers. I just stood still. 'I kept as calm as I possibly could but I was quite scared. It all happened really quickly.' The officers frisked him and quickly discovered the sword was a plastic toy. They then told Mr Duffield, who has worked at the centre for five years, to relax, explaining that a member of the public had alerted them to a suspicious character. 'They were just doing their job really,' said Mr Duffield, whose exploits have now earned him the moniker 'Ninja Neil' among colleagues. 'They told me to put my arms down and explained the situation. There were a few smiles afterwards.' He added: 'I was told not to carry it in public again....So I guess I’m not going to be out on the streets fighting crime after all!' Hi ya! Mr Duffield pounces with the ferocity of one of Japan's fabled assassin elite. But he wasn't so fierce when armed police had 50,000 volt Taser stun guns aimed at his chest . Mr Duffield said that instead of the deadly ninja throwing stars he was carrying starfish with him, which were due to go on display at nearby Adventure Island. Sealife Adventure manager Lucy Hodges accepted police had done right thing. She added: 'Looking back it was quite amusing. The police were really nice.' A police spokesman said: 'Officers were alerted just after 11am on Sunday to a man cycling on the seafront wearing a balaclava with a sword strapped to his back. 'They performed a low-key stop and after speaking to him realised the sword was plastic. He was taking part in a superhero themed weekend at Sealife Adventure.'",'Ninja' Neil Duffield had a plastic toy sword strapped across his back .
"They arrived on a private jet but Catalan Dragons finally ran out of fuel, their dream play-off run ended by a St Helens side who showed their class to reach a sixth Grand Final in eight seasons. The French visitors notched 6,000 air miles and unlikely wins over Leeds Rhinos and Huddersfield in their play-off campaign. They would have dearly loved another trip across from Perpignan to attend next Saturday’s Grand Final for the first time. But Saints, who have not won the end-of-season prize since 2006, ran out comfortable winners with important tries either side of the interval. Adam Swift dives over to score one of St Helens' five tries after doing brilliantly to stay in-field . Saints were strong in defence as Willie Manu and Sia Soliola bring down Zeb Taia of the Dragons . ‘We’re at the big dance now and the boys deserve it,’ said St Helens assistant coach Keiron Cunningham. Saints overcame adversity to clinch the League Leaders’ Shield following season-ending injuries to Luke Walsh, Jonny Lomax and Jon Wilkin. ‘There’s 1,000 excuses for why we shouldn’t be here,’ said Cunningham. ‘We lost our three best players but we didn’t give up, we fought on and that’s the proudest thing for me.’ Kyle Amor holds off three tacklers and looks to off-load as Saints fought back from behind to establish a lead . They face the winners of Friday night’s semi-final between Warrington and Wigan. Tournament organisers will no doubt be relieved, realising that even as sweet a story as Catalan’s run here will not fill Old Trafford like an all-Lancashire final. Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous said he was ‘very proud’ of his team, who were without their star player Morgan Escare, who hobbled off the field five minutes after the interval. Escare had controversially put the visitors ahead, skipping over the line after an acrobatic but suspect off-load from Thomas Bosc. The home fans booed as Bosc made the conversion. Veteran Paul Wellens celebrates with Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook after St Helens' 30-12 victory . Two minutes later Jordan Turner bulldozed his way over and Mark Percival kicked the first of five conversions. Adam Swift gave Saints the lead just before the interval. He burst down the wing and was inches from being bundled out, but somehow grounded the ball legally. The decisive try came 10 minutes after the break. Paul Wellens and Tommy Makinson combined to release Willie Manu. The 20st 7lb prop Mose Masoe plunged the dagger further into Catalan hearts as he shrugged off a couple of slightly less burly men to dive under the posts. Percival rounded off the scoring 15 minutes from time. The Catalan fans who made the trip were in good spirits as they celebrated a fantastic play-off run .","Saints run in five tries to reach Super League showpiece .

"Vauxhall has been on a roll this week, announcing hundreds of new jobs in Britain ahead of the launch of the new Astra family hatchback, which is to be built at its factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. And it's also released details of the new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini. It's set for its official launch at the Paris Motor Show in October, priced from less than £10,000. Vauxhall is out to knock Ford's Fiesta off the top sales spot. The current Corsa — its best-seller — sold 83,000 in the UK in the past year, against around 121,000 Fiestas. Supercar: Vauxhall's new, fifth-generation Corsa super-mini is set to launch in October . Although almost as long as the outgoing model, Vauxhall says almost every other aspect of the new car's design and engineering has been changed to 'significantly improve' it. That includes a re-designed instrument panel and dashboard and Vauxhall's IntelliLink communications system, which operates through a 7in colour touchscreen, is compatible with smartphones and incorporates extra features, such as voice command. The new model, pictured right, will be available with heated front seats, steering wheel and windscreen, as well as 'soft-tone' ambient lighting and an optional, full-size panoramic roof. Available in three and fivedoor versions, the next-generation Corsa has a new chassis, better suspension and speedsensitive power steering, while the chassis has been tuned for a smoother drive, with more precise steering, to cater for what Vauxhall calls Britain's 'unique and challenging topography'. Does it mean our crumbling, potholed roads? Star exhibit: Princess Diana's Austin Mini Metro will be on display at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional . A red Austin Mini Metro once owned by Princess Diana — and affectionately known as the 'Courting Car' — will be the star exhibit at an event that aims to be the antidote to all those posh, glittering supercar extravaganzas. Normally in Coventry Transport Museum, it makes its first public outing in around 20 years at Hagerty's Festival of the Unexceptional later this month. Said to have been a gift from Prince Charles to the then Lady Diana Spencer during their courtship, the car will headline the first 'Concours de l'Ordináire' in Towcester, Northants. The event promises 'the finest collection of mauve interiors and beige exteriors ever brought together in one place', within a show that 'humorously celebrates the best examples of some of the most mundane British and European cars ever built' between 1968 and 1985. An spokesman said: 'The 1980 Metro is the final entry on a list of 50 truly unexceptional vehicles and highlights how a great era of ordinary cars has become endangered.' Other unexceptional specimens include a Peel P50, a three-wheeled micro-car, produced from 1962 to 1965, and an Austin Maestro — a distant cousin of the Metro — owned by the grand-daughter of the aristocrat who financed William Morris, to create his celebrated, eponymous company. Can you imagine F1 archrivals McLaren and Williams getting together? They are next week for a major sale of registration plates. The DVLA is offering the plate '650 S', ideal if you're the owner of a £200,000 McLaren 650S supercar. The plate (reserve price £3,500) is among 1,500 that will go under the hammer during the agency's threeday summer auction. The event at the Williams Formula One team's factory starts on Wednesday, July 16 and entry includes a pass to the museum, which houses one of the largest collection of grand prix cars under one roof.

"A groundbreaking new app for Google Glass allows users to take photos just by thinking about them. MindRDR claims to be the world’s first telekinetic app for the hi-tech specs that lets a wearer use brainwaves to take photos of what they can see, simply by concentrating really hard on the image. As well as thinking about taking the photo, wearers can then use the power of thought to share the pictures on Twitter and Facebook. Scroll down for video . MindRDR claims to be the world's first telekinetic app for Google Glass (pictured along with a sensor) and uses brainwaves to take photos of what a wearer sees, as well as sharing their snaps on Twitter and Facebook . The current version of MindRDR uses commercially available brain monitor Neurosky MindWave Mobile to analyse brainwaves, expressed as meditation and attention levels. These values are used to build up session information that charts concentration levels over time. Wearers of Glass and the sensor can take photos by concentrating and relaxing. The app’s visual feedback is represented by a horizontal line that sits in the middle of the screen, which moves closer to the top of the screen the more users concentrate. The more they relax, the further down the screen the line goes. Once the line reaches the top of the screen, Google Glass takes the photo. At the next screen, users either concentrate to move the line to the top of the screen and share it, or relax to move the line to the bottom to discard the image and take another photo. The app also shows users ‘scores’ of how they are doing and signals success using emojis. It means that users of Glass no longer . have to touch the specs or use a voice command to take a picture, which . will thrill some photographers but cause other people to worry that the . innovation could be used to invade their privacy by wearers taking . covert photos. Built by London-based firm This Place, the free app, which launches today, uses Google Glass and the Neurosky EEG biosensor. The app enables the sensor, which measures brainwaves to translate brain activity into action, to communicate with Google Glass, allowing users to control actions on the device by concentrating and relaxing. MindRDR presents Google Glass wearers with visual feedback throughout the process to demonstrate how close they are to taking a picture and then lets them share it on social media channels. ‘Google Glass is one of the world’s most recognisable and popular pieces of wearable technology, but after getting our hands on it, the challenge of connecting it to brainwaves was one we could not resist,’ said Dusan Hamlin, founder and CEO of This Place. Built by London-based firm This Place, the free app uses Google Glass and the Neurosky EEG biosensor (pictured) to measure a wearer's brainwaves and allow them to take photos simply by concentrating on what is in front of them . ‘Currently, users either have to touch it or use voice commands, which are restrictive for some social situations and for users with disabilities. ‘All we could think was, how can we make the user’s experience even better? We wanted to realise the true potential of Glass by allowing users to control it with their minds.’ MindRDR’s visual feedback is represented by a horizontal line that sits in the middle of the screen, which moves closer to the top of the screen the more users concentrate. The more they relax, the further down the screen the line goes. Once the line reaches the top of the screen, Google Glass takes a photo. At the next screen, users either concentrate to move the line to the top of the screen and share it, or relax to move the line to the bottom to discard the image and take another photo. MindRDR presents Google Glass wearers (pictured) with visual feedback throughout the process to demonstrate how close they are to taking a picture. It is designed to make communicating and collecting information less obvious then voice commands and touching a button . Chloe Kirton, creative director at This Place, says: ‘While MindRDR’s current capabilities are limited to taking and sharing an image, the possibilities of Google Glass telekinesis are vast. ‘In the future, MindRDR could give those with conditions like locked-in syndrome, severe multiple sclerosis or quadriplegia the opportunity to interact with the wider world through wearable technology like Google Glass. ‘This Place is already in conversation with Professor Stephen Hawking, amongst others, about the possibilities MindRDR could bring as the product evolves.’ Mr Hamlin said: ‘Imagine a world where you can interact with wearable devices just by thinking about the content you want. That’s the world we’re building, and we’re just getting started.’ In a bid to help the technology catch-on, the MindRDR software is open source and is available on GitHub from today.","MindRDR claims to be the world’s first telekinetic app for the hi-tech specs .

"Insider insists bank bosses must have known about Libor fixing in 2008 . Hearing: Former chief executive Bob Diamond left Barclays over the matter, before appearing before MPs this week . A former senior employee of Barclays has spoken out about a 'culture of fear' that existed at the bank - and alleged that it is 'impossible' that bosses did not know about the interest rate rigging taking place on their watch. The banker claims disgraced ex-chief executive Bob Diamond would have been aware that his traders were involved in Libor fiddling in 2008. Mr Diamond maintains that he knew nothing about the rate fixing and told MPs this week that he only heard about it last month. Today's revelations follow demands from furious shareholders that the bank strips its former boss of his entitlement to an £18million bonus, while the Serious Fraud Office yesterday confirmed it is pursuing criminal investigations into the industry-wide conspiracy. The banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Independent that Barclays executives must have been told about irregularities in Libor - a key lending rate - because staff knew they would be sacked if they did not report any such concerns to their managers. This goes against Mr Diamond's insistence that signs of distorted Libor figures were not reported up. During Mr Diamond's reign, the banker said, Barclays was run through management by intimidation, and some employees felt it necessary to work 15-hour days due to a brutal appraisals system that left them in constant fear for their jobs. The insider account laid blame on the former chief, saying: 'Bob Diamond was the CEO and his policies come down through the executive committee, and then MDs and directors push that down through the firm. All of this stuff ultimately comes from the top.' This climate of fear and fierce competition was encouraged by directors, the former employee claimed, and those who complained or appeared to crack under the pressure would be 'demoralised' and slowly 'managed out' of the company. The unnamed insider also raised the question of whether MPs could have been more rigorous in their questioning of Mr Diamond when he appeared before a Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday. A Barclays spokesman responded by pointing out that Rich Ricci, head of the investment banking division, had led a probe into rate-rigging and passed on his findings to the board. Meanwhile, the SFO's own inquiry has been launched after it was put off last year because of lack of funding; its budget has been cut by 38 per cent over five years. It has been sharing information with the Financial Services Authority from its investigation into Barclays and other banks thought to be caught up in rate-rigging. Leading City investors say Mr Diamond, who quit this week over the scandal, should not receive a penny. Under fire: Barclays former chairman Marcus Agius (right) with former CEO Bob Diamond (centre), and former chief executive John Varley (left) Joanne Segars, chief executive of the . National Association of Pension Funds – one of the most powerful . shareholder groups in the country – said: ‘Shareholders, including . pension funds, have been negatively affected by their investments in . Barclays. ‘This whole . issue has been deeply damaging and raises questions about previous pay . which now need answers. Any severance payments to top staff must be kept . to a contractual minimum.’ Mr . Diamond has pocketed more than £120million from Barclays since 2007, . while pension savers and shareholders – including 719,000 small private . investors – have seen the value of their holdings plunge. Barclays . is under pressure to claw back the potential £18million payout to Mr . Diamond, who quit on Wednesday after the bank was fined £290million . because corrupt traders had made huge profits by secretly manipulating . Libor figures. As the SFO prepares its . investigation, Labour leader Ed Miliband continued to push for an . independent inquiry into the banking scandal despite MPs rejecting the . demands. The Labour . leader said that while the party would cooperate with a parliamentary . investigation, its remit was too ""narrow"" and a judge-led probe was . still needed. Mr . Miliband also defended the conduct of Ed Balls after the shadow . chancellor engaged in a bitter war of words with his opposite number . George Osborne in the Commons. It . followed an interview with the Spectator where Mr Osborne said former . prime minister Gordon Brown's inner circle had 'questions to answer' over apparent pressure on Barclays to post lower Libor rates during the . credit crunch. Backing: Ed Miliband (left) has defended Ed Balls (right) after he engaged in a bitter war of words with his opposite number George Osborne in the Commons . Bank of England deputy governor Paul . Tucker and Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, who announced his intention . to resign after a replacement for Mr Diamond is found, will give . evidence on the rate-rigging scandal to the Treasury Select Committee . next week. Mr Tucker . was dragged into the affair by Mr Diamond, who revealed a record of a . conversation they had in October 2008 in which the deputy governor . relayed concerns in Whitehall about Barclays' high Libor rates. The American banker said Mr Tucker . was trying to warn him that ""there are ministers in Whitehall who are . hearing that Barclays is always high, that could lead to the impression . that you are not funding yourself"". Barclays . was dealt another blow yesterday as agencies Moody's and Standard & . Poor's downgraded their outlook for the bank's credit rating in the . wake of Mr Diamond's departure. The agencies said the departure of Mr . Diamond, as well as Mr Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del . Missier, could lead to the break-up of its powerhouse investment arm. Appearing before the Treasury Select Committee earlier this week, Mr Diamond was savaged by some MPs. Labour . MP John Mann said Mr Diamond had been either ‘complicit in what was . going on, or grossly negligent, or grossly incompetent’. But . the former boss said he had been ‘physically ill’ when he learned of . the behaviour of traders who rigged the Libor rates, had known nothing . about it before last month, and did not feel personally to blame. Mr . Diamond said emails showing that traders fiddling the rates had told . each other ‘this is for you big boy’ and promised bottles of Bollinger . champagne had been ‘reprehensible’. But . he suggested other banks had been manipulating their rates while . Barclays was telling the truth at the height of the financial crisis. Barclays . has been fined £290million by regulators after its traders were . revealed to have spent years fiddling the rate, based on individual . banks’ own declarations of what they were paying to borrow. Mr . Diamond faced the most intense questioning from MPs over a key phone . conversation he had with the deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul . Tucker in 2008. He refused . to speculate about the identity of ‘senior Whitehall figures’ he said Mr . Tucker told him had been concerned about Barclays’ Libor rate. However, . he did suggest that Baroness Vadera, a Cabinet Office minister who was a . senior economic adviser to Gordon Brown, had been heavily involved in . discussions with the banks at the time.","Insider insists bank bosses must have known about Libor fixing in 2008 .

"Security experts have revealed a major flaw in dating app Tinder's security that could allow a someone to pinpoint the exact location of a user. The flaw was discovered in October, when security firm IncludeSec first told Tinder of the bug. However, they waited until now - when the flaw was fixed - to go public because of the huge security risk it posed. Scroll down for video . The flaw revealed the exact location of any Tinder user in code sent from the app to servers. It would allow hackers to easily triangulate where a user was. The team found the Tinder app revealed the exact distance from the match in code sent to its sever. By intercepting this, it was possible to find the exact distance from the user. By creating three fake accounts and locations and looking at the target user, they could triangulate the exact location of the user. 'Being a dating app, it's important that Tinder shows you attractive singles in your area,' said Max Veytsman of IncludeSec, which uncovered the flaw. 'To that end, Tinder tells you how far away potential matches are.' The firm said that in July 2013 it found Tinder was actually sending latitude and longitude co-ordinates of potential matches to the iOS client. 'Anyone with rudimentary programming skills could query the Tinder API directly and pull down the co-ordinates of any user. ' However, the firm said Tinder soon fixed the bug - but introduced a new bug as they did. 'By proxying iPhone requests, it's possible to get a picture of the API the Tinder app uses. 'Of interest to us today is the user endpoint, which returns details about a user by id. The researchers even created a private web app called Tinder finder to show off their discovery - but did not reveal until the flaw was fixed . One of the fake profiles created by the researchers - using their flaw, they were able to pinpoint the user exactly . 'This is called by the client for your potential matches as you swipe through pictures in the app.' The team found the API revealed the exact distance from the match. By creating three fake accounts and locations, they could triangulate the exact location of the user. The team even built a special site to show exactly where a user was, automating the entire process. 'I can create a profile on Tinder, use the API to tell Tinder that I'm at some arbitrary location, and query the API to find a distance to a user. 'When I know the city my target lives in, I create 3 fake accounts on Tinder. 'I then tell the Tinder API that I am at three locations around where I guess my target is. 'Then I can plug the distances into the formula on this Wikipedia page.' The firm stressed the app was never made available, and that the flaw had now been fixed  by tinder - even though it was first reported in October last year. 'This is a serious vulnerability, and we in no way want to help people invade the privacy of others.' By setting up three accounts and looking at the same user, the hackers could triangulate their exact location . 'At IncludeSec we specialize in application security assessment for our clients, that means taking applications apart and finding really crazy vulnerabilities before other hackers do. 'The API calls used in this proof of concept demonstration are not special in any way, they do not attack Tinder's servers and they use data which the Tinder web services exports intentionally. 'There is no simple way to determine if this attack was used against a specific Tinder user.' Sean Rad, Tinder's cofounder and CEO, told MailOnline: 'Include Security identified a technical exploit that theoretically could have led to the calculation of a user’s last known location. 'Shortly after being contacted, Tinder implemented specific measures to enhance location security and further obscure location data. 'We did not respond to further inquiries about the specific security remedies and enhancements taken as we typically do not share the specifics of Tinder's security measures. 'We are not aware of anyone else attempting to use this technique. 'Our users’ privacy and security continue to be our highest priority.","App maker was notified of serious privacy flaw in October .

"Ernst Hess, Adolf Hitler's company commander in WWI, who was, despite his Jewish roots, spared from the genocide unleashed by the Nazis . Some German Jews escaped the Holocaust by fleeing the country, others hid and some battled to stay alive long enough to be freed from the Nazi death camps. But Ernst Hess owed his survival to the personal intervention of Adolf Hitler. The Fuhrer ordered his SS thugs to leave the Jewish judge alone because Hess had been his commanding officer during the First World War. Hitler looked back on his time on the Western Front with great pride and fondness so, while some six million Jews perished in the Holocaust set in motion by Hitler, Hess was allowed to live on the Fuhrer's whim. His remarkable story was told by his daughter Ursula, 86, after a newspaper unearthed the letter sent on the orders of Hitler insisting that Hess was not to be 'persecuted or deported'. A file kept by the Dusseldorf Gestapo on him includes the letter from the head of the Gestapo and the SS, Heinrich Himmler, dated August 27, 1940, saying Hess must receive 'relief and protection as per the Fuhrer's wishes'. Himmler made a point of informing all relevant authorities and officials that the judge was 'not to be inopportuned in any way whatsoever'. Ironically, Hess told his daughter that he and his old comrades from the trenches hardly remembered Hitler – by then a well-known figure in German politics – when they met at reunions in the 1920s and 30s. He told her that the future dictator rarely spoke and had few friends among the troops. Historians have in recent years poured scorn on the Nazi myth of the heroic Corporal Hitler running messages from one frontline trench to another. In fact, other soldiers regarded him as a 'rear area pig', taking his messages between HQs a few  miles behind the front. Ernst Moritz Hess, born in 1890, had joined the 2nd Royal Bavarian Reserve Infantry as an officer at the beginning of the First World War, the same regiment that Austrian-born Hitler volunteered for. Both men were deployed to the Flanders front in autumn 1914, serving in what was known as the List Regiment until 1918. Hess was seriously wounded in October of 1914 and again two years later in October 1916. In the summer of that year, the highly decorated officer had temporarily been Hitler's company commander. Although baptised a protestant, his mother was Jewish and the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935, introduced by the Nazis, classified him as a 'full blooded Jew'.

His family saw him being beaten up outside . his house by Nazi thugs the same year. He had petitioned Hitler in June of 1936 asking for an exception to be made for him and his daughter under the race laws. In his letter Hess said: 'For us, it is a kind of spiritual death to now be branded as Jews and exposed to general contempt.' Hess ended up as a slave labourer, . building barracks. This time he escaped extermination because of his . 'privileged miscegenated marriage' to Margarete Hess, a Protestant. His sister Berta was gassed at Auschwitz, wrongly believing that the protection afforded to her brother extended to her. Hess died in Frankfurt after a successful career in post-war West Germany on September 14, 1983. Hess moved his family to Bolzano, . Italy in October 1937, but was forced to return in 1939.  Hoping that . his connections to Hitler would keep him safe, he moved his family to a . remote Bavarian village in mid-1940. A copy of the letter Himmler sent to . the Gestapo in Dusseldorf was given to him. But in late June 1941, Hess . was summoned to appear before the SS in Munich. When he submitted his letter of . protection it was taken from him and he was told it had been revoked in . May of 1941, and that he was now 'a Jew like any other'.","Ernst Hess commanded Adolf Hitler's unit during the First World War .

"'Patronising': Colin Baker as Dr Who in the 1980s worked with Jimmy Savile on a specially written scene . Former Dr Who Colin Baker claims Jimmy Savile behaved like an overindulged child who lacked professional respect. Baker, 69, worked with Savile on a specially written Dr Who scene which aired on Jim’ll Fix It in 1985. The scene had been set up after young boy Gareth Jenkins wrote to Savile asking if he could help him meet Dr Who and travel in the Tardis, the doctor’s famous time machine. Baker, who played the doctor from 1984 to 1986, said: ‘I met Jimmy Savile briefly in the 1980s when I was working on Dr Who. A young man had written asking if he could “fix it” for him to meet the Doctor and travel in the Tardis. ‘After the lad had saved the day and the Sontarans had been “fixed”, Savile entered the set and did his usual self-congratulatory shtick. ‘I didn’t warm to him. His demeanour was neither friendly, nor inclusive. He behaved much as one might expect a child to behave who had been indulged and led to believe that life revolved around them. ‘There was certainly none of the professional respect that one would expect to be shared when two programmes combine for a special purpose. Even though we were on the Tardis set, it was very much his territory and his agenda.’ Scroll down for video . His agenda on set: Gareth Jenkins (centre) wrote to Savile (left in the scene with the boy, Baker and Janet Fielding) asking if he could help him meet Dr Who . Baker said all the actors had worked hard on the specially written scene, called A Fix with the Sontarans. He said: ‘A special scene was written, called A Fix with the Sontarans, which we duly rehearsed and recorded. ‘The other actors and I had worked hard over a couple of days to create a relaxed atmosphere, but the first and only time he saw Savile was when he came on the set when the cameras were rolling. Revolved around him: Savile claps after Baker puts a 'Jim fixed it for me' medal around Gareth's neck in the scene. Baker said that while they were on a Dr Who set, Savile acted as if it was his territory and on his agenda . Big difference: Savile kisses Fielding's hand in the scene in which Baker described him as 'creepy and 'patronising' but said that there was a big difference between that and suspecting him of a sexual predator . ‘His eyes were cold and his demeanour patronising. I recall clearly the disappointment I felt for the young boy for whom I suspect the whole experience was daunting and overwhelming. ‘At least it was I who got to put the Jim’ll Fix It medallion around his neck.’ 'Should have been braver': Baker said there may have been people who could or should have come forward when rumours about Savile surfaced . Speaking on the mounting abuse allegations recently made against Savile, Baker said: ‘There is of course a huge difference between finding someone creepy and patronising and suspecting them of being a sexual predator. ‘I only hope that the BBC’s failure . to investigate him does not tarnish, in the eyes of the world, an . organisation that has rightly been regarded as a bastion of honest and . honourable broadcasting for decades. ‘There may have been individuals who . could or should have been braver in confronting the unpleasant . possibility of his depravity when rumours and accusations surfaced, but . that is evidently also true of the hospitals and mental institutions . that trusted him to the extent that he had his own set of keys for . Broadmoor with living quarters on the site and a bedroom at Stoke . Mandeville Hospital. ‘A picture is emerging of a man . unusually adept at manipulation and concealment. Identifying willing . co-conspirators and abusers is much more important than demonising the . bamboozled who may have thought their suspicions so far off the scale of . decent human behaviour as to be unbelievable.’ Janet Fielding also starred in the . scene where Dr Who accidentally teleports himself and companion Tegan .

"A teen Florida foot fetish performer and two male friends were arrested this week after having sex with girls aged 12, 13 and 14-years-old and bragging about it on social media, authorities said. Bianca Byndloss, 19, of Miami, drove the underage girls to 18-year-old Christian Hernandez’s house Wednesday and had group sex while being filmed by Bryan Yanes, also 18, according to investigators. A self-proclaimed ‘porn diva,’ Byndloss relentlessly promotes herself on Twitter and Tumblr advertising foot fetish sex shows she performs on Skype in exchange for money. 'Porn diva' and foot fetishist Bianca Byndloss, from Miami, has been charged with sex with a minor and promoting the sexual performance of a child after having group sex with three girls aged 12, 13 and 14 and two 18-year-old men . Accomplices: Brian Yates (left) and Christian Hernandez (right) are also charged with having sex with the underage girls . The trio had consensual sex with the minors while filming the acts, an arrest report cited by the Miami Herald said. A video posted online showing the young girls in the act led to someone reporting the teens to police, and a warrant issued led cops to make more disturbing finds. Footage of two of the underage girls performing oral sex on each other, a close up of one of the young girl’s genitals and various other pictures and videos of the encounter were discovered on Hernandez’s cell phone, police told WTVJ. Police said that Byndloss drove the girls to Hernandez's home for the sex party last week. She is out on $37,500 bond . Shameless: Byndloss has posted several revealing pictures online and performs sex shows on Skype for cash .

"It may at first seem a highly illogical picture - but fear not, you can Klingon to the knowledge it really did come from the surface of Mars. Nasa today revealed this amazing v-shaped dune field on Mars - which looks uncannily like the Starfleet logo from the hit TV show Star Trek. It was spotted by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Scroll down for video . The 'wingtip' dunes were spotted in a dune field in a large crater near Mawrth Vallis on the martian surface . They bear an uncanny resemblance to the Star fleet insignia badges seen on crew members throughout the series, shown here. This image was acquired by the HiRISE camera aboard the Orbiter on Dec. 30, 2013. 'In this image of a dune field in a large crater near Mawrth Vallis, some of the dunes appear to be in formation,' Nasa said. It likened the formation to flying birds. 'Migratory birds and military aircraft—like during World War II—often fly in a V-shaped formation,' it said. 'The 'V' formation greatly boosts the efficiency and range of flying birds, because all except the first fly in the upward motion of air--called upwash--from the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead.' The odd shapes were formed by a combination of whather and terrain, it said. 'For dune fields, the spacing of individual dunes is a function of sand supply, wind speed, and topography.; . The dune field has dozens of the strange shapes on it. The find isn't Star Trek's first brush wiht the Nasa's red planet projects. Earlier this year actor William Shatner joined growing calls for Nasa to investigate the bizarre 'jelly doughnut' shaped rock on the Martian surface. Shatner asked Nasa about the strange Mars rock found by Opportunity via Twitter during a press conference on the Opportunity rovers latest discoveries - asking mission controllers if they had ruled out 'Martian rock throwers'. Mission controllers responding by saying Shatner's theory was 'unlikely'.'We've got another question from Twitter, this one from William Shatner,' NASA spokesman Guy Webster said, according to space.com. A starfleet flag from the show recently auctioned at Christie's . Willaims Shatner recently took to Twitter to question Nasa about its finding on the red planet . 'He'd like to know if you've ruled out the Martian rock throwers in the case of the jelly doughnut.' Nasa later said it had solved the mystery of a 'jelly doughnut' rock that appeared on the Martian surface - and says it was just a rolling stone. The white-rimmed, red-centered rock caused a stir last month when it appeared in an image the rover took on January 8th. More recent images show the original piece of rock struck by the rover's wheel, slightly uphill from where Pinnacle Island, the name Nasa gave the rock, came to rest. 'Once we moved Opportunity a short distance, after inspecting Pinnacle Island, we could see directly uphill an overturned rock that has the same unusual appearance,' said Opportunity Deputy Principal Investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. 'We drove over it. 'We can see the track. 'That's where Pinnacle Island came from.'","Unusual dune field spotted by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .

"Arrested: Matthew de Grood is facing murder charges over the stabbing . The son of a Calgary city police officer has been charged with murder after five students were stabbed to death at a house party to celebrate the end of term on Tuesday.

"Furious: Susan Tanner, 37, was kicked off a Stagecoach bus with her two children because her 15-month-old toddler, Tommy (above), was crying . A mother and her two children were heartlessly thrown off a Stagecoach bus because her 15-month-old toddler would not stop crying. Susan Tanner, 37, caught the bus with her youngest son, Tommy, and his six-year-old brother, Frankie, from their home in New Romney, Kent. She was planning to take the 35-minute journey to Folkestone so that she could buy clothes for her eldest son ahead of his first day at school next week. But when her youngest, Tommy, began to bawl two miles from the family's intended destination, the driver decided he had heard enough and kicked them off the bus and on to the street. Miss Tanner is furious about the incident and claimed: 'The driver said ""Do you need some time out?"" I asked what he meant. 'He then said ""Do you need to get off the bus because the baby is crying?"" 'I said no, and I asked the other passengers if the baby was disturbing them. None of them said so. 'The driver then said ""It's disturbing me and I would like you to get off the bus"". 'Frankie was so upset because he didn't understand why his mum was thrown off the bus. 'I am still in shock. I couldn't believe it.' After being ditched in Sandgate village, just five minutes drive from Folkestone, Miss Tanner was forced to call her partner for a lift - despite the fact that she had already paid £6.40 in bus fares. After eventually being dropped off in Folkestone, the mother-of-two marched straight to the bus station to complain - only to be told she would have to sit and fill out a complaint form if she wanted to get a refund. A Stagecoach spokesman said the driver's action was strongly against company policy. He said: 'We were very concerned to hear about this incident. Stranded: After being thrown from the Stagecoach bus (like the one pictured), Miss Tanner had to call her partner for a lift . 'We have carried out an investigation to find out what happened and can confirm that one of our drivers suggested Ms Tanner alight the bus. 'This is definitely not part of any company procedure or policy and we would like to offer Miss Tanner our sincere apologies for our driver's actions. 'We will take appropriate action to prevent this from ever happening again. 'We have not yet received Ms Tanner's formal complaint, but when we do we will reiterate this apology to her directly.' It is not the first time Stagecoach has received complaints over its treatment of passengers. In August, a mother from Cardiff claimed that one of their drivers refused to help her find a seat for her toddler, who has cerebral palsy - despite her explaining his condition. Alisha Frost, 24, was forced to sit on the floor while holding her brain damaged son, Jack, in her arms.","Susan Tanner, 37, caught bus from New Romney to Folkestone, both in Kent .

"A horrific video shows a Chinese female student engulfed in flames after a waitress tips too much flammable fluid on her table in a cook-your-own barbecue restaurant. The shocking video was filmed on the restaurant's CCTV on September 3. A woman with the surname, Qian, 20, who lives in  Heyang, a county of Weinan, Shaanxi in northwest China, apparently went to the self-service BBQ restaurant to meet a college friend before they returned to college after the summer break. The video posted, on chinasmack.com, shows the two friends eating their barbecued food at their table. Scroll down for video . A horrific video shows a Chinese female student rolling around hysterically as she is engulfed in flames in a BBQ restaurant, after a waitress tipped lighter fluid on a hot plate . A waitress is then called to the two friend's table when because there is not enough heat to cook the food. The 18-year-old waitress, named Shan, had only been working at the self-service barbecue restaurant for a month. She said her boss had previously only allowed her to refile the barbecues with a more experienced employee present. But the other employee had the day off and it was her first shot at refilling the BBQ plates by herself. The flame ignited because the waitress had poured the fluid on a BBQ in which a flame was still burning. This caused the entire table to ignite. To make matters worse, the panicked waitress apparently threw the entire bottle of alcohol on the table as she ran from the scene, leaving the 20-year-old student engulfed in flames. For over 10 seconds, Young Qian  rolled around on the floor, hysterically kicking and screaming, as she attempted to put out the burning flames. Her friend finally ran over shirtless, smacking the flames with his white shirt. It was when Young Qing felt that the heat from the barbeque was not strong enough, that he called the waitress over to their BBQ table and asked for the flames to be stronger . The young woman was rushed to hospital, where she was treated for burns. Fortunately for waitress Young Shan and Young Qing, their burns were not as severe as Young Qian, who was immediately transferred to the better equipped Yiwu Central Hospital for severe burns and then transferred a second time to a hospital in Hangzhou. Young Shan's right hand was only lightly burnt and Young Qing,  suffered second-degree burns on his head and neck and was transferred to an ordinary ward after being bandaged. The waitress who is completely horrified by her mistake, has been asking doctors if she will go to jail. 'I never thought this kind of thing would happen,' she said. Yiwu police are investigating the incident. The barbecue still had a flicker of a flame, as Young Shan poured the alcohol into the grill, which immediately ignited dangerous flames that shot across to Young Qian, causing her whole body to be captured in flames .

"Graeme Swann has rubbished Kevin Pietersen’s claim of a bullying culture in the England dressing room - and suggested that the sacked batsman has been guilty of bullying Matt Prior. In his autobiography, Pietersen claimed that England's bowlers ruled with fear and demanded apologies for fielding mistakes. Swann on Monday called the suggestions 'codswallop' before learning on Tuesday that an England and Wales Cricket Board document on Pietersen's behaviour alleges that the South African had referred to him as a 'c**t'. Graeme Swann(background) has rubbished Kevin Pietersen's claims of bullying in the England camp . Pietersen, pictured during the last Ashes series, told his side of the story in his new autobiography . Swann was given light treatment compared to wicket-keeper Matt Prior, though, with Pietersen reserving most of his personal criticism for the Sussex man. But, according to Swann, bowlers knew where the line was and, in his opinion, Pietersen's assassination of Prior can be considered as bullying. 'There was absolutely no bullying. Sure, bowlers shout at fielders if they are out of position or not concentrating,' he wrote in The Sun. 'A bowler or wicketkeeper delivers a bit of a kick up the backside - just like a goalkeeper shouts at his centre-half. This is international sport, not the Under-11s. Pietersen, pictured celebrating England's Ashes win in 2011 with Matt Prior, reserving personal criticism for the Sussex man in his new book . VIDEO Pietersen blasts former England 'regime' 'If Kevin or other players can't take a b*****king for being unprofessional, for being out of position or seemingly not trying, they are in the wrong business. I must stress bowlers never had a go at fielders for dropping catches or a genuine mistake. It was when somebody was out of position or too busy waving to the crowd.' Swann did concede that Pietersen's claims that Jonathan Trott 'cracked' during a game in Bangladesh after such an incident carried some truth, but insisted that Pietersen had 'misinterpreted' things. It is Pietersen's words about Prior which anger Swann the most, though. Known as 'Big Cheese' in the England squad, Pietersen accuses Prior of being a back-stabber, 'horrendous' and 'embarrassing' amongst other things. Swann feels his criticism is unfair, considering it was Prior who actively sought Pietersen's reintergration into the England team after the text-gate scandal of 2012. 'It is Kevin's attacks on Prior and (Andy) Flower that really annoy me. Matt is the most passionate bloke about protecting the team environment. He was the voice of the dressing room,' he added. 'Kevin obviously doesn't realise Matt was the guy who really fought to get him back in the team after the Andrew Strauss messages business in 2012. 'Matt was the one guy telling everyone we must work with Kevin, that he's a brilliant batsman and we need his talent. Cheese was the one bloke who picked up the phone to Kevin. Swann, pictured celebrating with Pietersen in 2008, feels his former England team-mate has been unfair . 'Now Kevin has written a whole chapter assassinating him, even having a pop at him for taking his bike to New Zealand. Kevin's attack on Matt is, dare I say it, a bit like bullying.' Speaking at a question and answer session in Manchester on Tuesday, Pietersen accused Swann of letting England down when he left last winter's Ashes Tour to retire through injury. Upon getting back from Australia, Swann praised Pietersen's attitude on tour, and stands by that viewpoint. Pietersen attack on former England head coach Andy Flower (right) has also angered Swann . 'I've said all along that Kevin was fine in Australia until the point I left the tour before the Fourth Test,' he added. 'So what changed? It must have something to do with Prior and Flower because he seems to have a vendetta. And, of course, he has a book to sell. 'Well, there is one ever-present feature in all this. Kevin shouldn't be called KP, he should be called CD - Common Denominator.'","Graeme Swann has rubbished Kevin Pietersen's claims of bullying among the England cricket team .

"Chinese police have detained more than 500 people from a fringe Christian group for spreading rumors about the world's impending end, state media reported today. In western China's Qinghai province alone, police arrested more than 400 members from the religious cult group, state-run China Central Television reported. Police seized leaflets, video discs, books and other apocalyptic materials as they arrested more than 500 people across eight provinces and regions, from the prosperous east coast to less developed western China, state media reports said. Police arrested 500 members from a fringe Christian group known as Almighty God across eight provinces . The detentions come ahead of Friday, December 21 - a date some say the Mayans prophesized would be the end of the world and which was the subject of the apocalyptic movie '2012.'. Those detained are reported to be members of the group Almighty God, which is also called Eastern Lightning, after a phrase from the Bible's Book of Matthew. Widely regarded as a heretical Christian sect, the group preaches that Jesus has reappeared as a woman in central China. It has been accused of targeting Christians, kidnapping and beating them to force conversions. Chinese society has been in tumult as decades of rapid free-market economic growth discredit communist ideology, loosen social controls and pull hundreds of millions from the countryside to the cities. Into the spiritual void have rushed traditional Buddhist groups and Daoist practices, as well as evangelical Christian churches and other spiritual groups, some with unorthodox and apocalyptic visions. City centre: Around 400 of the detainees were arrested in Qinghai province in Western China . Eastern Lightning first appeared around 20 years ago, and the official Xinhua News Agency said that its members had 'recently latched on to the Mayan doomsday prophesy to predict that the sun will not shine and electricity will not work for three days beginning on December 21'. A public notice on the web site of Qinghai provincial government said local police are waging a 'severe crackdown' on the group described as a cult with 'strong political penchants'. The government urged the public to inform the police of any illegal propaganda, gathering and preaching by the group. The CCTV report called the group a cult and accused it of attacking the party and the government, though it did not give any specifics. The state-run Huashang website last week, citing local authorities, reported that the group is urging followers to 'exterminate the great red dragon' - a reference to the Communist Party - 'and found a country under the rule of Almighty God'.","Those arrested are reported to be members of a fringe Christian group Almighty God - also known as Eastern Lightning .

The team, however, have still prepared the second car, which is to sit on Bianchi's side of the garage for the remainder of the weekend, and with his name over the entrance. It is understood to have been a tough decision to make for sporting director Graeme Lowdon and team principal John Booth, the latter remaining at Bianchi's bedside at the Mie General Medical Centre in Yokkaichi. Chilton expressed himself to be 'truly devastated' with regard to Bianchi's situation after the 25-year-old sustained brain injuries from a high-speed collision at Suzuka with a recovery vehicle. Despite that, along with the other 20 drivers this weekend, Chilton returned to the cockpit of his car as all attempted to put behind them the traumatic events of the race at Suzuka. Unsurprisingly, it was championship-chasing Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton who led the way, as they have done virtually all season long. On the back of three consecutive victories which has allowed him to open up a 10-point lead in the drivers' championship, Hamilton had to settle for second best to Rosberg by just 0.065 seconds. The latest Hermann Tilke-designed track, that winds its way through the Olympic Park central to the winter Games earlier this year, does not appear too technically demanding. Marussia have entered only Max Chilton this weekend out of respect to Jules Bianchi. His car is vacant . Jenson Button shows his support for Bianchi with two separate tributes on his helmet to the Frenchman . For the fans in evidence, they certainly saw plenty of action as the drivers completed numerous laps to ensure they are fully up to speed with its nuances. The best of Rosberg's 29 laps was a one minute 42.311secs, with Hamilton in close attendance, aborting one lap in which it appeared he would go quicker. Jenson Button, further highlighting McLaren's recent improvement, was a close third as the veteran Briton was 0.196secs adrift. With team-mate Kevin Magnussen fifth quickest, the duo sandwiched Ferrari's Fernando Alonso who finished four tenths of a second off the pace. Kimi Raikkonen in action for Ferrari on Friday. He finished eighth on the timesheets . The sun beams down on the track in Sochi, the venue for the Winter Olympics earlier this year . Behind Force India's Sergio Perez in sixth was Russia's home hope in Daniil Kvyat in his Toro Rosso, but who next year will be promoted to Red Bull as replacement for Ferrari-bound Sebastian Vettel. The four-times champion, whose reign is due to come to an end, was a lowly 14th, just over two seconds back, with team-mate Daniel Ricciardo two places and 0.6secs ahead. Aside from the Mercedes pair, Ricciardo is the only other driver who can win the title this season, with the Australian 73 points behind Hamilton. Another Russian in Sauber reserve Sergey Sirotkin was given his race-weekend debut and finished 17th, 2.721secs behind Rosberg. As for the lone Marussia, Chilton finished bottom of the pile, almost five seconds down.

"Uncapped Hull defender Brian Lenihan has been called up by the Republic of Ireland for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany, with injuries having taken their toll on Martin O'Neill's squad. The 20-year-old full-back will meet up with the Ireland party at their base in Portmarnock on Tuesday evening and train with his team-mates on Wednesday morning, with Seamus Coleman having joined Everton colleague James McCarthy and Aston Villa keeper Shay Given on the injured list. Coleman has been nursing a hamstring problem for several weeks, while club boss Roberto Martinez has indicated that midfielder McCarthy needs rest and recuperation as he battles a thigh injury. Hull defender Brian Lenihan, in action for Cork City, has yet to play for the Premier League side after his move . Seamus Coleman has pulled out of the squad after failing to recover from a hamstring injury in time . Given is struggling with a hip problem and O'Neill has effectively written off the trio's chances of being involved against either Gibraltar in Dublin on Saturday evening or Germany in Gelsenkirchen three days later. He said: 'I haven't spoken to Roberto Martinez, but I had a word with Seamus - Seamus doesn't feel fantastic at the moment - and James . 'There was talk about James being available, or trying to be available, for last Sunday's game against Manchester United, but I think that was a long shot. Manager Martin O'Neill (right) and assistant Roy Keane have been hit with a string of injury problems . James McCarthy has been in need of a rest for some time and missed Everton's last two games . 'At the moment, you would say that there is no chance of them being available.' Asked about Given, O'Neill said: 'He's picked up a hip injury that needs some sort of attention, and he thinks now might be the best time to get it done, to get it sorted out. It's been bothering him for a little while. 'We talked it over ourselves and thought maybe this might be the best chance so that he is clear, just in case anything happens to him in the next couple of months at club level, for instance if he did go out on loan or something like that, that he would be absolutely right for it.' Shay Given will miss out on the games with Germany and Gibraltar to 'sort out' a hip injury . World Champions Germany are the toughest test Ireland will have to face, while Gibraltar should be the easiest . The remaining 25 members of the squad trained in Malahide on Tuesday morning with Lenihan due to boost their ranks. O'Neill, who admitted he had not seen much of the Under-21 international, said: 'We are going to bring up young Brian Lenihan at Hull because we don't have any natural right-back in the team at the moment, so he will come in later on today and train with us tomorrow. 'I was speaking to some of the lads here at Hull, who said he has settled in well, and of course he is delighted to be coming.'","Lenihan has not played for Hull since joining from Cork City this summer .

"Oscar's host Ellen DeGeneres failed to keep up appearances for sponsor's Samsung during Sunday night's ceremony when she kept posting pictures to Twitter backstage from her own iPhone. Shooting what seemed like a carefully coordinated social-media and advertising blitz in the foot, DeGeneres snapped the now-famous A-list selfie and several other pictures with her Galaxy Note 3 live on air, but when she was off camera, she reverted to her trusty Apple smartphone. Having spent upwards of $25 million over the past five years of Oscar ceremonies at $1.8 million for 30-seconds of advertising space, Samsung would have been dismayed to see their chief rival gatecrashing what should have been a promotional coup for the South Korean firm. Scroll down for video . Publicity coup: It is now famous - dubbed the greatest selfie ever - and was uploaded to the Twitter account of Ellen DeGeneres after being taken on her Galaxy smartphone - provided to her by official Oscar's sponsor Samsung . Indeed, while the selfie featuring . Kevin Spacey, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence taken on . her Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone was an undoubted success, the gloss was . rubbed off when DeGeneres posted photos online from her iPhone, such as . one selfie with actor Channing Tatum. The . two-time host was rumbled because the source of the photograph as . posted to Twitter can not be seen on their own page, but this . information is visible by using a third-party app such as TweetDeck. And in at at least two pictures posted to Twitter by DeGeneres, the source was revealed to be her  iPhone. To make matters worse for Samsung, the South Korean firm was also ABC's 'The Oscars Backstage' sponsor, which called for a series of 10 promoted tweets of celebrity selfies to be posted online during the ceremony. However, . while Samsung have not responded publicly yet to the mild embarrassment . of DeGeneres' mix-and-matching of smartphones, they still have the huge . publicity that the A-list selfie generated as it was re-tweeted almost 3 . million times and crashed Twitter. 'Samsung's unique product placement, woven into the moment, front and center, without seeming ham-handed, generated the type of positive buzz that is rarely seen and is actually hard to buy,"" said Ammiel Kamon, EVP of products and marketing for Kontera, a prominent social media data tracker. 'Kudos to Ellen for pulling it off,' said Kamon to USA Today. Ellen isn't the first celebrity to have her choice of smartphone questioned. Singer Alicia Keys was called out for tweets sent via iPhone after she had been named Global Creative Director for smartphone maker BlackBerry. But she blamed the incident of hackers. Whoops: While Samsung would have thought their PR victory was complete with the selfie - backstage Ellen was posting pictures to Twitter taken on her iPhone . And . despite their huge presence at the Oscar's during which they launched a . whole new range of products including their new Galaxy S5 smartphone, . Samasung have denied they had paid DeGeneres or ABC any money or . engineered the celebrity-packed selfie. The . South Korean firm did admit to 'an integration with ABC' but the firm . said that it was DeGeneres who chose to 'organically incorporate the . device into the selfie moment that had everyone talking.' In . addition, Samsung said it would be donating $1.5 million each to two of . 'Ellen’s charities of choice,' namely St. Jude’s and the Humane . Society. But in a move . which seemed to confirm at least some kind of publicity tie-in, Samsung . and DeGeneres gifted her audience all a Galaxy smartphone as she . presented her show today. On Sunday night DeGeneres repeatedly brandished her Galaxy during the ceremony she . hosted - taking selfies of stars such as Oscar winner Lizi Minnelli, . which she posted online. The . impromptu and now iconic selfie, which DeGeneres claimed was not . intended, set the record for the most retweeted post ever and even . temporarily disrupted Twitter's service. The . previously most-retweeted Twitter post was by President Obama after . winning his second term in 2012. That tweet got 778,000 retweets. More iPhone uploads: This picture of Oscar winner Jared Leto was taken on an iPhone and uploaded to Ellen's Twitter account as was the picture (right) of her about to walk onstage . On Message: This selfie taken by Ellen featuring Oscar winner Lizi Minnelli was snapped on the comediennes Samsung Galaxy . Promotional gifts: On her show the day after the Oscar's ceremony, Ellen handed out free Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphones to her ecstatic audience . Thanks Ellen: Ellen DeGeneres handed the phones to her audience the day after hosting the Oscar's to rapturous applause from the crowd . DeGeneres’ tweet even knocked Twitter . offline for a bit, racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly . 200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes. 'We crashed and broke Twitter,' DeGeneres said later from the stage. 'We made history.' Twitter declined to comment on the service glitches except for a statement on its status blog according to the LA Times: . 'Between . 19:05 and 19:29 PST today, some users may have experienced issues . viewing and sending tweets on twitter.com and Twitter’s mobile apps. 'Traffic was redirected away from the components that were experiencing problems, and the issue has now been resolved.' However, . Twitter did send a congratulatory tweet to DeGeneres remarking, 'The . envelope  please … to @TheEllenShow -- this is now the most retweeted . tweet with over 1 million RTs. Congrats!' Ellen's Samsung use was designed to highlight its new range of products including the Galaxy Note Pro tablet, the Galaxy S5 phone, the Gear 2 smartwatch and a curved ultra-high-definition TV. As part of a deal with broadcast network, ABC, Samsung also sponsored 10 tweets from Ellen featuring selfies in the backstage green room and posted onto the account of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. However, DeGeneres seems to have posted 4 out of her ten from her iPhone, not her Samsung Galaxy S5 which operates the Android platform. Crash: DeGeneres' tweet even knocked Twitter offline for a bit, racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly 200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes. Let me in: The selfie was not planned by Ellen to unfold this way - it was meant to be a quick joke at the expense of Meryl Streep and quickly became something else entirely . Can we get everyone in? Ellen originally wanted to take a selfie with Meryl Streep and crop her head off in the picture . It seems though, that one thing DeGeneres was sure of crashing Twitter in the wake of her sensational selfie. 'I thought it would crash,' DeGeneres told E!'s Marc Malkin at the Governors Ball. 'But I didn't know everyone would do it.' The comedienne told EOnline.Com. 'What's funny is that Lupita's brother is the most prominent. And then Jared came running over to be in it. And Angie got it in. I didn't expect all that.' Indeed, DeGeneres even revealed that she originally wanted to do a visual joke with the selfie by taking the picture and cropping Meryl Streep's head from it. 'That was going to be the joke,' she revealed. 'But it doesn't matter. It was just great.'","Ellen DeGeneres broke Twitter records and crashed the site after she posted an incredible selfie using her Galaxy smartphone .

"Darron Gibson is hoping for a chance to play himself into contention for a showdown with World champions Germany as he continues his comeback from an injury nightmare. The 26-year-old made his first appearance for club or country in more than 10 months in Ireland's 2-0 friendly victory over Oman last month following a gruelling fightback from a cruciate ligament problem. He played the full 90 minutes of club Everton's 1-1 Europa League draw with Krasnodar in Russia last Thursday and with James McCarthy missing from Martin O'Neill's squad through injury, will hope to get the nod for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar in Dublin and the intensely difficult trip to Germany which follows three days later. Darron Gibson hopes his injury nightmare is behind him as he pushes for a place in the Republic of Ireland team for their Euro 2016 qualifiers with Gibraltar and Germany over the coming days . Gibson suffered a cruciate ligament injury in Ireland's World Cup qualifier with Kazakhstan back in October 2013 and was on the sidelines for 10 months . Gibson said: 'I played in the European game during the week and I felt physically strong, so I think I am ready. Hopefully I do get the chance and I do have an influence so I can play on Tuesday. 'I think any player enjoys playing in games like that. They are some of the best players in the world, so it's good to see how you fare against them. 'Obviously, the first few games I played, it was just about getting minutes under my belt. But I think I am ready to play properly now, I think I am match-fit and ready to go. 'It's been all right. It's been a bit frustrating not playing in the Premier League, but I have got two games in in the last two and a half weeks, so I'm happy enough coming into this week.' Ireland will face Group D minnows Gibraltar - who lost their opening game against Poland 7-0 at home - at the Aviva Stadium knowing goal difference could be important, but taking nothing for granted. Gibson made his return for club Everton in their 1-1 draw with Krasnodar in the Europa League last week . Martin O'Neill will be hoping to gain at least four points from the weekend's double-header . Gibson said: 'No football game is easy. Obviously we will take the game seriously and hope to get the win. 'I don't think we will be going out there thinking, 'Right, we are going to beat them five or six nil'. It's not as easy as that. We will go out and try our best and hopefully, we get the win. 'We are going into both games and treating them exactly the same. We will focus on Saturday's game first, hopefully get the result we need and then we will push on to Germany on Tuesday.' Ireland began their preparations in Malahide on Tuesday morning with much of the focus surrounding the camp on manager Martin O'Neill's assistant Roy Keane and his updated autobiography, The Second Half, although the older man was adamant it would not be allowed to prove a distraction. The build-up to the qualifiers have been dominated by the fall-out from assistant manager Roy Keane's book . O'Neill said: 'The most important issue here is our games, and Saturday [the match against Gibraltar] is really, really important. We have come off the back of a great win against Georgia and it's important to focus on that. 'I genuinely don't know what the headlines are in the book. It obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another - the very fact he put his name to this book would suggest that it's exactly what would happen. 'It's there and it doesn't matter. The games are the most important things for us.'","Darron Gibson hoping to be involved in the Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany over the weekend .

"Lewis Hamilton fastest in Russian Grand Prix practice . Lewis Hamilton quickly found himself at home around Sochi's Olympic Park on a day when Formula One attempted to get back to business in the wake of Jules Bianchi's accident five days ago. The 29-year-old Briton, with the teams switching to the faster soft-compound Pirelli tyres in the afternoon session after running mediums in the morning, posted a lap of one minute 39.630 seconds. Remarkably, it was McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and not Nico Rosberg second on the list, albeit 0.864secs adrift, followed closely by Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Rosberg, quickest in the morning run, had to settle for fourth, just over nine tenths of a second off of Hamilton's pace. Lewis Hamilton set the pace in Friday's second practice session at the inaugural Russian Grand Prix . Latest on Jules Bianchi . Jules Bianchi’s father has revealed there is no change in his son’s condition as he continues to fight for his life in hospital. Bianchi’s brother Tom and his sister Melanie arrived at the Mie University Hospital late on Thursday where the Frenchman is being treated for a severe head trauma sustained in last weekend's rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix. His British-based team confirmed earlier on Friday that they will only enter one car for this weekend’s inaugural race in Russia out of respect to the 25-year-old and his family. Bianchi was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury to the brain – whereby damage is widespread rather than localised in one particular area – after he ploughed into a recovery vehicle sent out to retrieve Adrian Sutil’s Sauber during the latter stages of Sunday's race. Jules Bianchi's Marussia is vacant in Russia after the team opted against naming a replacement driver . Hamilton insists he'll speak to Mercedes over new deal . Lewis Hamilton is adamant he will sit down with Mercedes at the end of the year to discuss a new deal as rumours regarding the prospect of Fernando Alonso taking his seat in 2016 gather pace. In Japan last week the driver merry-go-round began in earnest, with Red Bull confirming four-time champion Sebastian Vettel would be leaving the team. Although his destination has yet to be officially announced, Vettel is replacing Alonso at Ferrari as Red Bull team principal Christian Horner let the cat out of the bag on that score. Hamilton is adamant he will discuss a new deal with Mercedes amid suggestions Fernando Alonso will join the team in 2016 . Lotus agree Mercedes deal . Lotus have confirmed they are to run Mercedes power units from 2015. The long-term supply arrangement comes as no surprise as Lotus have long been linked with a switch to Mercedes. The deal brings to an end a long-standing agreement with Renault, who recently made clear Red Bull were their number one team, effectively pushing Lotus to one side. The agreement means Mercedes will again be supplying three teams in 2015 - Williams, Force India, along with Lotus - as well as running their own works programme. Lotus have announced a deal to use Mercedes engines next season, ending their relationship with Renault .","Hamilton was fastest in second practice session at Sochi's Olympic Park .

"Research undertaken at the University of Oslo  shows that dope cheats such as Justin Gatlin could still be benefiting from taking banned substances years after initial usage. The experiments carried out by by scientists in Norway show for the first time that muscles could retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids for decades after they were first used. The 2004 Olympic 100 metres champion Gatlin was banned for a maximum of eight years by the United States Anti-Doping Agency after testing positive for testosterone at the Kansas Relays in Lawrence in 2006 - his second failed drugs test. Justin Gatlin (left) powers ahead during the IAAF Diamond League Athletics meeting at Lausanne in July . Gatlin (right) attempts to chase down Usain Bolt as the American claimed bronze at London 2012 . Professor of physiology at the University of Oslo Kristen Gunderson and his team studied the effect of steroids on mice and believes that the same mechanism is at work in human muscles and that other performance-enhancing drugs would have similar long-term effects. Gunderson told BBC Sport: 'I would be very surprised if there were any major differences between humans and mice in this context. 'The fundamental biology of muscle growth is similar in humans and in mice, and in principle any drug that builds muscle mass could trigger this mechanism. 'I think it is likely that effects could be lifelong or at least lasting decades in humans. Our data indicates the exclusion time of two years is far too short. Even four years is too short.' Thirty-two-year-old American Gatlin served a four-year ban after appeal to arbitration and - after his return to the sport in 2010 - he ran the fastest 100 metres in the world in this year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the Memorial van Damme in Brussels last month. But British 400 metres hurdles champion Dai Greene said: 'He's over the hill as far as sprinting is concerned - he should never be running these times for the 100m and 200m. Gatlin in 2006, the year he was was banned for a maximum of eight years by the US Anti-Doping Agency . Dai Greene (centre) says Gatlin's phenomenal times this year suggest the steroids he took still have an effect . 'But he's still doing it, and you have to look at his past, and ask how it is still affecting him now, because the average person wouldn't be able to do that. 'Those are incredible performances. Not many people have run that fast separately, ever. To do it on a damp Friday night? I couldn't believe those times. 'It shows one of two things: either he's still taking performance-enhancing drugs to get the best out of him at his advanced age, or the ones he did take are still doing a fantastic job. 'Because there is no way he can still be running that well at this late point in his career. Gatlin  celebrates winning the men's 100m sprint   in Rieti, Italy in September to continue his superb year . 'After having years on the sidelines, being unable to train or compete, it doesn't really add up. 9.77 is an incredibly fast time. You only have to look at his performances. I don't believe in them.' The new data casts a further shadow over formerly-banned athletes such as Gatlin, his compatriot Tyson Gay and Britain's Dwain Chambers. In his defence, Gatlin's agent Renaldo Nehemiah said: 'Justin would have run these times, and faster, had his over-zealous (former) coach Trevor Graham not tried to get him there sooner than he would've naturally gotten there. 'So, what Justin is doing right now, I'm not surprised by that. 'His body is rested for four years, so he wasn't racing. And he was the talent that I always knew he was.'

"Gibraltar boss Allen Bula insists Brazil should also be classed as minnows if his newcomers to the big stage are to carry that tag. UEFA's 54th full member nation will contest its second competitive game against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Saturday evening having been trounced 7-0 by Poland in its first Euro 2016 qualifier last month. However, Bula bristles as the minnow tag despite his country boasting a population of less than 30,000 people and just 600 registered footballers, and used World Cup hosts Brazil's semi-final horror show against Germany to support his case. Gibraltar prepare for Republic of Ireland tie at Aviva Stadium, Dublin on Friday . Asked about the argument that smaller nations should have to pre-qualify, he said: 'It's something that keeps cropping up and I keep on asking the same question to all those people who keep on saying this: how do you judge a minnow? 'Do you judge it by the size of your country or by the results? Because of that was the case, then Brazil would be a minnow because they lost 7-0. That's my argument. 'We all deserve to be here and as long as we can give a good game, then why should we pre-qualify? We are going in there and all of us have got to get ready. Gibraltar boss Allen Bula bristles at his country's minnow tag . 'Every single manager that is with a national team and goes into a tournament should aim to reach what's at the end of the tunnel, and that's France. 'These arguments keep on coming up and to be honest with you, I am getting a bit tired of some of the big managers saying this. 'I think what it is is they are scared of the the so-called minnows because of the results lately by the minnows. Once they get a result against them, then they get stick. 'Like I say, Brazil, they lost 7-0. Should they be classed as a minnow now?' Gibraltar were trounced 7-0 by Poland in their first Euro 2016 qualifier . Despite their heavy defeat by the Poles, it has not been all doom and gloom for Gibraltar, who tasted victory over Malta in just their fifth match, and have also recorded draws against Slovakia and Estonia. But there are only two full-time players among their ranks with the remainder of the squad made up of part-timers including policemen, firefighters and students. Captain Roy Chipolina too insists they deserve their chance to rub shoulders with the big boys and even at the age of 31 is relishing the opportunity to learn. He said: 'We all want to play against the best players in the world. For example, we played Poland where we faced Robert Lewandowski and we realised the gap between he as an individual and ourselves. 'You do learn - I have learnt so much just from that one game. I am 31 now now, but if I had had that opportunity, say, when I was 18, from 18 to what I am, 10 years playing at that level, how much a better player I would have become.' Enfield-born defender Chipolina, a customs officer by trade, admitted the preparations for the clashes with Ireland and Georgia over the next few days are as close as he will get to being a professional, and he is determined to enjoy every second of it. He said: 'It's completely different. Right now for me, this week is as close as I am going to get to being a professional football player. 'Back home in Gibraltar with our full-time jobs and putting training in between as well, it's very hard, so being able to be here and just concentrate on football makes things a lot easier and is what we dream about.'","Gibraltar lost 7-0 against Poland in their first competitive game .

"Alexander Rossi is on the official FIA entry list for this weekend’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix in place of Jules Bianchi. Marussia are  yet to make an official announcement on their plans for the weekend with Bianchi in a critical but stable condition following his horror crash in Japan on Sunday. The British-based team are still weighing up their options and may run only one car  or indeed pull out of the event altogether. An announcement will be made before first practice on Friday. Alexander Rossi (centre) takes part in a track walk at Sochi ahead of this weekend's Russian Grand Prix . Rossi's name appears on the official FIA entry list - but Marussia are yet to reveal their plans for the weekend . Rossi, a reserve driver for Marussia, has a superlicence which would enable him to race, but some within the team are wary of entering both cars given Bianchi's condition. The 25-year-old was diagnosed with diffuse axonal injury after he careered into the back of a tractor during Sunday's rain-lashed Japanese Grand Prix. The sport has united in Sochi with messages of support for Bianchi who remains at Mie University Hospital.

Writing in his MailOnline column, Nico Rosberg said: 'Since the race, I have spent a lot of time thinking about Jules, his family and the people who are close to him. 'He has a lot of friends in the paddock – obviously being a Frenchman many of them are from France – so I have been spending some time with them, particularly Jean-Eric Vergne. I flew from Japan to Russia with the Toro Rosso driver and I am staying in the same hotel with him. We have spent that time exchanging our different stories of Jules. 'I am really hoping that there is some good news on his condition, but tragically it has to be said that it is looking very serious. 'As such, the mood in the paddock ahead of this weekend’s race is very different. Nobody is laughing or having a good time. Everyone is talking and thinking about Jules.'

"Lewis Hamilton quickly found himself at home around Sochi's Olympic Park on a day when Formula One attempted to get back to business in the wake of Jules Bianchi's accident five days ago. With Bianchi fighting for his life in a hospital in Japan, for all connected with F1 the swift return to action with this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix has been tough to endure, and especially for his team Marussia. As a mark of respect, the team confirmed ahead of first practice on Friday they would run only one car, that of Bianchi's team-mate Max Chilton.

Despite placing reserve Alexander Rossi on standby to deputise on Thursday, Marussia said their decision was 'the appropriate course of action under the difficult circumstances of the weekend'. The team, however, have still prepared the second car, which is to sit on Bianchi's side of the garage for the remainder of the weekend, and with his name over the entrance. It is understood to have been a tough decision to make for sporting director Graeme Lowdon and team principal John Booth, who remains at Bianchi's bedside at the Mie General Medical Centre in Yokkaichi. Chilton expressed himself to be 'truly devastated' with regard to Bianchi's situation after the 25-year-old sustained brain injuries from a high-speed collision with a recovery vehicle at Suzuka. With all drivers carrying the slogan 'Tous Avec Jules' - All for Jules - on their helmets, they returned to the cockpits of their cars still feeling the traumatic events that unfolded on Sunday. With three successive wins behind him to open up a 10-point cushion over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg at the top of standings, Hamilton finished the day comfortably ahead of his main title rival. Around F1's newest venue, the Sochi Autodrom that was at the heart of the winter Olympics earlier this year, Hamilton has quickly mastered what appears to be far from a tricky track technically. Nico Rosberg was almost nine tenths down on Mercedes team-mate Hamilton in second practice . The 29-year-old Briton, with the teams switching to the faster soft-compound Pirelli tyres in the afternoon session after running mediums in the morning, posted a lap of one minute 39.630 seconds. Remarkably, it was McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and not Rosberg second on the list, albeit 0.864secs adrift, followed closely by Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Rosberg, quickest in the morning run, had to settle for fourth, just over nine tenths of a second off of Hamilton's pace. Williams duo Valtteri Bottas, whose first set of Pirellis in FP1 were ruined by an overheating tyre blanket so delaying his maiden foray onto the track, and Felipe Massa, were fifth and seventh quickest respectively. Jules Bianchi's Marussia is vacant this weekend after the British-based team did not enter a driver in his place . Jenson Button provided the filling in that particular sandwich, with McLaren showing a return to form as they are pushing both Ferrari and Williams. Home hero Daniil Kvyat was eighth best in his Toro Rosso, with four-times champion Sebastian Vettel and Jean-Eric Vergne in the second Toro Rosso completing the top 10, the latter nearly two seconds down. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen has so far struggled to get to grips with the circuit, with the Finn 11th. The only man who can deny either Hamilton or Rosberg the title, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, was down in 13th place, with his session over seven minutes from the end due to a mechanical issue with his car. As for the sole Marussia of Chilton, the 23-year-old Briton was 20th of the 21 on track, but nearly five seconds adrift, leaving Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi to bring up the rear.","Hamilton finished ahead of Kevin Magnussen and Fernando Alonso .

"There was mounting anger on Tuesday night as the prospect of franchise-based professional rugby union moved a step closer with former London club Wasps completing a multi-million pound purchase of Coventry City’s Ricoh Arena. One Wasps stalwart described the move, which will see the two-time European Cup winners leave their current Adams Park ground in High Wycombe and relocate to the 32,000-seat stadium next season, as ‘crossing a red line’ while posts on social media predicted a ‘toxic’ atmosphere at this Sunday’s Aviva Premiership clash with Bath. Rob Smith, who spent 40 years at the club as a player and then a coach, said: ‘I want the club to be financially secure, but there is a time when you draw the line and say I prefer the club to stay even if that means going down the leagues rather than be transported elsewhere. You get so attached to a club and stay with them. Coventry isn’t a million miles away but it might as well be.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sharks v Wasps highlights . Wasps are set to move into Coventry's Ricoh Arena (above) on a permanent basis from next season . Wasps are planning to move home games from their Wycombe ground Adams Park to Coventry . The move to Coventry, two years after Wasps were saved from bankruptcy by businessmen David Thorne and Derek Richardson, has sparked fury among Wasps fans, who feel betrayed after early promises of a move back to their original north-west London base. Mailsport understands Wasps are also set to announce a new sponsorship deal worth close to £500,000 with Jaguar Land Rover, whose global headquarters are in Whitley on the outskirts of the city, but no amount of financial sugar-coating can appease diehard fans. As the local council was braced to rubber-stamp the move, Wasps fans took to social media websites to discuss possible protests at this Sunday’s Adams Park fixture against Bath with a growing sense they have been let down by the RFU and Premier Rugby. One Wasps fan @thewaspsblog tweeted: ‘Atmosphere on Sunday at Adams Park is going to be toxic’ while another post read ‘what a sad day to be a Wasps fan’. Despite the fans’ anger, the move is a commercial necessity less than two seasons after Wasps’ financial situation became so dire that players sometimes went unpaid as the club was unable to meet the monthly wage bill. With average attendances of only around 6,000 at Adams Park, where Wasps have played their home fixtures for 12 years, the Ricoh move will see the club attempt to build an almost entirely new fan-base in a catchment area historically targeted by the likes of Leicester, Northampton and Worcester. Councillors also confirmed in the meeting that Wasps plan to build a new training base in the city . Sky Bet League One football club Coventry City will continue to host home matches at the Ricoh . ‘It’s an odd one,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. ‘From what I understand, they are staying in Acton and will recruit from that area. ‘They will just travel 100 miles for their home games! ‘I am from Coventry so it’s going home for me. Another game down the M69 instead of going to Wycombe? Perfect.’ Professional Game Board regulations mean Wasps are unable to move their academy to the Coventry area but moves are already afoot to build a new training ground close to the Ricoh with plans to relocate their current Twyford Avenue facility in Acton within three years. On Tuesday night it was unclear how, if at all, Wasps players and backroom staff, who signed contracts to live and work in London, will be compensated for being asked to move 100 miles north. ‘We will be watching the Wasps situation with considerable interest,’ said Rugby Players Association chairman and former Wasps player Damian Hopley. ‘It will be fascinating to see how it pans out. ‘Will Wasps play in Coventry but still train in Acton? That is important because players have families, mortgages and children in local schools. ‘It would be madness not to consider the implications of what is being proposed. Personally, I’m a sentimentalist and find talk of a move quite sad.’ The club is set to hold a press conference on Wednesday. VIDEO Sharks v Wasps .

"The prospect of an NFL franchise to be based at London's Wembley Stadium will be explored in detail, the sport's UK chief has said. England football matches could be taken around the country again from 2018 if the Football Association secures the NFL franchise. Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, said there was ""real momentum"" around American football in Britain with the sport now staging three matches at Wembley this season. VIDEO: Scroll down to see a brilliant timelapse of Wembley Stadium filling up with NFL fans . Wembley Stadium is packed to the rafters before the Miami Dolphins and Oakland Raiders clash . Miami Dolphins' Jarvis Landry (right) makes a strong run against the Raiders at Wembley last September . Cortland Finnegan celebrates a touchdown in front of 83,000 fans in London . He told BBC Radio Five Live: ""Moving from one game to three games in a couple of years is a sign of real momentum and fan growth. ""We are going to have a look at seeing if we can grow from that over the next couple of years and see where we go from there. "" We're very interested in exploring the idea of a British-based franchise and seeing if we can pull it off. That's the way of making our sport much more mainstream. ""Fan growth has grown considerably in recent years. But we've seen in all forms of sport, having something that's considered national transforms your potential popularity."" Kirkwood warned that there was still much work to do before a plan could be put in place. He added: ""It's not just about the logistics of where a team might come from or whether it would be a new team, it's also scheduling, air travel, a tonne of other logistics. ""If we were to finish it off, it would be a big project realised."" The FA has made securing an NFL franchise at Wembley a priority and it is understood that would open the way to holding some England games away from the national stadium. Securing an NFL franchise would be a lucrative earner for the FA, which owns Wembley, and allow the governing body to look at options for England games. During the construction of the new Wembley, England matches were held in packed stadiums in different parts of the country including Old Trafford in Manchester, Sunderland's Stadium of Light, Newcastle's St James' Park, Villa Park, Leicester City's stadium and Southampton's St Mary's ground. The FA agreed a deal to play all England games at Wembley until 2017 but there will be some flexibility when that current deal ends, although the majority of the matches would still be held at the national stadium. Last year, Wembley managing director Roger Maslin said he was confident the stadium could stage a whole season of eight NFL games. He said: ""Football is our priority. But, yes, I'm absolutely confident that if the NFL wanted to have a franchise here then we could absolutely do it.""","Securing NFL franchise at Wembley a priority for FA .

"An emotional Marussia team will decide on Thursday whether to replace the stricken Jules Bianchi for this weekend’s Russian Grand Prix or leave his car empty as a mark of respect. With Bianchi’s condition remaining critical but stable after his horrific crash at last Sunday’s race in Japan, a sense of normality has yet to return to the British-based team.

The 23-year-old, who has driven in practice for Caterham, has a superlicence that would allow him to slot straight in but some within the team would prefer they race only one car, that of Britain’s Max Chilton. Whether the rules allow that is unclear. There is also the question of how their owner, Andrey Cheglakov, views the situation going into the first Formula One race to be staged in Russia. The race is likely to see the grand prix community united in sympathy. Ferrari, who schooled Bianchi - he remains on their young driver programme - will carry the words ‘Forza Jules’ on their car. The FIA embarrassingly included John Booth, the Marussia team principal, on their press conference list even though he is still in Japan at Bianchi’s bedside. Lewis Hamilton, who won in Japan to extend his championship lead over Nico Rosberg to 10 points, said on Wednesday: ‘I was pleased to have finally won at Suzuka, but as soon as we heard what happened to Jules it suddenly didn’t seem relevant anymore.

"Former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans could be set for a shock return to his old club with reports suggesting that he could be allowed to start training in July. Evans, 25, could be allowed to participate in pre-season training on day-release whilst tagged according to the Mirror. The striker was convicted of rape in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The reports suggest that Saudi Arabian Prince Abdullah bin Mossad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is one of the world's richest men and Sheffield United's co-owner, has given his approval for Evans' return. Sentenced: Evans (centre) seen here playing for Sheffield United was convicted in April 2012 . Return: Evans' return to Sheffield United would generally be well received says the Supporters' club chairman . Pete Whitney, who is the Supporters' club chairman, has said 'Ched is coming back. He has his prime years ahead of him. 'I am sure he will get a good reception but of course thee might be a small minority who will object.' Evans has said he plans to appeal against his conviction and his girlfriend Natsaha Massey told the Sunday People that she still supports him and plans to get engaged saying 'Ched loves the club and supporters. He wants his old job back.' The Welsh striker was a promising player when he moved from Manchester CIty in 2009 for £3 million and during the 2011/12 season scored 35 goals for Sheffield United in League One. Defiant: Evans has said that he plans to appeal against the conviction when he is released . International: Evans (left) made 13 appearances for Wales and scored one international goal . Almost 60,000 have signed a petition addressed to Kevin McCabe, the club's chairman, urging him not to resign Evans. An extract reads: 'For the male leaders of the club to endorse him and ""welcome him back"" is an absolute humiliation to all women who expect the men who commit gross acts of violence against women to pay for what they have done and part of that is relinquishing the celebrity they attained, and in this case used as a tool to facilitate the violence. 'The clear message to young boys and men is that you will be forgiven for this crime. Women will not be believed when they accuse you of that crime even if a court believes them. 'The message given is that men who commit such atrocious crimes will suffer only a small penance whilst the women they attack suffer for the rest of their lives.' One supporter wrote: 'I want to feel safe in a city that takes a strong stance against sexual assault, not a city that ignores and rewards it.'

"Dougie Freedman is on the brink of being sacked as manager of Bolton. The Scot is due to have a meeting with Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside on Thursday following the abject 4-0 defeat at Fulham. Gartside has been loyal to Freedman - who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints - and believed there were signs the manager was heading in the right direction. However, results and recent performances have put pressure on to make a change before Bolton get cut adrift by the teams above them. Dougie Freedman (centre) is at a loss as Bolton are hammered 4-0 by Fulham at Craven Cottage . The Championship table . The main issue seems to be whether they can pay Freedman off - and then who would replace him. Academy director Jimmy Phillips, who was briefly joint-caretaker boss with Sammy Lee before Freedman's appointment, is the strong bookies' favourite, with Malky Mackay and Billy Davies also in the mix. Bolton have won just once in the Championship this season and are second from bottom with only Blackpool - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them. The players do not seem to be playing for Freedman and the manager, who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side, chops and changes frequently - there were five against Fulham. This has led to some horrendous performances, home and away. The fans have lost patience with him, too, as the vocal minority have become the majority. There were pitch invasions against Derby on Saturday and chants for the manager to go at Craven Cottage. Freedman and his No 2 Lennie Lawrence leave the pitch after a chastening night for the Bolton manager . Freedman's apparent inability to acknowledge that his actions play a part in the current struggle has infuriated supporters but even after a display as rancid as the one at Fulham, he still insisted he was the right man for the job and that there was a 'good spirit' among the players. He told the Bolton News: 'I’m here to work, I’m here to do my very best and that’s what I’m doing right now. 'I don’t think that way at all (about being sacked). I’m working very hard to turn this round. 'I don’t think the players have chucked the towel in, I think they have shown a very good spirit.

"Embattled manager Jose Riga led Blackpool to their first point in a 0-0 draw with high-flying Wolves, which came at the end of a week of high drama at Bloomfield Road. It seemed improbable that Riga would even be in charge of this contest after the Seasiders spoke to Burton's Gary Rowett about his post earlier this week, while chairman Karl Oyston had also openly called his current manager's professionalism into question. But Riga, who has retained the backing of Blackpool supporters despite six successive losses, was in the dugout to see a spirited performance which suggests this team are not as doomed as their early-season form indicates. Blackpool manager Jose Riga (right) smiles after his side's first point of the season against Wolves . Blackpool forward Nathan Delfouneso (left) is challenged by Wolverhampton Wanderers' Richard Stearman . Whether he is around to preside over that potential turnaround remains to be seen, though, given Oyston is seemingly intent on parting ways with a boss he hired less than 100 days ago. Wolves could have gone top of the Sky Bet Championship with a victory and hit the woodwork through Rajiv van La Parra before half-time, while Seasiders striker Nile Ranger dinked an effort off the crossbar in the second period. While Wolves' run of three straight wins meant the international break probably came at an inconvenient time for them, Blackpool's patched-together squad got some welcome time to familiarise themselves with each other. Riga initiated double sessions this week and the Seasiders looked set to reap the benefits early on, with Andrea Orlandi's cross being scooped over the top by Nathan Delfouneso. The Blackpool forward almost got through again shortly afterwards only to be halted by Danny Batth's fine sliding challenge. Blackpool's Peter Clarke (left) and captain Tony McMahon (right) applaud after picking up their first point . Joe Lewis was the first goalkeeper called into action, though, pushing away a header from Wolves midfielder Michael Jacobs.

However, it was Wolves who ended the half on top as right winger Van La Parra's cross-cum-shot came back off the far post before Batth skewed a drilled effort just wide. Riga's men should have been ahead four minutes into the second period as Orlandi fed the overlapping Tony McMahon, yet the Tangerines skipper fired into the side netting. The hosts would go closer still some 10 minutes later when Ranger waltzed beyond Batth and turned back on to his right foot, which he used to stab an effort against the crossbar.

Kenny Jackett had already turned to Bakary Sako and James Henry off the bench prior to that, the latter's try being diverted over the top by Clarke's block as the game started to open up. The skipper was epitomising the spirit Riga had asked for as he threw himself at a well-struck shot from Sako after Delfouneso's loose pass inside his own area. McMahon then went close again by nodding a header towards goal from a scrappy corner but Ikeme managed to swipe at the ball and touch it over. There was no sign of Blackpool, who have barely had a pre-season programme, fading in the latter stages as they have done so often this season, although Lewis needed to rush out to stop substitute Leon Clarke stealing in. It ended all square and Riga stayed to clap the Blackpool fans that were chanting his name and hoping to see him again in three days time against Watford.

"Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley has criticised Rio Ferdinand for treating the anti-racism organisation as a 'punchbag' and for what they consider damaging inaccuracies in his autobiography. In #2sides, QPR defender Ferdinand labels Kick It Out 'useless', accuses it of 'pure lip service' and of a lack of support during John Terry's trial for racially abusing his young brother Anton in 2012. But Ouseley believes Ferdinand's anger should be directed 'at the real power brokers' and not Kick It Out who, he says, supported the family as much as possible. Lord Ouseley (right) has hit back at Rio Ferdinand following the defender's public criticism of Kick It Out . John Terry was found guilty by the FA of aiming racist abuse towards then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand . He told the Guardian: 'Ferdinand is selling a book of trivia. Meanwhile, the bigger issues remain untouched.' Kick It Out also dispute the former England captain's claims that they refused to attend court with the family – saying a member of the organisation was present each day. Ferdinand also says his mum Janice kicked representatives of the organisation out of the home after they refused to wear T-shirts in court, but Kick It Out deny there was any meeting or outburst. 'Unfortunately we are the punchbag for some people and it's easy to have a punchbag like us. We're a soft target and the easiest target. 'Rio should not be attacking the weakest point – the people who are actually supporting him – but the people who were not supporting him. I would have thought the whole of football should have turned up at that court case wanting justice. Anton's older brother Ferdinand partnered John Terry at the heart of England's defence for several years . Kick It Out's slogan is 'Tackling Racism and Discrimination'. The organisation was launched in 1993 by the Commission for Racial Equality and the PFA. According to its website, it 'is primarily a campaigning organisation which enables, facilitates and works with the football authorities, professional clubs, players, fans and communities to tackle all forms of discrimination.' 'The FA, the Premier League, the clubs, all the people with the real power, not us, and who missed an opportunity and didn't mobilise. 'We are a soft target, but I don't hear criticism of David Bernstein or Richard Scudamore. We did as much as we could but what it shows is a complete lack of understanding about our actual powers. 'Nobody can ever say a player has come to us and we have not supported them. Not one. We have always done what we could whereas there are an awful lot of other people who haven't.' In #2sides, Ferdinand also criticised Kick It Out for not wearing T-shirts in support of the family outside the courtroom. Kick It Out's representative Danny Lynch attended court in a suit and Ouseley says the criticism was 'pathetic'. He said: 'It [the criticism] is absolutely pathetic. He was representing Kick It Out and we expected him to dress in a correct way and respect the court. He was there to observe in a professional capacity.' Ferdinand's camp had no comment when contacted by MailOnline. Ferdinand refused to shake the hand of  Terry during a match between QPR and Chelsea in September 2012 . Herman Ouseley joined the House of Lords in 2001 and is a cross-party peer. As well as being chairman of Kick It Out, the 69-year-old chairs the Football Association Race Equality Advisory Group and is an FA council member. The south Londoner supports his local club Millwall but also reportedly has a soft spot for Manchester United. He added later: 'We don't like being Rio Ferdinand's punchbag. It was very unfair. I have no hang-ups about being criticised but it has to be based on fair and accurate information. 'I just want to put the record straight. We had someone there with the family in court every day - Anton Ferdinand's club [QPR] wasn't there, his union wasn't there every day, but we were. Was Rio himself even there? 'We gave as much support as we could give, we could not do any more, we had no power to do so. We spoke to the club and the police and had meetings. If the clubs had acted properly in the Terry case and the Suarez case we would not have had all this grief.' Kick It Out had had a number of meetings with the Ferdinand family before the trial, but decided it could not agree to their request for their staff to wear campaigning T-shirts in court. Ouseley said he had been happy for Ferdinand and Jason Roberts to later boycott the Kick It Out T-shirts because it was only when people 'put their heads above the parapet' that changes were made. Ferdinand (left) refused to wear a Kick It Out T-shirt before Manchester United's game against Stoke in 2012 . He added: 'I want more to speak out and challenge inequality. You only see action when people speak out - it was only when Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in Italy that FIFA sat up and took notice.' Ouseley also expanded on his reasons for resigning from the FA Council, revealing it came after then FA chairman Bernstein refused to issue an apology on behalf of the governing body for the way it had handled the Terry case. He said: 'I wanted the chairman to issue a full apology. They mishandled those cases and caused so much grief and because he refused to do, I relinquished my place on the FA Council. 'The Ferdinand family were severely abused, I was severely abused - I got hundreds of abusive emails - and they deserved a full apology.' Ouseley was also highly critical of Liverpool and their then manager Kenny Dalglish after Luis Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra. The Kick It Out chairman added: 'Liverpool could have been sanctioned three times over the Suarez incident, Kenny Dalglish's behaviour was appalling. Anton Ferdinand (right) leaves Westminster Magistrates Court after the John Terry racism case in July 2012 . 'Andre Villas-Boas was manager of Chelsea and kept on saying Terry would always be their captain whatever the outcome. 'The FA only did something about him being England captain when they were about to go off to Euro 2012 and the whole thing was incendiary and very toxic. They hid behind the police inquiry but it is the FA that regulates football and the Ferdinand family were given so much grief. 'We have moved on but you have to purge yourself of these errors. 'I think a lot more people have confidence now, at least people know the FA will investigate everything now.'

"Andy Murray fought from a set down to defeat Jerzy Janowicz 6-7 (11/9) 6-4 6-2 and book his place in the second round of the China Open. Murray, who defeated Spain's Tommy Robredo on Sunday to win the Shenzhen Open - his first tournament victory since winning Wimbledon last year, looked out of sorts in the opening set before firing back to give Janowicz a real contest. After going 5-1 up only for Murray to hit back, the Pole went on to claim the first set on a tie-break. Andy Murray followed up his recent triumph in the Shenzhen Open by defeating Jerzy Janowicz . The 27-year-old Scotsman looked in a relaxed mood during his clash against the Pole . Qualified . 1. Novak Djokovic - 8,150 points . 2. Roger Federer - 7,020 . 3. Rafael Nadal (6,645) Still to qualify . 4. Stan Wawrinka (4,795) 5. Marin Cilic (3,935) 6. Kei Nishikori (3,845) 7. David Ferrer (3,535) 8. Tomas Berdych (3,510) 9. Milos Raonic (3,440) 10. Andy Murray (3,405) Points he will be awarded if he wins the following: . Beijing - 500 . Shanghai - 1,000 . Paris - 1,000 . The second set went Murray's way thanks to a single break of Janowicz in the ninth game before he dominated the third to claim victory. Murray started off in the worst possible fashion as he was broken by Janowicz in the first game of the match before the Pole claimed a 2-0 lead. Janowicz raced to a 3-0 advantage after he took the first of two break points on the Murray serve. However, while the Scot broke back immediately he was not able to hold his serve for the third consecutive game and slump to a 4-1 deficit. Janowicz then moved 5-1 ahead but Murray hit back, claiming four games in a row to draw level at 5-5. The Scot won his first service game of the match to stay in the first set before a break of serve saw him claim back-to-back games. Murray served out the next before breaking Janowicz, although his momentum stuttered in the next, as he trailed 30-0 on serve before firing back to claim a 6-5 lead - the first time he was ahead in the match. Janowicz then served to love to take the first set to a tie-break, which was hotly contested with the duo matching each other all the way until the Pole found a way through to win 11-9. Murray, pictured after winning the Shenzhen Open,  will be hoping to progress to the later rounds of Beijing, Shanghai and Paris to book a place in the ATP Finals . It meant that if he were to win, Murray would need to battle back from a set down for his third match in a row. The second set went on serve until the ninth game, where the number six seed broke Janowicz to take a 5-4 lead before taking the set 6-4. It meant the game went into a decider and an early break for Murray saw him go 3-1 up, before another saw him move 5-2 ahead and just one game away from a place in the second round. Murray then served for the match and claimed a battling victory in a match time of two hours and 28 minutes to line up a second-round meeting with American John Isner.","British tennis star Andy Murray lost the opening set against Poland's Jerzy Janowicz .

"Harry Redknapp has called on the Premier League to consider temporary substitutions in a bid to improve concussion treatment. The QPR boss was left frustrated after medics withdrew Sandro just 11 minutes into Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Southampton, only for the Brazil midfielder to be deemed 'fine' at half-time. Sandro suffered a heavy blow to the head and manager Redknapp admitted doctors must take no chances with such complex injuries. Brazilian midfielder Sandro is forced off with a head  injury during the first half of QPR's game at Southampton . Club doctors now have the final say over whether players who suffer head injuries are withdrawn, after widespread criticism last season when Spurs' Hugo Lloris returned to action despite being knocked unconscious. The ex-Tottenham boss suggested football take a leaf out of rugby's book and implement short-term replacements, to allow extended assessment of head injuries. 'You couldn't wait 10 or 15 minutes with 10 men, you just couldn't do it,' said Redknapp. 'So you couldn't give medics that amount of time to look at a player. 'But it doesn't sound the worst idea for a temporary replacement, so that the doctors could have a longer look at the player with the potential head injury. Redknapp talks to his summer signing as the midfielder was withdrawn after only 11 minutes at St Mary's . 'That is something worth looking at. Medical people have got to be so careful, they can't take a chance because if anything went wrong there would be massive trouble. 'If someone is very bad you cannot expect them to carry on because if something went wrong we would all be very sorry. 'At half-time there didn't seem to be a lot wrong with Sandro to me though. 'He was fine in the changing rooms, he didn't look too bad at all but obviously the doctors have got to err on the side of caution.' Charlie Austin expresses his delight towards the travelling Rangers supporters after scoring on Saturday . Graziano Pelle's scissor-kick volley trumped a fine blast on the spin from Charlie Austin to deny QPR any points on the south coast. Former Saints boss Redknapp admitted Rangers are continuing to count the cost of losing Loic Remy to Chelsea in the final stages of the transfer window. Redknapp believes QPR are missing '16 goals' after being unable to secure a replacement for France striker Remy, with a deal for Jermain Defoe falling through. 'I thought Bobby (Zamora) was excellent when he came on, held up the ball well, but we are short and we don't have an awful lot of striking options,' said Redknapp. Graziano Pelle makes the perfect connection from a cross to score in spectacular fashion as Saints won 2-1 . 'We have lost 16 goals when Remy went. It is a problem: you look at last year and Charlie (Austin) got 17 goals and no one else got anywhere near.' Redknapp admitted he was disappointed Steven Caulker's case of mistaken identity with the police ended up making headlines. Rangers defender Caulker was wrongly detained by police in Surrey after being falsely accused of stealing soft cheese from a Tesco store. Redknapp said the incident has had no effect on club or player. 'It is not fair to get accused of that. I honestly don't know the story of it all, but surely he doesn't need to nick a piece of cheese. 'If he had stolen it then he would deserve to be in trouble for being such an idiot but obviously he hasn't. 'How does it get in the papers; how does it get in? We have all been there haven't we, someone tells them.' Redknapp is concerned by the lack of striking options at his disposal at QPR this season after losing Loic Remy .","Harry Redknapp frustrated after Sandro withdrawn after just 11 minutes during Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Southampton, but deemed 'fine' at half-time .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admits he has been surprised how quickly striker Diafra Sakho has found his feet in England. Sakho, a summer signing from French side Metz, now has five goals in as many games after finding the target in the 2-0 defeat of QPR. Nedum Onuoha's own goal had given West Ham the lead at Upton Park, setting them on the way to a win which means they head into the international break in good shape. Diafra Sakho takes the plaudits after scoring West Ham's second goal in their 2-0 win over QPR . The Senegal international striker leaps to head home with QPR goalkeeper Rob Green stranded . Allardyce said: 'I would have seen Sakho as being a player, coming from the French second division, playing maybe 10 to 15 games for us and finding out about the Premier League. 'But he is so desperate to do well and his runs are so good at the opposition's defences and he seems to have the knack - and that's the hardest knack of all - of turning up in the right place at the right time. 'So that's fantastic for him and absolutely outstanding business for us at West Ham.' In contrast, Harry Redknapp has little to smile about with his QPR team bottom of the Barclays Premier League. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is delighted with Sakho's contribution so far this season . The west London side made a number of high-profile signings in the summer but the team's big names have failed to deliver results so far this season. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville described the visitors' attitude as 'diabolical' after the game but Redknapp refused to criticise his players' commitment. The 67-year-old said: 'We need to get them fitter. I've put a lot of faith into Sandro. Unfortunately he's had an injury and we need to get him fit. 'When he's fit he's a fantastic player - I had him at Tottenham, he's an excellent player - but at the moment he's short of fitness. 'The doctor came to me at half-time and told me he can only play another 15 minutes - I need players who can play 90 minutes. Harry Redknapp admitted that Sandro (right) is lacking fitness after substituting the midfielder . 'They've had injuries and missed training - we need to get everyone fit and ready to go.' Redknapp's side face a tough run of fixtures after the international break with Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City to come in the next four games. When asked if the players were letting him down with their disappointing displays, Redknapp said: 'I don't think so. We're short - we're short of goals, we're short up front. 'It's been difficult, we lost Loic Remy on the deadline and couldn't get a replacement. We've had a tough start but there's an awful long way to go. 'We're not going to give up are we? It's early days. We have to find a way of playing that suits everybody and get the best out of what we've got.'","Diafra Sakho scored his fifth goal for West Ham as they beat QPR 2-0 .

"Manchester United are looking at playing lucrative friendlies overseas to fill the midweek void left by the absence of European football this season and their early Capital One Cup exit. The record 20-time English title winners have forecast a 10 per cent drop in revenue in 2014-15 after they failed to qualify for the Champions League under David Moyes. The struggles have left United with just one midweek Premier League match before the end of 2014, and just three in the first three months of 2015. Angel di Maria and Falcao signings mean Manchester United could attract lucrative contracts for friendlies . Manchester United don't have a midweek match until the start of December . Everton (h) Sun 5 Oct . West Brom (a) Mon 20 Oct . Chelsea (h) Sun 26 Oct . Man City (a) Sun 2 Nov . C Palace (h) Sat 8 Nov . Arsenal (a) Sat 22 Nov . Hull (h) Sat 29 Nov . Stoke (h) Tue 2 Dec . Going overseas - the Middle East would be the most likely destination - would allow United to escape the English winter for a few days, and the addition of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria have made the club even more likely to attract lucrative contracts for friendlies. 'That's something we continue to look at, as always making sure that the preparations we do on the pitch come first,' said United managing director Richard Arnold. 'For many years of our (pre-season) international tours, there is a plan to ensure we get that team building that goes together with getting the team all together in one place. That's something that's being looked at with regards to the future (friendlies) with Louis (Van Gaal).' Van Gaal said during United's preseason tour of the United States, shortly after taking over as manager, that the obligations to sponsors and distances the team has to travel was 'not very positive for a good preparation' for the Premier League campaign. But Arnold said there's no disagreement with Van Gaal over the possibility of taking on more commercial ventures. Man United have had a difficult start to the season losing to Leicester and going out of the Capital One Cup . 'I can only speak positively of my experience with the manager in terms of his understanding of what's required to get a first-class team onto the pitch and also what's required for running a club of our magnitude,' Arnold said. 'We have a fantastic partnership in terms of our work off the pitch and I'm very appreciative of the support we have had from him.' Picking up the pieces after Moyes' disappointing 10 months in charge, Van Gaal has managed just two wins from seven matches in charge but the new-look squad is still a work in progress. 'There has been continued excitement that stems from the day that Louis was appointed and it's just been a progressive build from that,' Arnold said in a telephone interview from Old Trafford. 'Outside of that obviously there will still be areas we still need to build on.' Wayne Rooney saw red against West Ham and Manchester United's stars are under pressure to perform . Robin van Persie and Luke Shaw could get opportunities to find their form in midweek friendlies abroad . United, which is owned by the Florida-based Glazer family and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, remains English football's biggest moneymaker, with revenue up 19 percent to a club record 433 million pounds (around $700 million) in 2013-14. The latest commercial deal was announced on Monday, with Abengoa announced as the club's first 'sustainable technology partner,' working with United to make the company more environmentally friendly. Abengoa chief executive Manuel Sanchez Ortega said United was chosen because it is the 'most global football team.' Arnold maintained that its sponsorship operation has not been affected by the team's slump since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after more than 26 trophy-filled years in charge. 'We find current form does not figure highly in the reasons to partner or not partner,' Arnold said, pointing to club research that shows they have 659 million global followers.

'A young guy who’s willing to do that and has already shown he’s very capable of doing it is a bit of Godsend — you don’t want to throw that away, believe me.’ Cipriani, who faces former club Wasps in the Aviva Premiership on Sunday, has been in outstanding form this season after forcing his way back into the England reckoning on their summer tour to New Zealand. ‘Danny Cipriani is a great talent,’ said Wilkinson. ‘Everybody knows he’s got the ability and mentally he’s probably as strong as he’s ever been.’ Wilkinson was speaking at a World Cup event at his former club Newcastle, who host Exeter in the Aviva Premiership on Sunday. Danny Cipriani has been in terrific form for Sale, but Wilkinson still thinks Farrell has proven himself .

"Gareth Bale admits he does not want to see Cristiano Ronaldo leave Real Madrid for a second spell in English football. Portuguese star Ronaldo maintained his incredible scoring burst on Sunday night with his 22nd La Liga hat-trick - equalling the record of Real icon Alfredo Di Stefano and former Athletic Bilbao striker Telmo Zarra - in Madrid's 5-0 rout of Athletic at the Bernabeu. But stories of a summer return to Manchester United refuse to go away and Ronaldo has even been linked with a sensational move across town to English champions Manchester City. Cristiano Ronaldo is world class and should remain at Real Madrid, according to team-mate Gareth Bale . Wales star Bale is preparing for Euro 2016 qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus . The duo have been on fire in La Liga in recent weeks, with Ronaldo netting three hat-tricks in four games . Yet Real team-mate Bale is in no doubt as to what he wants to see happen regarding Ronaldo's future and it does not involve him returning to England next season. 'Definitely not,' Bale said while on international duty ahead of Wales' Euro 2016 home qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. 'He's shown what a world-class player he is year after year scoring the goals. 'Obviously he's a player we wouldn't want to see leave. 'Of course, (I) want to see him stay at Real Madrid.' Bale chats with Welsh team-mate James Collins during a training session at Dragon Park . The winger looked relaxed in training, but the pressure will be on over the next week . Ronaldo takes part on a sprinting drill in Portugal training as Adrien Silva watches on in Obidos . Bale was also linked with free-spending United last week after Real Madrid fans made it clear they were unhappy with his performances this season. The Welshman enjoyed a stunning debut season in Spanish football following his world-record £85.3million move from Tottenham, scoring in both the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals. But his displays have come under scrutiny in the Spanish capital this term and, ahead of Sunday's game, the influential Madrid newspaper Marca ran a poll asking whether Bale should be relegated to the bench. Around 60 per cent voted in favour of Bale being dropped but the 25-year-old quashed talk of him leaving Madrid next summer. Bale and Jonathan Williams find the funny side as they warm up in Newport . Portugal play France in a friendly before taking on Denmark in their Euro 2016 qualifier . Ronaldo takes part in training with fellow stars Nani and William Carvalho . 'I signed a six-year deal last year so I don't really think so,' Bale said. Bale's focus for the next week is on Wales and their quest to qualify for a first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Wales won their opening game in Andorra last month and could take a big step towards the expanded Euro 2016 finals in France by beating Bosnia and Cyprus at the Cardiff City Stadium. 'We have massive potential and I want to make history with Wales and qualify for a major tournament,' Bale said after being crowned Welsh footballer of the year on Monday night for a record fourth time. 'We've got off to a positive start in the group with three points and we feel we've got the momentum behind us. 'We want to carry that into the next game and get a positive result.'

"Australian properties are rising higher in the housing market but a rise in interest rates could cause a downturn, according to new data. The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index found capital cities dwelling values rised 4.2 per cent higher in June, July and August, recording Australia's strongest house price growth in winter since 2007. Sydney and Melbourne were recorded as the strongest performing cities in all capital, where market values recorded a 5.0 per cent and 6.4 per cent lift. The next best performing city was Canberra where values gain 2.5 per cent higher over the three months, according to data. Australian properties are booming in the housing market but interest rates could cause a slow down . Adelaide home values rose 1.5 per cent and Brisbane recording a 1.3 per cent gain while Perth values up 1.0 per cent. A modest drop in values over the winter months was seen across Darwin at -0.6 per cent and Hobart -0.8 per cent. Market values are now 10.9 per cent higher over the past 12 months but Sydney and Melbourne were the only cities to double its growth over the past year. RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were the strongest performing cities during the 2009/2010 growth cycle. 'Over the latest growth cycle we have seen Sydney dwelling values increase by 27.2 per cent and Melbourne values up by 19.5 per cent,' he said. One of NSW's homes, based in Carlingford in Sydney is seeking offers over $1,050,000 . The Templestowe home in Melbourne, Victoria is on the market from $950,000 - $1,050,000 . 'Since the beginning of 2009, we have seen values rise by a cumulative 50.1 per cent and 46.1 per cent respectively in Sydney and Melbourne.' Darwin and Canberra recorded fairly strong growth at 29 per cent and 21.5 per cent. The next best performer was Perth where values are 15 per cent higher, followed by Adelaide at 9.9 per cent, Brisbane with 5.3 per cent but Hobart values dropped 1.5 per cent lower. 'With September marking the start of Spring, we are expecting listings numbers to rise over the coming month which will provide a real test for the housing market,' Mr Lawless said. 'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months. 'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.' The Gunn home in Darwin, Northern Territory is seeking offers over $995,000 . The Wright two-storey home in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory is priced at $1,050,000 . Despite the population increase of all capital cities, Senior research analyst Cameron Kusher told Property Observer that: 'we may see a slowdown in value growth across these cities.' Mr Kusher said that a rise in interest rates could slow down the housing market in Sydney and Melbourne. 'With interest rates already at historic low levels and returns on safe investment classes so low, the maintenance of current interest rate settings is likely to continue to encourage investment in housing,' he said. The Brentwood home in Perth, Western Australia is on the market from $1,675,000 . Property Observer reports the other option to decrease the house price growth would be macro prudential control, alike to that seen in the UK and New Zealand. New Zealand have been introduced to limitations allowing just 10 per cent of lending to mortgages of loan to value ratio (LVR) above 80%. The UK also brings in limitations to just 15 per cent of new mortgage lending going to mortgages 4.5 times the annual income of the lender in a mortgage, according to the Property Observer. Mr Kusher said that given current median prices in Sydney and Melbourne, it’s fair to say that 15 per cent of the mortgagee are borrowing above 4.5 times their annual income. 'With home values in Sydney and Melbourne continuing to march higher it seems as if only higher interest rates or the introduction of macro prudential tools can realistically stop the growth in home value,' he said.","Australian properties are booming in the housing market but interest rates could cause a slow down .

"Alan Pardew fully expects to be in charge of Newcastle when they face Leicester City a week on Saturday. The United boss has no intention of quitting his position and Sportsmail understands owner Mike Ashley remains fully supportive of his manager. The Magpies still reside in the bottom three despite twice coming from behind to claim a 2-2 draw at Swansea on Saturday – Papiss Cisse with both goals – and Pardew believes his players showed their commitment to the cause. Newcastle manager Pardew shows what it means as his team picks up a huge away point . A banner shown off by the Newcastle fans during their draw at the Liberty Stadium . Cisse gets an enthusiastic high 10 from his boss Pardew after his two goals secured the draw . ‘We showed so much character and were determined to try to win,’ he said. ‘One thing you have to analyse as a football manager is – is the team giving you everything? ‘I don’t think our worst critic could argue they didn’t give me everything. We wanted to push for the win and had the chance to do that at 2-2. ‘It’s obvious we’re not playing the way that I would like. We’re a little bit tight in the way we’re playing.

"Australia has emerged as the top country with the most overpriced housing market in the world, with properties overvalued by 33 per cent. In the latest issue of The Economist, the nation's property prices are measured against average incomes and topples Canada, New Zealand and France for the number spot. The country's position as one of the most expensive housing markets is further solidified when comparing prices and rents. Scroll down for video . Under this comparison, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Canada and Belgium are the only four countries which have higher overvaluation than Australia, sitting on 55 per cent. According to the same data, China is undervalued on 38 per cent. This is accounted for by the Chinese market being flooded with properties as newly constructed apartment buildings sit empty around built-up areas, according to Property Observer. But it is a different story at home where demand for Australian properties has exceeded supply, which accounts for the increase in prices. Australia has come out on top as the nation that has the most overvalued real estate in the world after a record growth of 4.2 per cent in housing prices . This comes as new figures show house prices in Australian capital cities have recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007, increasing by 4.2 per cent in the three months to the end of August. RP Data figures showed Melbourne and Sydney were the only capital cities to record double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year. Melbourne outperformed Sydney over winter but Sydney was the leader year-on-year, with house prices increasing 16.2 per cent in Sydney compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne. Melbourne (pictured) and Sydney led the growth figures, recording double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year . All other capital cities trailed behind with Adelaide recording a 5.9 percent rise year-on-year, followed by Brisbane with 5.4 percent, Darwin with 5.4 per cent, Perth with 3.5 per cent, Hobart 2.8 per cent and Canberra with 1.4 perc ent. RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were driving these two tier conditions. He added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this Spring. 'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months,' Mr Lawless said. 'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.'","Australia's real estate market was compared to a number of other countries .

"In the end, City remembered their duty to play like champions. Two goals conjured from the dying embers of a testing match restored their confidence and increased their optimism that their title can be retained. The Premier League may not be won at this autumnal stage of the season, but a defeat would have proved crushingly expensive. As it turned out, the fans were singing, blue flags were waving and the table was looking a happier place. The goals came from the kind of players who were acquired — at enormous expense — with precisely these occasions in mind. Yaya Toure, after emerging slowly into the match, remained icily cool amid the uproar as he simply passed his chance into the net. And Sergio Aguero, totally unruffled by his earlier misses, did what he does supremely well — surging on to the chance, controlling the ball at pace and tearing off a scoring drive. At such moments, their talents seem to have been purchased all too cheaply. In truth, City were not entirely convincing. There was an incoherence about their approach play, their finishing lacked its usual authority and while they were rarely put under genuinely testing pressure, their defence allowed the kind of space which better teams than Villa might have exploited. But they retained a conviction that everything would work out, that this story would have a happy ending. And so it proved. Sergio Aguero celebrates finally finding a way beyond Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (left) walks back to his post after celebrating Toure's opening goal . Manchester City manager Pellegrini and assistant Ruben Cousillas look on during their match at Villa Park . Villa Park is the kind of place where prospective champions must come to state their case. They have to look impressive, at ease with their talents, perhaps the touch of an intimidating swagger. City understood the demands; meeting them was proving a problem. They offered energy to spare, commitment to burn, but little of that crisp, incisive passing which distinguishes their better days. As ever, the major players were as good as their reputations. Vincent Kompany was massively influential in central defence, perceiving problems seconds before anybody had even suspected them and dealing with them with his customary authority. David Silva ghosted through the game with intelligent awareness; controlling the tempo of the effort, subtly investigating defensive lapses. And at the point of the attack, Aguero simply oozed menace and intent, reminding us why he is possibly the finest striker in all England. But given such resources, City were making hard work of their task. At times in the first half, they looked not so much a good team as an extremely expensive one. Manchester City's Toure is tackled by Aston Villa's Tom Cleverley on Saturday evening . Manchester City defender Aleksandar Kolarov struck the post with an early shot at Villa Park . Despite early frustration, Manchester City proved their title credentials with a win at Villa Park . And the home side, in truth, had been no more than awkward. A combination of finance and circumstance has made Villa one of those clubs who seem to know their place. And that place is not to be found alongside the likes of Manchester City. They work with energy, they toil unsparingly to put their plans into action, yet they remain a team who seem grateful for small mercies. And yet, there is a genuine spirit about their game, and they revealed it within moments of the second half. First, they allowed Aguero the kind of chance which the finest striker in all England usually buries. This time, Aguero thumped it wastefully against a post. At which relief, Villa scampered purposefully into City’s defensive quarters and Kieran Richardson was frustrated only in the final step of an enterprising attack. A Villa goal at that stage would have provoked a real examination of City’s credentials. As the match entered its final third, as the game became stretched and as Villa legs began to betray the strain of endless chasing, we waited for the major players to strike the telling blows. But as minutes ticked past, so the nerves grew taut. Aguero struck a fine blow, well parried By Brad Guzan. Silva’s finish met a similar fate, while the sweeper Eliaquim Mangala was allowed the finest chance of all, but fluffed his header. Suddenly emboldened, the Villa fans started to mock their aristocratic visitors. They even began to believe that their own folk hero, the substitute Christian Benteke, might upset form and overwhelming fancy. And then, with eight minutes remaining, Yaya Toure scored the goal which shattered their illusions. It was a touch of glittering class. When Aguero made his contribution, the argument was over. They may have cause to remember those moments when the points are counted in May. Pellegrini brought Frank Lampard on with the scores at 0-0 as City attempted to go ahead . Toure's teammates joins him in celebrating the opening goal against a resilient Aston Villa side . Aguero strokes the ball beyond Aston Villa goalkeeper Guzan early in the second half, but it hits the post .","Reigning Premier League champions Manchester City beat Aston Villa 0-2 at Villa Park on Saturday evening .

"It's a mystery worthy of James Bond. A tiny island in the Pacific which appears on a range of maps seems to have disappeared without a trace. Australian scientists who went in search of Sandy Island - which appears midway between Australia and the French-governed New Caledonia on Google Earth among other world maps - found nothing but sea when they arrived. The Times Atlas of the World appears to identify the sizeable phantom island in the Coral Sea as Sable Island, and weather maps used by the Southern Surveyor, an Australian maritime research vessel also say it exists. Scroll down for video . Phantom island: Sandy Island as it appears on Google's satellite maps service. A team of Australian geologists went in search of the island, and discovered it wasn't there . The first recorded instance of the phantom island was believed to be on a map in 2000, when it was claimed to have been seen on National Geographic maps based on data from U.S. satellite images. The N4GN group of amateur radio enthusiasts, run by Tim Totten, from Louisville, Kentucky, claimed in April 2000 that they had seen the images on the National Geographic website - but there was open water in other sources, such as the 1999 edition of the Times Atlas. A National Geographic expert reportedly told the group that the maps in that area were by WorldSat International and known to contain problems. The British Society of Cartographers said today that human error was most likely to have caused the mistake. The society’s president Danny Dorling told the Guardian that it is still possible the island does exist nearby - and that someone may have found an island but ‘put it in the wrong location’. But when the ship, which was tasked with identifying fragments of the Australian continental crust submerged in the Coral Sea, steamed to where it was supposed to be there was nothing there. The island supposedly sits in an area of very deep sea, making its existence something of a geological oddity that researchers wanted to investigate. However, when they got there, it was nowhere to be found. 'We wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 metres (4,620 feet) in that area - very deep,' said Dr Maria Seton, of the University of Sydney, after the 25-day voyage. 'It's on Google Earth and other maps so we went to check and there was no island. We're really puzzled. It's quite bizarre. 'How did it find its way onto the maps? We just don't know, but we plan to follow up and find out.' The island's appearance on Google perhaps should have sparked suspicions. Compared with nearby islands on which the undulations of ground are visible, Sandy Island appears merely as a dark blob. Look for yourself: This map embedded from Google maps shows the location of the phantom island . Google Maps satellite images are not updated in real time and in most cases they are several months or years old . Although the service provides high-resolution aerial or satellite images for most urban areas all over the world, most of the world's publicly current satellite imagery is over 5 years old. Because of this, many areas where there have been recent changes are not accurately covered. And not all areas on the satellite images are covered in the same resolution - less populated areas usually get less detail. With the introduction of an easily pannable and searchable mapping and satellite imagery tool, Google's mapping engine prompted a surge of interest in satellite imagery. Although Google uses the word satellite, most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800–1500 feet rather than from satellites; most of the rest of the imagery is in fact from satellites . News of the invisible island sparked debate on social media, with tweeter Charlie Loyd outpointing that Sandy Island is also on Yahoo Maps as well as Bing Maps 'but it disappears up close'. On www.abovetopsecret.com, discussions were robust with one poster claiming he had confirmed with the French hydrographic office that it was indeed a phantom island and was supposed to have been removed from charts in 1979. Another claimed: 'Many mapmakers put in deliberate but unobtrusive and non-obvious ""mistakes"" into their maps so that they can know when somebody steals the map data.' Google was not immediately available for comment. But the Google Maps product manager for Australia and New Zealand told the Sydney Morning Herald a variety of authoritative public and commercial sources were used in building maps. 'The world is a constantly changing place, and keeping on top of these changes is a never-ending endeavour,' Nabil Naghdy told the newspaper. The closest landmass to the invisible island is the Chesterfields, a French archipelago of uninhabited coral sand cays.

Josey II, 40, following Sunday's events during a festival associated with the city's Puerto Rican Day parade. Ramsey described the incident, captured in the YouTube video, as very troubling and he thought the use of force applied was in excess of what was needed. Scroll Down for Video . Caught on camera: Lt Jonathan Josey circled on the left, appears to deliver a blow to Aida Guzman during the Puerto Rican day parade . Floored: Ms Guzman falls to the ground as Lt Josey stands over her, and is handcuffed by the police . Fired? Highway Patrol Lt Jonathan D. Josey II was suspended following the incident last year . He said that while he knows and respects Josey for his accomplishments in the department, and he personally likes him, that would not impact his decision. The president of the Philadelphia . Fraternal Order of Police said Josey is eager to tell his side of the . story to internal investigators. The District Attorney's Office has . also announced that charges against the victim of the incident, . 39-year-old Aida Guzman, have been dropped. 'We are happy that the charges are . dropped and we support the decision if they are going to fire him or . have fired him, we support that decision,' said her attorney Enrique . Latoison. 'I feel so happy. I have a lot of . pain in my body, but I feel so happy. I want to say thank you everybody for the support,' said Guzam. She has suffered a swollen and cut lip as well s injuries to her hands and arm after the violent assault. Speaking . at her Chester home on Monday, she said she was angry at the officer's . actions and insists she had done nothing wrong and that she was merely a . participant in the parade. Translating for her mother, her . daughter Keysha, 19, said her mom was hit from behind and while she was . on the ground the officer said: 'That's what you get'. She then told . him,'It wasn't me.' She said: 'That's what happened. I didn't do it. He has no right to put his hands on me. I'm 39, I don't play games like that. 'I feel angry, very angry. I go to someplace, got a good time and look this happen, for no reason.' Lt Josey - is seen in the video punching Ms Guzman violently in the back of the head after someone else in the crowd throws silly string or water at the officers. In March 2010, Josey was cleared in the fatal shooting of an armed robber at a 7-Eleven and was later cited for bravery. He was stabbed in June 2010 when he was trying to break up a fight at a bar when he was off duty. An internal affairs investigation was . launched on Monday and Josey was placed on desk duty pending the outcome . of the investigation. Victim: Aida Guzman said she did nothing to provoke the incident. She is reported to be considering filing a civil lawsuit against Lt Josey . Aftermath: she points to the cuts and bruises on her arms and elbow following the attack . Injuries: Ms Guzman showed off her cut and swollen lip as well as grazes to her hands and arm . Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross said of the incident: 'We'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge that the video is disturbing. 'Clearly, the one issue at hand is she does appear to be walking away. She does not appear to be facing Lt Josey at that time.' The 36-second video, which was first . posted on YouTube on Sunday - the same day as the parade - has been . watched by hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have voiced outrage at . what is largely deemed unnecessary violence and brutality. The . video shows a number of people milling around during a street party that followed the parade. A number of officers appear to be surrounding a . car and as their backs are turned, someone throws an unidentified . substance at them which some viewers speculated was either water or . silly string. When Lt . Josey turns around, he zeroes in on Ms Guzman and as she nonchalantly . walks away from the impending danger, he punches her from behind and . knocks her to the floor. The . 39-year-old was then arrested and was issued a summary citation for . disorderly conduct, on which police reported she had thrown beer at . them. Violence: Ms Guzman was floored during the incident and can be seen being cuffed as she looks up bewildered . Injuries: Ms Guzman is led away from the scene, bloodied, by a policeman. The footage caused outrage when it was posted online . Friends . told the Daily News that these were not actions typical of Josey, calling him a stand-up citizen, loving father and caring member of . the community. They also revealed that bout three years ago, he and Crime Scene Unit . Officer Terry Lewis started the Life or Death Initiative, a nonprofit . organization that teaches violence prevention to teens and ex-offenders. The . Fraternal Order of Police said it will 'defend Josey to the end', with . President John McNesby saying the officers did not know what was being . thrown at them as they have been attacked by urine and bleach in the . past. The executive . director of Concilio, the organization responsible for putting on the . parade every year, called on police to fully investigate: 'While we have . no knowledge of what led to the incident, it is clear from the video . that a police officer unnecessarily and brutally struck a woman in the . face. 'One of the . reasons for Concilio’s founding 50 years ago was to combat police . brutality such as the assault shown in this video.

"When James Howells spilt lemonade on his laptop, he decided it was not worth keeping. But he is now ruing his decision – after he realised it had £5million worth of virtual currency stored on  the hard drive. The stash that could make him a millionaire is now buried under four feet of rubbish and mud in a landfill site. James Howells, an IT worker from South Wales, pictured, had used his laptop to 'mine' 7,500 units of digital Bitcoin currency in 2009. At the time the coins - which are units of data stored in 'wallets' on a computer - were practically worthless. But as more and more people heard about the new currency, its value has soared . The 28-year-old IT worker had accumulated 7,500 units of  ‘bitcoin’ soon after it was launched in 2009. Back then his stash of ‘coins’ – which . are units of data stored on his computer – was worth around £20 but . their value has soared after the currency took off among online traders. The price of a single bitcoin reached . £664 yesterday, meaning Mr Howells’ haul is worth an incredible . £5million. Windfall: Bitcoins could be generated for next to nothing when they were first introduced in 2009, but are now worth more than £600 each . Buried treasure: Mr Howells' valuable hard drive is estimated to be under four feet of rubbish kept on a landfill site (file picture) Last week, it dawned on  him how valuable his collection had . become and he went looking for the hard drive. But when he got to the landfill site . in Newport, South Wales, workers broke the bad news that it could be . anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch. Launched in 2009, Bitcoins can be exchanged for goods online and used as virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes. As with any currency, their value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange them for. In 2011, one bitcoin was worth £1.50 while today it is worth £664. Customers can buy bitcoins  from online exchanges. They are growing more popular among the public and investors but have yet to be accepted by websites of major retailers such as Amazon. Bitcoins are stored in a ‘wallet’ on the hard drive of a computer and can be accessed  using a ‘private key’. Because they can be bought anonymously, critics say they are used for all sorts of criminal acts such as money laundering. He told the Guardian: ‘You know when . you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself “That’s a . bad idea”? I really did have that.’ Bitcoins – which were introduced by a . mysterious programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto –  exist only as units . of digital data and are not backed by a central bank. They can be bought, sold and even . ‘mined’, which means they are created by enthusiasts who use powerful . computers to solve complex mathematical problems. Mr Howells generated his stash in . early 2009, when the currency was known only in tech circles, by running . a programme on his laptop for a week.

"Many animal lovers are familiar with the nuisance caused by cats interrupting their work by climbing across their papers or computer keyboard. But this is not a new phenomenon, as this extraordinary photograph of a medieval manuscript proves. The 15th-century book is marked with four pawprints, which appear to be the result of a cat jumping on to the paper. Age-old problem: This 15th-century manuscript has been damaged by a cat walking across it . The animal also seems to have stepped in ink of some kind, leading to the exceptional clarity of the marks even five or more centuries later. The picture was taken by Emir O. Filipovic, a scholar working in the Dubrovnik State Archives in Croatia. After he sent it to historian Erik Kwakkel last year, the image took on a life of its own as web users shared it as a poignant proof of how cats have been beloved pets for half a millennium. The book is part of the 'Lettere e commissioni di Levante', an official record of the activities of the Dubrovnik government throughout the Middle Ages. Clear: The animal had apparently just stepped in a pot of ink before jumping onto the book . Document: The book contains medieval records from the city of Dubrovnik, now in Croatia . These days, if a government document was disfigured by an animal it would probably be destroyed and replaced - but back then writing was such an elaborate and expensive exercise that the book could not be wasted. This week, Mr Filipovic went online to give his own interpretation of the image's success. 'You can almost picture the writer shooing the cat in a panicky fashion while trying to remove it from his desk,' he wrote. Unique: The mishap is an extraordinary glimpse into the daily life of a scribe in the Middle Ages . 'Despite his best efforts the damage was already complete and there was nothing else he could have done but turn a new leaf and continue his job. In that way this little episode was ""archived"" in history.' This is not the only incident of a cat vandalising a manuscript - one item in the Cologne archive features a page left half-blank because an animal had urinated on it when it was left out overnight. Cats were often allowed to live in monasteries and scriptoria because they chased away mice which might otherwise nibble at the manuscripts.","Unique document comes from Dubrovnik State Archives in Croatia .

"Newcastle United are this season’s ‘crisis club’ and manager Alan Pardew is already clinging to his job with the campaign just six games old. A 1-0 defeat at Stoke on Monday night has reopened the debate over his future – not that the subject was ever closed – and leaves the Magpies joint bottom of the Premier League. Indeed, they have collected just 19 points from a possible 81 since Boxing Day. Owner Mike Ashley, however, is set to keep faith with the 53-year-old in the short term and a trip to Swansea is next up on Saturday. But there is very definitely trouble in Toon right now. Here, Sportsmail looks at 10 contributing factors to their peril… . Newcastle fans show their frustration with the current regime during the Premier League clash with Stoke . Peter Crouch scores Stoke's winner to continue Newcastle's winless run that leaves them bottom of the table . Midfielder Moussa Sissoko looks dejected after Newcastle fall to another league defeat . Alan Pardew – The manager has been in charge for four years, enjoying good times and bad. Don’t forget, he was Premier League and LMA Manager of the Year in 2012 and there was talk of admiring eyes being cast from the Football Association. But sometimes a tenure simply runs its course and there is a definite feel of that with Pardew and Newcastle. Supporters have, at times, accepted the boss, but very few have taken fondly to him. A change for both parties seems like the sensible solution right now. No ambition – Ashley’s wish is to renew the club’s top-flight status season on season, thus lining the coffers. There is no desire to follow the model of a club such as Everton and, with similar resources, make a bid to break the top four. Manager Alan Pardew appears to have run his course on Tyneside after a dismal run of results . Owner Mike Ashley manages to applaud after watching another drab defeat at the Brittania Stadium . When they did finish fifth in 2012, United’s subsequent involvement in the Europa League was viewed as an inconvenience and the season almost finished in relegation – and Ashley does not want that. Hence, then, the policy of deprioritising the domestic cup competitions, something which has angered supporters starved of silverware since 1969. Poor relations – The club have banned three local newspapers and several national titles are also barred from St James’ Park. Relations with sections of the Press, therefore, are strained to say the least and this has eroded any notion of ‘good will’ towards the club, something which is particularly important from your local papers in times of trouble. Fan frustration – The Toon Army will never accept Ashley and, as long as he remains in ownership, unrest will always lurk beneath the surface, even in good times, should they ever return. They, like all football fans, want to be sold a dream, a vision, a reason for putting down £50 every fortnight. Sadly, romance is dead on Tyneside and fans love nothing more than to hate the regime right now. Newcastle fans unfurl a banner in protest of Mike Ashley's ownership of the club . English core is no more – When Newcastle won promotion back to the Premier League and then re-established themselves as a top-flight outfit – first under Chris Hughton and then Pardew – they did so with an English blue-chip brigade. Steve Harper, Nicky Butt, Alan Smith, Joey Barton, Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll were the standard bearers and kept affairs on and off the pitch in check. None of those players remain at the club and have instead been replaced by foreign imports who see United as a stepping stone to bigger things – Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, Demba Ba and Mathieu Debuchy are four who have used Tyneside as a launch pad. Poor signings – ‘Super scout’ Graham Carr can point to some fine discoveries on the continent, but this summer’s soccermarket sweep is yet to bear fruit. Remy Cabella has looked more like a 12-year-old on a playground than a £12million playmaker on a Premier League pitch. Newcastle have lost their English spine of players like Kevin Nolan (C) and Andy Carroll (R) New signing Emmanuel Riviere is yet to score a Premier League goal for the Magpies in six attempts . Striker Emmanuel Riviere – a £6m addition from Monaco – is yet to score in the league and was hooked at half-time against Stoke. At least Riviere has been judged good enough to start, which is more than can be said for fellow frontmen Ayoze Perez and Facundo Ferreyra, a pair of unknowns who remain a mystery. No goals – United have drawn a blank in four of six league games this season and failed to score in 13 from 20 at the back end of the last campaign. The club have known since May that a goalscorer was needed to replace Loic Remy, yet no-one with any Premier League pedigree has arrived. Papiss Cisse – scorer of two against Hull – offers a glimmer of hope, but he was horribly out of form last season and netted just twice in the league. Holland international defender Daryl Janmaat (R) struggles to keep Victor Moses at bay . No case for defence – On paper, United’s back five makes for assured reading – Holland internationals Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat, skipper Fabricio Coloccini, Mike Williamson and Geordie lad Paul Dummett. On grass, however, they are a constant source of worry for Pardew and supporters. Opposition teams rarely have to work hard for a score against United and they have shipped 12 from six in the league this season. Injuries hurt – Injuries, of course, happen – that is why squads are built and allowance made for cover. United, though, do not have the depth to absorb loss in key positions. Ajax captain Siem de Jong had looked the most promising of the summer signings until a torn thigh muscle ruled him out until Christmas. Newcastle have been denied the services of promising Siem de Jong (C) through injury . Manchester City are the only top seven side to play Newcastle, yet Magpies have collected just three points . And it says a lot when a hamstring injury suffered by 18-year-old Rolando Aarons – who is yet to start a league game – is described by Pardew as a ‘major blow’. Playing catch-up – The Premier League fixture list was kind to Newcastle, opening against champions Manchester City apart. But subsequent home games against Crystal Palace and Hull – as well as trips to Aston Villa, Southampton and Stoke – have produced just three points. Those games are gone now, you don’t get them back. That means away matches at last season’s top seven still lie in wait, while all of the big boys – other than City – are yet to visit Tyneside.","Newcastle are joint bottom of Premier League after their 1-0 loss to Stoke .

"She is not even old enough to vote, can’t drive and only left school last year. But Paris Brown, who turns 17 today, is to be paid £15,000 a year to be the country’s first youth police and crime commissioner. She has been appointed to the new post to represent young people’s views on policing in Kent. As well as her salary, Paris will be given a desk, a telephone and official car – with her own emblem. She will work a 37-hour week. Paris Brown, 16, in Maidstone, Kent, after she was unveiled as the UK's first youth police and crime commissioner to represent the views of young people . She was appointed by Ann Barnes, who was elected to the £85,000 role of Kent Police and Crime Commissioner last year. PCCs were elected in 41 police forces in England and Wales in November and each one has control over the budget and policing priorities in their area. Ministers say they will make the police more accountable but critics claim they are a waste of money and could undermine the police’s political independence. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s always great to see people getting involved in the fight against crime in their communities. ‘But paying this youth PCC a salary and giving her expenses like this is a ridiculous waste of money and nothing more than expensive tokenism.’ And Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘If the elected police and crime commissioner can’t do her job of protecting young people and she has to pay a 17-year-old £15,000 a year, I hope it is coming out of her own salary, . ‘If she’s incapable of going out and speaking to young people herself then that doesn’t say a great deal about her.’ Miss Brown, who left school last year with six GCSEs, beat off competition from more than 160 other applicants to secure the role. She has now put on hold plans to do A-levels to take up the year-long post. She applied for the job while working as an apprentice for her local council and living at home on the Isle of Sheppey with her parents and three brothers. Last night she said the job would help her be the ‘messenger’ for young people in Kent. And she has vowed to change perceptions of young people to show that most of them are ‘lovely’ and not threatening hoodies. She said: ‘The only reason young people hang around on the street is because there’s nothing else for them to do. ‘I’m going to be going out and asking them what things they need to get them off the streets. One of the things I want to do is help to remove the stigma young people have attached to them. Paris will work alongside Commissioner Ann Barnes after she pledged in her manifesto to appoint a youth counterpart . ‘When people see a young person in a hoodie they think they’ve got to stay away from them – but actually most young people are lovely if you give them the time.’ She added: ‘I’m just like any other girl my age. I like doing normal teenage stuff like going to the cinema with friends and playing on the computer. ‘I’m really excited. I know I’m only 16, but I really do think I can make a difference.' Paris, from Sheerness, Kent, was one of 164 applicants for the job . Miss Brown, who is currently an apprentice official at Swale Borough Council, will take up the commissioner role in the summer. She is working in the commissioning and open spaces department on a project to create a skate park in the town of Sittingbourne. Despite her new job, she said she has no aspirations to become a politician and wants to go to university to study computing. She said her mum Debra, 51, who works as a GP surgery receptionist, and dad Dennis, 51, who is a charity fundraiser, were her inspiration. Mrs Brown said: ‘We think she’s going to do a great job. Paris has always been very confident and happy to speak her mind. ‘She’s always been one to look out for the underdog. At school she would always stand up for someone she thought was being picked on or getting a hard time. ‘She’s had a very stable, normal upbringing. She’s never been in trouble and neither have her three brothers thank goodness. 'We’ve taught them wrong from right.’ Mrs Barnes is using £5,000 from her own salary to pay the cost of the post, with the remaining £10,000 coming from her staffing budget. She said: ‘Young people don’t have much of a voice in policing in Kent and I’m determined to change that. ‘Young people are victims of crime and also perpetrators of crime. They are often forgotten or demonised and that shouldn’t be the case – they are our young citizens and we need to listen to them. ‘Paris is going to be the young face of policing in the county and I’m quite sure she is going to do a brilliant job at helping the police to connect with young people. She’s very exceptional.’ Mrs Barnes said commissioners in other parts of the country had suggested they may introduce similar posts.","Her salary will be paid for out of the police budget .
Idea behind appointing Ms Brown is help police 'stay in touch' with the youth ."
"Yaya Toure admitted it felt 'amazing' to fire his first Barclays Premier League goal of the season and drive champions Manchester City to a crucial 2-0 victory at Aston Villa. City's talismanic midfielder hit back at criticism of his early-season form with a late goal to break spirited Villa's stubborn resistance, before Sergio Aguero claimed a second at the death. Ivory Coast star Toure reacted to critics of his form by admitting he is only human, then pledging to help City chase down early-season league leaders Chelsea. Yaya Toure celebrates his sublime goal against Aston Villa on Saturday in Manchester City's 2-0 win . Toure delicately glides his shot through traffic and inside the post to Brad Guzan's right . 'I think it was amazing,' Toure told Sky Sports of his match-winning strike. 'If it was not me it would have been Aguero or Silva. 'The most important thing is for me to do my best. I'm keeping going: I play for a top side in Europe. And I'll just do my best to win things again this season. 'It's not so easy because you have to play every three days. I'm not a machine, I'm a man, but it's important to keep things going. 'I have great team-mates around me, and the most important thing is to do my best.' City's victory sustains pressure on Chelsea, who host Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Manuel Pellegrini's men were able to cut the Blues' Premier League lead to two points with victory at Villa Park. 'I think today was a great victory for us, because it was against a great team working very hard,' said Toure. 'The first half was quite difficult for us but in the second half we did the job. Full credit to Villa they played very well in defence but in the second half we did the job.' City striker Sergio Aguero shows his delight after blasting in the second goal to secure the win . Guzan, who had a magnificent game, has no chance as Aguero's shot rockets by the American keeper . Admitting he relishes any chance to push to the top of City's midfield, Toure predicted it will be the usual suspects competing for the title once more. 'I think if the manager gives me possibility to play more in front I'm always delighted, but there's always a player on me so it's quite difficult. 'We have a proper team, it's difficult for Liverpool at the moment, but they and Arsenal will be up there as well,' he said. 'From my point of view it will be the same as last year with the teams fighting it out.' Toure (left), celebrating with David Silva, praised his team-mates and 'hard-working' Villa . Villa boss Paul Lambert praised his side's battling qualities despite a 'gruesome' four-game run against Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and now City. 'I thought it was a big effort from us,' said Lambert despite Villa's third-straight league loss. 'The two lads who scored their goals are probably worth more than our entire team put together. 'I've never known a run as gruesome as that one, but we've come through it without anyone beating us heavily. Villa boss Paul Lambert (left) praised the 'big effort' of his players after having held out City to so long . 'So we've nothing to be ashamed of.' Lambert hailed striker Christian Benteke's return after five months out with a torn Achilles, revealing Gabriel Agbonlahor was withdrawn after feeling 'dizzy' in the warm-up. 'He didn't feel good in the warm-up, he was light-headed and dizzy,' said Lambert of Agbonlahor. 'So you can't take any chances. 'Getting Christian back was a bonus.

"A former soldier who was mentally scarred from the war in Afghanistan was jailed yesterday for killing his landlady while he was ‘in a trance’. Aaron Wilkinson, 24, was jailed for a minimum of five years for shooting 52-year-old Judith Garnett in the chest and head. Brutal: Wilkinson, 24, had become traumatised . while on a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan when he shot dead Mrs . Garnett, right . He carried out the 'brutal' killing after she ordered him to pack his bags and leave the house they . However, he will not be released until he no longer poses a threat to public safety. Wilkinson was cleared in April of murdering Mrs Garnett but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Bradford Crown Court heard that on the day of the shooting, January 24 last year, Mrs Garnett  had returned home and shouted at the soldier for not letting her  dogs out. Wilkinson, who has Asperger’s syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder, said he could not explain why he shot her and said it was as though he was in a ‘trance’. Scarred: Aaron Wilkinson gunned down landlady Judith Garnett with a shotgun after becoming 'obsessed' with firearms in Afghanistan . But Judge Justice Kenneth Parker rejected the idea he had lost all control because he had paused to reload his shotgun before shooting Mrs Garnett in the head. Wilkinson, of Woodlesford, Leeds, joined the Territorial Army at 19 and went on a tour of duty of Afghanistan in 2009, during which he was wounded. He also saw three Afghan soldiers being blown up. The victim’s family were appalled at the sentence. Her brother Chris said: ‘It has flattened the family and we are going to appeal against it.’ The trial had previously heard that . Wilkinson had become ‘obsessed’ with guns after his six months in . Afghanistan, where he suffered a minor wound but ‘seemed disappointed at . not having fired a shot’. The . court had been told he may have shot Mrs Garnett, who had become a . second mother to him, simply to experience what it was like to kill . someone. The prosecution . claimed Wilkinson was a cold-blooded murderer, but a jury at Bradford . Crown Court decided he was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress . Disorder, as well as Asperger’s syndrome, and was not in control of his . actions. Mother-of-two Mrs Garnett ran a game farm and Wilkinson worked for her and lived at her home in Woodlesford, near Leeds. She . had taken him in a decade earlier when he was homeless after being . thrown out by his mother, and treated him like a member of the family. The . court heard Wilkinson had been in the Territorial Army since he was a . teenager but was a changed man when he returned from a tour of duty in . May 2010. He constantly . talked about his time in Afghanistan with the Welsh Regiment, wore . combat clothing and held a shotgun as if he was carrying an Army rifle. While staying in Mrs Garnett’s attic, he applied to join the regular Army but his application was turned down. He found it hard to adapt to civilian life and motivate himself and his relationship with Mrs Garnett began to deteriorate. On . the day of the shooting, January 24 last year, Mrs Garnett returned . home and shouted at him for not letting her dogs out, calling him . 'thick' and a 'cruel bastard'. Gun-obsessed: The court heard Wilkinson may have shot his landlady just to 'find out what it was like' to kill someone . Judge Justice Kenneth Parker rejected Wilkinson’s account that he shot Mrs Garnett three times after she threw his shotgun up through the hatch into his attic bedroom and told him to 'pack his bags'. He said he could not believe Wilkinson’s account that Mrs Garnett stood in the attic room and watched Wilkinson load the gun with two cartridges before shooting her. He told Wilkinson: 'I am satisfied that you had already loaded that gun. When she came to the attic you gave her no choice to say or do anything, you simply gunned down a defenceless woman.' Wilkinson said he could not explain why he shot Mrs Garnett and said it was as though he was in a 'trance'. Following the sentencing, Mrs . Garnett's brother, Chris Higgins, said: 'The family are appalled with . the decision. It has flattened the family and we are going to appeal . against it.' Wilkinson, . wearing glasses, a dark suit, white shirt and tie, showed no emotion as . he was given the indeterminate jail sentence for the public protection . with a minimum term of five years. The . former soldier, of Alma Street, Woodlesford, Leeds, joined the . Territorial Army at 19 and went on a six-month tour of duty of . Afghanistan in 2009. Following his return from Afghanistan, Wilkinson moved into Mrs Garnett’s attic room. The . court heard that Wilkinson had known Mrs Garnett since he was 13. He . worked on her game farm and she acted as a mother figure to him. Judge Justice Kenneth Parker said: 'She was the one person who had showed you kindness, generosity and even maternal affection.' Judge . Justice Parker added: 'There was an element of calculation in which you . could have paused and made greater efforts to restrain yourself.' After you had fired the first two shots . either instinctively as you say, or with some calculation I think, you . then calmly loaded a third cartridge and that is a moment where you . could have made greater efforts to restrain yourself. 'You made death certain and you made the killing that much more horrific.' Mrs Garnett’s sons are now orphans and her father has outlived her, the court heard. Wilkinson, pictured while serving on his six-month tour of duty, struggled to adapt to civilian life when he returned from Afghanistan, the court heard . The judge said: 'This was a brutal killing of a woman in her own home. Her sons, who when young lost their father in a car accident, now have no mother. 'Your victim’s elderly father has had to live to see his daughter die in the most shocking and distressing circumstances.'","Aaron Wilkinson shot landlady dead at point blank range with shotgun .

"O2 mislead customers over how quickly it would fulfil orders for the new iPhone 5, the ASA said . Mobile giant O2 mislead customers over how quickly it would fulfil orders for the new iPhone 5, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has today ruled. Information on the company’s website seemed to suggest that all orders placed before 4pm on the day before launch would be delivered next day, but that was not the case, the watchdog said. The claims were made on website www.o2.co.uk, in the answer to a frequently asked question about the release of the phone. It said: 'When will my iPhone 5 pre-order be delivered? 'If we get your pre-order before 4pm the day before launch, we’ll get it to you on launch day. 'The only exception to this will be those customers with an address in the Highlands and Islands.' Six complainants, five of whom had ordered the phone and not received it on launch day, challenged whether the claim was misleading. Telefonica UK, trading as O2, explained there were different types of orders for the launch. Consumers could make a special order prior to launch which would be dispatched to arrive on launch day and this was named a pre-order. Once their initial stock was fully allocated to customers who had pre-ordered, they stopped accepting these and accepted orders that would be met from future supplies, which were known as standard orders. The company said it should have been made clear to customers buying before launch whether they had made a pre-order or a standard order, and those making a standard order should have been informed that the product could take up to three weeks to be dispatched. O2 said 100 per cent of pre-orders were dispatched as planned for launch day. Information on the company¿s website seemed to suggest that all orders placed before 4pm on the day before launch would be delivered next day, but that was not the case . The company said that in hindsight it appeared some people making standard orders while the frequently asked question was online may have been confused by it, believing it applied to their order. Six complainants, five of whom had ordered the iPhone5 and not received it on launch day, challenged whether the claim was misleading . The ASA said it did not consider that the claim in the frequently asked questions made the distinction between the two types of order clear to readers, who would infer that all orders placed before 4pm the day before launch would be delivered on launch day. 'Although O2 had explained that they had advised customers, when purchasing, which type of order they had placed, we did not consider that was sufficient to remove the misleading impression conveyed by the claim,' the ASA said. 'Notwithstanding that, five of the six complainants had ordered the iPhone from O2 believing that they would receive it on launch day and had not done so. 'Because the claim implied that all iPhone 5 orders placed before 4pm on the day before launch would be delivered on launch day, and because we understood that was not the case, we concluded that the claim was misleading.' An O2 spokeswoman said: 'We accept the ASA’s ruling and apologise to those customers who were led to believe they would get an iPhone 5 the next day as a result. 'We can confirm that the claim will not appear again in its current form and we will ensure that our ads make clear the distinction between ‘Pre-Orders’ and ‘Standard Orders’ in future.'","Advertising Standards Authority ruled the company had not been clear .
The claims were made on o2 website .

"Every nation in Europe will have to bring in tough new measures to slash the use of plastic bags, after a key EU vote yesterday. Euro MPs voted in favour of strict new targets forcing each country to reduce plastic bag use by 80 per cent before 2019. The decision is a huge boost for conservationists, who have been fighting for years to reduce the huge volumes of devastating plastic litter harming the environment. Euro MPs have voted in favour of strict new targets forcing each country to reduce plastic bag use by 80 per cent before 2019 (file picture) Backed by the Daily Mail, campaigners have successfully fought for a supermarket plastic bag charge in Britain, which will be introduced in 2015. Every other EU nation will now have to bring in similar measures if they are to meet the strict target - or leave themselves open to large fines. MEPs suggest they will either have to introduce a charge for bags or tax shops which give them out for free. The EU directive, which will pass into law in the coming weeks, also removes blocks to outright bans on plastic bags for the first time. Sue Kinsey of the Marine Conservation Society said: 'This is a fantastic result and will lead to the drastic reduction of single use carrier bags given out throughout Europe.' An estimated 100 billion carrier bags are used every year in Europe - with 8 billion ending up as litter. Many of those end up in seas and rivers, killing millions of marine animals. The decision is a huge boost for conservationists, who have been fighting for years to reduce the huge volumes of devastating plastic litter harming the environment . A 2004 study of wildlife in the North Sea found 96 per cent of dead sea birds had fragments of plastic in their stomachs. Nick Clegg announced last year that supermarkets and other large stores in England will have to charge 5p for plastic bags from 2015. Ireland and Wales have already introduced charges for bags and have seen the volume of plastic bag litter plummet as a result. Italy is currently facing legal action from the European Commission, after launching Europe's first plastic bag ban in 2011. That case will now be dropped, paving the way for other nations to follow suit with an outright ban on lightweight bags. Backed by the Daily Mail, campaigners have successfully fought for a supermarket plastic bag charge in Britain, which will be introduced in 2015 . Chris Davies MEP, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats in Europe said: 'Discarded plastic bags are killing millions of marine animals each year. It's become a massive problem across Europe and one we must deal with together. 'Every country has the right to decide what action to take, but the need to reduce the huge volumes of plastic waste we create should not be in dispute.' But Tory MEPs say the rules will place an 'unreasonable burden' on businesses. A Conservative spokesman in Strasbourg said: 'Conservatives agree that action needs to be taken to reduce the distribution of these bags. 'Discarded plastic bags are killing . millions of marine animals each year. It's become a massive problem . across Europe and one we must deal with together' - Chris Davies MEP . 'Discarded plastic bags are an iconic symbol of waste and a visible form of littering, and the environmental impact extends beyond littering to their production and disposal in landfill. 'However, the current proposals are muddled over just how plastic-bag consumption should be measured and recorded. 'Existing and planned domestic legislation in the UK requires reporting on consumption of lightweight plastic bags by large retailers. 'So extending the legislation to include ultra-light plastic bags, and bringing small businesses into the scope, brings an unreasonable burden.' Joan Walley MP, chair of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee said: 'The vote by European Parliamentarians is another reminder of the importance of reducing the litter and environmental damage that unnecessary use of plastic bags can cause. 'A simple and consistent 5p charge for all single-use carrier bags in all stores is the best way to have the biggest impact and to achieve reductions in use of 80 per cent or more.'","Euro MPs vote in favour of strict new targets to reduce plastic bag use .

"Facebook's digital cloud met with an actual weather system when the company's air conditioning system malfunctioned and actually formed a rain cloud inside the social media giant's data center headquarters. The company recently revealed that when their Prineville, Oregon Data Center, which contains all of Facebook's severs, opened in 2011, the building's energy efficient cooling system combined the hot air coming off the severs with a water-based cooling system in the air vents. The system was supposed to cool the air down, but instead the clash of temperatures made the air so wet that it condensed and formed a rain cloud inside the sever room, panicking workers and shorting out the social media system. The sever room in Facebook's data center in Oregon (pictured here) was drenched by an actual rain cloud that formed inside the building after the company's air conditioning system malfunctioned . 'I got a call, 'Jay, there's a cloud in the data center',' Jay Parikh, Facebook's Vice President of Infrastructure Engineering, told The Register. Parikh continued narrating the conversation, ''What do you mean, outside? No, inside'. He remembered how panicked the employees sounded, finally realizing himself that, 'It was raining in the datacenter.' When the freak weather event took place two summers ago Facebook officially labeled it a 'humidity event,' according to the website. The social media leader employed an air conditioning unit the used outside air instead of a less energy efficient model to cool their massive server room, which uses energy-intensive direct expansion cooling units. The system was designed to take in hot air coming off the severs and cool it down with the use of a water-based cooling system. Facebook's data center cooling center (seen here being shown by Tom Furlong, director of site operations) malfunctioned, causing a rain cloud to form inside the company's sever room, shorting the system . The unit then recycled this cool air back out into the sever room, however, an unforeseen complication caused the air to condense as it cooled. The condensed air eventually accumulated and formed a rain cloud in the sever room, damaging several units. The company released an official account of the incident stating 'This resulted in cold aisle supply temperature exceeding 80°F and relative humidity exceeding 95 per cent. The Open Compute servers that are deployed within the data center reacted to these extreme changes. Numerous servers were rebooted and few were automatically shut down due to power supply unit failure.' Since the indoor rain cloud passed over Facebook's blue skies, the company has learned from their mistakes. Jay Parikh, Facebook's Vice President of Infrastructure Engineering, could hardly believe what employees were telling him when they phoned to say that it was raining INSIDE Facebook's data center . The data center now designs its severs with a 'rubber raincoat,' Parikh told the site. Facebook severs now have a seal over their power supply to protect from any condensation that could form on its surface. 'This is one of those things. When you are 100 per cent aircooled it's awesome from an efficiency perspective,' Parikh said, 'but the range you have to operate in is much, much wider.' Since the incident occurred two years ago the Facebook facility has had nothing but sunny skies, so to speak, in their sever room, and after improving their building management system, predict that there's no more chance of rainclouds on the horizon.","The Facebook severs short circuited after a building's cooling system malfunctioned and caused an actual rain cloud to form inside the building .
Hot air from the computer equipment being taken in to the air conditioning system caused the air being pushed back out of the unit to condense and fall as rain ."
"A raging punk rocker stormed into a dressing room and slashed two members of his former band with a hunting knife before a gig, it emerged today. Tattooed skinhead Harley Flanagan, 42, caused chaos when he knifed the pair - one of whom he also bit - at the Cro-Mags concert in New York. The band, who have a strong cult following, was about to take the stage at Webster Hall, East Village, around 8.15pm when Flanagan burst in. Former Cro-Mags bassist Harley Flanagan stormed into a dressing room before a gig and slashed two members of his former band in New York . The band's former bassist, and one of its founders, had forced his way through the venue's VIP section before unleashing his attack. Law enforcement sources and witnesses told the New York Post that nearly 30 guests on the balcony were sent into a frenzy. Security guards then jumped on the Jiu-Jitsu expert, who suffered a broken leg, before police handcuffed him to a chair. Witness Dave Gustav said: 'Someone was yelling, ""Get his hands, get his hands, he's got a knife!""' Another witness told the Horns Up Rocks website: 'I talked to him outside minutes before it happened and I knew something was going to go down. Handcuffed and reportedly suffering from a broken leg, Harley Flanagan is taken out of Webster Hall by an emergency worker . The attack occurred last night at Webster Hall in Manhattan, New York before the band the 'Cro Mags' were due to take to the stage . 'He was like a lunatic outside. Next thing I know he’s in the VIP area stabbing people!' Eyewitness Justin Brannan said: 'People started booing him and throwing stuff at him. His hands were handcuffed but he still gave everyone the finger.' Bandmember William Berario, 45, was slashed above the eye and bitten on his cheek, the New York Post reported. Michael Couls, 33 - the band's current bassist, who is known in the hardcore world as 'The Gook' - was cut on his arm and stomach. Police are visible outside Webster Hall after Harley Flanagan disrupted a 'Cro Mags' gig last night in New York City . Both members of Cro-Mags were taken to New York's Bellevue Hospital with non life-threatening wounds. Flanagan, from New York, was also taken to the hospital. He was charged with two counts of 2nd degree assault and weapons charges. The show, which was part of the CBGB Festival and also featured the band Sick of It All, was cancelled . According to the New York Post, Cro-Mags lead singer John Joseph McGowan told the crowd: 'You can all thank Harley Flanagan for ruining the night for everyone.'","Harley Flanagan caused chaos when he knifed the pair .

"A 12-year-old boy accused of fatally stabbing a nine-year-old boy on a western Michigan playground told authorities he had been planning to murder someone for a year. Jamarion Lawhorn also said he wanted to go to jail, did not know his young victim and that he's 'bad and always does stupid things', according to a delinquency petition filed in Kent County Circuit Court on Friday. WZZM 13 are reporting the pre-teen wanted to die and 'take somebody with him', so he swallowed some pink pills he found at home, took an eight-inch steak knife from the kitchen and walked half a mile to the Pinebrook Village playground. Lawhorn then went up behind Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke, 9 - who was playing at the small jungle gym with his brother and a friend - and stabbed him repeatedly in the back. Horrific: Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his home . Police Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back . The horrific incident occurred on Monday. Seriously injured, Connor was helped back to his home 100 feet away by his seven-year-old brother Kameron Verkerke. The boys' great uncle, Jim Stearns, told MLine that Connor, on the brink of death, told his brother: 'If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you.' Connor later died in hospital. Lawhorn left the playground and called police to turn himself in. He initially said he wasn't concerned for the victim, then said he was concerned because ""it made him feel stupid,"" an investigator wrote. He is designated as an adult in the juvenile court system, which would allow the boy, if convicted, to be sentenced as a juvenile and then as an adult once he turns 21. Lawhorn's attorney, Charles Boekeloo, entered a not-guilty plea for his client on Tuesday. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday’s deadly attack. About 100 people gathered to celebrate Connor's memory. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday's deadly attack . Stearns . said the incident has 'terrorized' the park for kids - in particular, . two of Connor’s brothers who were with him when the attack occurred. 'They’re afraid,' he said. The Verkerke family were also concerned about the Jamarion Lawhorn's family. 'Even though . we’re dealing with a different type of pain, they’ll be dealing with a . similar pain every day for the rest of their lives. That’s not to be . taken lightly,' said Stearns. The community has some together to help Conner's mom pay for his funeral. A Go Fund Me page set up yesterday has already raised more than $13,000 from 321 people. The Grand Rapids Press . reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on . Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to . try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him. About 100 people gathered on Wednesday night to celebrate Connor's memory and sing Jesus Loves Me . Shocking: . Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an . adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young . for his age . Children . and adults both laughed and cried during the vigil, reports MLive before Stearns, who is the uncle of Connor's mom, . spoke to the crowd and everyone joined in to sing Jesus . Loves Me. ‘Their . top priority right now is the mental health of their three remaining . children,’ Stearns said of the devastated Verkerke family. Community . members honored Connor's memory with teddy bears, passed out by vigil . organizers, placed next to a cross on the side of the playground. Jamarion's lawyer asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him. Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. Horrific: A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in the back with a kitchen knife . Random: Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he didn't live in the trailer park near the playground . Suddenly, . he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in . the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the . weapon. Conner . ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken . to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. Authorities . say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent . County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An . 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 . in Pontiac, Michigan. Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime. Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' Witness: Glen Stacy says the 12-year-old suspect asked to borrow his cell phone then called 911 and admitted he had killed . He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him. The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press. He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy. 'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived. When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.","Michael 'Connor' Verkerke, 9, was fatally stabbed while playing in a Michigan playground on Monday .

"A man suspected of murdering his ex-girlfriend was also wanted for questioning over claims he raped her, sources revealed today. Mother-of-two Linzi Ashton was battered to death in a 'sustained and vicious' attack at home after making a string of calls to police over claims of domestic abuse against ex-boyfriend Michael Cope. Police made 'numerous' attempts to arrest the 28-year-old after Miss Ashton, 25, of Salford, Greater Manchester, was interviewed by detectives over a rape allegation. Scroll down for video . Detectives are hunting Michael Cope, left, in connection with the 'brutal' murder of his ex-girlfriend Linzi Ashton . But he was not tracked down and police fear Cope returned to kill the blonde barmaid in revenge. They have urged Cope to give himself up . for his own safety after vigilantes threatened to kill him if officers . didn't find him first. The public were told not to approach . him and police warned anyone found harbouring or assisting him could . expect to be in 'very deep trouble'. Greater Manchester Police Superintendent Kevin Mulligan said: 'If anyone is harbouring this individual they will be prosecuted. This is a serious offence and we need to track down this man. 'He does have a history of violent and aggressive behaviour and he does represent a risk to the community. The community, or members of the community, must know where he is. 'They need to pass on that information to us as soon as possible - and that information will be treated in the strictest of confidence.' The attack on Miss Ashton was 'sustained and vicious', Mr Mulligan said. Police and Crimestoppers have announced a £5,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to the arrest of Cope. Mother-of-two Miss Ashton was found by the father of one of her children at her home in Salford . Death: Miss Ashton's body was found with head and facial injuries at her home in the Salford area on Saturday .

"It was a moment that gripped a global audience: Nasa’s dramatic landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars on 6 August 2012 remains one of mankind’s greatest space achievements. Recently, however, the rover came under criticism for coming last in a review of Nasa’s active planetary missions, owing to the slow progress it has made on the red planet since then. But now two years after landing the rover has finally reached its goal, a giant mountain named Mount Sharp, and the true science of the mission as had been planned can begin. Scroll down for video . Nasa's Curiosity rover has finally reached the target of its mission, with a 'shortcut' taking it to Mount Sharp quicker than was intended. This image shows the old and new routes of Nasa's Mars Curiosity rover and is composed of color strips taken by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) The three-mile (5km) high Mount Sharp had been selected as the target for Curiosity’s landing by Nasa owing to its interesting slopes. These will hopefully provide an insight into the history of Mars, and answer the important question of whether the planet was once habitable. And after 6.6 miles (9km) of driving, Curiosity is finally ready to start exploring this fascinating region. ‘Curiosity now will begin a new chapter from an already outstanding introduction to the world,’ said Jim Green, director of Nasa’s Planetary Science Division at Nasa Headquarters in Washington. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. ‘After a historic and innovative landing along with its successful science discoveries, the scientific sequel is upon us.’ Since touching down at a site named Bradbury Landing, Curiosity has spent two years exploring the Gale Crater in which Mount Sharp resides. However in a recent review of seven active Nasa planetary missions Curiosity came last. This was because a panel said the rover 'lacked specific scientific questions and testable hypotheses' for the next two years of its operations. Reviewers also said they felt the Curiosity team thought they were 'too big to fail', owing to the huge amounts of money - more than £1.5 billion ($2.5 billion) - spent on the rover. While the review will come as a stark wake-up call, it's hoped that the rover can now begin to fulfill its potential at Mount Sharp. The rover is taking a shortcut to get to the mountain, after mission engineers spotted a quicker route. The 3-mile (5km) high Mount Sharp has been the target of Curiosity's driving since its landing (self-portrait made by stitching together images shown). In total the rover has covered 6.6 miles (9km) on the red planet, and in two weeks it will begin trekking further up the mountain . Mount Sharp's eroded sedimentary layers (shown) should reveal how habitable Mars was in the past, and what fate might befall Earth. The mountain is officially known as Aeolis Mons, and it forms a central peak in the Gale Crater within which Curiosity landed . Curiosity is now at the boundary between the crater and the mountain, where the terrain will become noticeably different. The rover's access to the mountain on this quicker route is granted by a region known as Pahrump Hills. This is considerably earlier than a previously planned entry point named Murray Buttes, providing a shortcut that allows the rover to reach the mountain 1.2 miles (2km) earlier than before. The entry is at a point where the mountain’s base layer meets the crater floor, terrain that has been previously unexplored by the rover. The rover will reach Pahrump Hills in two weeks, where drill samples will be taken, before it heads further up the mountain. Despite criticisms Curiosity’s mission so far has still been successful. In its first year of operations it fulfilled the major scientific goal of determining if Mars once had favourable conditions for microbial life in its past - namely by spotting evidence of an ancient lake. The next step will be to ascertain just how habitable Mars really was - and whether it’s present might be a fate that could one day befall Earth. It's not all been bad news for Curiosity, with many important discoveries being made. Last month the rover spotted the interesting 'Bonanza King' rock (shown), which was tapped by the rover's drill. Vibrations from the drill cleaned off some of the rock veins, revealing a strange lighter color seen in this picture .","Nasa officials in Washington DC say the rover has now reached the target of its mission on Mars, a mountain called Mount Sharp .

The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard (pictured) showing all the user's health and ﬁtness data. However, the firm was today forced to delay apps using the service from being distributed. HealthKit is not an app but a back-end framework that allows third-party apps to sync with Apple's new and proprietary health tracking app, Health. This lets users chart metrics like weight, sleep and calorie intake, and is available in the iOs update. However, until apple fixes the bug, users will have to manually enter their data rather than syncing it form other apps. 'We discovered a bug that prevents us from making HealthKit apps available on iOS 8 today,' it told the FT's Tim Bradshaw. 'We're working quickly to have the bug fixed in a software update and have HealthKit apps available by the end of the month.' Developer Brian Mueller of Carrot Fit said via Twitter that his app had been removed from the App Store because HealthKit wasn't ready for launch. Later he said the service wouldn't be ready for the rest of this week. The Health app puts all heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, and cholesterol information in one place, and blood type and allergy information can be accessed from the Lock Screen, in case of an emergency. The delay comes as Apple today launched iOS 8, a huge update for the iPhone and iPad software. Apple's latest software features updated photo editing tools and time-lapse videos, sounds and location features in the Messages app, and an Interactive Notifications tool. Design-wise, the software looks similar to iOS 7, with flat icons and menus. The search function on Apple's Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates, or album name. The Messages app in iOS 8 now lets users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds and music. The new Messages app also takes on Whatsapp by additionally letting users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time. Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi speaks about the Apple HealthKit app at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco in June, when it was first revealed. Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on an interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll. Apple announced HealthKit in June at its World World Wide developer's conference. Tim Cook said in a recent interview with Charlie Rose that health care represented a 'wide open field to make some really profound contributions.' 'You can begin to take all of the data that's in all of your health apps and aggregate those,' he said when describing HealthKit. 'You might elect just to use that yourself. You might elect to interact with your doctor on them. The search function on Apple's Photos app (pictured) has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates or album name.

The search function on Apple's Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates or album. Users can fine-tune edits, and the latest smart composition tools automatically straighten horizons, or crop the image. The Messages app takes on Whatsapp by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds or music . There are also smart adjustments that modify the overall light and colour in a photo to balance exposure, brightness and contrast. Apple has now added time-lapse video modes, accessible through the Record button on the Camera app. MESSAGES . The Messages app in iOS 8 takes on Whatsapp by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds or music. To play these sounds, users can either press the Play button, or hold the device up to their ear and listen like a phone call. The new Messages app additionally lets users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time. Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on a interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll. There is also a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video messages. INTERACTIVE NOTIFICATIONS . One of the stand-out features mentioned by Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, at iOS 8's unveiling in June was the Interactive Notifications tool. This feature let users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner. This means they don't have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using. With iOS 8, pressing the Home button twice opens the multitasking menu. Along the top, users will now see the faces of people they've recently talked to, and by swiping to the right, their favourite contacts. This means they can call or text these people with one tap. And when contacts send calendar invites, for example, they can be added to the diary from the top of the screen. One of the stand-out features of iOS 8 is Interactive Notifications (pictured). They let users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner. This means users don't have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using . QUICKTYPE . In iOS 8, Apple has added support for more third-party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text. In iOS 8, Apple has added support for more third-party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text (pictured) As a user types, they'll see a choice of words or phrases the software thinks they will type next, based on past conversations and writing style. The software can also distinguish between informal languages uses in the Messages app, for example, and more formal language when using the Mail app. It also adjusts the style based on the person the user is communicating with, because their choice of words is likely more laid back with a spouse than with a boss. FAMILY SHARING . With Family Sharing, up to six people in a family can share purchases from iTunes, iBooks and the App Store without sharing accounts. This means family purchases can be paid with the same credit card, and a child's spending has to be approved from a parent's device. Photos and family calendars can also be shared more easily, and everyone on the account can contribute photos to shared albums, for example. HEALTH . The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard showing all the user's health and ﬁtness data.

"Rolf Harris, 84, pictured before he was jailed, has reportedly lost a stone since being behind bars . Disgraced Rolf Harris has reportedly lost a stone since being jailed because he does not like the taste of prison food. The 84-year-old entertainer, who was convicted for 12 indecent assaults in June, previously enjoyed eating curried lobster and roast quail as part of his pre-prison diet. But he now has to make do with meals such as tuna salads and low-fat chicken curries at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire. Harris, who is serving five years and nine months at the prison, has reportedly seen his weight plummet as a result. A source told The Sun: 'This is a world away from what he is used to.' According to the Ministry of Justice, prisoners must be provided with three meals a day. Breakfast includes a continental breakfast, while there are a minimum of five options at every meal time. There must be at least one hot meal, as well as one vegan choice, one vegetarian choice and one Halal choice. A typical menu shows that dinner options include shepherd's pie, pasta bake, white fish in tomato and basil sauce and Halal chicken curry. Lunch options include cous cous with bread, a variety of sandwiches and pasta salad boxes. Guidance given to catering managers by the MoJ says prisons should 'constantly review their practices in order to provide increasingly healthy meals'. Recommended ways of doing this include replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, using reduced fat products such as skimmed milk where possible and 'using one layer of pastry rather than two'. The guidance also suggests using oatmeal 'for coatings or to add to crumbles and other suitable dishes'. Caterers are also told that a third to a half of all cold desserts should be decorated with fresh or dried fruits rather than 'over-relying on piped cream'. Harris, who is serving five years and nine months for the offences, has had a tough time since arriving at the prison as he has become a 'hate figure', one inmate said. in July, he was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris has become a 'hate figure' since being put behind bars at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire . The fellow prisoner shouted insults from the pews of the chapel, before attempting to spit on the convicted paedophile. When it missed and hit another prisoner, a grapple broke out between the two convicts, who had to be separated by officers. Harris was ‘was not physically hurt’ in the scuffle. Two weeks ago, it also emerged that Rolf Harris had angered fellow inmates after being handed a ‘plum job’ as a prison gardener. Other prisoners believe he may have ‘jumped the queue’ to land the cushy role. Harris is now being paid to look after the vegetable patch and parts of the ground, despite one prisoner saying he had been waiting 12 months for a similar job. At the prison in Oxfordshire, pictured above, Harris is fed meals such as tuna salads and pasta bakes . But he has since softened inmates by signing drawings for convicts who queue outside his cell, it was reported. The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was jailed for his decades preying on victims including and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. He even attacked her as his daughter slept in the same room. His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE. The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims. Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault. The court will now consider whether to grant permission for him to continue with his appeal bid. No-one from the Prison Service was available for comment.","Entertainer, 84, previously enjoyed eating curried lobster and roast quail .

"Andy Murray’s controversial tweeting of last month may not have helped his image among many people but it seems to have done little to harm his tennis. Since sending out his support for a Yes vote in the Scottish referendum in the early hours of September 18 the British number one has won seven straight matches, a run that continued this morning with his best victory since Wimbledon in the summer of 2013. After winning the ATP title in Shenzen on Sunday Murray was extremely sharp in defeating US Open champion and world number five Marin Cilic 6-1 6-4 to make the semi-finals of the China Open, in which he will take on the world’s best player Novak Djokovic. VIDEO Scroll down for archive footage of Murray and Djokovic practicing together . Andy Murray breezed through 6-4 6-1 against Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals . He will now face long-time adversary Novak Djokovic in the final four in Beijing . Murray's victory moved him into ninth place in the Race to London ahead of David Ferrer but he still faces a battle to overhaul Milos Raonic and Tomas Berdych. And his cause to make it into the top eight performers of the season was significantly aided by Djokovic defeating Grigor Dimitrov, who is one of his main rivals for one of the three remaining places. The 27 year-old Scot may fancy his chances as the signs become more evident that his climb back towards his best level is gaining real traction. It took him 98 minutes to beat a player against whom he has a good record, but who has received a massive boost with his unexpected triumph at Flushing Meadows. It was business as usual between the pair with Murray’s supreme athleticism forcing Cilic to cut his margin of error and consequently make more mistakes than normal. US Open champion Cilic had no answer to Murray's quality throughout the contest . Djokovic had made light work of beating Grigor Dimitrov earlier in the day . He also punished the Croatian’s serve and broke him three times in the first set and once in the second to win the match, after eventually being made to fight much harder in what was a feisty encounter in which Murray was lucky to escape censure for his four-letter outbursts. There was, after all, plenty at stake for him as he seeks the big wins that have been missing since undergoing back surgery. His previous best statistical victory had been against then world number ten Jo Wilfried Tsonga at the US Open, but there is no substitute for the belief beating a top five player gives you. While there is long way to go, every win boosts Murray’s chances of making the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in November, open to the world’s top eight performers of the season.","Murray beats Cilic 6-1 6-4 in quarter-finals of the China Open .

"A teenager will have to pay almost £900 in fines and costs after playing a James Blunt song too loudly – even though she claims to hate his music. Council environmental health officers heard Rebecca Hope, 19, blasting out the British singer’s 2004 hit You’re Beautiful in her first-floor flat. Another officer visited eight days later and heard her loudly playing the 1998 number one C’est La Vie by Irish girl band B*Witched, a court heard. Scroll down for video . Council environmental health officers heard Rebecca Hope, 19, blasting out the James Blunt's 2004 hit You’re Beautiful in her first-floor flat . Another officer visited eight days later and heard Hope loudly playing the 1998 number one C’est La Vie by Irish girl band B*Witched, a court heard . Hope was found guilty in her absence of four offences of breaching a noise abatement notice at her council home in Ipswich in March and April. It was imposed by Ipswich Borough Council in February after neighbours complained about noise from her flat. South East Suffolk magistrates fined Hope £500 and ordered her to pay £374 costs and a £20 surcharge from her benefits. But yesterday she denied that she was responsible for playing James Blunt and B*Witched, claiming it must have been one of her neighbours. ‘I hate the sound of James Blunt – so why would I listen to him,’ said Hope. ‘I am in to much more modern music. My mum likes James Blunt and the last time I heard one of his songs was when she was listening to it at her home in Devon. ‘I don’t know anything about B*Witched and I haven’t even got any of their music.’ A council spokesman said: 'The council is here to help residents who are upset by loud noise. 'We will take action if necessary and will not tolerate noise nuisance that blights people’s lives.'","Rebecca Hope, 19, fined nearly £900 for playing music too loudly .

"Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray will meet in the semi-finals at the China Open - but second seed Rafael Nadal was a shock quarter-final casualty. Nadal was beaten 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 6-3 by world No 56 Martin Klizan, who will face third seed Tomas Berdych in the second semi in Beijing. One service break apiece in the first set led to a tie-break which the Spaniard eventually won 9-7. Rafael Nadal is out of the China Open losing in three sets to world number 56 Martin Klizan . Klizan beat second seed Nadal 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 6-3 in their quarter-final encounter on Friday . Klizan will face third seed Tomas Berdych in the semi-finals after taking the scalp of Nadal . And, although he broke in the third game of the second set when Klizan sent a backhand wide, the Slovakian saved a break point in game seven and broke back in the next on his way to taking the set. In the decider, Nadal had to brilliantly save a break point in his first service game, but broke in the fifth game, only to immediately drop his serve twice in a row. That left Klizan serving for the match and he finished the job in style, with a flying cross-court smash to round off a hold to 15. Nadal lost his serve twice a row in the deciding set as Klizan sealed a historic victory . Berdych was imperious in beating John Isner 6-1, 6-4, breaking the American's usually formidable serve twice in the first set and again at the start of the second. Thirteen clean winners in the second set saw him home. Djokovic is bidding to win the ATP World Tour 500 level event for the fifth time in six years and he made short work of Grigor Dimitrov in his quarter-final to continue his unbeaten career record at the tournament. Having breezed through the first set 6-2, he looked on course to repeat that scoreline in the second when he had two match points on Dimitrov's serve. The Bulgarian saved both and broke back to trail only 5-4, but double-faulted at 15-40 in his next service game to hand Djokovic a 6-2, 6-4 win in 90 minutes. Klizan will face Berdych next, who beat John Isner 6-1, 6-4 in their quarter-final tie . Djokovic told atpworldtour.com: 'The second set was up and down. But generally it was a good performance.' British number one Murray won last week's Shenzhen Open and Djokovic continued: 'I've seen a little bit of his matches this week. He's hitting the ball very well. 'Every time I play him, it's a huge challenge. It's a very physical match, a lot of long rallies. I do not expect anything less tomorrow.' Novak Djokovic will face Andy Murray in the other semi-final on Saturday after beating Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-4 . Djokovic says he is expecting a tough match against Murray, who defeated US Open champion Marin Cilic . Murray raced into a 4-1 lead in the opening set as Cilic's serve crumpled under the first signs of pressure. Cilic crafted two break points for himself, but Murray saved both before breaking for a third successive time. The second set was on serve most of the way but, having gone 5-4 up, Murray finally found more cracks in Cilic's serve to set up three match points, taking the the second as Cilic slipped trying to return his sliced backhand. Women's top seed Serena Williams withdrew ahead of her quarter-final against Sam Stosur due to a knee injury, which was heavily strapped during her three-set win over Lucie Safarova. Women's top seed Serena Williams has had to withdraw from the China Open with a knee injury . She follows her sister Venus in pulling out of the tournament and said: 'It throbs just sitting, standing. I felt it mostly serving because I'm landing on my left knee. That was really killer for me. 'I haven't had time to get an MRI scan yet, but I'll do that and see what the problem is.' The world number one's exit gave Stosur an automatic pass to a semi-final against third seed Petra Kvitova after the Czech dispatched Roberta Vinci 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 on Friday. Fourth seed Maria Sharapova was untested in a 6-0, 6-4 win over Svetlana Kuznetsova and will face Ana Ivanovic, who also received a walkover due to second seed Simona Halep's hip injury. Fourth seed Maria Sharapova will face Ana Ivanovic in the semis after beating Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-0, 6-4 . The pair met in the semi-finals of August's Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati, Ivanovic victorious in three hard-fought sets before losing the final to Serena Williams. 'It was a very tough match we had in Cincinnati. I was just a point away from winning the match,' Sharapova told wtatennis.com. 'It was a tough one to lose.

"England all-rounder Ravi Bopara admits he still feels 'devastated' from his exclusion earlier this summer. Bopara had been widely tipped to feature in England's one-day international team for the series against India, especially after playing the series against Sri Lanka in May. However, he ended up playing just the one-off Twenty20 international against India, which England won, scoring an unbeaten 21 and conceding 14 runs with the ball for no reward. England all-rounder Ravi Bopara admits he still feels 'devastated' from his exclusion earlier this summer . Bopara has been enjoying life at club level, averaging 44.64 in the LV= County Championship, as Essex only narrowly missed out on promotion from Division Two, and earned himself a new one-year deal. While he has been recalled to the England squad for the tour of Sri Lanka, it is the summer that Bopara still carries regret, as he said: 'Obviously I'm devastated (about the exclusion). 'Life is full of surprises, but now I just want to focus on the future, and getting back into the squad for Sri Lanka is a great feeling.' Bopara made his ODI debut against Australia in Sydney in 2007 and will hope to be on the plane there once again when England fly out for next year's World Cup. To that effect, when asked if he had any major changes to make to his game ahead of the Sri Lanka tour, Bopara added: 'Nothing special. 'I'm mainly hitting as many balls as I can. That's all you can do as a cricketer. 'I'm going to be in the nets pretty much every day (until we set off for Sri Lanka).' Bopara faces still competition for an England place from all-rounders Varun Chopra (left) and Adil Rashid . Mooen Ali (who won Player of the Season at the Asian Cricket Awards) has been backed to become a success . Bopara has also backed England's rising star Moeen Ali to make it at least a decade of success after he was named the Professional Player of the Season at the inaugural Asian Cricket Awards at Lord's . Moeen saw off competition from fellow all-rounder Bopara, Yorkshire's Adil Rashid and Warwickshire's Varun Chopra, with the accolade coming just a few weeks after he was also given the Birmingham Sportsman of the Year title. The 27-year-old's individual success is a result of his form for both England and Worcestershire, most notably when he took 19 wickets in the Test series against India. And Bopara, who will line up alongside Moeen on England's winter tour to Sri Lanka, said: 'Mooen has been brilliant this season. 'He's shown his talent, how good he can be. 'He's always looked like a guy who should go on and play at the top level, and now he's got there it's great to see. 'I hope he goes on and has a great career for England for the next 10 years or more.

"Leicester boss Richard Cockerill hit back at the club's critics after their 22-16 win at home to Harlequins ended a run of three successive Aviva Premiership defeats. Cockerill said some of the 'stick' from the media had been unfair but admitted he was relieved to avoid a repeat of 2003, the last time they lost four in a row. 'I'm relieved, I'm happy for the players and the club because we have had some stick in the last few weeks,' he said. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill patrols the touchline of the Midlands ground . Blaine Scully of Leicester Tigers runs in for the opening try against Harlequins at Welford Road . 'When people say we have lost the hunger and there's no pride in the shirt, that's just rubbish. 'People who know this place should have a bit of respect. They can shout at me and think I'm poor but don't attack the quality of this club and what it's about. 'We have won the Premiership three times in the last six years, we have won it 10 times. We have won the Heineken twice and produced Lions and England players. 'There are lots of things that are fantastic about this place. You can abuse me but don't abuse the club, that's just not right.' Young Welsh centre Owen Williams kicked 17 points on a filthy night, landing five penalties out of nine and converting a fourth-minute try by winger Blaine Scully to earn Leicester only their third win of the season. It moved them up to seventh place in the table on 14 points, one place behind Harlequins on the same points. Quins, who had few chances, scored a late try through scrum-half Karl Dickson who replaced England's Danny Care after he withdrew due to his wife having a baby. Fly-half Nick Evans kicked 11 points.

There's still lots to do. 'We can be better than we were tonight. But I thought the work-rate and attitude of the players, and the way we managed the game, was fantastic.

Cockerill revealed that England flanker Tom Croft will be out for six weeks and will miss the autumn internationals after having a screw removed from the knee which needed a reconstruction last season. Harlequins boss Conor O'Shea said his side had paid the price for losing the kicking game in the rain. He said: 'We got stuck in the middle of the pitch and we did not deal with their kicking game. The only time we held on to the ball was when we scored. 'We did not play in the right areas of the pitch. That's the disappointing thing in conditions like that.

Garcia, who also won his singles contest against Jim Furyk, felt the whole week at Gleneagles Hotel was a success from start to finish. 'We always have such amazing teams,' he said. 'The chemistry we have between us is just amazing. 'I just feel so honoured and proud to be part of it. I couldn't think of nicer teams to be around in the team room, not only the players but the captain and vice-captains, the wives, everybody.' Garcia holds the trophy while world No 1 Rory McIlroy jokes around in the background . While for Garcia the victory was a fifth in seven Ryder Cup appearances, for Lee Westwood it was a seventh from nine. Westwood, who claimed two points with two foursomes victories to move to fourth on the all-time European points list, said: 'It's incredible. I'd love it to be every week. I'm sure I'd get tired but I'd love it every week. The European Ryder Cup team is dominant at the moment.' Westwood was also impressed with every aspect of McGinley's camp. 'I couldn't pick a fault with any point during the week,' the 41-year-old said.","Paul McGinley led Europe to victory over USA in Ryder Cup at Gleneagles .

"Brad Barritt has had enough of being pigeon-holed, so when he confronts England rival Billy Twelvetrees on Saturday afternoon, the Saracens centre will aim to tackle the perception that he is solely a defensive force. The 28-year-old has been cleared to play after missing last week’s defeat at Bath with a minor calf injury. It is no coincidence that in his absence, his club lost. Saracens were only beaten three times in the league phase of the Aviva Premiership last season and each time, Barritt was not on duty. He is the man who leads the line – setting the tone for the fabled ‘Wolf-pack’ defence. But that is not all he does, as he has shown in a barnstorming start to this season, notable for his dynamic ball-carrying. There is a clear sense that the England No 12 shirt remains up for grabs and Barritt is convinced he has the requisite all-round credentials. Brad Barritt (C) has made a storming start to the season playing an offensive role for Saracens . Barritt comes up against England rival Billy Twelvetrees (L) when Gloucester play Saracens on Saturday . While Kyle Eastmond received the Premiership Player of the Month award for his midfield feats on behalf of Bath, he was replaced at half-time during England’s last match, as they capitulated against the All Blacks in Hamilton. Gloucester captain Twelvetrees was dropped after a hit-and-miss display in Dunedin, while Luther Burrell was also demoted but is another strong inside centre option. Having made more appearances in that position than anyone else during Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach, Barritt is fed up with faint praise for his defensive work. ‘It is something I’m very proud of and it is a key component in a centre’s game, but it can be a bit of a frustration because my attacking contribution can often get over-looked because of what I do in defence,’ he said. ‘There have been numerous games where I’ve made a big contribution in attack, like Clermont last year – when I was involved in three assists for tries we scored. Going back to our (England) win over New Zealand in 2012, I contributed a try and an assist, and had numerous attacking involvements across the park. Kyle Eastmond (L) has been named Premiership Player of the Month but hasn't always performed for England . Barritt has played more games at centre under England coach Stuart Lancaster than any other player . ‘Ultimately, I will do whatever the job requires and that is my character; I will do whatever the team needs. But I do think I am very capable of providing that ball-carrying ability and distribution ability and acting as a second 10, as well as knuckling down when the team needs me. I feel like I’m in a good place in terms of my all-round role as a 12.’ Lancaster likes the principal of having two footballing backs who can act as playmakers, whether that is at 10 and 12 or 10 and 15. With that in mind, Barritt worked hard on the New Zealand tour to enhance his kicking game and believes the results are apparent. ‘We have scored a few tries from situations where I’ve put the ball on my foot and sent it behind the first line of defence,’ he said. ‘That is something I did at the end of last season against the Crusaders and it is something I spent a lot of time on the tour working on with Mike Catt and Andy Farrell. I put a lot of emphasis on it and it’s something I have definitely added to my game.’ Another string to his bow this season has been a stint as stand-in captain, while Alistair Hargreaves was out of action. ‘I have enjoyed it,’ said Barritt. ‘I pride myself on being ultra-competitive and being a leader. In difficult situations I like to think I’m a player who stands up.’ Barritt takes on Richie Gray during England's Six Nations clash with Scotland at Murrayfield . The Saracens centre would like to resurrect his midfield partnership with Leicester Tigers' Manu Tuilagi (C) He will relish Saturday's intriguing duel with Twelvetrees, the Gloucester captain and seek to harness a fervent desire to regain his status as a fixture in the England back line. ‘It is something I think about every day,’ he said. In the past, he has formed an effective midfield alliance with Manu Tuilagi and as the powerful Tiger is sure to feature at outside centre providing he is fit, Barritt is keen to resurrect their partnership, which was so instrumental in the record win over New Zealand two years ago. He remains in the coaches’ thoughts and he is hopeful about his autumn prospects. ‘There is still a huge amount to play for at 12,’ said Barritt. ‘It is a position where there have been injuries and different people have had opportunities. Guys have come in and come out of the team. The tour ended very positively for me, I had some great feedback from the coaches and I have started this season thinking it is an open door.’","Saracens centre believes he has the all-round game to be England's No 12 .

"A season of sensational firsts for jockey Paul Hanagan could end in the biggest of them all at Longchamp on Sunday afternoon. The Warrington-born dual champion will line up for the first time in the €5million Qatar Prix de L’Arc Triomphe on 6-1 second favourite Taghrooda confident there was an explanation for her only defeat behind Tapestry in the Yorkshire Oaks in August. The Liverpool-supporting rider will also be buoyed by a 2014 record which has seen Taghrooda provide him with wins in the Investec Oaks at Epsom and the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on his first rides in the pair of prestigious contests. Paul Hanagan has experience of riding Taghrooda, pictured at Ascot in August 2014 . Hanagan leaves the weighing room at Ascot in October 2014 . Taghrooda would become the first filly to win the Arc and King George in the same season and a more than satisfactory gallop last week at Newmarket’s Rowley Mile racecourse has convinced Hanagan that his John Gosden-trained mount is back in prime form. Hanagan said: ‘I never like to make excuses but she was just coming into season and that is pretty big. When I went for her she felt as if she just faltered. Newmarket did her the world of good. She rides like a colt and is built like one. It has been a wonderful season — to win the Arc would be the perfect end.’ Longchamp’s normally sparsely-populated lawns will be packed this afternoon with 60,000 spectators. About 5,000 Japanese among them will be hoping their trio — Just A Way, Gold Ship or Harp Star — can give them a first win after near-misses including second place for Orfevre for the last two years. The big worry for Hanagan, who landed the first Group One of his career at this meeting in 2010 with Richard Fahey’s Wootton Bassett in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere, is Taghrooda’s draw in wide stall 15. Treve won from there last year but she was the first to do so from a double-figure stall since Dalakhani (14) in 2003.

The sun shone at Longchamp yesterday and drying conditions are another negative in the argument that trainer Criquette Head-Maarek can turn around a disappointing season for 2013 winner Treve. Whether the narrow defeat by Cirrus Des Aigles in the Prix Ganay left its mark is debatable but the filly who was 2-1 to win back-to-back Arcs immediately 12 months ago is now 11-1 after other defeats at Royal Ascot, when she was injured, and last month’s Prix Vermeille. Treve is ridden by Thierry Jarnet not Frankie Dettori, leaving the Italian to ride Prix Foy winner Ruler of the World. But Prix Niel winner Ectot, the third of the trio of runners owned by Sheik Joaan Al Thani, looks the most likely to win under Gregory Benoist.","Paul Hanagan will line up on Taghrooda in the €5million Qatar Prix de L’Arc Triomphe on Sunday afternoon .

"South Korean president Park Geun-hye fired her press secretary this week after he was accused of sexually assaulting a young female Korean employee of the nation's embassy in a downtown Washington, D.C. hotel after drinking late into the evening on Tuesday night. The former spokesman, Yoon Chang-jung, was sent back to Seoul on Wednesday, while President Park and the rest of her delegation continued from Washington to Los Angeles. Korea's Yonhap News Agency, which first reported on Yoon's dismissal, obtained a copy of a report from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department which said the suspect 'grabbed her buttocks without her permission' between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. Tuesday. The Chosun Ilbo daily newspaper reported Friday morning that the alleged victim felt 'shame and humiliation' and called the police, but no arrest was made. Yoon Chang-jung, a now-former spokesman for South Korean President Park Geun-hye, was fired after he allegedly groped a female intern after a night of drinking at a Washington, D.C. hotel . South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the country's so-called 'Iron Lady' is the first woman to be elected to her nation's top government position, a circumstance that will bring even greater scrutiny on her spokesman, who was accused of sexual assault . While the police report Yonhap obtained did not include Yoon's name, a department spokesperson was responding to a request for information about a sexual assault involving a Korean official. The request specifically named 'Yoon Chang-jung.' Park, South Korea's first female president, was in the U.S. capital for a series of meetings and public appearances with President Barack Obama and other senior officials. Lee Nam-ki, a more senior presidential spokesman, confirmed Thursday during a briefing that a 'decision was made since it was determined that Yoon showed inappropriate conduct as a high-ranking official and . harmed the dignity of the nation by being personally involved in a disgraceful . event while accompanying President Park in her U.S. visit.' Other English translations rendered Lee's comments differently, addressing 'an unsavory incident.' While President Park met with California Gov. Jerry Brown (L) and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (R), press secretary Yoon Chang-jung was headed back to Seoul from Washington, alone and disgraced . Park Geun-hye met with Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the WHite House on Tuesday, just hours before her press aide allegedly groped a young female following a night of drinking . A spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said that MPD was 'investigating the report of a misdemeanor sexual abuse' but 'cannot comment further.' She did not immediately respond to a request for information about whether the Korean embassy had invoked diplomatic immunity on Yoon's behalf. Yonhap noted that critics from the opposition Democratic Party had accused Yoon of being unfit for presidential spokesman duty. A former political columnist, he worked for Park's transition team before joining her administration and was known for a confrontational and provocative writing style as a journalist. Several other nominees to top posts in the Park government have withdrawn their names from consideration in connection with ethics scandals, including some allegations of tax evasion and unethical real estate speculation. South Korea's embassy in Washington (L) was home-base for the extended summit between Park and Obama, leading the embassy to hire temporary staff - including the alleged young female victim. Park's visit to Washington culminated with an address before a special joint session of Congress . Yoon's alleged victim is reportedly a Korean-American in her 20s who was hired on a temporary basis to assist the embassy with Park's visit. Kim Kwan-young, the principal spokesman for Korea's Democratic Party, publicly asked President Park on Friday for a formal apology. She and her administration 'should deeply reflect on their appointment of the wrong personnel and apologize to the people,' Kim said. Park's Saenuri Party expressed 'regret.' 'I hope that the mistake of one individual does not cloud all the achievements of President Park's visit to the United States,"" said Saenuri spokeswoman Rep. Min Hyun-joo .

"Euro record-breaker Robbie Keane reckons the Republic of Ireland are 'playing Germany at a good time' in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday night. Germany suffered a shock defeat by Poland on Saturday night, and Keane said: 'They are the World Cup winners but a few players have since retired and a few others are injured. Will that make a big difference? I'm not too sure. I hope it does but I think we are in a better place going there than we were before. 'To have six points going into the Germany game gives the players a lot of confidence. I believe we can go there and get something from the game.' The Republic of Ireland's Robbie Keane seals his hat-trick against Gibraltar from the penalty spot . The Republic of Ireland take on World Cup holders Germany in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday evening . Germany's Thomas Muller (centre) appears dejected after Poland's first goal during their 2-0 defeat in Warsaw . After his third Irish hat-trick, and his quickest, in the 7-0 thrashing of Gibraltar on Saturday, Keane, who scored three goals in the first 18 minutes, spoke of how he puts the team first now, compared to his teenage days. 'As you get older, you appreciate that it's about the team more. When you're young, you're hungry and a lot more selfish,' said the Irish captain. Keane's first Irish goals of 2014 were timely. 'You are judged by scoring goals. It's the most important thing for any striker, to score goals and get your confidence up,' he said. With 65 goals, Keane is joint 14th on the list of all-time international scorers; and fifth in Europe behind Ferenc Puskas (84 goals), Sandor Kocsis (75), Miroslav Klose (71) and Gerd Muller (68). In the Euro qualifiers, Keane is out on his own with a record 21 goals, the same number the previous holder, Niall Quinn, managed in total for Ireland. Keane, pictured leaving the Aviva Stadium pitch with the match ball, is confident ahead of facing Germany . Winger James McClean celebrates scoring the first of his two goals against Gibraltar at the Aviva stadium . 'It's nice to have it (Euro record) but I will forget about it and focus now on Tuesday's game,' he said. When Keane first burst on to the Irish scene in 1998, Quinn predicted his fellow Dubliner would go on to score 50 goals for Ireland; by coincidence, Keane eclipsed Quinn's Irish 21-goal mark 10 years ago on Monday. Keane has pep in his step after surgery on his heels at the end of last year to cure a nagging achilles problem. 'I feel great, I struggled for two years with the achilles injury and it's just nice to play a game and not come off being hardly able to walk. And then wake up in the morning struggling to walk.' With Irish manager Martin O'Neill leaning towards a 'horses for courses' strategy, there are no guarantees that Saturday's star performers will start against Germany, including Keane. 'It's important that everybody is ready because you never know when you are going to be called upon,' he said.","Germany suffered a surprise 2-0 defeat to Poland on Saturday .

"Sebastian Coe has questioned the nomination of former drugs cheat Justin Gatlin as one of the IAAF's athletes of the year and said he is convinced by research that steroid users can benefit from usage long after they are declared 'clean'. New findings from the University of Oslo states athletes who take anabolic steroids can retain the advantage of muscle development even decades later. Gatlin, from the United States, has run the three fastest times this year in the 100 metres, and the fastest times in the 100 metres and 200 metres ever by a man in his 30s. IAAF vice-president Seb Coe has questioned Justin Gatlin's nomination for the IAAF Athlete of the year . The 32-year-old 2004 Olympic 100m champion Gatlin tested positive in 2006 for excess testosterone and was banned for four years until 2010. Gatlin's nomination last weekend as one of the IAAF's male athletes saw another nominee, Germany's Olympic discus champion Robert Harting, asking for his own name to be removed. Lord Coe, an IAAF vice-president said he also had 'big problems' with the nomination. Speaking at the Securing Sport conference in London he said: 'The only thing I would say is that he is entitled to be competing. I'm not particularly comfortable about it. I think you'd be pretty surprised if I did sit here and was sanguine about that. 'I personally have big problems with that. Justin Gatlin (left) powers ahead during the IAAF Diamond League Athletics meeting at Lausanne in July . 'I have long since believed that, particularly anabolic steroids, but performance-enhancing, muscle-developing drugs, have a long-term effect. 'I don't wish to be dismissive about the Oslo research but I think anybody in the last 20 years that I've known in that world, particularly in sports physiology and biochemistry would tell you that's certainly the case. 'The effect is certainly not transient and we've seen that in the performance of athletes for some time.' Coe is also chairman of the British Olympic Association but he accepted there was no going back to the days of its lifetime ban for drugs cheats. Gatlin (right) attempts to chase down Usain Bolt as the American claimed bronze at London 2012 . 'I recognise legally and for all sorts of reasons that that particular train has left the station,' he said. 'A life ban, we know from all sorts of challenges, can't be upheld. 'We pushed very hard within the IAAF to get the WADA ban from two years back up to four years. 'I do think sanctions do have to take into consideration the extended effect that anabolic steroids, performance-enhancing drugs, can have on a career even when the athlete is 'clean'.' Coe added that he will stand for the presidency of the IAAF next year - current incumbent Lamine Diack has said he will step down. Coe said: 'I've always been clear, if I'm given the opportunity to shape the future of my sport, I will certainly take it. 'If there is a presidential election, I will want to stand for that.' Professor of physiology at the University of Oslo Kristen Gunderson and his team studied the effect of steroids on mice and believes that the same mechanism is at work in human muscles and that other performance-enhancing drugs would have similar long-term effects. Gatlin in 2006, the year he was was banned for a maximum of eight years by the US Anti-Doping Agency . Gunderson told BBC Sport: 'I would be very surprised if there were any major differences between humans and mice in this context. 'The fundamental biology of muscle growth is similar in humans and in mice, and in principle any drug that builds muscle mass could trigger this mechanism. 'I think it is likely that effects could be lifelong or at least lasting decades in humans. Our data indicates the exclusion time of two years is far too short. Even four years is too short.' Thirty-two-year-old American Gatlin served a four-year ban after appeal to arbitration and - after his return to the sport in 2010 - he ran the fastest 100 metres in the world in this year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the Memorial van Damme in Brussels last month. Dai Greene (centre) says Gatlin's phenomenal times this year suggest the steroids he took still have an effect . But British 400 metres hurdles champion Dai Greene said: 'He's over the hill as far as sprinting is concerned - he should never be running these times for the 100m and 200m. 'But he's still doing it, and you have to look at his past, and ask how it is still affecting him now, because the average person wouldn't be able to do that. 'Those are incredible performances. Not many people have run that fast separately, ever. To do it on a damp Friday night? I couldn't believe those times. 'It shows one of two things: either he's still taking performance-enhancing drugs to get the best out of him at his advanced age, or the ones he did take are still doing a fantastic job. 'Because there is no way he can still be running that well at this late point in his career. Gatlin  celebrates winning the men's 100m sprint   in Rieti, Italy in September to continue his superb year . 'After having years on the sidelines, being unable to train or compete, it doesn't really add up. 9.77 is an incredibly fast time. You only have to look at his performances. I don't believe in them.' The new data casts a further shadow over formerly-banned athletes such as Gatlin, his compatriot Tyson Gay and Britain's Dwain Chambers. In his defence, Gatlin's agent Renaldo Nehemiah said: 'Justin would have run these times, and faster, had his over-zealous (former) coach Trevor Graham not tried to get him there sooner than he would've naturally gotten there. 'So, what Justin is doing right now, I'm not surprised by that. 'His body is rested for four years, so he wasn't racing. And he was the talent that I always knew he was.'

"The gloves worn by Muhammad Ali in his 1971 fight with Joe Frazier have been sold for £237,000. An anonymous bidder bought the gloves at an auction in Cleveland, Ohio. The bout, dubbed ‘The Fight of the Century’, saw Frazier beat Ali by a unanimous decision to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion. At the time, Frazier was the heavyweight world champion, a title that had been stripped from Ali four years previously after he was banned from boxing for refusing to enlist in the Vietnam draft. History: The gloves were used by the boxing hero when he took to the ring against Frazier in March 1971 . Memorable: Ali suffered his first professional defeat at the hands of Smokin Joe Frazier (left) After successfully fighting a five-year prison term handed down in 1967, Ali had been granted a license to box again in late 1970 and set his career back on track with easy wins against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena. The victories paved the way for his first fight against reigning champ Frazier, once a friend but now a bitter enemy. Ali viewed Frazier as the poster boy for the pro-Vietnam movement and the two exchanged increasingly barbed words in the run-up to the fight. Frazier was the most intimidating fighter at the time and the match, in New York's Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1971, was one of the most anticipated in the sport's history. The two boxers unleashed their animosity towards one another in the ring but it was Frazier who emerged on top and after Ali was floored in the 15th round the bout was awarded to Frazier. It was Ali's first ever professional . loss and set the stage for a thrilling rematch against Frazier in New . York in 1974 and the series decider, the Thrilla in Manilla, the . following year, both of which Ali won. Hefty: The gloves fetched £237,000 from an anonymous bidder at auction in Cleveland, Ohio . Following the 1971 fight Ali's gloves were cut off his wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012. The sweat-stained Everlast gloves, in good condition but with signs of discolouring where the tape was, were then purchased by a private collector. Experts have tipped them to fetch upwards of 300,000 pounds when they go under the hammer in the Heritage Auctions sale in Cleveland, Ohio. And they could challenge the current world record for boxing memorabilia set in February this year when a pair of Ali's gloves from his 1964 heavyweight victory against Sonny Liston sold for 540,000 pounds. Back then: New York's Madison Square Garden hosted the fight on March 8, 1971 . Included in the sale is a signed letter from Angelo Dundee confirming the provenance of the gloves. Chris Ivy, director of sports at Heritage, said: 'These gloves represent so much more than just a sporting moment in history. 'They were the tools of one of the greatest ever sportsmen but they also represent a pivotal point in Ali's career. 'Both he and Frazier were undefeated when they stepped into the ring together for their first fight in March 1971 so there was a lot riding on it and a lot of hype surrounding it. 'There were strong political overtones too - Frazier was seen as being part of the pro-Vietnam establishment while Ali had refused the draft due to his religious views. Safe keeping: The gloves remained with his trainer Angelo Dundee until his death in 2012 . 'All this sent people into a frenzy and led to an epic battle that lasted the full 15 rounds. 'Ali lost the fight but it laid the groundwork for two rematches which are now legendary. 'You can definitely tell the gloves have taken some punishment but they are in pretty good condition. 'There is every chance that the sale of these gloves could break the world record that was set last year - they are just as significant.' The auction will take place on July 31.","The gloves were used by Muhammad Ali when he took to the ring against Joe Frazier in March 1971 .

"Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has described how the club dug their heels in and refused to sell him during the summer after parting with five of their stars. The French international had hoped to secure a move to Tottenham after former Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino attempted to take him with him to White Hart Lane. The south coast club turned down Spurs' advances, leaving Schneiderlin unhappy that he had not been allowed to follow Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers out of St Mary's.

Schneiderlin, pictured in training with France, was angry that Southampton did not sell him to Tottenham . Adam Lallana (right), pictured in action for Liverpool against West Brom, was one of five players sold by Southampton during the summer transfer window . Speaking to France Football, Schneiderlin said: 'I told them I signed for a project that was supposed to keep the best elements to go higher. And before that meeting, Lallana, Lovren, Lambert, Luke Shaw and Chambers all left. 'I asked myself: ""That is not the same situation anymore, that is not possible. What are they doing?"" At that moment, Southampton didn't hire anyone yet. Chambers signed at Arsenal the day before our meeting.' The 24-year-old believes the club's stance on selling players changed as supporters became increasingly frustrated with seeing their best individuals sold to the highest bidder.

"Arsene Wenger will be hoping for 12th time lucky on Sunday when he faces nemesis Jose Mourinho of Chelsea. The stats make unhappy reading for north London. Arsenal’s Wenger has lost six, drawn five, scored six and conceded 19 against his arch rival. The wait for a first win goes on. And while the match takes centre stage, stand by for the usual sub-plot between the warring pair. For there is no doubt that Mourinho knows exactly how to get under the skin of Wenger and appears to relish the opportunity to do so. Sportsmail looks at the longest managerial feud in the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: Record against Jose Mourinho counts for nothing . Jose Mourinho lurks behind Arsene Wenger on the Wembley touchline during the 2005 Community Shield . Where it all began . A decade ago Mourinho was the brash new boy who refused to kow-tow to anyone, especially the establishment. In the summer of 2005 the outspoken Portuguese suggested the fixture list was arranged to favour Arsenal and within a month Wenger was questioning Chelsea’s negative tactics. War was declared. Mourinho’s quote at the time: ‘Some clubs are treated as devils, some are treated as angels. I don’t think we are so ugly that we should be seen as the devil and I don’t think Arsene Wenger and David Dein are so beautiful that they should be seen as angels.’ Wenger’s dig: ‘We live in a world where we only have winners and losers but once a sport encourages teams who refuse to take the initiative, the sport is in danger.’ The pair watch on as Arsenal face Chelsea back in December 2005 - Chelsea won the League that year . Chelsea won two consecutive titles in Mourinho first two seasons at Stamford Bridge . The ‘voyeur’ moment . Of all the verbal rows between Wenger and Mourinho, this is the one which will never be forgotten. The Arsenal manager had criticised Chelsea’s big spending in the autumn of 2005 and Mourinho responded furiously, labelling his rival a ‘voyeur’ and accusing him of being obsessed with Chelsea. Mourinho said: ‘He is one of these people who is a voyeur. He likes to watch other people. There are some guys who, when they are at home, have a big telescope to see what happens in other families. He speaks, speaks, speaks, speaks about Chelsea.’ Wenger hit back: ‘I find it out of order, disconnected with reality and disrespectful. When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent.’ Final word to Mourinho: ‘We have a file of quotes from Mr Wenger about Chelsea in the last 12 months – it is not a file of five pages, it’s a file of 120 pages.’ The pair come to blows in February 2007 as Mourinho grabs a hold of Arsenal utility man Emmanuel Eboue . Valentine’s Day massacre . Back in February, Chelsea were one point clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League table and the ceasefire between Wenger and Mourinho was shattered after the Arsenal manager suggested his opposite number was afraid of failure. Mourinho hit back: ‘He’s a specialist in failure. If he is right and I am afraid of failure it is because I didn’t fail many times. Eight years without silverware, that’s failure.’ One month on and with Wenger’s 1,000th game on the agenda, Mourinho was offered the chance to retract but declined. Statistics do not lie . Over the years Wenger has beaten most managers but the Jose jinx continues and the form book would place Chelsea as the favourites on Sunday. A quirk of the fixture list meant that Arsenal played their London rivals on Wenger’s 500th and 1,000th game and Mourinho emerged victorious both times. Last season’s landmark occasion was ruined for Wenger as Chelsea thrashed his side 6-0 having conceded twice in the first seven minutes through Samuel Eto’o and Andre Schurrle. Kieran Gibbs (left) is wrongly sent off in March as Chelsea thrash Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge . Eden Hazard scored from the spot after an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handball – Kieran Gibbs was sent off in a case of mistaken identity – and 10-man Arsenal crumbled. Oscar scored twice with the last goal from sub Mohamed Salah. Absolutely Fabregas . The summer of 2014 saw a fresh battleground as former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas joined Chelsea in a £30million move from Barcelona. Mourinho insisted that returning to the Emirates was ‘not an option’ because the Spaniard ‘really wanted to come to Chelsea’. Wenger responded: ‘People came out and said he wanted to go to Chelsea but I don’t know who tells the truth here or not.’ Cesc Fabregas listens to his mentor Arsene Wenger back in February 2011 . Fabregas has a stroll with his new manager Mourinho at Chelsea's training ground last week . Back-handed compliments . Mourinho was asked to say something about Wenger’s 1,000 game landmark earlier this year but only succeeded in muddying the waters further. He said: ‘I admire him and I admire Arsenal because it’s not possible to have 1,000 matches unless the club is also a fantastic club in the way they support the manager, especially in the bad moments – and especially when the bad moments were quite a lot. So I admire the manager and I admire the club.’ Sniper’s alley . It does not seem to matter whether Mourinho is at Chelsea or not for the pair to start scrapping. The Portuguese was out of work when he once again turned his attention to Wenger in 2008 and said: ‘The English like statistics a lot. Do they know that Arsene Wenger has only 50 per cent of wins in the English league?’ A couple of years later Wenger was calling for punishment when it appeared Mourinho’s Real Madrid had got their own players, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos, deliberately sent off at Ajax. Wenger said: ‘There should be sanctions. It gives a bad image of our game. Think, “Never do that again” because it looks, frankly, horrible.’ Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.","Chelsea face Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Sunday at 2.05pm .

"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain believes England could benefit from having a core of players from a handful of top clubs, as seen with Spain and Germany in recent years. Both countries boasted a strong axis formed around individuals from two of their best clubs when they won the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, respectively. A similar situation now appears to be building in the Three Lions set-up, with nine of the current 21-strong squad playing for either for Liverpool or Arsenal. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, one of five Arsenal players in the England squad, in action against San Marino . Roy Hodgson is pleased to see a group of Arsenal players forcing their way into his plans for Euro 2016 . Danny Welbeck celebrates scoring against San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night . There are four players from Anfield in the side right now, whereas the Gunners' quintet all began the second half of Thursday's 5-0 defeat of San Marino together after Oxlade-Chamberlain came off the bench. The midfielder's introduction helped up the tempo and underlined the strong bond with his club team-mates, like when he provided the assist for Danny Welbeck just minutes after the break. 'When you do get to play week in, week out with team-mates and then bring that to international football, just knowing each other, off the pitch and on it, does really help in gelling the team together,' Oxlade-Chamberlain said. 'The Germans and the Spanish they've been able to do that. Spain have a big influence from Real Madrid and Barcelona and when you go and watch Spain play it's almost like watching Barcelona or Real Madrid play at times, with the number of players on the pitch. 'It is a nice thing to have that with Arsenal at the moment. Liverpool have got a good number of players as well. 'It's not just those two clubs, everyone who comes away really does gel in well with the team and helps us to hopefully be successful and do well.' Germany started with six Bayern Munich players as they won the World Cup final against Argentina . Spain's starting XI in the Euro 2012 final was made up of nine players from  Real Madrid and Barcelona . Oxlade-Chamberlain says there is a 'really nice feel' to the squad right now, despite the hangover from England's dismal World Cup having yet to fully subside. The Arsenal midfielder could only watch on helplessly in Brazil after missing the tournament through knee ligament damage sustained in the warm-up clash with Ecuador. 'I guess all I can do is try and make up for lost time,' Oxlade-Chamberlain said. 'I did get a lot of experience out of that. It was a disappointing experience for me personally on the injury front and obviously on the bigger scale, as well for the nation. 'I know what we're playing for again in this qualifying campaign and it does give you the bit between the teeth to try and really push on and keep yourself fit, keep yourself in and about, playing as much as football as possible. 'It's really nice to be in good form - touch wood, I don't want to jinx myself with injuries. 'It's nice to feel good at the moment. I feel fresh and it's important to keep myself that way so I can help the team progress.' Oxlade-Chamberlain will be hoping his display against San Marino could see him start Sunday's qualifier in Estonia, a match few are expecting Hodgson's men to fall short in. That only fuels former England Under-21s manager Stuart Pearce's belief that eligible players like Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere should be playing for the Young Lions, if Gareth Southgate wants them. Callum Chambers was 'loaned' to the Under 21s for this week's two-legged Euro play-off with Croatia . Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker (centre), pictured in training with England's Under 21 squad, was given the chance to train with the senior squad by Hodgson . Luke Shaw and Chambers were, in Hodgson's words, 'loaned' to the Under 21s for this week's two-legged European Championship play-off with Croatia, only for injury to see the latter bumped back up to the senior squad. 'Why did I come over here?' Oxlade-Chamberlain said with a laugh when asked about the hot potato subject. 'That's a tricky question to answer, obviously. It's for the England manager to put his views on that. 'If he's got boys in the England squad and wants them in and around the England squad that's his choice. 'If he wants to advise them to go and play for the Under 21s then again that's his choice. That's all I can say on that matter.'","Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere all started in the 5-0 win against San Marino .

"Displacing Daniel Sturridge up front for England is not something Danny Welbeck is thinking about ahead of the European Championship qualifier in Estonia. A thigh injury suffered on Three Lions duty last month has ruled Sturridge out of Liverpool's last seven matches, as well as this week's Euro 2016 qualifiers. The 25-year-old's setback also meant he had to be replaced in the starting line-up to face Switzerland, giving Welbeck a rare chance as striker from the outset. Danny Welbeck, one of five Arsenal players in the England squad, celebrates scoring against San Marino . Daniel Sturridge was injured during an England training session at St George's Park . It was an opportunity he grasped, after scoring twice to secure a 2-0 win in Basle before netting four goals for new club Arsenal, as well as a close-range strike in the 5-0 defeat of San Marino on Thursday. Welbeck is likely to get another start up front in Estonia, but the chance to put himself above Sturridge in the pecking order is not something he is thinking about. 'No, because I have been in squads with Daniel Sturridge before and we have played in different positions,' he said. 'There is me, Daniel, Wayne [Rooney] and Raheem [Sterling] as well and all the other forward players, so you can't just say this is the opportunity to make my mark. 'Whoever is in the squad I am going to try my best in every single game and training. Roy Hodgson is pleased to see a group of Arsenal players forcing their way into his plans for Euro 2016 . Danny Welbeck is likely to start against Estonia in the absence of injured Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge . 'Playing as a centre forward and getting into those goal-scoring opportunities it becomes much easier.' England had to remain patient to find their way through the defence-minded San Marinese and are likely to have to do the same in Tallinn on Sunday. 'It's a quick turnaround,' Welbeck said of the Estonia trip. 'We have to travel out there and recover well as a team. 'We need to be prepared physically, mentally and tactically for the game. 'It's not going to be similar to San Marino and being away from home Estonia are going to try and win the game, but so are we.'

"I was made a scapegoat... and Flower wanted a team of Boy Scouts . 'Big Cheese' Prior was a schoolyard bully . The day Trott told Prior to 'f*** off' I didn't tell South Africans how to get Strauss out . Kevin Pietersen has accused Andy Flower of ‘treating me like something stuck to the sole of his shoe’ from the outset of his reign as England coach. The former England batsman is unsparing about his Zimababwean adversary in his book KP: The Autobiography, which was released on Monday. Pietersen, who had sought to have Flower sacked as assistant coach at the same time as Peter Moores was first ousted, believes that the man who turned out to be England’s most successful supremo was a control freak who was after him from the beginning. Kevin Pietersen (left) sits next to Andy Flower, the man he called the 'Mood Hoover' in 2012 . The problems between them began when Flower was appointed as caretaker successor to Moores on the England tour to West Indies in the early spring of 2009. While insisting that he conducted himself as the model professional, Pietersen accuses his coach of ‘looking to pick a fight’ by demanding that he showed a look of greater interest when other people were talking at team meetings. 'With Flower it was always about control,' alleges the South-African born batsman. He accuses him of wanting to ‘neutralise’ him as the team’s most talented player and ‘keep me on the periphery until such time as he was ready to show me the door’. Pietersen hits Flower, much respected by many others who played under him, with a stream of invective in the book, describing him as ‘contagiously sour’ and ‘infectiously dour’, saying that he was the kind of man who could walk into a room and suck the life out of it. He calls him the ‘Mood Hoover’ and adds that the only time he felt really happy and appreciated in the England set up was under Duncan Fletcher and Michael Vaughan, who masterminded the 2005 Ashes triumph. Flower makes a point to Pietersen last summer but the batsman said the former coach 'treated him like dirt' Pietersen details how Flower banned the traditional touring fines meetings on that tour of the Caribbean, when over a beer players would bond and tease each other about their shortcomings, because it made some of the management team uncomfortable. He puts this down, again, to Flower not feeling entirely in control of the situation. While admitting that he occasionally saw glimpses of a Flower that he – and it should be said numerous others - found more appealing, he describes the coach as being ‘f***ing horrendous’ 95 per cent of the time. It must be emphasised that plenty who played under Flower would disagree with Pietersen’s opinion of a man who won three Ashes series as a coach and showed tremendous personal courage in his stand against Robert Mugabe with Henry Olonga during the 2003 World Cup. The antagonistic nature of their relationship is a thread that runs through the whole book as the batsman places the blame for many of his woes as an England player at the door of the Zimbabwean. Pietersen points the finger at Flower during a nets session at The Oval in 2011 . He does not rate him as a technical coach, and is very critical of the way he felt Flower allowed a group of bowlers to form themselves into a clique that alienated others, Pietersen more than anyone. The hurt that the batsman felt over the Twitter account that continually teased him is something he believes that Flower should have stopped, and he connects the state of mind it put him in directly to the ‘Textgate’ incident involving Andrew Strauss. He actually accuses Flower of trying to prolong the whole Textgate affair at one point, and describes the ‘torture’ that he thinks the management put him through as part of the reintegration process that led to him getting back in the team. Another failing, he maintains, was allowing Jonathan Trott’s problems to get out of hand before he had to fly home from the disastrous Ashes tour in Australia. Pietersen believes that Flower was obsessed with his legacy being ruined by that dreadful winter, and was like ‘a deer in the headlights’ during the 5-0 drubbing. Another crime of the coach was his closeness to Matt Prior, who also bears the brunt of his most coruscating observations. Graeme Swann, Nick Knight and, quite gratuitously, batsman James Taylor, are among others who do not escape the sharp end of his tongue. The neediness of Pietersen does show through in some of this analysis, like when he got upset that Flower did not want to join Alastair Cook in having a beer to celebrate the batsman’s landmark of making 8,000 Test runs. He even accuses him of smiling on one occasion when informing the player that he was being dropped. There was doubtless some blame on both sides, and Flower may want to give an equally comprehensive account of his version of events, which might differ considerably. It clearly goes way beyond the professional and is a very personal enmity. For all their talents, achievements and attributes as people and cricketers, it is clear that these two were never destined to get on, to put it mildly.

"Read Pietersen's forthright views on Andy Flower and his team of 'Boy Scouts' And his opinion of 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior . I did not text South Africans ways to dismiss Strauss, says Pietersen . Kevin Pietersen has detailed how the England dressing room quickly deteriorated into a clique-ridden unit in which the mild-mannered Jonathan Trott told team-mate Matt Prior to 'f*** off'. The atmosphere soured when Andy Flower took over as coach and divisions developed between batsmen and bowlers, says Pietersen. In his book, KP: The Autobiography, he tells of how the situation got so bad in Bangladesh in 2010 that it led to Trott losing his temper and shouting abuse at Prior and Graeme Swann on the pitch before a bemused opposition. Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott during the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in November 2013 . Trott (left), Prior (centre) and Kevin Pietersen in the nets on the tour of Bangladesh in 2010 . He describes how the introverted James Anderson liked to attach himself to extroverts, and fell upon Swann, a ‘loudmouth’, who was ‘the one who picked on players’. Pietersen says that the batsmen such as Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Alastair Cook, Eoin Morgan and a young Joe Root were men who would not say ‘boo to a goose’, who took stick from their team-mates on a daily basis. The continual ridicule and rollockings from the bowlers and wicketkeeper finally made Trott snap when he was fielding at deep square leg during the Test match against Bangladesh. According to Pietersen he ‘cracked’ and started shouting 'Will you f*** off? Who the f*** do you think you are?' Pietersen sympathised with the Warwickshire player and accuses the dressing room of ‘quietly isolating’ him (Pietersen), blaming Flower for not creating a more inclusive atmosphere. Prior, whom Pietersen dubs 'the Big Cheese', is highly criticised in the book. The nickname was given, according to the author, because Prior was 'a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie'.

"Manchester United were always masters of the late show. They were the team that never gave up until the final whistle, often scoring last-gasp goals that snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, they made an art form of it, winning innumerable Premier League games, Cup ties and even the Champions League through their never-say-die spirit. Opponents would always have that nagging doubt in the back of their minds as the clock ticked ever-more-slowly down. When would the onslaught come? Did they have the resolve to hold out? VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: My attacking players must have more discipline . Falcao celebrates his winner against Everton on 62 minutes, the latest United have scored this season . Louis van Gaal's team have not scored after the 62 minute mark so far this season . Sir Alex Ferguson's United team made an art form out of scoring in the latter stages of matches . Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's stoppage time goal won United the Champions League in 1999 . But all that seems consigned to history - none of United's 13 goals this season have come after the 62 minute mark. Radamel Falcao's winner against Everton on Sunday came just after the hour - but that is the latest they've scored so far this season. By contrast, they have conceded eight goals beyond 62 minutes, including four at Leicester in the league and three at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

Courtesy of Opta . Louis van Gaal's team seem to have lost the knack of scoring late in games, something that is quite alarming considering their porous defence. Compare this season to the last 10 under Sir Alex Ferguson - 468 goals were scored between minutes 0 and 62, while 296 came between minutes 63 and the final whistle. So during Ferguson's last decade at Old Trafford, 38.7 per cent of goals came in the final 27 minutes of games plus that indefinite added period known as 'Fergie Time'. The late show reached its height in the 2009-2010 season when 39 of United's 86 Premier League goals - or 45 per cent - came after 63 minutes. United had even retained the knack of scoring late goals under David Moyes last season. It wasn't quite the dying seconds smash-and-grab raids of Ferguson's era but 21 of their 64 league goals came after 63 minutes. Unless Van Gaal's fearsome front line can ensure every match is wrapped up by the hour mark, it is essential they rediscover that characteristic Man United ability to keep going until the bitter end.","Manchester United have yet to score later than the 62-minute mark under Louis van Gaal this season .

"Radamel Falcao glanced over and, seeing his number was up, started trotting over in the direction of the dug-outs. As one, Old Trafford stood to rapturously acclaim their new hero. The Colombian was up and running, off the mark for Manchester United with, they all hoped, the first of many, many goals for the club. And history suggests we'll be seeing many more of these ovations in the remaining months of the season. Radamel Falcao opened his scoring account for Manchester United with the winner against Everton on Sunday . It took the on-loan Colombian striker until 62 minutes into his fourth match for Man United to get off the mark . Falcao was in the right place to divert a mis-hit Angel Di Maria shot past Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard . Louis van Gaal shakes Falcao's hand after he is replaced by James Wilson in the 73rd minute . For Falcao specialises in gluts of goals. Wherever he has played, he's scored. And when the goals start to flow, they really start to flow. Falcao is a binge goalscorer. It takes just one goal to get him going and it could then be weeks and weeks before there's a game in which he fails to find the net. His match-winner against Everton was a little fortunate. Angel Di Maria's mis-hit shot came directly to his feet and then instinct took over for a close-range finish. But that's all he needs and he departed the action for James Wilson on 73 minutes with the loud cheers ringing in his ears. Louis van Gaal knows all about Falcao's record and will now expect another glut to begin when United travel to West Brom after the international break. Falcao takes a backwards glance to ensure he wasn't offside before wheeling away in celebration . The United fans have already taken the prolific Colombian striker to their hearts . 'He needed that goal,' the Dutchman said afterwards. 'He is a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long. 'I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.' Van Gaal has every reason to expect fireworks. At the start of last season, Falcao went on a sequence of seven goals in seven matches for Monaco. The season before, when at Atletico Madrid, there was a sensational spree of 13 goals in eight games at the beginning of the season and another of seven goals in eight towards the end. During 2011-2012, his run of 12 goals in 12 matches in a hectic March and April helped Atletico to Europa League glory. Falcao celebrates a goal for his parent club Monaco in a Ligue 1 match against Nantes back in August . The striker slides across the turf after scoring for Atletico Madrid in the 2012 Europa League final . Falcao is right at the centre of Porto's celebrations after they beat Braga to win the Europa League in 2011 . Falcao scored 18 times en route to Europa League glory that season, including this one against Villarreal . Some of the striker's best sequences: . MONACO . 2013-2014: 7 goals in 7 games . ATLETICO MADRID . 2012-2013: 13 in 8 . 2011-2012: 12 in 12 . PORTO . 2010-2011: 16 in 9 . 2009-2010: 8 in 9 . And in his debut season for Porto, in 2009-2010, a sequence of eight goals in nine matches early on helped establish him as a hero. The following year, his incredible haul of 16 goals in nine outings during the run-in helped Porto to a league and Europa League double. Falcao is capable of scorching sequences of scoring and everyone of a United persuasion will hope he's about to embark on another. In fact, the international fortnight could have come at an inconvenient time as the striker seeks to build his momentum. Falcao's goals will be needed as United attempt to keep up with Premier League pace-setters Chelsea. With Wayne Rooney suspended for the next two matches and Robin van Persie not in the best of form, they need Falcao to put them away. His track record suggests they won't be disappointed.

"The captain who tipped a young Kevin Pietersen’s kitbag out of the dressing room window in frustration at his young charge’s behaviour has described his former team-mate as the ‘most gifted but difficult’ player he ever led. Jason Gallian’s irritation with a 23-year-old Pietersen boiled over in 2003 when he was Nottinghamshire captain, and the young star threatened to leave his first English county in protest at his mentor Clive Rice being sacked as coach. ‘Playing with Kevin was a real privilege,’ Gallian said. ‘What he could do to bowlers to single-handedly win you the game was frightening. Kevin Pietersen was the 'most gifted but difficult' player, says the controversial cricketer's former captain . Pietersen has fallen out with plenty of big names in cricket wherever he has played over the years . ‘I saw him destroy Shane Warne at Hampshire to the extent he had to take himself off after three overs. You couldn’t help but think “this guy is special”. ‘But I never got as frustrated with anyone as I did with Kevin. For it to get to that situation [with the kit bag] wasn’t right. Probably from both sides. I can empathise with Alastair Cook. ‘He’s a very amenable bloke and if he has fallen out with Kevin it just demonstrates the world that Kevin wants to live in.’ Jason Gallian (pictured) was irritated with Pietersen in 2003 when the former was Nottinghamshire captain .","Jason Gallian admits it was a 'privilege' to play with Kevin Pietersen when he was Nottinghamshire captain but he says it was very difficult .

"Kevin Pietersen’s much anticipated autobiography is published on Monday and English cricket waits to see the extent of his score-settling at the end of a chequered international career. Yet KP seems intent on avoiding difficult questioning, with no press conference planned for the cricketing media and one-on-one interviews being refused, even to the likes of respected BBC correspondent Jonathan Agnew. Here, cricket correspondent Paul Newman asks the questions that, with respect to Graham Norton and the presenters of Blue Peter, he is unlikely to face. Why have you fallen out throughout your career with significant people wherever you have played — a pattern that began in your native South Africa, carried on in English club cricket with Cannock and continued at Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and, it is suggested now, Surrey? Most significantly, of course, there is England. Andy Flower, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Peter Moores and Matt Prior, to name but five, are all good, team-oriented people who have the best interests of English cricket very much in their hearts. Can they all be wrong and you be right? Why is it always you? Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography is published on Monday and English cricket eagerly awaits its release . English cricket is waiting to see the extent of his score-settling at the end of a chequered international career . And just what has happened at Surrey? The bottom line is that you have been released and there is very little prospect of you playing at The Oval next year. Yet a magnificent piece of spinning in a Pietersen-friendly paper last week suggested that it is all a ploy to dash the hopes of the bad old ECB to fine you. Pull the other one, Kevin. If you had scored more runs or shown any enthusiasm for county cricket, maybe played the odd first-class match, your argument that you want to play for England again would have some substance. As it is, it seems even your old mentor Graham Ford has been frustrated at your lack of desire to work at your batting this year. And what about the suggestion that you have somehow won the ‘PR battle’ this season? If so, why did large sections of the sell-out crowd at Edgbaston for Twenty20 finals day roundly boo you while treating your old adversary Andrew Flintoff, for instance, as a returning hero? More pertinently, Cook has had complete support at every ground he has played throughout the summer, most notably at the Ageas Bowl where he received standing ovations when he went out to bat and when he was undefeated in the 40s at lunch. Yes, there was sympathy in January at the way it all ended for a player who touched greatness but that was quickly dissipated by your willingness to allow Piers Morgan to be your mouthpiece. You sitting there with Morgan at Lord’s while he tweeted about Cook being ‘a weasel’ was a low point. Pietersen has been released and there is very little prospect of him playing at The Oval next year . Pietersen bats for Surrey during a T20 Blast match against Essex Eagles at The Oval in June 2014 . Sportsmail revealed Pietersen sent derogatory messages to South African opponents about Andrew Strauss . The biggest question, of course, is Sportsmail’s revelation from 2012 that you sent derogatory messages to South African opponents about your captain Andrew Strauss. Why on earth did you do that? And why, if they were just ‘banter’ between old friends, have you consistently refused to show them to the ECB ever since or properly to apologise for your actions? That really should have been the end of the road with England for you, we all know that now, but then we would have been denied your incredible century in Mumbai that went a long way towards securing an historic series win in India. That’s the thing, you see Kevin, there’s always that contradiction and frustration with you. Your relationship with England fell apart during that 2012 summer and your behaviour during and after the Headingley Test was bizarre to say the least. You went out of your way to mix with the South Africans on the field in training and at intervals rather than your team-mates. You did not acknowledge the applause from the England dressing room when you scored a century — another world-class knock, by the way — and then there was the dressing room incident involving James Taylor. A glum-looking Pietersen has been a controversial figure for England on and off the cricket pitch . What did you say behind his back that so annoyed your team-mates? Why did you say ‘it’s tough being me’ after that game? And while we are at it what did you say about Michael Carberry behind his back in the Sydney dressing room as England crumbled to that 5-0 Ashes thrashing? You had a horrible habit of undermining inexperienced team-mates when the going got tough. It is widely understood that Cook played a huge part in convincing the ECB to take you back after the text scandal but what is not as well documented is that it was mainly Flower who persuaded England to give you another chance. Pietersen has had a chequered international past and his autobiography may include a spot of score-settling . Pietersen had his feuds with Andy Flower, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss, Peter Moores and Matt Prior . Are you really going to make Flower the No 1 target in your book after all he did for you — and more importantly, for England? You wanted him sacked along with Moores in 2008, a move that was to catastrophically backfire. Why did you feel so strongly that Moores and Flower had to go? Flower still worked with you and managed you after that and then agreed to have you back in 2012 even though he felt personally let down by your betrayal of Strauss. It is difficult to see how he has wronged you. Let’s go back to one of the most controversial episodes in recent cricket history, the Allen Stanford affair. To be fair, you conducted yourself as England captain as well as could be hoped as the team were effectively hired out to a crooked Texan. Much was made of the winner-takes-all aspect of the week in Antigua and we all know the England players won nothing while the Stanford team walked off with a million dollars each. It is not as well documented that Flower (right) persuaded England to give Pietersen another chance . Pietersen wanted Flower sacked along with Peter Moores (left) in 2008, a move that backfired catastrophically . But did you have a separate agreement with Stanford to promote the whole tawdry business? If so, did you hand back the money once it was found to be ill-gotten gains by Stanford? What did you think when Graeme Swann said in his autobiography that you were never the right man to captain England? And did you really think Swann and other England players like Stuart Broad were involved in that fake ‘KP genius’ Twitter account that seemed to offend you so much. What about when Swann said, after his retirement in Australia, that ‘some players are up their own backside’ and show a lack of humility? ‘It will bite them on the a*** one day and when it does I hope they are embarrassed about how they carry on,’ Swann said about the unnamed player or players. Who do you think he was talking about? Finally Kevin, why did you walk out of that last meeting with Cook and Paul Downton when they told you about your deselection, rather than hang around to hear the reasons and talk it through? Cook wanted to have a full discussion on where it had all gone wrong but you did not give him a chance, instead getting your mate Morgan to suggest Cook wouldn’t front up. The same cheerleader later misinterpreted the pivotal Melbourne team meeting and made groundless accusations about Matt Prior attacking Flower when you know he did nothing of the sort. Confidentiality agreement, anyone? The fact is your departure has been horrible and nasty. There’s only one person to blame for that, Kevin. It’s not Flower, Cook, Strauss, Prior, Downton, Swann, Moores, Hugh Morris, Ali Bacher, Jason Gallian or anyone at Hampshire and Surrey. It’s you. Alastair Cook (right) wanted to discuss where it went wrong with Pietersen, but he refused to do so .","Kevin Pietersen releases his autobiography on Monday and English cricket eagerly wants to know if any burning questions will finally be answered .

"Sam Allardyce has urged the West Ham faithful to give QPR’s former Hammers a warm reception when the two sides clash on Sunday. Rob Green, Rio Ferdinand and Bobby Zamora have collectively made more than 500 appearances for the Hammers while Harry Redknapp was manager for six seasons from 1994. The quartet are all plying their trade on the other side of the capital but Allardyce believes their time in east London should not be forgotten when they return to Upton Park. Rio Ferdinand is one of three current QPR players who have formerly played for West Ham . Sam Allardyce urged the West Ham fans to give the former Hammers a warm reception on Sunday . ‘They should get a warm reception as all three of them were here for a considerable amount of time, they weren’t short-term stays,’ he said. ‘We would like them to be very miserable at the end of the game though. ‘The year I had Robert Green when he helped us get back in to the Premier League, he was a great professional and we all know about Rio. ‘Harry has been managing longer than me — one of the few left who has. I think they will all come back with an extra determination to show everyone what they can still do.’ Rob Green joined West Ham from Norwich in 2006 and went on to make 219 appearances for the club . Ferdinand and Steven Caulker were two big names to arrive at Loftus Road but the team have conceded 13 goals in six games - the most in the division - and questions have been asked about the pair’s performances. ‘It’s a team game, I don’t think you can point out those two individuals,’ said Allardyce. ‘They have had a transition because they’ve changed the way they have played - they thought the back three would work and now they’ve moved to a back four. ‘They will be talking about how much protection they are getting - or not getting - from the midfield players to stop those goals going in.’ Bobby Zamora joined West Ham from Tottenham and scored 30 goals for them in 130 games . West Ham entered the weekend 13th in the table but only three points above QPR and the bottom three. Allardyce says it is never too early for supporters to grow frustrated and believes it is vitally important to maintain a gap above the relegation spots. ‘The pressure affects us all if you’re in and around the bottom, even at this stage of the season,’ he said. ‘There’s no give or take whether it’s the start, middle or end of the season so you have to avoid ever being there if you can. ‘The only way of doing that is to make sure you win and, if you don’t win, make sure you draw — if we had drawn rather than lost some of our games we’d be two or three points better than we are now. That kind of gap can be important to take the pressure off, so it’s almost a six-pointer on Sunday.’ Harry Redknapp featured as both a player (1965-72) and a manager (1994-2001) for West Ham .","West Ham host QPR in Premier League on Sunday .

"Highly-rated Everton youngster John Stones has revealed that one life-changing summer during his teen years prompted his mesmeric rise to the top after uncertainty whether he would even make the grade at former side Barnsley. The 20-year-old has now gone on to establish himself as a first-team regular in the Premier League at Everton, but rewind five years earlier and the future looked all the more contrasting for Stones. In an interview with The Times he said: 'I was actually held behind for two years. I played down, a year below my age group, when I was 14 or 15, playing with lads who were younger than me. John Stones looks to advance with the ball as Rickie Lambert looks on during Everton's 1-1 draw at Liverpool . Stones had an uncertain future at Barnsley as a youngster before making the grade and then getting his big break at Premier League outfit Everton in January 2013 . 'That was tough, being told that, but I was small at the time. I think it was a kick up the bum, too, a reminder that you need to start producing  I suppose I dug in and it paid off.' Ronnie Branson, academy manager at Barnsley, recently said 'he wasn't even the best player in the under 14 group' at the time, with Stones recollecting on the summer which changed everything. He added: 'I think it was my size more than anything. I just shot up one summer. No one could believe it. My size changed and, with that, I think my mentality changed too. 'It probably just clicked. I came back fitter, stronger and I could compete with lads my age. The 20-year-old comes up against Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel in the Merseyside derby last weekend . 'I just kicked on. I came back into my normal age group and then I quickly went up into the under-18s at 16, made my first-team debut at 17. That was probably a life-changer.' Stones went on to feature heavily in the Tykes' 2012/2013 campaign in particular, before making the move to Merseyside the next season for a reported fee of £3million. The youngster's early stages of his Everton career haven't gone bad either, recently penning a five-year contract extension at the club.

"Drug cheat Justin Gatlin ran the fastest 100 metres in the world this year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the Memorial van Damme in Brussels. The American, who has twice served doping bans, emphatically beat a world-class field to extend his unbeaten run to 17 races at the final Diamond League meeting of the season. The time was a new personal best for the controversial sprinter at the age of 32. It in fact equalled the mark he set in 2006 - then an equal world record - which was scratched from the history books following his doping ban. The win also earned him victory in the Diamond Race, the overall competition across all 14 Diamond League meetings of the year. Triumph: Gatlin recorded a years best time of 9.77s in Brussels on Friday evening . Cheat: Gatlin (centre) powers to victory ahead of Kemar Bailey-Cole (left) and Kim Collins (right) Win: Gatlin celebrates his victory at the Memorial Van Damme athletics Diamond League meeting in Brussels . It all raises the prospect of Gatlin posing a very real challenge to Usain Bolt at next year’s World Championships, especially given the Jamaican’s fitness problems this season. The six-time Olympic gold medallist has ended his campaign. The thought of a man who served a four-year ban before returning to the sport in 2010 winning a world title is one that many in the sport will find hard to stomach. Great Britain’s former world 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene said on Twitter: “I enjoy watching athletics but it’s hard to do so when I’ve not raced because of injury and the coverage is full of drug cheats winning.” American Mike Rodgers finished second behind Gatlin in 9.93secs, while there was reason to cheer for Britain’s James Dasaolu after he ran a season’s best 10.00s in fifth. Hard to stomach: Dai Greene, who is out injured, commented that it was hard to see cheat Gatlin win the race . Happy: Brit James Dasaolu is also celebrating . The European champion declared himself “happy” with his run as he finished ahead of the likes of Tyson Gay, Nesta Carter, Richard Thompson and Kim Collins. Elsewhere, Eilidh Child, another European champion, was third in the 400m hurdles in 54.76. Gatlin’s superb form continued in the men’s 200 metres as he completed the double, with just an hour between races. He once again decimated everyone else, powering around the bend and lead the field home at a canter and even looked slightly disappointed to see the time of 19.71 seconds when he crossed the line. Gatlin’s compatriot Allyson Fox took both the Diamond Race and the best time of the year as she came home first in the women’s 200 metres. The 28-year-old returned earlier this year after a nine-month injury lay-off but was too good for the rest of the Brussels field and clocked a time of 22.02 seconds. Myriam Soumare of France took second with a personal best of 22.11, with Great Britain’s Jodie Williams unhappy after finishing eighth. “That was awful,” she conceded. “But I cant complain really as I have had a great season but that was probably a step too far for me.” Elsewhere: In another race at the meeting, Eildh Child finished third in the 400m hurdles with a time of 54.76s .","Drug cheat Gatlin clocked a 9.77 second time to claim an impressive win .

"The son of boxing champ Evander Holyfield seems to be following in his father's athletic footsteps. Elijah Holyfield, a junior at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia, has just fielded an offer to play college football for the University of Oregon Ducks. That's not all either, as Yahoo Sports reports the running back has also received recruitment letters from Arkansas, Boston College, Cal, Duke, Georgia, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Ole Miss and Wisconsin, to name just a few. Scroll down for video . Athletic genes: Elijah Holyfield (above during a visit to Ohio State) has been recruited to play college football for over 20 major universities . Famous dad: Elijah (second from right) is the son of boxing champ Evander Holyfield (third from left, pictured with his children) In fact, the young Holyfield is so good, he has been ranked as the No. 137 recruit in the country by ESPN. Overall, 22 different colleges have extended offers to the 17-year-old. 'Oregon Just offered #GoDucks!' Elijah wrote on Twitter yesterday. Elijah, Evander's only child with ex-wife Dr. Janice Itson, is also a state champion in track. And not only is Evander proud of his son, he also seems to think he will be a better athlete than he ever was. '[My dad] was saying how different it was for me and him,' Elijah told The Oregonian. 'He was picking up, as far as people knowing him, at a later age. At a younger age, he didn't have a lot of money and was a small kid and wasn't that popular. He was saying how different it is for (me), because I'm so young and all the people on me, talking to me all the time – because of him, because of me playing football. He just said to keep a cool head and just remember the main focus.'

Evander made millions over the course of his career, and is still the only 4-time World Heavyweight Champion in the history of boxing. Despite his huge success, he is perhaps best known to many for an incident in 1996 when fellow boxer Mike Tyson bit off part of his ear during his match. As for his son, Elijah says he is excited to visit Oregon later this year, but has made no choice yet on what college he might attend.

"Alan Pardew is set to drop £12million Remy Cabella as he admits there is one simple solution to easing the pressure on his position – victory at Swansea on Saturday. The Newcastle boss has endured another week of intense speculation regarding his future following Monday’s televised 1-0 loss at Stoke. Fans on the street have started to let their feelings be known and defeat at Swansea would make for an uncomfortable international fortnight. Remy Cabella (left) passes the ball whilst being challenged by Mike Williamson during training on Thursday . Newcastle boss Alan Pardewis under intense pressure to turn around the club's fortunes . Owner Mike Ashley will not sack Pardew, regardless of Saturday afternoon’s outcome, but the United manager does not want to rest on that assumption. Indeed, he tore in to some of his players on the training ground this week and we understand he will shake up team selection against the Swans. Cabella – their marquee summer signing – is almost certain to be axed after a string of weak and ineffective performances, while Yoan Gouffran and Emmanuel Riviere are also under threat. Gabrial Obertan will come in for his first Premier League start in 18 months. And Pardew said: ‘We haven’t got time to wait for players to come through. We need that to happen now. ‘Remy Cabella has got to start performing now. Our younger players like Sammy (Ameobi) and (Paul) Dummett have got to deliver now, we aren’t hanging about anymore. ‘It’s important we step up to the plate.’ Yoan Gouffran (3rd from right) smiles with teammates (seen left to right) Moussa Sissoko, Massadio Haidara, Gabriel Obertan, Emmanuel Riviere and Sammy Ameobi during training . And, when asked what it would take to ease the scrutiny on his position, Pardew said: ‘I have to win a game to calm it down a little bit, particularly for the players. ‘They need the confidence of a win. Stoke is a tough game but Swansea is even tougher. ‘Normally if we went there and came away with a draw and played well I would be quite pleased. ‘But that probably isn’t going to be enough to take the spotlight off us. I have to accept that. ‘Only if we win will it take the spotlight away a little bit. It is still going to be around us. I am trying to get everyone to understand in my training ground that isn’t going to go away. It will be here a while and we need to be strong.’ The players remain behind the manager, evidenced by televisions inside the training ground being turned off when speculation centres on their boss. But they need to return on that support on the pitch. Pardew added: ‘The characters will grow as we go along. This is a difficult club to play for, I think. Owner Mike Ashley has stuck by under-fire Newcastle boss Alan Pardew . ‘It can be the greatest club in the world to play for when you are winning, but we are not winning, so it becomes even harder to play for us, and we need to make sure we can handle that. ‘These players are going to learn more in the next six weeks than they have for the last two years of their careers.’ Pardew, meanwhile, refused to be drawn on the suggestion that the current squad has been left short in key areas by the failings of a transfer model in which he does not have autonomy on incomings. ‘The way players are brought in, it’s obviously a process that we go through, but the model is to buy younger players, and that makes it difficult if you are not winning,’ he said, chief scout Graham Carr the man responsible for the bulk of recruitment. ‘We have produced some fantastic signings at this football clubs – I don’t think anyone would deny that – so we can’t suddenly say we have got it all wrong and this is the wrong model and these are the wrong players.’ Disgruntled supporters display 'SackPardew.com' banners against Stoke .","Alan Pardew is set to drop £12million marquee signing Remy Cabella .

"Alan Pardew has admitted that he is worried about his family after fans on the street made their feelings known to the under-fire Newcastle boss.

Meanwhile, Sportsmail can reveal that televisions inside the training ground were turned off on Thursday when Sky Sports News did a live broadcast on Pardew’s position ahead of his weekly press conference. The 53-year-old has been involved in ‘one or two interactions’ with disgruntled supporters on Tyneside this week, but concedes it is when that spills over and begins to affect those closest to him that he becomes concerned. ‘My family and friends worry me a little bit, because it’s started going past football media at times,’ he said. ‘That’s not nice.

Ashley — who on Thursday increased his stake in Glasgow Rangers to almost nine per cent — flew in to witness the defeat at the Britannia Stadium and has spoken to Pardew since then. ‘The message is very much “how can we support you?”,’ revealed Pardew. ‘They (Ashley and managing director Lee Charnley) have been very solid and I appreciate that. 'It’s getting lost in the wash a little bit that I’m here out of arrogance or Mike’s being stubborn about it to annoy people. Owner Mike Ashley has stuck by under-fire Newcastle boss Alan Pardew .

"Kevin Pietersen accuses England of having a bullying culture and tries to portray himself as a victim in his autobiography that will become public on Monday. Pietersen, shown the door by England when they finally had enough of his maverick ways after their humiliation in Australia, reserves his most stinging criticism for Matt Prior and Andy Flower in an extraordinary attack on England. The first glimpse of what looks likely to be a rant against those who lost patience with him came in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. Kevin Pietersen's autobiography is published on Monday and English cricket has eagerly awaited its release . Pietersen discusses alleged 'bullying nature' of the England team and Andy Flower (right) as 'ruling by fear' It has long been known that Pietersen would aim his guns on Prior, a selfless team man who tried to broker a peace deal after Pietersen had sent derogatory texts about Andrew Strauss to South African opponents but who now finds himself accused of leading a concerted regime of bullying within the team. ‘Horrendous. Hugely disturbing,’ says Pietersen in the Telegraph of what he says was the culture within the England team when they rose to become the best in the world. ‘I brought it up on numerous occasions. I told Andrew Strauss about it. I told Alastair Cook about it. It was a huge thing. ‘I could give you telephone numbers of international players around the world. You ring them and ask how the England team have conducted themselves over the last three or four years. People would say to me, “I can’t believe you could play with these guys?” Pietersen has taken aim at former coach  Flower ahead of his new autobiography which is released on Monday . MATT PRIOR . ‘He’s a bad influence, a negative influence, he picks on players’ ANDY FLOWER . ‘He didn’t like one of his soldiers to hammer him. He was the boss. He wanted me to fear him’ THE STRAUSS TEXTS . ‘I regret being involved in conversations like that… I went to his house to apologise’ ‘The bowlers were given so much power. They were doing really well but these guys ran the dressing room. The thing that horrified me most was when Strauss and Flower said before the one-day internationals in India, “Guys, we’ve got to stop this. It’s not right for the team. People have come to us who are intimidated to field the ball.” ‘And the bowlers had the audacity to stand there and say, “No, if they **** up we deserve an apology”. It’s the most angry I’ve ever got in the dressing room. I thought, “I reckon I could hit these guys.” Pietersen stops short of hammering Alastair Cook, whom he calls ‘good at heart.’ But he cannot resist attacking Prior. ‘Alastair Cook isn’t the greatest speaker but his sidekick Matt Prior could talk the hind legs off a donkey. So Cook wanted Prior close to him. He wanted his vice-captain to do all his talking for him. So when I went after Prior I said he shouldn’t be in the team, he’s a bad influence, a negative influence, he picks on players.’ As expected, Pietersen attacks Flower even though England’s most successful coach was the man who gave him one last chance after he betrayed Strauss. Pietersen (left) and Matt Prior (right) during better times in 2010 after England took on Australia in Melbourne . Pietersen (right): 'It's only Prior (left) that I'd seriously have real issues with, because of how he was portrayed' ‘I’ve been one of the only ones who constantly through his reign as coach did not say “How high” when he said “Jump”. He built a regime, he didn’t build a team. 'I told him on numerous occasions, “You’re playing by fear here, you want players to be scared of you. And Andy, I’m not scared of you”. And he hated it. 'He had it in for me since I tried to get rid of him as second in command. Andy Flower didn’t like one of his soldiers to hammer him. He was the boss. He wanted me to fear him. I’ll never fear you buddy.’ There is one shock admission of regret over sending the messages about Strauss but he claims it was because he was ‘broken’ by a parody Twitter account mocking him. He says his mistake was not disagreeing with the South Africans calling Strauss a ‘doos’, which, loosely translated, is the word Strauss called Pietersen when he was commenting for Sky this summer and thought he was off-air. Former coach Flower and Pietersen had their disagreements and the latter has revealed more on the matter . Pietersen (right) claims he was ignored after trying to alert Flower to the anxiety condition of Jonathan Trott . ‘A doos is just an idiot and I regret being involved in conversations like that,’ Pietersen tells the Telegraph. ‘But mentally I was totally broken. I was crying in a room with Andy Flower during that Test (against South Africa at Headingley) saying, “How the hell has it come to this?” ‘Why? Because I was told by a senior player that the Twitter account was being run from inside the dressing room. I was completely broken, absolutely finished, mentally shot. Yes of course I regret getting Straussy involved and I went to his house to apologise. I apologised to his wife, too.’ Extraordinarily, Pietersen claims he still wants to play for England even though he made no attempt to play any first-class cricket for Surrey last summer and did not reach 60 in any Twenty20 innings in three competitions all year. ‘I know my issues are not just with the captain but with the board,’ he said. ‘If that changes — and I believe it could in the next few months — then I really believe I could play for England again. ‘The reason is that I honestly, 100 per cent believe I could I can help the youngsters and I believe I can help Cooky get better. I said to Andy Flower in that Ashes series, please, whenever you speak to Cooky, if he needs my help I’ll help him. I’m incredibly passionate about English cricket. I always want England to win.’ Pietersen has a funny way of showing it, that’s for sure.

"The goals came from Senegal and Croatia but manager Steve Bruce says Hull’s long-term success will very much depend on home-grown talent. Midfielder Mo Diame headed in his third goal in four matches from a cross supplied Andrew Robertson, the impressive Scottish full-back. Nikica Jelavic made the points safe and ended Crystal Palace’s unbeaten league run under Neil Warnock with a strike after English midfielder Jake Livermore’s through pass. Mo Diame celebrates after scoring to put Hull City 1-0 up against Crystal Palace on Saturday . Mo Diame (right) heads Hull in front against Crystal Palace with his third goal in four games . Nikica Jelavic scores Hull's second goal with a neat finish across the box . In his four league games for Hull, Mo Diame has scored three goals, the same number as he scored in his last 25 games for West Ham. ‘All this nonsense that we’re not producing players, sometimes they need a stage to play on,’ Bruce said. ‘We decided that we needed a few younger players because we haven’t produced many. ‘We’ve now got a nucleus of very good young players. I include Tom Ince and Harry Maguire in that. Jake Livermore’s only 23, you think of him as a seasoned professional. It’s his second season in the Premier League. We’ve got some good young players, which is important.’ After conceding 13 goals in five matches before Saturday, Hull reverted to the 3-5-2 formation that served them so well in the last two seasons and it worked perfectly during the 2-0 win. Only a free-kick from Mile Jedinak and a 30-yard shot from Yannick Bolasie came close to troubling Steve Harper, while the hosts’ main threat was posed by their wing-backs, Ahmed Elmohamdy and Robertson. Andrew Robertson (right) was playing part-time football two years ago . Jake Livermore (left) is in his second season at Hull and is impressing manager Steve Bruce . Robertson, 20, joined Hull from Dundee United for £2.85m in the summer. Two years ago, he was playing part-time football for Queen’s Park in the Scottish third division. ‘I have to be honest and say he’s totally and utterly shocked me with his ability to step in,’ Bruce said. ‘For 20 years old, and play at the highest level — he’s going to have a big, big future.’ Warnock, searching for positives, highlighted the performance of Martin Kelly. The former Liverpool defender moved from right-back to a central role after Scott Dann was injured in the 12th minute. ‘He’s such a good pro,’ Warnock said. ‘There’s a lot more to come from him, I think. He’s looking a little bit sharper, now he’s had a few games under his belt. ‘Kenny Dalglish thinks that’s he’s best position — right-side centre-half — and I don’t think he did anything wrong. I thought he was super.’","Manager impressed with the likes of Tom Ince and Jake Livermore .

"So much for being a two-man team. The Americans had talked endlessly in the build-up about targeting Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter, as if taking down those two would lead naturally to the Ryder Cup heading back across the Atlantic. The wisdom of that theory was rather shot to pieces on a fascinating first day, as any number of fearless Europeans stood up to be counted to turn a one-point deficit at lunch into a handy 5-3 advantage. An out-of-sorts McIlroy contributed just a half point and Poulter suffered a rare defeat, so to that end the American plan might be said to have worked.

Trouble is, when those two faltered, there to take up the slack was Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood and their wonderful rookie partners, Victor Dubuisson and Jamie Donaldson. Most of all, there was the prodigious gifts and warrior instincts of Justin Rose and his Swedish partner Henrik Stenson. Rose’s partnership with Poulter might have been broken up but the former is fast compiling a Ryder Cup record of which the latter would be proud. The two points he contributed on Friday with Stenson takes his overall record to eight victories from 11 matches spread over three Ryder Cups. Rose is one of those Mr Dependables who could play with anyone. He has taken over the role of largely unsung hero Westwood used to play. Here in the tricky breezy conditions he was immense and the competitor in Stenson rose to the challenge of being an able partner. Average by his standards in the morning, the Swede was at his awesome best following the break. As ever, the first day of this 40th edition had plenty that intrigued and lots to analyse; plenty to keep fans of the sport and beyond in rapt conversation at the 19th hole. At its heart lay an astonishing decision from American captain Tom Watson that sucked all the momentum built up by the visitors in the morning and left them crestfallen at the finish. The story at half-time was that Europe had somehow contrived to lose yet another series despite winning one match comfortably and leading two more with just the final three holes to play. They would lose one and halve the other to concede the first series by a point. That took their record to two wins out of the last 12 series of fourballs and foursomes. Team Europe's Graeme McDowell (right) of Northern Ireland lines up a putt on the seventh green during the foursomes matches at Gleneagles . Team Europe's Lee Westwood  and Jamie Donaldson  line up a putt on the 18th green during the foursome afternoon match on the first day of the 2014 Ryder Cup . Inevitably there were grumblings but any questions about some of the pairings and why a natural front man like McIlroy was stuck in the anchor match became a faded memory thanks to Watson’s howler. Comfortably the best golf in the morning was played by the youngest American partnership in Ryder Cup history — 21-year-old Jordan Spieth and 24-year-old Patrick Reed. To be fair, it was a Watson masterstroke to pair them together, for they didn’t just take down Poulter and local hero Stephen Gallacher — they wiped the floor with them. The two rookies were full of it afterwards and rightly so. They were the talk of the Glen. The Americans present were buoyant. Who would the new American dream pairing be taking on in the afternoon? They were benched. World number one Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia (pictured) turned their fortunes around to salvage a halve after losing their morning session on Friday .

Sportsmail's graphic shows why it is good Europe started brightly against USA . Naturally, they could not believe it. Who could? They pleaded with their captain. ‘They’re very upset with me right now,’ admitted Watson. They were not alone, among those with American interests at heart. And so the momentum shifted. Donaldson and Westwood were majestic in beating the noted foursomes players, Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar, on the final hole. Poor Mickelson, now 44 and with an arthritic condition, looked like a man who could hardly believe he was being sent out again, and played tired golf — who would have thought that? — in losing to McDowell and Dubuisson. Even America’s only half point in the afternoon must have felt like a loss as world No 1 McIlroy and world No 3 Garcia came back from two down with two to play. What a start we had to proceedings. It is an incredible logistical exercise to get 50,000 people on to a golf course situated in the middle of nowhere for a 7.35am start but the hardy Ryder Cup regulars, as ever, were up for it. The park-and-ride car parks started filling up at 5am and by the time the gates opened at 6am, there were thousands waiting to make the mad dash for the best seats in the 3,000-capacity grandstand around the first tee. By 6.15am, some 45 minutes before the sun started peeking above the Ochil Hills, there were no unoccupied seats at all. Daylight revealed a magnificent landscape, with spectators occupying every possible vantage point — and soon the songs began. ‘Ten-six, and you still can’t win,’ was one chant, a reference to the epic turn of events at Medinah. Bubba Watson was first out for America and when he cupped his hand to his ear the thrilled crowd knew what that meant. So it was he boomeranged the ball in trademark fashion to a deafening ‘Ole’ accompaniment. That, however, was as good as it got for the Masters champion and his hapless partner Webb Simpson. A special reception was afforded Poulter and local hero, Stephen Gallacher. Poulter pounded his chest, the frustrated footballer to the end. It looked as if the occasion was too much for Gallacher, while Poulter lost for the first time in eight Ryder Cup matches. Curiously, all four of his defeats have come on the opening day. Just a minuscule contribution in points terms from McIlroy and Poulter, then, but no matter. To American chagrin, this was the day European golf displayed all its considerable strength in depth.

"If Graeme McDowell is to be believed, Victor Dubuisson will be a household name in the near future — yet what is publicly known about the Frenchman wouldn’t fill the back of a score card. ‘Enigmatic’ doesn’t come close to describing the 24-year-old, who is originally from Cannes but is such a man of mystery that nobody apart from himself knows for sure where he now resides. Reportedly, over the past year, he has based himself in Honduras (to avoid punitive French taxes), Andorra, Monte Carlo and elsewhere. The European Tour says he is a resident on Antibes in south-east France. The man himself will not say. Nor will he speak of his background, especially a childhood in which he was left ‘by myself’ and left school aged ‘10 or 12’ to concentrate on golf. Graeme McDowell thinks Victor Dubuisson will be a household name in golf in the very near future . Team Europe's Victor Dubuisson of France (right) and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland on Saturday . CLICK HERE to read the report from Saturday's Ryder Cup action . Friend and compatriot Thomas Levet has said: ‘I know his family story and it was not an easy childhood, let’s leave it at that.’ Dubuisson says his childhood is too painful to talk about. One thing is certain: the Ryder Cup rookie is some player, underlined by the skills he displayed in two wins from the two fourballs matches he has played alongside McDowell here. On this form he has an excellent chance of adding another in the singles. His and McDowell’s latest victims on Saturday were Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, drubbed 5&4. Dubuisson’s father was reportedly a banker. One of France’s most famous basketball players, Herve Dubuisson, is supposedly his uncle. Beyond that, not much is known. After Dubuisson became a YouTube star thanks to wondershots in the desert in an Arizona match play tournament earlier this year, he changed his phone number to avoid unwanted calls. The Frenchman’s first Tour victory was in the Turkish Airlines Open last year and he has been talked up ever since.

The late Seve Ballesteros’s son Javier tweeted earlier this year: ‘Victor Dubuisson is my new hero.’ Lee Westwood says he is a friendly guy but ‘it is very difficult to know what to make of Victor’. McDowell says he is a ‘great guy’, while US captain Tom Watson said: ‘The man is a sensation.’ Dubuisson himself simply says: ‘I am a simple man.’ Good at golf, too.

"Gareth Southgate believes Raheem Sterling's busy schedule should exclude him from England Under 21 duty, but suggested Luke Shaw could do with the game time. The former Middlesbrough manager highlighted that, despite still being eligible, Sterling's participation in the Premier League, Champions League and senior national side meant he was unlikely to benefit from playing for the Young Lions. 'Whilst as a coach you always want the best possible players available, sometimes I don't think it is the right or appropriate challenge for the individual player,' the England Under 21s boss said.

'On the list of priorities, the 21s wouldn't necessarily be so high. For the group, you think you're bringing back the best players but it wouldn't necessarily guarantee you get a better performance whereas the boys with us this week, for them this is everything. Gareth Southgate said he wants the best players for his Under 21 side but has to consider all factors . Spouthgate said he did not doubt Sterling's attitude but felt it would not benefit him to join the Under 21s . 'So we win both ways, really. We give Raheem the experience of continuing with the seniors and we also get the experience for the group that remains with us.' While Sterling was included in the senior squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, defenders Calum Chambers and Shaw dropped into the Under 21s. The former was bumped back up after an injury to John Stones, although Manchester United left-back Shaw remains with the Under 21s. It was not a decision Southgate took lightly but, like Sterling, believes the decision is for the betterment of the individual and country. 'Leighton Baines did really well last month, so would Luke start for the seniors this time around? What's the best experience for him?' he said. Louis van Gaal is a strong advocate of the international Under 21 level of football, and explained that to Shaw . Calum Chambers was initially in the Under 21 squad, but was promoted after the injury to John Stones . 'I think certainly from his club perspective playing two matches would be good because he has not had a lot of football. 'I know Louis van Gaal was very positive to him about it. Also, having been manager of a national team and spoken so much about the importance of the Under 21s in preparation for the Dutch last summer, I didn't think we were going to have an issue from the club.' Southgate admitted that he had considered whether Shaw's meteoric rise would affect his motivation, but has faith the former Southampton man is in the right frame of mind. He said: 'You're thinking, ""where's the player with it,"" because his world has changed a lot since we had him last November. 'He has played as many matches this campaign as our other left-backs, but his world has changed considerably. Southgate said Roy Hodgson had spoken to Shaw about playing for the Under 21 side . Stuart Pearce was Southgate's predecessor as Under 21 manager, but was sacked last summer . 'But he has been brilliant. Roy spoke to him, which I think was important, I then spoke to him before we met up and a really good chat since we got here. 'He is looking forward to the game. Yes, he played at the World Cup, he has played friendlies for the seniors, but he has only got three caps for us. 'So although he is making brilliant progress in his career, he is not the finished article so experiences like this can only help him.' Having won their European Championships qualifying group at a canter, the unbeaten Young Lions now face a two-legged clash with Croatia as they look to progress to next summer's finals in the Czech Republic. They prepare for that tournament in the shadow of a miserable performance at last years's edition in Israel, where the Under 21s returned home embarrassed after losing all three games. It led to manager Stuart Pearce losing his job, with the former Under 21s boss this week saying successor Southgate should get the pick of the talent to avoid similar failure this time around. Goalkeepers: Jonathan Bond (Watford), Jack Butland (Stoke City), Sam Johnstone (Manchester United). Defenders:  Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Luke Garbutt (Everton), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Carl Jenkinson (West Ham United, on loan from Arsenal), Michael Keane (Burnley, on loan from Manchester United), Jamaal Lascelles (Nottingham Forest, on loan from Newcastle United), Liam Moore (Leicester City), Luke Shaw (Manchester United).

"UCLA biologists says they can slow the aging process by activating a gene by 'remote control.' Scientists at the university's Molecular Biology Institute published a paper this month that found activating a gene called AMPK in fruit fly cells increased the insects' lifespans by about 30 percent and lived healthier lives. The treatment could one day be used to increase human lifespan and stave off disease by stimulating the gene in targeted organs or organ systems. Triggered: By activating AMPK in the cells of fruit flies, researchers at UCLA found they could significantly increase their lifespan . The study found that when AMPK was increased in cells in the nervous system, not only did the those cells age slower but the cells in the intestines did as well. The reverse was true when AMPK was targeted in intestinal cells. After treatment, the fruit flies in the study increased their lifespan from six weeks to eight weeks. By tweaking levels of AMPK, scientists were allowing cells to dump 'cellular garbage,' components that cells discard due to damage or age. Discarding this material earlier avoids damage to the cell and prevents the aging process. David Walker, associate professor at UCLA and senior author of the research, is hopeful that the treatment could one day be used to prevent the debilitating diseases associated with aging. New life: Biologists at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA are hopeful that this research could prevent aging-related diseases like Parkinson's . ""Instead of studying the diseases of aging—Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes—one by one, we believe it may be possible to intervene in the aging process and delay the onset of many of these diseases,"" said Walker. UCLA Newsroom writes fruit flies are used in gene studies because scientists have already cataloged the entirety of the fruit fly's genes and can activate targeted genes. The lead author of the study said that a drug used to treat diabetes Type 2 could be used to activate AMPK in humans.","Biologists conducted a study on fruit flies that found activating a gene called AMPK increased the flies' lives by 30 percent .

"Snapchat’s founders have quietly announced that they have settled a long-standing lawsuit with a former colleague, while all eyes were on the launch of Apple’s iPhone 6. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy acknowledged that their former fraternity brother, Frank Reginald Brown IV, was integral to the birth of their popular app, where 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day. The settlement comes just a fortnight after Snapchat was valued at £6 billion ($10 billion). Snapchat's Chief Executive Evan Spiegel (pictured left)  and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy (right) acknowledged that their former classmate, Frank Reginald Brown IV, was integral to the birth of their popular app, from which 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day . Negotiations have been going on for a year-and-a-half. Mr Brown originally came up with the idea for Snapchat – which sends disappearing photos – in 2011 when the three men were at Stanford University. ‘He then collaborated with Spiegel and Murphy on the development of Snapchat during its early and most formative days,’ a statement issued by Snapchat explains. But Mr Brown was later ousted and has been pushing for a favourable settlement. The final settlement resolves all disputes between the former students and is confidential, but a statement put out by Snapchat acknowledges that Mr Brown came up with the concept for the app. ‘Reggie Brown originally came up with the idea of creating an application for sending disappearing picture messages while he was a student at Stanford University,’ the statement reads. Mr Brown (pictured) originally came up with the idea for Snapchat - which sends disappearing photos - in 2011 when the three men were at Stanford University . Instagram recently launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt to compete with Snapchat . The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. Mr Spiegel said: ‘We are pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter in a manner that is satisfactory to Mr Brown and the Company. ‘We acknowledge Reggie’s contribution to the creation of Snapchat and appreciate his work in getting the application off the ground.’ In August last year, Mr Brown unearthed photos, emails and other 'evidence' in a bid to prove he was an integral part of Snapchat's success, but the other founders claimed he had 'no equity' in the venture. It was reported at the time that he was suing the company for a third of its $800 million (£496 million) valuation. Only the individuals involved know the financial outcome of the settlement, so it is impossible to speculate whether Mr Brown received this figure, something lower, or a much higher settlement based on the company's soaring valuation. Mr Brown claimed he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year. But the friends are said to have fallen out a month before Snapchat launched, arguably making Mr Brown's role in the success of the final product slightly ambiguous. Last year Snapchat turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook, and while some doubted the app could grow further, the company was valued at a staggering £6 billion (£10 billion) two weeks ago. In a recent round of funding, investors promised millions to the company, including Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byer, leading to the huge valuation, The Wall Street Journal reported. The venture-capital firm had committed to invest up to £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat in May, the Journal cited one source as saying. If the deal goes through, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £6 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB. Snapchat is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services, which may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users. It has also been rumoured that it may feature some sort of news service. This week it has debuted a new feature for New York Fashion Week, featuring 'a live story' with material from the Marc Jacobs and Pamella Roland shows and street style photographers. Though Snapchat and other similar mobile messaging apps don't have established business models yet, their rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so. While . the final settlement, which resolves all disputes between the former . students, is confidential, a statement put out by Snapchat acknowledges . that Brown came up with the concept for the app. Snapchat's humble beginnings began in a home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles in 2011, Business Insider reported in the summer of last year. Mr Brown, an English major, decided to spend the summer there at the home of Mr Spiegel, his friend from Stanford University. That is where Mr Brown is said to have come up with the idea for the disappearing photo app. In the spring of 2013, Snapchat now admits in the suit, Mr Brown came up with the idea of a disappearing photo app. But that's where the two parties' stories part ways. Mr Brown said that he and Mr Spigel looked for someone to write the code for their idea and chose Mr Murphy. 'From spring of 2011 and into the summer,' reads Brown's filing, '[Brown] and Spiegel and Murphy lived, worked, developed and launched the Application together.' A saved text conversation between Mr Brown and Mr Spiegel seems to back the claim and suggests that Mr Brown helped to secure the company's first patent, while another suggests the would-be app was a three man startup. In the summer of 2011, things went sour between Mr Spiegel, Mr Murphy and Mr Brown, when the now famous startup founders reportedly changed the passwords to shut Mr Brown out. Last year, Mr Brown claimed that he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year.","Announcement was made while all eyes were on Apple's launch .

"She's the ex-wife of convicted murderer and drug trafficker Carl Williams, who served her own six-month jail term for  trafficking $100,000 worth of ecstasy in 2004. But Roberta Williams has revealed that being the mother of an autistic child is the 'toughest role' she has ever played in her life. Her three-year-old son, Giuseppe, was diagnosed with autism at two years of age after a difficult pregnancy and birth. 'I was distraught. I just sat in the car and cried,' Ms Williams told A Current Affair of the day she found out about her fifth child's condition, describing it as a 'kick in the guts'. Roberta Williams, the ex-wife of convicted underworld murder Carl Williams, said being the mother of a child with autism has been the toughest role of her life . Her three-year-old son Giuseppe was diagnosed with autism at the age of two . 'Then [the doctor] told us that he will never function like a normal child, he will never talk,' she continued. 'To hear that was like someone took my breath away.' Ms Williams revealed that it was just before the diagnosis that her life was rocked by the deaths of her former husband Carl, her sister, her niece, her mother and even Carl's mother. 'And I just thought, ""is this going to be another death?"",' she said of her son. 'I just couldn't take it in. It was just too much to take in.' Ms Williams said that her mother's intuition had told her something was wrong throughout the pregnancy . '[The doctor] told us that he will never function like a normal child he will never talk. To hear that was like someone took my breath away,' Mrs Williams said . The mother shared an insight into her daily struggles with A Current Affair, as well as some of her parenting techniques when it came to raising Giuseppe. 'If you're not going to win the fight, don't start it,' Ms Williams said, describing the necessity to be consistent when disciplining her son. The mother-of-five, who said she strongly opposed smacking children, shared a technique that had helped her adjust some of Giuseppe's behaviour. 'He used to stim all day. He would just jump up and down and flap his arms in front of the TV,' Ms Williams told Channel Nine. The mother-of-five shared some of her parenting techniques when it came to raising Giuseppe, including her mantra 'If you're not going to win the fight, don't start it' Ms Williams is the ex-wife of convicted murderer and drug trafficker Carl Williams and served her own six-month jail term for trafficking $100,000 worth of ecstasy in 2004 . 'So I went up and grabbed his hands, put them beside him and said no, and I made him look me in the eye and firmly said no. 'After a couple of weeks he stopped doing that, no more stimming. If I can help one parent out of this then that is good for me.' Despite the daily struggle, Ms William's said she 'would not change him for the world'. 'My little navigator is the bestest, cutest, happiest little dude you have ever come across.' Ms Williams has four otherchildren, Tye, 25, Danielle, 20 and Breanane, 18, from a previous relationship and Dhakota, 11, from her marriage with Carl. She says she conceived Giuseppe with fiance Robert Carpenter in 2011, the day before her ex-husband  was bludgeoned to death inside Victoria's Barwon Prison.","Ms William's son Giuseppe, was diagnosed with autism at two years of age .

"Rock inscriptions and tomb carvings have shed light on the large beasts that thrived in Egypt before they were wiped out around 6,000 years ago. The etchings depict horned hartebeest and oryx, as well as other big mammals, that lived in the Nile Valley before its ecology changed dramatically, and the country became drier overall. Experts claim that 37 large bodied mammals including lions, wild dogs, elephants and giraffes, lived in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 BC - compared to just eight now. Scientists studied depictions of animals in Egyptian artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the Nile Valley going back to pre-dynastic times. This 5,150 year-old ceremonial stone palette is ramed by two wild dogs clasping one another’s paws and features ostrich, hartebeest, oryx and giraffes . Scientists have used depictions of animals in Egyptian artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the Nile Valley going back to pre-dynastic times. The study shows species extinctions in the area - probably caused by a drying climate and an exploding human population - made the ecosystem progressively less stable. One of the artefacts examined was a 5,150 year-old ceremonial stone palette housed in a museum at Oxford University. It is framed by two wild dogs clasping one another’s paws and features ostrich, hartebeest, wildebeest, ibex, oryx and giraffes. The palette also features mythical creatures including serpent-necked panthers and what is thought to be a griffin - a legendary bird with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. The etchings depict horned hartebeest (pictured left in the Namibian desert) and oryx (pictured right) as well as other cumbersome animals that lived in the Nile Valley before its ecology changed dramatically and the country became drier . Experts say that 37 large bodied mammals also including lions, wild dogs, elephants and giraffes lived in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 BC - compared to just eight now. Computational analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in Egypt’s mammals, three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions. These droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the Old Kingdom around 4,000 years ago and the fall of the New Kingdom about 1,000 years later. Dr Yeakel said: ‘There were three large pulses of aridification as Egypt went from a wetter to a drier climate - starting with the end of the African Humid Period 5,000 years ago when the monsoons shifted to the south. ‘At the same time human population densities were increasing and competition for space along the Nile Valley would have had a large impact on animal populations.’ The most recent major shift in mammalian communities occurred about 100 years ago. The analysis of predator-prey networks showed species extinctions in the past 150 years had a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem stability. Another stone tablet, kept in the British Museum, shows human hunters armed with bows, spears, clubs and lassoes stalking lions, gazelles, hartebeest and an ostrich. Dr Justin Yeakel, of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, explained that when there were many species in the area, the loss of any one had little impact on the rest, but now the ecosystem is much more sensitive to perturbations. Dr Yeakel, who was at California University in Santa Cruz when he carried out the study, added: ‘What was once a rich and diverse mammalian community is very different now. ‘As the number of species declined one of the primary things lost was the ecological redundancy of the system. There were multiple species of gazelles and other small herbivores which are important because so many different predators prey on them. ‘When there are fewer of those small herbivores the loss of any one species has a much greater effect on the stability of the system and can lead to additional extinctions.’ The study, published in the journal PNAS, is based on records compiled in zoologist Dale Osborne’s 1998 book The Mammals of Ancient Egypt, which was, itself, based on archaeological and palaeontological evidence, as well as historical records. Dr Yeakel said: ‘Dale Osborne compiled an . incredible database of when species were represented in artwork and how . that changed over time. His work allowed us to use ecological modelling . techniques to look at the ramifications of those changes.’ The study looked at which animals lived in the Nile Valley (marked in green) before the time of the Pharoahs . Computer analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in Egypt’s mammal population, three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions. These droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the Old Kingdom around 4,000 years ago, and the fall of the New Kingdom about 1,000 years later. Dr Yeakel said: ‘There were three large pulses of aridification as Egypt went from a wetter to a drier climate - starting with the end of the African Humid Period 5,000 years ago when the monsoons shifted to the south. ‘At the same time human population densities were increasing and competition for space along the Nile Valley would have had a large impact on animal populations.’ The most recent major shift in mammalian communities occurred about 100 years ago. The analysis of predator-prey networks showed species extinctions in the past 150 years had a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem stability. Dr Yeakel said these findings have implications for understanding modern ecosystems. ‘This may be just one example of a larger pattern. We see a lot of ecosystems today in which a change in one species produces a big shift in how the ecosystem functions - and that might be a modern phenomenon,’ he said.

"Rosetta has taken an incredible selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space. In the background is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct ‘head’ and ‘body’ clearly visible. The image was taken on 7 September by Rosetta's landing craft Philae at a distance of 31 miles (50km) from the comet. Scroll down for video . Rosetta has taken a stunning selfie of its 131ft (40 metre) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of deep space. In the background, is the duck-shaped comet, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with its distinct 'head' and 'body' clearly visible . Two images with different exposure times were patched together to help highlight the details. It was created as part of the preparations being made by the lander team for the first ever attempt to land on a comet. Five possible landing sites, which appeared to be flat and relatively smooth, were chosen last month. But as Rosetta has edged closer to the comet, its uneven surface has come into focus, suggesting that the landing sites will be more risky than first thought. Yesterday, a colourful map revealing its stunning landscape was unveiled by mission scientists in Darmstadt following data sent back from the probe. Several different surface regions are shown in this map, which is oriented with the comet's 'body' in the foreground and the 'head' in the background. The map is expected to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in November - the first time a landing on a comet has ever been attempted . The map shows 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko’s ‘continents’ based on the variations on the comet’s surface. Esa told MailOnline that the colours do not represent specific formations on the comet, but do indicate that they are different regions. Various areas are dominated by cliffs, depressions, craters, boulders and even parallel grooves, with some regions still being shaped by the comet’s activity. As both 67P and Rosetta travel closer to the sun over the next months, the mission control team will monitor the surface looking for changes. While the scientists don’t expect the borderlines of the comet’s regions to vary dramatically, more subtle transformations could help explain more about how comets form. Jagged cliffs and prominent boulders are visible in this image taken by on 5 September 2014 from a distance of 39 miles (62km) from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The left part of the image shows a side view of the comet's 'body', while the right is the back of its 'head'. One pixel corresponds to 3.6ft (1.1 metres) Next weekend, on 13 and 14 September, the maps will play a key role as Rosetta’s Lander Team and the Rosetta orbiter scientists to decide where they will park the Philae lander. An announcement on their decision will be made on 15 September. Once Philae leaves Rosetta to head for 67P/C-G, there will be no chance to alter its path. It will take between five and eight hours to reach the comet’s surface and be pulled in by its weak gravity. Earlier this week, Rosetta uncovered some surprising features about comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Instead of imaging a bright, ice-covered comet, the probe’s instruments have detected that 67P is in fact darker than charcoal in some wavelengths of light. And scientists working on Rosetta’s Alice instrument have so far failed to find any large patches of water-ice on 67P’s surface. An artist's impression of the Rosetta orbiter at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Instead of imaging a bright, ice-covered comet, the probe’s instruments have detected that 67P is in fact darker than charcoal . Rosetta has measured the temperature of the comet and determined that . its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F). Although . it may seem cold, that is actually 20 to 30°C (36 to 54°F) warmer than . predicted for a comet at that distance, suggesting its surface will be . quite dusty in addition to being icy. 'This . result is very interesting, since it gives us the first clues on the . composition and physical properties of the comet’s surface,' says Virtis . principal investigator Fabrizio Capaccioni from Rome, Italy. This suggests that much of the surface must be dusty, because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice. ‘We're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water-ice it shows,’ said Alan Stern, Alice principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado. Scientists had previously believed the comet’s surface would contain ice because it was too far away for the sun’s warmth to melt it. The lack of ice could suggest that the comet had been in close with our sun, or a different star, at some point during its journey in deep space. They also found that the 'coma' - or atmosphere - around the comet contains of hydrogen and oxygen. This is surprising as comas are generally thought to be composed of water vapour and dust. Described as ‘the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever’, Rosetta will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on Earth. The comet itself is about 2.5 miles (4km) long and orbits the sun every six-and-a-half years. It is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more. For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment . Five sites were identified on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Landing Site Selection Group meeting held 23–24 August.

"Magnus Pehrsson's last close encounter with an England international ended with Chris Waddle advising him to try American Football instead, so the Estonia boss will feel there is room for improvement. Pehrsson joined Bradford on loan from Djurgardens in November 1996, with a plan to spend four months in Yorkshire playing in the second tier of English football but he played only once, in a 3-0 home defeat to Oldham, when he was replaced after an hour. Estonia boss Magnus Pehrsson played one game for Bradford City in 1996 . One moment stands out in his memory. ‘I was playing in midfield with Chris Waddle, who was a bit older then but still a terrific player,’ said the 38-year-old Swede. ‘When we got this dangerous free-kick situation I was confident enough to tell him I should take it and he said: “Go on then son”. I kicked it 10 metres over and he did this field-goal sign, and was laughing when he said that I should try American Football.’ He was too polite to mention Waddle’s penalty in Italia 90, also launched into the sky. Pehrsson, who previously managed Aalborg and Djurgardens, took control of Estonia at the end of last year and his first campaign started with an encouraging win at home to Slovenia. Pehrsson (right) signs for Bradford boss Chris Kamara . But that upbeat mood was punctured by defeat in Lithuania on Thursday with Ken Kallaste sent off and therefore suspended on Sunday. ‘The World Cup was not what Englishmen expected or hoped for but they are at start of something new with young players with key roles,’ said Pehrsson. ‘It’s now a team with more pace. We have to be a compact unit and put out a perfect performance and then there is a chance.’","Magnus Pehrsson joined Bradford on loan in 1996 .

"European captain Paul McGinley insists Rory McIlroy will be fresh and raring to go when the 40th Ryder Cup gets under way at Gleneagles on Friday, but hinted that Graeme McDowell may not be alongside him when it does. McIlroy and McDowell have been regular partners in team events since 2009, winning three of their four matches in the Seve Trophy and also representing Ireland in the World Cup that year and 2011. The Northern Irish duo have also played six times together in the Ryder Cup, including the very first match at Medinah two years ago, and would seemingly make an obvious pairing at Gleneagles. Paul McGinley insists Rory McIlroy will be raring to go when the 40th Ryder Cup gets under way . McIlroy's ongoing court case with his former management company put a strain on their relationship as McDowell was also represented by the same firm, but, with both players insisting that would not be a factor this week, McGinley revealed other concerns. 'Both of them have assured me all along that there's no issues and that's the way I've always seen it,' McGinley told a press conference on Monday. 'Whether they come together or not is another story. 'Three or four months ago, I had a very strong view that they would have been, but the more I look at their statistics and the more I look at the different value I have with them, I'm thinking there may be value in not doing it. But the world No 1 may not be paired with fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell . 'If I don't decide to play them, it would be for tactical reasons. They have played six Ryder Cup matches and they have only won two together (losing three and halving one). It's not like these guys are written in stone. They are not a formidable fourball pairing that's unbeatable (both wins have come in foursomes).' McDowell was the last member of the European team to arrive at Gleneagles on Monday afternoon, while McIlroy turned up on Sunday after a week off following the Tour Championship. Despite saying he was in need of a rest, the 25-year-old kept himself busy with various sponsorship and social events, but McGinley added: 'I don't have any concern. He hit balls yesterday and got a real good break away from golf. Ryder Cup captains McGinley and Tom Watson speak at a press conference ahead of the tournament . 'Resting doesn't always necessarily mean lying in bed for the week or lying by the pool. I think getting out and doing different things he's been doing, having fun, like going to the boxing the other day, and doing that Goals on Sunday (programme) too - those are things he enjoys doing. 'He arrived yesterday afternoon, had a nice session with his coach and again this morning, so he's fresh, he's ready.' McIlroy was famously not ready for his singles match at Medinah two years ago, when a time-zone mix-up meant he needed to hitch a ride in a police car to get to the course with just 10 minutes to spare. Staying on site at Gleneagles should ensure there is no repeat this time - 'They can roll out of bed to the first tee in five minutes,' McGinley joked - and the European captain has also learned another important lesson from 2012. McIlroy said on Sunday that people should expect some different pairings on the European team on Friday . VIDEO Pundits provide insight into potential pairings . 'It was a big learning curve for us in a lot of ways,' the 47-year-old Dubliner added. 'Sadly for me it was the first time in a team situation that we were really getting a wallop the first two days. 'I learned a lot from (captain) Jose Maria Olazabal - the decisions he made and the structures he put in place to give us the best chance of getting out of the hole that we were in. Looking back on it now, it was a great experience. 'The bottom line is, this is a very, very strong American team. The favourites tag is irrelevant as far as I'm concerned. We're going to have to play really well to win this Ryder Cup. 'I think we're slight favourites. We're not overwhelming favourites. But we have been favourites before and I think our players have deserved it. I think it's a situation to embrace. It's not something to be afraid of or be ashamed of. The guys have worked very hard to be in the position they are.' McGinley revealed that there would be no ban on players using social media during the week, adding: 'The last few Ryder Cups that I've been involved in the policy was to be aware of what you're doing and be aware of confidences to be breached and privacy. You have to trust the players at the end of the day.'","Paul McGinley says world No 1 Rory McIlroy is raring to go .

"A social media campaign has been launched to name and shame holidaymakers who take too much carry-on luggage on board planes. Travellers are urged to publish photos of flyers carrying large amounts of holdall baggage, using the hashtag #CarryOnShame. The campaign was launched by Spud Hilton in the US as airlines introduce higher fees for checked baggage - meaning more holidaymakers are opting for large carry-on bags to avoid paying the charges. Social media campaign: Spud Hilton tweets a photo of a woman carrying excess luggage . The . journalist and blogger wants airlines - which only have a limited amount . of space in overhead lockers - to crack down on passengers breaking the . rules and bringing on board excess bags. It . means due to people carrying larger bags, other passengers are forced . to check in their hand luggage, or store their bags rows away from their . seats. And . he is encouraging travellers to take photos of those carrying what . looks like excess luggage - naming and shaming them on social media. Campaign: Spud Hliton launched the initiative to draw attention to flyers who take too much luggage on flights . On his blog SFGate, Hilton writes: 'We’ve all seen them. The passengers at the gate dragging roller luggage that is more the size of a clown car than a carry-on. And of course they have a “personal item,” a bag or case in which you could smuggle a small pony.' He adds: 'Which is the bigger sin? The passenger disregarding the airline rules — or the airline not enforcing them? 'We . think it’s worth calling attention to both, which is why we’re asking . travelers at the airport (past security) to look for examples of . “carry-on shame,” to take pictures or videos of the obviously oversized . “carry-on” luggage and post them on Instagram, Twitter and Vine with the . hashtag #CarryonShame.' Online shaming: Photos of people carrying excess luggage have been shared on Twitter . The campaign has also spread to Australia.

"The five Olympic boxers from Cameroon who ‘vanished’ three weeks ago have reappeared at a South London gym for a sparring session. The boxers disappeared from the Olympic village with a swimmer and a footballer after being beaten in their bouts during the Games. It was confirmed on August 7 that the team had gone AWOL by David Ojong, Cameroon’s Olympics chief and had not returned home with the rest the athletes. Missing Cameroon Olympic athletes. Top L to R:  Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, Christin Donrack Adjoufack, Thomas Essomba, Drusille Ngako - Bottom row L to R; Paul Ekane Edingue, Serge Ambomo, Abdon Mewoli . Thomas Essomba of Cameroon departs the ring following victory in his match against Abdelali Daraa of Morocco during the London 2012 Olympic Games . Thomas Essomba was happy to fly punches but not to fly home . It was feared they were staying below the radar in the UK in a bid to secure permanent asylum once their Olympic accreditation had expired. However, the temptation of punchbags, dumbbells and medicine balls, was too much and the gym-goers blew their cover by turning up at a boxing gym in New Cross, South London. On Monday, the five boxers - Thomas Essomba, 24, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, 28, Yhyacinthe Mewoli Abdon, 26, Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, 27 and Serge Ambomo, 26 - showed up at the Double Jab Boxing Club in New Cross, South London. The Cameroon boxers failed to resist the lure of laying into a punchbag . It is alleged the group showed up and asked for a training session with coach Patrick Harris, after hearing he was a ‘top coach’. Jim Addis, an assistant coach at the boxing club, said this week: 'We were all completely gobsmacked when they turned up. 'We knew they had gone missing, but were dumbfounded when we realised who they were. 'They knew Patrick and asked especially for him and they all took part in sparring sessions.' Mr Addis said that as news spread of the team's appearance the gym became increasingly busy with regulars. He added: 'It was amazing - the gym was packed and the atmosphere was superb and was one of the best nights we have had here. 'It’s a great honour to have them in the gym and we are all over the moon - they have even asked to come back for more training.” The five boxers claimed they were ‘currently living in Lewisham’, with Mr Addis adding: 'They told me they wanted to stay here and were very keen to come back to the club. 'We all want to help them as much as we can and understand they will be applying to stay here in the UK.' Under Olympic accreditation rules the boxers can stay in the UK until November, but will then have to apply for permission to remain in the country. Two other Cameroon athletes also vanished at the same time as the boxers - Drusille Ngako Tchimi, 25, a stand-by goalkeeper for Cameroon’s women’s team, and swimmer Paul Ekane Edingue, 21, who are both still missing . Jackie Brock-Doyle, organiser Locog’s director of communications, said after the seven athletes went missing: 'They have been reported as missing but they have visas to stay in this country until November, so right now they haven’t done anything wrong. 'We are in quite a difficult position at the moment because they are able to be in this country, they are able to do what they like in this country, obviously within reason, but until that changes it is quite difficult.' The boxers fled from the Olympic Village after being beaten in their fights .

"The first tussle of this year's Ryder Cup appears to have been won by the United States after Europe captain Paul McGinley lost the early fashion battle with an ill-advised tartan jacket and gilet. The Ryder Cup has a long history of awful clothing, and while McGinley's combo will not trouble the the US shirts at Brookline in 1999 for top spot in the hall of shame, it is nevertheless not a promising start to the sartorial week in Scotland. But McGinley, who was waiting to greet the American team at Edinburgh airport, soon saw the opposition also score an own goal as Rickie Fowler unveiled a new haircut featuring 'USA' shaved into the right side. Paul McGinley, captain of Europe, was spotted sporting a tartan jacket and gilet as he waited with his wife, Alison (right), and Shona Robison, Scotland's Minister for Sport (left), for the US team at Edinburgh Airport . Rickie Fowler's shocking haircut was unveiled as the Amercian team disembarked from their flight . McGinley's tartan jacket may not be spotted at a Topman near you any time soon, but it is still a welcome tribute to the hosts of this year's Ryder Cup, which is being held at Gleneagles in Scotland and tees off proper with Friday's foursomes and fourballs. While American fans heading into the office this week are advised not to copy Fowler's brash barnet, the 25-year-old Californian's patriotic passion for the competition also comes shining through. In perhaps the biggest shock of all on Monday, it was Ian Poulter who was spotted wearing the most sensible dress. The flamboyant Englishman, who has sported Union Jack slacks and tartan trousers among many bold designs, was spotted hitting balls on the range in a plain grey jumper. Ian Poulter, surprisingly, was the most demurely dressed star on show, wearing grey at Gleneagles .

"The Manager From La Mancha did not go far enough. Vicente Del Bosque took the tweezers to his world champions when he should have swung an axe. A couple of changes from the Spain team ripped apart by Holland and a tinkering around the edges of a decaying system of play set up the beautiful game for this massively  redefining moment. When is a gamble not worth taking? When the poker player doesn’t know the time has come to go all in. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chile fans storm the media centre before Spain crashed out . Disaster: Vicente Del Bosque watched his Spain side crash out of the World Cup . Dejected: Spain's World Cup campaign has come to a premature end . Del Bosque planted a couple of saplings in the outfield when he should have chopped down half a team. Leaving Iker Casillas rooted in goal after his catastrophies against the Dutch was as much an act of cruelty as a grotesque excess of loyalty. Seeing him scrambling around on his knees as Chile scored their first, then palming a free kick down into his goalmouth to present them with a second was painfully embarrassing. Spain’s distinguished head coach knew that his job was as much on the line as the pride of a nation, the future of several of his most beloved players and the football ethos which had changed the world game for an enchanted while. Gutted: Del Bosque's position is under threat after Spain failed to reach knockout stages . Mayhem: Chile fans caused chaos before the game when they stormed the media centre before being lef away by police . Penned in: Chile fans sit beside a temporary wall that was torn down before the game . The cry was for drastic action. Instead he sought a compromise between the keep-ball style which had won three major tournaments in six years and the high-speed power game with which must of the rest of the world has been overtaking Spain. The issue was not only how well Spain would play but which way they would set about trying to rescue themselves from the humiliation of being knocked out after ony two games in defence of their title. Tiki-taka  or take a chance? Compromise is invariably the mother of disaster. Despite an invasion of the Maracana by hundreds of ticketless Chilean fans – who broke through fences and the police cordon, stampeded through the media centre and smashed holes in walls there to break into the  tunnels – the match started on time as if nothing untoward had happened. No hiding place: Calamity keeper Iker Casillas cost his country dear . Blunder: Casillas could only parry the ball away before Eduardo Vargas fired Chile in front . In the vast bowl of the stadium itself, the only security question on 74,000 minds was whether the world champions and their manager would survive the evening. Most prayed they would not. The overwhelming majority in the crowd had crossed the Andes to be here, not the Atlantic. The din they created, louder even than the full house of Brazl’s noisy neighbours from Argentina two days earlier, was especially sensitive to the ears of del Bosque. He had injected pace into the midfield, i the person of Pedro. At the expense of Xavi, the living legend who is his team-mate at Barcelona.

Out went Gerard Pique, another Barcelona veteran whose legs buckled under Holland’s five-goal onslaught in Spain’s first match. The good old boys in Barca put their heads in their hands. But nothing is forever. The manager was striving to answer the need for change without throwing out too many of the players and principles who have achieved so much. Down and out: Sergio Ramos struggles to hide his disappointment after Spain's World Cup exit . At 2-0 down at half time del Bosque knew more had to be done. Time was up for another icon. Xabi Alonso bowed out in favour of more energetic youth, by the one name of Koke. They went back out to strive for a miracle, while being prepared to die bravely in the attempt. Fernando Torres went to join them later, displacing the deeply disappointing but still Chelsea-bound Diego Costa. Then came Santi Cazorla. But where it had been too little to begin with, now it was too late. It is goodbye to Spain and hello to whoever becomes the new world champions. Farewell to tiki-taka and adios Senor del Bosque.

The app connects members based on location and their relative stages of pregnancy. Users can subscribe to people's posts, and send direct messages to make friends or arrange events. It was developed by the team behind Babyblog - a Russian site for pregnant women and mothers that has more than seven million monthly users. Developers at Motherroom are planning to launch a companion app ‘soon’ that will be for all parents to share photos of children of any age. ‘Preggie App makes it easy for pregnant women to discuss pregnancy and babies issues,’ explained the developers. ‘Unlike other social networks, there are no entrance barriers – once you install the application, you are surrounded by women who want to communicate. The app shows notifications (pictured left) and connects people based on location (pictured right), as well as by what stage of pregnancy members are at. A companion app is expected to be released 'soon' for fathers and parents of older children . ‘The app takes a completely unique approach: it links the user with hundreds of women in her local area so that they have a lot to share. ‘It is based on the-same-pregnancy-stage principle, which means letting the user read posts of ladies who are at the same week in their pregnancy.’ Preggie is available on iOS and the developers are working on an Android version. In 2012, developers created a Chrome plugin that automatically replaced images of babies on Facebook, with images of cats. It was originally called Unbaby.me, but changed to Rather and will now block any unwanted posts - from football-related statuses, to political opinions. It works by searching for keywords in statuses and posts.","Preggie is a social network app designed for expectant mothers .

"A couple who murdered a transvestite in order to claim his benefit money and left him to rot in a suitcase in their bathroom have been jailed for life for murder. Big Issue sellers Tracey Hurrell, 32, and David Hardman, 51, were told at Preston Crown Court they must serve a minimum of 23 years. Their victim Lionel Morl, 49, who was known locally as 'Susie' and wore women's clothes, false breasts and wigs was stabbed and beaten to death before being stuffed into the suitcase. Big Issue sellers Tracey Hurrell, left, and David Hardman, right, were today jailed for life for the brutal murder of Lionel Morl. The couple left the body of their victim in a suitcase for weeks after he was killed. But when police officers visited the flat on an unrelated matter they failed to inspect the case despite spotting it covered in a sleeping bag, saying it did 'not look out of place' in a house so strewn with rubbish. And despite the fact they noticed that Hurrell was said to be 'tetchy and agitated' and Hardman had glazed eyes during their visit, they failed to raise the alarm. The corpse was not discovered until ten days later in August last year when police officers went to a neighbouring address and noticed a 'terrible smell' coming from the property in Openshaw, Manchester. Hardman, who was a tenant at the address, then tried to pass off the smell as coming from an abscess on his foot. Victim Lionel Morl, 49, was stabbed and beaten to death before his body was stuffed in a suitcase and left to rot in the bathroom . The couple lived in squalid conditions in the house in Manchester, before a foul stench eventually alerted officers to Morl's body . The couple were both known addicts - with Hurrell a heroin and crack cocaine user, and Hardman drinking up to seven litres of cider a day. Gut wrenching photos of the flat show kitchen tops strewn with empty bottles of cider and spirits and piles of washing up and the lounge and bedrooms festooned with dumped clothing, bedding, books and paint pots. Hurrell initially lived with Hardman but then befriended Morl who lived in a neighbouring street before moving into his house after claiming she was homeless. Shortly afterwards she began bullying Morl, and on one occasion threatened him with a knife before he asked her to leave. hBot Hurrell and Hardman were known addicts, with Hardman drinking up to seven litres of cider a day . She and Hardman then began preying on Morl for his benefit money and the victim's post office card - which Morl had used to withdraw his fortnightly invalidity benefit of £200 - went missing. The card was used by the couple to withdraw £190 from Morl's account. It is believed Morl was attacked when he returned from a friend's house to his flat to collect his  glasses. The killers were later seen pulling a wheeled suitcase near to the house. Andrew Thomas QC, prosecuting, said WPCs Maria Campbell and Louse Macfarlane initially visited Hardman's flat but did not believe there was anything suspicious. Despite a visit from officers, police failed to notice the body stuffed into a suitcase in the couple's bathroom . The couple used victim Lionel Morl's post office card to withdraw funds from his account . Mr Thomas said: 'The flat was cluttered with junk. The officers saw the suitcase and by that stage it was in the flat in the bathroom under a sleeping bag. But there was no significant smell. 'The officers did not check the contents of the suitcase and eventually they left.' WPC Campbell told the jury she and her colleague often visited properties that smelt bad and were untidy. She told the court: 'Because the flat was in such a terrible state it didn't appear out of place to have a sleeping bag and suitcase in the bathroom.' After returning days later to the property, however, PC John Sutcliffe told the hearing the stench of the body was undeniable: 'The smell became increasingly worse. Both Hardman and Hurrell denied murder and blamed each other for the killing . The couple, who were both Big Issue sellers, lived in squalid conditions in their house in Manchester . 'It's a smell I recognise and it was very, very strong now. 'I cut the corner of the suitcase with my pocket knife and it revealed what I could see to be a human foot and what I thought was the side of a head.' Hurrell and Hardman were both subsequently arrested. A post-mortem examination showed that Lionel had died following a violent attack in which he had been stabbed and beaten. It is estimated he had been dead for about two weeks. The couple were jailed for life at Preston Crown Court, pictured, and told they must serve a minimum of 23 years . Hardman and Hurrell both denied murder - blaming each other for the killing. The couple were also both convicted of perverting the course of justice . Senior Investigating Officer, Andy Tattersall of Greater Manchester Police said after the case: 'Hurrell and Hardman were both dependent on alcohol and drugs and went to desperate lengths to obtain cash to fund their habits. 'This is reflected in the theft of Lionel's benefits before and after they killed him. Each blames the other for what happened and both have fabricated different stories so we might never know exactly what happened and why. 'What we do know is that from start to finish, they worked together: in stealing Lionel's benefits, in his violent murder and in trying to hide his body.'","Drug addicts Tracy Hurrell, 32, and David Hardman, 51, kept Lionel Morl's decomposing body for several weeks .

"A bride-to-be whose fiance was killed on his stag night while she was on holiday fought back tears of pride today as he was honoured at the church where they were due to marry. Debbie Smith, 23, said she was 'missing part of herself' but promised to 'stay strong' as she bid farewell to soldier Matt Cottrell, 24, at his funeral. Matt had just been recruited as a Sapper in the Royal Engineers when he was hit by a coach last month following a night out celebrating his forthcoming nuptials with Army comrades. Brave: Debbie Smith (right) clutches a tissue as she fights back tears during the funeral of her fiance Matt Cottrell, who died in a road accident on his stag night last month . 'I'm missing part of myself': Debbie described soldier Matt as her 'rock' while paying tribute to her fiance . He suffered serious head injuries and died at the scene. It is believed Debbie found out about the tragedy while on a family holiday abroad. Clutching a tissue, Debbie today attended a full military funeral service for her husband-to-be at Holy Trinity church in Southport, Merseyside. They were to due get wed there tomorrow. Matt was said to be Debbie’s 'rock' after her brother took his own life four years ago. In a message on a floral wreath, Debbie wrote: 'Love you Matt, I really miss you. Hope you are looking over me. Immense grief: Debbie was accompanied by family and friends at the full military funeral service at Holy Trinity church in Southport, Merseyside, where they were due to get married . Highest honour: Matt's colleagues carry his coffin at the military service, which included a firing party of soldiers on the church gardens . Poignant: The church service opened with the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, which was due to be played at the couple's wedding day . 'I’m missing part of myself. Don’t know if I’ll ever feel the same again. I feel numb and empty sometimes. 'Find myself lost then I think of you and how much you should still be here. I miss my brother. Feel alone and scared for myself and the people I love and care about most dear. I’m staying strong for you. I love you matt forever.' In pouring rain, she and fellow mourners were greeted by 60 Army colleagues, including a firing party of uniformed soldiers on the church gardens as well as guards who stood near the entrance. A Union flag was draped over his coffin and cream floral wreaths spelling their name ‘Cotty’ were placed along one side. The service opened with All Things Bright and Beautiful, which was due to be played at their wedding day. The couple’s favourite song, Ed Sheeran’s Kiss Me, was also played. 'Don¿t know if I¿ll ever feel the same again': Debbie's touching message to Matt on a floral wreath in which she describes how she feels 'numb and empty' without him . 'Will always love you': A floral tribute from Matt's brother . Rev Rod Garner, who was due to officiate at the wedding, told mourners: 'I cannot tip-toe around that Matthew has died suddenly and that tomorrow here in this place, this would have been his wedding day to Debbie.' 'I had known Debbie quite well from years past, but Matthew was the new kid on the block - and I wasn’t sure. 'He was a bit shy, self-contained, a bit of a lad I thought, but after a few meetings and phone calls I began to warm to him very considerably. I had good feelings for him and for the two of them, a sound partnership with a promising future. 'It was obvious the prospective couple really loved each other.' He said the word 'happy' was often used to describe Matt whenever he had visited the family since his death. 'The uncomplicated word happy - and it’s what we all want to be,' he added. 'One of the guys': Matt had just been recruited as a Sapper in the Royal Engineers when he died last month . 'The happy baby, the happy boy at school and at home. His mind was curious and was eager to learn - he wanted to know how things worked. He was an engineer in the making. 'Happy in the past five or six years when they have been together - the quiet, simply intimacy of two very young people, happy to be together in love. 'There has been the acceptance that life is precarious, that time and chance sometimes come together in tragic ways and that love pledged forward sometimes is cut short. 'It is an incredibly sad event. They were both genuinely looking forward to the wedding. 'He was going to be posted to Germany for five years and she was going to move with him. I was due to see them for their wedding rehearsal when he was killed.' After a prayer, Matthew’s father Steven Cottrell, an ex-member of the Royal Engineers, read A Salute to the Engineers by Rudyard Kipling. Tragedy: Matt was walking along a notorious, unlit stretch of the A35 at Bloxworth, Dorset, at 3am when he was hit from behind by the single-decker coach . Inseparable: Matt was going to be posted to Germany for five years and Debbie was planning to move with him . Captain Matt Teeling said of Matt: 'He was a very physically and mentally robust individual. He was a great credit to his family. He was one of the guys, he was relied upon to hold everyone together. 'He motivated them to go forward. He got things done. He was always a positive, happy-go-lucky individual with a smile on his face.' He said men had come from all over the country to pay respects to the popular soldier. The tragedy occurred on June 23 after former mechanic Matt, who was training at the Bovington barracks in Dorset, had been out with colleagues to celebrate his forthcoming wedding. He had hailed a cab to make his way back to base, but abandoned the taxi half-way home because he had run out of money. He was walking along a notorious, unlit stretch of the A35 at Bloxworth, Dorset, at 3am when he was hit from behind by the single-decker coach. Army colleagues dashed to the scene and tried in vain to revive him. Matt’s parents Julie and Steve, a former TA soldier, and brothers Paul and Luke, were said to be 'absolutely devastated' at his death. The coach driver, 55, from Bournemouth, who is believed not to have seen Matt was treated for shock. There were no passengers on the coach. An inquest into Spr Cottrell’s death was opened and adjourned at Bournemouth coroner’s court. The cause of death was withheld awaiting toxicology results. Sgt Dave Stroud, from Dorset Police, described the accident as a 'poignant and tragic case'.","Debbie Smith, 23, promises to stay strong as she bid farewell to her 'rock'

"Miguel Cotto’s sensational stoppage of all-time middleweight great Sergio Martinez forces another revision of this column’s world pound-for-pound ratings. Now the first in the heroic history of Puerto Rican fighting men to win world titles in four different weight divisions, Cotto climbs back into boxing’s elite. When they fought in New York two weekends ago Martinez was clearly past his prime, his phenomenal athleticism limited by the succession of injuries which had kept him out of the ring for almost a year. Sensational: Miguel Cotto surprisingly stopped Sergio Martinez and climbed back into boxing's elite . Champion: Cotto would be too mobile for Floyd Mayweather and would beat the Money Man, says Freddie Roach . Nevertheless the Argentine remains a master of his craft and forcing his corner to pull him out in the tenth represents a considerable triumph. Cotto looked to be on the wane himself after he was taken apart by Manny Pacquiao a couple of years ago but such is the fraternity of the hardest game that he has the PacMan to thank for his renaissance. The pair have sparred frequently since Cotto was taken on by Pacquiao’s master trainer Freddie Roach. Their sessions at Roach’s Wild Card gym in Los Angeles gave Cotton the best of both worlds – the best possible coaching put into practice courtesy of one of the two greatest boxers of our time. Roach says: ‘I was confident Miguel was going to beat Martinez and of course it pleases me that he’s made me look good while doing it. The way Manny does.’ Helping hand: Manny Pacquiao has let Cotto train in his Wild Card gym, with successful results . Strong words: Freddie Roach reckons the new, improved Cotto would knock out Floyd Mayweather . 1)    Floyd Mayweather (unchanged) 2)    Manny Pacquiao (unchanged) 3)    Wladimir Klitschko (unchanged) 4)    Guillermo Rigondeaux (unchanged) 5)    Andre Ward (unchanged) 6)    Juan Manuel Marquez (up 1) 7)    Carl Froch (up 1) 8)    Miguel Cotto (new) 9)    Tim Bradley (unchanged) 10)   Adonis Stevenson (unchanged) With Pacquiao now back in the big-time following his brilliant reversal of that scandalous decision given against him and favour of Tim Bradley, Roach’s stock is now sky-high again. He gives much of the credit for his remarkable defiance of Parkinson’s disease to the adrenalin generated by the rigours of the sport and Cotto is supplying an additional surge. He has also given his career and earning potential a significant boost. Although the closeness of their professional relationship makes a return match with Pacquiao unlikely, Cotto could be back in the mix for a chance to avenge his 2012 defeat by Floyd Mayweather. Roach says: ‘The new Cotto, with his improved movement, would be too mobile for Floyd now and I believe he would knock him out.’ All powerful reasons for welcoming him to the top 10. I bring him in at eighth, which with Martinez dropping out serves to lift Carl Froch another place higher to seventh in this list (above right). Brian Rose goes by the ring moniker The Lion and it always looked as if he would be walking into the den of his feline namesakes in New York on Saturday night. And so it was that although the brave boy from Blackpool had only been off his feet once before, in his only previous defeat, he was on the wrong end of a mauling by Rhode Island’s Demetrius Andrade. A bridge too far: Brian Rose was well beaten in New York by Demetrius Andrade . Since he had been decked in the first and the third rounds and was taking a beating, it might have been a kindness had his corner pulled Rose out at the end of the sixth. But the inevitable stoppage was delayed only for another minute and 19 seconds. Rose had said himself that he considered Andrade to be the weakest of the 154lb belt holders. So the sad conclusion has to be that although he is fine competitor at domestic and European level, he may be just short of world class.","Martinez past his prime but Cotto's victory was still huge .

The Drachenstich play, which means Spearing the Dragon or more literally, dragon stab, has been performed in the town of Furth im Wald for the past 500 years. Its story is a take on the legend of Saint George and was adapted during the early 1950s to symbolise the threat of communism from the East. The current plot centres around the Hussite wars from the 15th Century. The dragon is made up of two hydraulic circuits consisting of 272 valves, 50 drives and uses 165 litres of oil. It also has 4,265ft of electric cables and 360ft or pneumatic lines. Fanny can travel at around one mile per hour using its 140hp engine. The beast also carries 80 litres of stage blood, which squirts out of its back when it is lanced with a spear during the play. Fanny, pictured, stars in the Drachenstich play which has been performed in the town of Furth im Wald for the past 500 years. Its story is a take on the legend of Saint George . Each of Fanny's legs has seven degrees of motion, which means it can move laterally and walk around corners. A spokesman from Zollner Elektronik AG said: 'Realising a radio remote-controlled, outdoor-capable four-legged robot walking robot in unheard-of dimensions, was what really motivated the developers and designers.

"She has been putting on a brave face since her split from husband Tom Cruise last week. But despite her smiling exterior the strain of Katie Holmes' break-up is showing itself in other ways - most notably her rail-thin body. The actress failed to hide her shrinking frame when she spent the day with her child by the Mission Impossible actor, Suri, six. Scroll down for video . Taking its toll? Katie Holmes put on a brave face yesterday as she showed off her rail-thin figure while carrying daughter Suri in New York after splitting from Tom Cruise . Loose fit: Katie's halter-neck top was hanging off her - and she didn't appear to be in need of a bra . The 33-year-old's blue and orange . halterneck top clearly displayed her bony back and angular collarbone . and her blue jeans seemed to hang off her. Her outing came as Tom's lawyer lashed out at Katie and her legal team, accusing them of 'playing the media'. High profile lawyer Bert . Fields spoke to BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. He would not be drawn on . specific details of the divorce - but did stick the knife in and . insisted Tom was 'really sad about what's happening'. Bony: Katie displayed her shrinking frame on a day out with daughter Suri . Rail-thin: Katie's halterneck top clearly showed off her bony back and her jeans seemed to hang off her . While Katie attempted a steely . resolve today, Suri Cruise looked tired and strained by the emotional . custody battle her parents are to embark on. The six-year-old is currently dealing with the news that her parents are set for a high-profile divorce. Katie held her daughter tenderly in her arms during a trip with friends - and of course security - to the Children's Museum of the Arts in the Soho area of New York City. Little Suri, dressed in a pink dress and holding onto a cuddly toy, clung to her actress mother. Exhausted: Suri Cruise looks tired by the news her . parents are set for a custody battle following their divorce . Yesterday, Katie - who filed for divorce from the Hollywood . star last week - spent American holiday Independence Day as a single . mother for the first time. The Dawson's Creek beauty was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment stocking up on food supplies. Making her way to the store, dressed . casually in a denim shirt and a floral summery skirt, the mother-of-one . looked feminine and pretty as she skipped along with Suri, who was in . the same multi-coloured poppy dress she was in the night before. Inside . the market, Suri rode in the front of the shopping cart playing with a . pale pink cowboy hat, with Katie photographing her wearing it. Growing closer: The girls rarely leave each other's side, with Katie often seen carrying Suri . The mother and daughter duo were accompanied by one of Katie's bodyguards from her top heavy security team. During the outing Katie reassured fans that she is coping following the split from the Hollywood star. Approached as she stocked up on food, Katie told a New York Daily News reporter: 'I'm alright. Thank you.' Meanwhile . it emerged that Katie Holmes is set to show her label Holmes & Yang at New York Fashion Week this September for the first time. A spokesperson for Katie told WWD that her personal life would not impact her fashion label, despite her high-profile split from Tom Cruise last week. Taking life into her hands: Katie stepped out braless and ringless as she moves on to the 'new phase' of her life . Protected: Katie was flanked by a burly security guard . The newly-single 33-year-old actress . co-designs the label, which launched in 2009, with her stylist and . long-time friend Jeanne Yang. Available at Barneys New York, Holmes . & Yang specialise in wearable day-to-night pieces and luxury basics . that are all manufactured in the U.S. Katie told the New York Times: 'We . know that women are on the go and do a lot of different sorts of things . all in one day. Hopefully, [Holmes & Yang] helps to provide them . with some confidence in attacking all those different roles.' Ms Yang added: 'We wanted to make pieces that you could bend over and pick up your kid in and also look really elegant. Helping hand: Suri was guided along by her mother, who tenderly placed an arm on each of her daughter's shoulders . Tea time: Katie and Suri also had a meal at Alice's tea cup during their girly day out together . 'Just comfortable clothes that you can wear going from a meeting to being a mom to going on a date.' Mission accomplished. Season after . season, Holmes & Yang creates a base palette of cream, navy, and . black, featuring luxe shirts and trousers; textured silk jumpsuits; . motorcycle jackets; leather, silk-lined blazers; and dresses worthy of . the red carpet. Showing their spring collection in . New York for the first time with an intimate presentation, instead of a . runway show, will firmly put Katie back on the high-fashion map. Since her marriage to Tom Cruise in . 2006, and her first foray into couture the same year with Victoria . Beckham, the golden girl of Dawson's Creek has kept a low profile within . the fashion industry.

Moving on: Katie Holmes was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment yesterday, stocking up on supplies . The . 50-year-old actor was said to be 'blindsided' when his wife filed for . divorce from him last week after five years of marriage and sought legal . custody of their child - intends to go to court in Los Angeles in . person to ensure he is legally allowed to see the youngster. Katie filed for the divorce in New . York because she believes she has a better chance of winning custody, . and although Tom was encouraged to file in California, the law states divorce cannot be filed in separate states at the same time. A . source said: 'Tom has told Dennis Wasser and Bert Fields, his long-time . entertainment lawyer, that his first priority is getting a court order . in place, obviously a temporary one, that will allow him to legally see . his daughter.

'Tom is extremely disappointed that Katie filed in New York, and he feels that she is trying to cut him out of their daughter's life. 'Tom won't tolerate it and told his lawyers that if he personally needs to go to court and make a plea in front of the judge for an order allowing him to see his daughter, he will.' It is believed Katie wants legal custody because she is worried about Tom's devotion to sci-fi cult Scientology and the effect the quasi-religious sect may have on their six-year-old daughter. However a source told TMZ: '[Katie] was totally committed to Scientology. She had enthusiasm for it and would voluntarily and gladly participate in it when Tom was off shooting movies. 'This is not a fight over religion. It's being used as a way to hurt Tom.'

"There were more questions than answers for Spain on Thursday night after an unbeaten qualifying run stretching back 36 games across eight years came to an end. It was not so much the defeat, as the symptoms of malaise that were so apparent at the World Cup and show no signs of lifting. No one quite knows why Diego Costa can score nine goals in nine matches for Chelsea and yet fail to score in any of his first six games for his adopted country. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Spain in training as they prepare for Luxembourg . Spain's players Cesc Fabregas (centre) and Diego Costa (right) look dejected after Slovakia's late winer . Former Chelsea midfielder Miroslav Stoch celebrates scoring a late winner to compound Spain's misery . No one really understands why the greatest goalkeeper in Spain’s history, Iker Casillas, and as of Thursday night the second most capped European international ever, can no longer be guaranteed to make straightforward saves. And no-one can fathom why a team that conceded just one goal as it won Euro 2012 now struggles to put together a defence worthy of the name. Costa’s drought is made all the more baffling by the fact that he has club team-mate Cesc Fabregas alongside him in the national team. The pair linked well against Slovakia but without success. Costa struggled for his country again, failing to score in any of his first six games for his adopted country . Some commentators argue that Spain are too narrow to give Costa the service he requires. Vicente del Bosque’s decision to drop Manchester City’s Jesus Navas was one that puzzled most commentators and with Andres Iniesta and David Silva on the wings – both preferring to come inside with the ball – there is a lack of decent service into the striker from wide areas. While Costa has failed to score in six, Valencia’s young striker Paco Alcacer has two in two and played instead of Costa when Spain beat Macedonia in their first qualifying match 5-1. There were calls for him to be kept in the side and when he came on, on Thursday night he scored almost immediately. Chelsea's star endured another frustrating night in a Spain shirt as his international goal drought continued . Valencia’s young striker Paco Alcacer came off the bench to equalise for Vicente Del Bosque's side . No one doubts Costa’s ability. But if Spain are to play the style of football that saw them win three straight tournaments many argue Alcacer’s mobility and ability to link with his midfielders better suits the team’s needs. In goal Casillas cuts a sad figure. On Thursday he pulled off one brilliant save from Robert Mak but 10 minutes later could be seen fumbling at a free-kick that back in his pomp he would have thrown his proverbial cap on. He is desperate for the disappointing World Cup not to be his last tournament and there have been signs in recent weeks at Real Madrid that he is getting back to his best. Here's the view from the Spanish press with AS stating 'Spain Continue from the World Cup. without aim, without luck and a gift from Casillas' whereas Sport highlights Iker Casillas' calamitous performance in goal . Real Madrid's keeper Iker Casillas made a glaring error, fumbling a free-kick for Slovakia's opening goal . But the latest mistake will encourage those who want him out of the side. In David De Gea Del Bosque has an in-form replacement. But Spain’s defensive problems go deeper than Casillas’ form. There is a serious centre-back shortage not helped by the fact that most top sides in La Liga don’t have a Spanish central defensive partnership. A lack of homegrown talent has been a typically English problem in the recent past but now Del Bosque, like Roy Hodgson, is scratching his head at a serious shortage of options. Barcelona have preferred Argentine Javier Mascherano and Frenchman Jeremy Mathieu so far this season, leaving Gerard Pique watching from the bench. Barcelona's Gerard Pique (left) and Spain coach Vicente del Bosque (right) look glum at the final whistle . At Real Madrid Sergio Ramos either has a French partner in Raphael Varane or a Portuguese accomplice in Pepe. And last season’s title-winning campaign at Atletico Madrid was based on a pairing of Uruguayan Diego Godin and Brazilian Miranda. Such are the changes made by Michel Platini to European Championship qualifiying that there seems little chance Spain will not be in France for the 2016 tournament. But the questions will need answering in the meantime. Perhaps some of the solutions will be on show on Friday afternoon when the likes of Juventus striker Alvaro Morata, Liverpool full backs Alberto Moreno and Javi Manquillo, former Everton loanee Gerard Deulofeu, and Stoke City defender Marc Muniesa will all be on show for the Under 21s.","Vicente del Bosque's side last lost a qualifier in 2006 against Sweden .

"An LGBT advocacy group has moved the location of a conference it is planning to hold later this year from the Beverly Hills Hotel to a different location in protest of anti-gay policies being adopted by the Sultan of Brunei - the owner of the hotel - that calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death. The Gill Action Fund, which was founded by activist Tim Gill, was scheduled to host its 'Winning the Heartland' conference for political donors at the Hotel from May 1-4. However, because of the draconian laws regarding 'sexual crimes' Brunei is set to adopt later this month, the group has canceled its conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel and is looking for a new location. The organizers of the annual Oscars Night Before Party have announced that they are joining the growing boycott of the Beverley Hills Hotel and will be hosting their event elsewhere in 2015 . Sharia: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah plans to implement a Sharia Penal Code, which calls for the stoning of gays . 'In light of the horrific anti-gay policy approved by the Government of . Brunei, Gill Action made the decision earlier today to relocate its . conference from the Beverly Hills Hotel to another property,' Gill Action Executive Director Kirk Fordham told washingtonblade.com. 'We are seeking a return of all deposits.' Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced last year that his tiny, oil-rich nation would begin to implement a Shariah Penal Code in his country, which calls for grisly executions of anyone committing a variety of sexual 'crimes,' including sodomy, adultery and rape. 'By the grace of Allah, with the coming into effect of this legislation, our duty to Allah is therefore being fulfilled,' the sultan said at a legal conference in Brunei's capital last year. The law would apply only to Muslims, who comprise about two-thirds of the population of nearly 420,000 people. The others follow mainly Buddhist, Christianity and indigenous beliefs. Boycott: The Gill Action Fund, started by activist Tim Gill, is taking its business elsewhere . Brunei's Mufti Awang Abdul Aziz, the country's top Islamic scholar, said last year that Shariah law 'guarantees justice for everyone and safeguards their well-being.' 'Let us not just look at the hand-cutting or the stoning or the caning per se, but let us also look at the conditions governing them,' Awang said. 'It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning. There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair.' Under secular laws, Brunei already prescribes caning as a penalty for crimes including immigration offenses, for which convicts can be flogged with a rattan cane. The United Nations already has criticized Brunei's adoption of the Sharia Penal Code, claiming it does not meet international human rights standards. 'Under international law, stoning people to death constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is thus clearly prohibited,” UN High Commission on Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville said last week. Even before the new penal code was adopted, homosexual acts were punishable by up to 10 years in prison in Brunei. Dorchester: The hotel is owned by the Dorchester Group, which is controlled by the Sultan and owns other hotels throughout the world . The . LGBT rights group behind the secret conference for high-dollar LGBT . donors announced Thursday it has cancelled plans to hold the event at . the Beverly Hills Hotel following news that its owner, the Sultan of . Brunei, would institute a policy in his country to punish gay people . with death by stoning. The OutGiving conference, known this year as “Winning the Heartland,” was set as of Thursday to take place at the Beverly Hills Hotel from . May 1-4, according to the registration website for the conference. The hotel is owned by Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, who . announced this month plans for his country to start punishing same-sex . relations with death by stoning in addition to subjecting perpetuators . of rape, adultery and extramarital sexual relations to the same . punishment. That policy would be consistent with Islamic Sharia law in . the predominately Muslim country. After the Washington Blade raised the connection on Thursday with the . Gill Action Fund, which organizes OutGiving, the organization said it . had notified the hotel earlier in the day the conference would no longer . take place at that location. Kirk Fordham, executive director of Gill Action, informed the Blade . that a new venue would be chosen in the aftermath of the announcement . from the sultan of Brunei. “In light of the horrific anti-gay policy approved by the Government . of Brunei, Gill Action made the decision earlier today to relocate its . conference from the Beverly Hills Hotel to another property,” Fordham . said. “We are seeking a return of all deposits.“ . The United Nations has already criticized the new policy in Brunei. Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the U.N. High . Commissioner for Human Rights said, “Application of the death penalty . for such a broad range of offences contravenes international law.” Even before the latest policy announcement, Brunei had a law on the . books unfavorable to gay people. Homosexual acts were punishable with up . to 10 years in prison. LGBT activists have previously targeted the Beverly Hills Hotel for . its connections to Brunei and its anti-gay policy. Last year, the group . Dump the Beverly Hills Hotel posted a quirky online video where individuals announced they were “breaking up” with the hotel unless its owners changed their homophobic ways. Fordham didn’t immediately respond to a follow-up email asking why . the Beverly Hills Hotel was chosen for OutGiving in the first place . given the anti-gay policies of Brunei prior to the latest announcement . and the criticism to which the hotel has been subjected. The OutGiving conference is geared toward high-roller donors whose . philanthropic giving each year exceeds $25,000 and who are interested in . the LGBT movement. Tickets for this year’s conference are $1,750 per . person. No media are permitted at the conference and attendees are told . to keep the discussions during the conference a secret. Leslie Lefkowitz, a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Hotel, said in . response to the OutGiving cancellation that conferences sometimes . decide to change venues. “In the hotel industry, it is not uncommon for organizations to . change aspects of their corporate programs, including the scope, date . and/or venues of planned events,” Lefkowitz said. “Anytime a valued . business partner decides to alter their plans, we respect their right to . do so and look forward to the next opportunity to be of service to . them.” During the 2012 OutGiving conference, which took place in D.C. at the . Mandarin Oriental Hotel, speakers included former Republican National . Committee chair Ken Mehlman; Prop 8 attorney Ted Olson; Mary Bonauto of . Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders; U.S. congressional . candidate Sean Eldridge; Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.); Sen. Susan Collins .

"All of the designs were scrapped for being 'too ahead of their time', too expensive or too complicated . A graveyard of previously unseen Thunderbird-style inventions, designed by British engineers in the 1960s, has been brought to life as sketches and animations by a UK defence firm. The forgotten designs were unearthed in BAE Systems' archives and include a hypersonic space-plane capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound, a jeep that leaps over enemy blockades and a commercial aircraft able to take off and land vertically from city centres. All of the designs were scrapped for being 'too ahead of their time', too expensive or too complicated. Scroll down for video . The Jumping Jeep was developed by BAC Warton at the request of the British army in the 1960s. It would have been powered by 12 vertical lift fans attached to the side of a 4x4 transporter. The angle of the fans could be adjusted dependent on the situation . This concept design taken from BAE System's archives is of a Fighter Jet Take-Off Platform. If developed it would have been a platform that rose vertically from the ground with an aircraft attached to its back. The attached jet could then take off without the need of a runway . A Massachusetts-based firm recently unveiled plans for a flying car that is small enough to fit in a garage, and doesn't need a runway to take off. The TF-X can take off from a vertical position because of motorised rotors on the wings. These rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors. Being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways, car parks and even when stuck in traffic. Although you will still need at least 100 feet in diameter in order to open the wings. According to designers Terrafugia, the vehicle will carry four people 'in car-like comfort'. It is expected to be able to fly, nonstop, for 500 miles. BAE has used animation to show how the . projects might have looked if developed further, with many worthy of a . place in the fleet of International Rescue in the Thunderbirds science . fiction series of the era. The display coincides with the opening of a new centre to celebrate BAE's heritage at its military aircraft factory in Warton, Lancashire. It has more than one million historical documents and artefacts in its stores. The unique designs were produced by engineers in BAE Systems' predecessor companies including English Electric, Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation. BAE's heritage manager Howard Mason said: 'Although 50 years have passed since these extraordinary designs were first put to paper, we can see how some of the technologies and ideas were developed over time and put to use now in aircraft like the F35 Joint Strike Fighter.' Mr Mason hopes the examples of forward thinking will still inspire young people who are considering a career in engineering and considering the 'endless possibilities' of what could be designed. Among the shelved designs uncovered by BAE Systems was the hypersonic aircraft. In 1964, the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) designed a hypersonic aircraft capable of flight at five times the speed of sound. It was nicknamed MUSTARD (Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device). The MUSTARD (Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device) would have been the world's first reusable 'space plane'. The designs showed the plane would have been made of three separate crewed, delta-winged sections that were launched as a single unit . The project would have created the world's first reusable 'space plane', with the cost of development having been estimated as '20 to 30 times cheaper' than the expendable rocket systems which eventually put man on the moon five years later in 1969. The aircraft was made of three separate crewed, delta-winged sections that are launched as a single unit. Two of those would act as boosters and launch the third into space. They would then separate before returning to Earth like normal aircraft, followed by the third once its intended mission was complete. The government decided not to proceed with the project though, prompting Tom Smith - one of the developers - to comment that MUSTARD was too 'far ahead of its time', and that there was 'nothing worse than being right at the wrong time'. An artist's impression of what he MUSTARD space plane's three delta-winged sections would have looked like after launch. Two of the sections would act as boosters and launch the third into space. They would then separate before returning to Earth once its intended mission was complete . The costs of the MUSTARD project were estimated as '20 to 30 times cheaper' than the expendable rocket systems which put man on the moon in 1969. The government decided not to proceed with the project though because of budget constraints. Its developer Tom Smith said MUSTARD was too 'far ahead of its time' The ideas behind that original aircraft can still be seen today in current delta-winged space aircraft such as Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, XCOR's Lynx Mk.III as well as early designs for the U.S. Space Shuttle. The Intercity Vertical-Lift Aircraft design from the Hawker Siddeley company was an attempt to bring vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) to commercial aircraft. It would have allowed airlines to put airports in densely-populated cities that would have opened up more direct travel for passengers and cut down on the amount of space required for airport runways. A number of designs were drawn up over the 1960s, looking very similar to modern-day passenger planes, each featuring rows of lift fans on either side of the body of the plane. This sketch shows the Intercity Vertical-Lift Aircraft design discovered in BAE Systems' archives. It was an attempt to bring vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) to commercial aircraft which would have meant airports could be placed in city centres . The Intercity Vertical-Lift Aircraft design from the Hawker Siddeley company was dropped after it was decided that together with the cost of fuel required to fly the aircraft and the extra load from the frames housing the lift fans, combined with the weight of passengers, could lead to instability in flight . The project was eventually dropped after it was decided that together with the cost of fuel required to fly the aircraft and the extra load from the frames housing the lift fans, combined with the weight of passengers, could lead to instability in flight. VTOL systems inspired by the project are still in use today however, through the F-35 Lightning II, with adaptations of the vertical lift fans having been engineered by BAE Systems to improve some of the most versatile military jets in the world. The 'Jumping Jeep' was a concept reconnaissance vehicle that was capable of leaping over obstacles and enemy blockades during battle. It would have been powered by 12 vertical lift fans attached to the side of a 4x4 transporter. The angle of the fans could be adjusted dependent on the situation. The 'Jumping Jeep' project was developed with the Ministry of Defence's Fighting Vehicle Research and Development Establishment but was cancelled in the mid-1960s due to assessments that production of the design would be too expensive . Developed by BAC Warton at the request of the British army in the 1960s, the design was an attempt to adapt vertical take-off and landing technology to vehicles and was developed with the Ministry of Defence's Fighting Vehicle Research and Development Establishment. Yet the project was cancelled in the mid-1960s due to assessments that production of the design would be too expensive. And the Fighter Jet Take-Off Platform was a concept platform that would rise vertically from the ground, and make it possible for an aircraft to take-off from its back. This would let planes operate from small airstrips or narrow forest clearings. English Electric developed the P17A jet and rather than attaching a heavy vertical take-off and landing system to the aircraft, it collaborated with Belfast-based Shorts to create the P17D - a platform that would stay steady above the ground and allow the P17A to take-off from its surface . Using 56 jet engines, the P17D platform, pictured,  gave the P17A jet the desired effect of being able to take off from tight spaces such as forest clearings. It was not picked for further consideration due to the complexity of its operation and a lack of available budget .

Using 56 jet engines, the P17D gave the P17A the desired effect of being able to take off from tight spaces. On its own, the P17D would also have been able to fill the role of a VTOL freight transport, able to deliver equipment and supplies to less-accessible locations.

Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'This was an extremely . traumatic incident where emergency services were working on the family . at the scene and subsequently in ambulances and at the hospital, and it . has been traumatic on all those involved. 'It was a head-on collision at speed. The black Vectra was coming down the hill and appears to have swerved . into the path of the oncoming car.; . He added the adverse weather . conditions being experienced throughout the country did not contribute . to the cause of the collision. Mr Netherton said because the driver . of a police car witnessed the crash, the force has referred the matter . to the Independent Police Complaints Commission as a matter of course.

"All things being equal Angel Di Maria should be on the Ballon d’Or podium at the end of the year. He made a huge contribution to Real Madrid winning the Champions League and then played a massive part in Argentina reaching the World Cup final. For inspiring success with both club and country he is out on his own. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo flicks Di Maria the V during Madrid training . Real deal: Manchester United are ready to spend £100m to take Angel Di Maria from Madrid . Of course all things are not equal. He doesn’t have the huge publicity machines behind him that other candidates have, he is not adored the world over and as far as poster-boy looks go, he’s more hall of mirrors than hall of fame. That in part is why Real Madrid are happy to let him go. The image just isn’t there; the football most definitely is. Carlo Ancelotti, who only cares about football and is not the slightest bit interested in image, wants to keep Di Maria. He helped reinvent him last season just to keep him in the side. Last summer Gareth Bale, Isco and Cristiano Ronaldo were set to play behind Karim Benzema in a 4-2-3-1 with Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric in midfield. World class: Manchester United target  Di Maria had a superb tournament in Brazil with Argentina . Please don't go: Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti is a massive fan of Di Maria but could lose him to United . When Bale missed much of the start of the campaign Di Maria was able to continue playing wide, but when Bale returned he was dropped undeservedly, booed by a mindless minority who just wanted to see the expensive new signing, and in one match responded to being taken off by grabbing his crotch for the cameras as he walked off as if to say: ‘That’s what I think of that’. Ancelotti kept the faith because he knew the assists, the goals and the incredible stamina would be invaluable as Madrid tried to win the Treble. As Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella said during the last World Cup: ‘The longer the game goes on the more he seems to run.' Ancelotti found a way to play Di Maria by switching to a 4-3-3, which didn’t really suit Isco, and which was perfect for the Argentine’s box-to-box energy. There was now no room for him as a winger because of Bale’s arrival on one flank and Ronaldo’s presence on the other but on the left of a midfield three, he was outstanding. Just not outstanding enough to curb the insatiable thirst for new players and the need for someone big to be sold to fund the latest arrivals. Tuning up: Di Maria training with Madrid last week but his days in Spain could be numbered . The line coming out of Madrid is that Di Maria wants to go but it’s more a case of him taking the hint as every year Real Madrid buy someone who plays in his position. Last year it was Bale and this year it’s James Rodriguez. He is also depicted as a money grabber who always wants a pay-rise but what he wants is something approaching parity with Bale, Benzema and new man Rodriguez. Why shouldn’t he ask for that after the season he has just had? Instead Madrid have him on around £2.4million  take-home pay a year that puts him in the third bracket of their wage structure, behind midfield team-mate Modric and a long way from the club’s top earners.

Not since ushering Arjen Robben towards the exit in 2009, much to the displeasure of then coach Manuel Pellegrini, have Real been so keen to lose such an important player. We all know what happened to Robben after he left the Bernabeu – three Champions League finals and one World Cup final – so maybe Manchester United would be wise to move for Robben Mark II. The only lingering question mark would hang over where he might fit into Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 template at United. He could perhaps operate to the right of Luke Shaw in the five across the middle although that could leave Juan Mata and Ander Herrera contesting the same position. He could play in attack or in midfield in a 4-3-3 but where does Mata fit into that system? Di Maria’s flexibility would certainly help Van Gaal complete the attacking puzzle although one question would still need to be answered: Why spend £100m on Di Maria when most agree centre back and central midfield are the team’s real problem positions?

"A sense of fairness separates apes and humans from other animals and evolved to promote the benefits of long-term co-operation, experts claim. Scientists came to the conclusion after studying the 'evolutionary puzzle' for more than 10 years. While monkeys and dogs became upset when treated unfairly, only humans and their great ape cousins voluntarily allowed themselves to be disadvantaged in the interests of fair play. A paper co-authored by Dr Sarah Brosnan from Georgia State University reviewed research into the sense of fairness in animals. They found only humans and apes have a true understanding of justice. Both disadvantage themselves to the benefit of others to avoid negative confrontations (stock image shown) The trait is not entirely self-less, the researchers note, but rather it is the result of wanting to avoid negative 'pay back' from a dissatisfied partner and ensure future co-operation. The paper reviewing research into the trait was published in the journal Science and was co-authored by psychologist Dr Sarah Brosnan from Georgia State University . 'Giving up an outcome that benefits you in order to gain long-term benefits from the relationship requires not only an ability to think about the future, but also the self-control to turn down a reward,' she said. Crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, research has shown. Scientists came to the conclusion after subjecting six wild New Caledonian crows to a battery of tests designed to challenge their understanding of cause and effect. Thetasks were all variations of the Aesop's fable in which a thirsty crow drops stones to raise the level of water in a pitcher. In the 'water displacement task', crows worked out how to catch floating food rewards by dropping heavy objects into water-filled tubes. They demonstrated an ability to drop sinking rather than floating objects, solid rather than hollow objects, to choose a high water level tube over one with low water level, and a water-filled tube over one filled with sand. 'These both require a lot of cognitive control. Therefore, we hypothesise that lots of species respond negatively to getting less than a partner, which is the first step in the evolution of fairness, but only a few species are able to make the leap to this second step, which leads to a true sense of fairness.' Dr Brosnan and Dr Frans de Waal, from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University, began their studies of fairness in monkeys in 2003. A paper published in Nature journal entitled Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay featured a study of brown capuchins which became agitated and uncooperative when a partner received a better reward for performing the same task. Since then further tests on responses to inequity were conducted on nine different species of primate, including humans. Animals only responded to unfairness when they routinely co-operated with non-related strangers, the scientists found. Beyond primates, domestic dogs showed evidence of 'first-order inequity aversion' (IA) - the sense of being treated unfairly - and the trait has even been seen in some members of the crow family. But the desire to equalise outcomes to the benefit of a partner despite suffering short-term disadvantage was something unique to humans and great apes. A paper published in Nature featured a study of brown capuchins (stock image shown) which became agitated and uncooperative when a partner received a better reward for performing the same task. Animals only responded to unfairness when they routinely co-operated with non-related strangers, the scientists found . The researchers concluded: 'Our closest relatives, the anthropoid apes, show evidence of second-order IA (inequity aversion), an essential component of human fairness because it seeks to equalise outcomes. 'Thus, humans and other species seem to share basic reactions to inequity, which serve the need for sustained co-operation. 'Humans' unprecedented brain enlargement allows for greater understanding of the benefits of self-control in the context of resource division. 'Additionally, the development of language enabled communication about third parties, which may have enhanced the role of reputation building. 'Despite these differences, many of the basic emotional reactions and calculations underlying our sense of fairness seem rooted in our primate background.'","A paper co-authored by Dr Sarah Brosnan from Georgia State University reviewed research into the sense of fairness in animals .

"For a rock star such as Bono, it has to be one of the cruellest blows his ego could receive. Apple has introduced a special ‘button’ for iTunes customers – simply so they can delete his band U2’s latest album from their accounts. The move follows a backlash by users who were unhappy at being given a free copy of Songs Of Innocence without asking for it. Apple CEO Tim Cook, left, announced that all Apple's 500 million iTunes customers would receive U2's latest album, although many customers complained about automatically downloading Bono's latest songs . Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced last week that all 500million iTunes customers would automatically receive a digital version of the album in their accounts ahead of its release next month. But it seems many were not impressed, with thousands of protests on social media. Some customers said they felt as though the album had been forced upon them by Apple. To make things worse, others complained that they could not find an easy way to remove it from their iTunes libraries. The protests prompted Apple to create the online tool allowing customers to get rid of the album. It comes with a message: ‘If you would like U2’s Songs Of Innocence removed from your iTunes music library and iTunes purchases, you can choose to have it removed. ‘Once the album has been removed from your account, it will no longer be available for you to redownload as a previous purchase. If you later decide that you want the album, you will need to get it again.’ Apple’s senior vice president Eddy Cue announced yesterday that 33million iTunes users had so far accessed the album.

"St Helens captain Paul Wellens will technically play his final match for his home-town club in Saturday's Grand Final but he is far from ready to hang up his boots. The 34-year-old full-back's contract is up at the end of the season and, remarkably, he has yet to open talks over a new deal. The decision of head coach Nathan Brown to cut short his stay at Langtree Park and return to Australia after Saturday's game adds to the uncertainty but Wellens remains laid back, confident that he will be starting his 18th season with Saints in February. St Helens coach Nathan Brown (left) is returning to Australia after Saturday's Grand Final . 'I'm kind of in a different situation to most players,' Wellens said. 'You'd expect it to be done and dusted but I've got a relaxed relationship with the chairman. 'I've spoken to him about it and said we'll just get this season done and sit down and talk. I've made it clear that I'd like to go around for another year and I think the chairman is thinking along the same lines. 'Because I've got that relaxed relationship and I trust him and (chief executive) Mike (Rush) and the people within the club, I'm afforded that luxury of being relaxed about it.' St Helens fullback Paul Wellens is confident that he will be back playing with the club next season . Brown's departure has raised the tantalising prospect of Wellens pairing up with his old St Helens team-mate Keiron Cunningham to form a 'dream coaching team'. Cunningham, who has been Brown's right-hand man for the last two years after 'holding the fort' with Rush for most of the 2012 season, looks sure to remain involved, either as the club's new head coach or as assistant to the new man, but Wellens insists the move into coaching right now would be too soon for him.

"Youth unemployment is falling faster in Britain than in any major global economy, employment minister Esther McVey will boast on a visit to Australia today. More than 6million people aged 16-24 are in work or studying after businesses made a 'game-changing investment' in the nation's young people, Miss McVey claims. The senior Conservative is in Melbourne for a meeting of G20 ministers, where she will examine the use of psychological tests to see if the unemployed are 'determined', 'bewildered' or 'despondent' about taking a job. Between the last quarter of the 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, the UK saw a bigger fall in youth unemployment than in the whole of the EU, the G7 and the OECD . The dramatic recovery in the jobs market has been one of the major economic success stories of the last 12months. Last week figures showed that in the last four years the number of people in work in the UK has increased by more than the rest of the EU put together. However, the coalition has faced criticism for high levels of youth unemployment, which Miss McVey insists is now falling sharply. The Department for Work and Pensions pointed to figures which show that in the first three months of 2014, youth unemployment fell faster in the UK than any G7 country, including the US, Canada, Japan, Italy, France and Germany. Employment minister Esther McVey told MailOnline the falls in youth unemployment have not 'happened by accident' Ahead of Miss McVey's trip Down Under, officials noted that 'while youth unemployment is rising in Australia, the UK has seen impressive recent falls'. Miss McVey told MailOnline: 'We've just seen the fastest drop in youth unemployment in the G7 in the last three months - and this hasn't happened by accident. 'I believe the hard work or our frontline staff, the reforms we've brought in, and the enthusiasm and professionalism of our young people have all played a role in the UK leading the way.' In the first three months of this year, youth unemployment fell by 5.38 per cent in the UK, compared to falls of 2.1 per cent in the EU as a whole, 0.85 per cent in Germany and 0.3 per cent in France. The average in the OECD was a fall of just 0.14 per cent. Across the G7, there was a rise of 0.01 per cent, driven by larger numbers of young unemployed people in Canada (up 0.35 per cent), USA (1.45) and Italy (1.73). Australia saw a rise of 0.54 per cent. Year-on-year, only the USA saw a bigger drop than the UK, where the number of 15-24 year olds out of work fell by 10.15 per cent. Miss McVey is attending the meeting of G20 employment ministers ahead of the heads of government summit in Brisbane in November. She will examine Australian attitude tests which are used to identify jobseekers who are less mentally prepared and gives them intensive coaching at jobcentres. Miss McVey's 'segmentation' programme has been inspired by the work of the wife of the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, Therese Rein. Her company has used attitude profiling in back-to-work schemes since the 1990s. A UK pilot scheme is taking place in three job centres and, if successful, it will be rolled out for a voluntary trial involving 27,000 jobseekers in 27 cities. In the 12 months to March 2014, only the US saw a bigger drop in youth unemployment, according to OECD data . Miss McVey added: 'With our help, British businesses are making a game-changing investment in our young people by supporting them to get the skills and work experience they need to build the careers they want. 'A generation of young Brits are being helped to build a career and find their way in the world of work, inspiring their peers to follow in their footsteps and helping their country compete on the world stage.' 'Young people tell me they need work experience to get a job, but they need a job to get work experience, which is why our advisers in Jobcentre Plus work closely with local businesses to provide tailored training opportunities for young jobseekers across the UK.' Since January 2011, more than 260,000 young people have taken part in employer-led placements or work experience through jobcentres. The number of jobless young people who have left full-time education has fallen by 174,000 in the last year.","In first three months of 2014 UK saw 5.38% fall in youth unemployment .

The two men broke into the family's home six years ago on July 23 in Cheshire, Connecticut.

The couple were married in 2012 and moved into a small but cozy home in Farmington River in western Connecticut. Terror in the suburbs: Michaela, 11, and her 17-year-old sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the house was doused in gas and set on fire . Last year it emerged that Steven Hayes came up with a bizarre plan to end his own life by lying about other victims. Hayes wrote letters bragging about how he had killed 17 other victims and raped dozens of women. However, he later claimed in an interview that he had 'made it all up' and that he had hoped the letters would lead prison authorities to notify police and he could trade information for food. He planned to use the ploy to eat oysters in his cell to which he is deathly allergic. The four letters that Hayes now says were made up as part of a bizarre suicide plot described in chilling detail how in two of the attacks he had tied up, tortured and killed women. In the 17 pages of handwritten letters, which were confiscated by prison authorities, Hayes gleefully recounted the rape and murder of his first victim in 1982 and his eighth. He wrote that all of his victims were aged between 14 and 25. Now Hayes says the killings, rapes and torture documented in the letters were all lies.

"A Tory minister's attack on a 'wealthy metropolitan elite' who hire cheap migrant workers backfired today, as it emerged David Cameron and Nick Clegg both employ foreign staff at home. Downing Street refused to defend the Prime Minister's decision to hire a nanny for his children from outside the EU, and Mr Clegg revealed he employs a Belgian woman but would not go into detail of his 'domestic arrangements'. The spotlight fell on politicians' home helps after Immigration Minister James Brokenshire used his first major speech to accuse the middle classes of enjoying 'cheap tradesmen and services', while the working class were squeezed out of jobs by migrants. Nanny state: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he employs a Belgian woman at home but would not give details, while David Cameron has previously hire Australian and Nepalese nannies . Mr Brokenshire said better-off families had benefited from cheap builders, tradesmen and nannies from overseas. But he claimed add that cheerleaders of uncontrolled immigration who view 'foreign labour as a cheap commodity' need reminding that it also 'forces wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services'. He claimed that for 'too long' the well-off had enjoyed the benefits of hiring cheap migrant workers as domestic help, and called for immigration to fall. However, in the past Mr Cameron has Australian and Nepalese nannies to look after his children in Number 10. Today the PM's official spokesman refused to comment on whether the Cameron's still have domestic staff from abroad. 'I'm going to keep talking about government policy', he said. Mr Clegg was also challenged about help at his some in South West London. Asked on his LBC radio phone-in where his gardener, nanny and housekeeper are from, the Deputy PM replied: 'I’m not going to get into a great list of who… . 'I have a lady who has a Belgian passport who helps us, but if you don’t mind I’m not going to discuss my own domestic arrangements.' In his first speech as immigration . minister, Mr Brokenshire also attacked the Lib Dem Business Secretary . Vince Cable for saying a sharp increase in net immigration was 'good . news'. In a sign of rapidly escalating Coalition tensions, Mr Cable will deliver a speech of his own on immigration in London tonight. New immigration minister James Brokenshire will say in his first speech that better-off families have benefited from cheap builders, tradesmen and nannies from overseas . The Lib Dem is planning to use a speech tonight to accuse critics of large-scale immigration of wanting to drag Britain back to 'medieval' days. He will say he is 'intensely relaxed' about people bringing skills to Britain – and suggests the public would think the same if it was better informed. Mr Brokenshire's speech is part of a concerted Tory effort to establish themselves as the party of hard-working Britons. He will told the Demos think-tank: 'Some have tried to claim that this rapid increase is somehow “good” for the country. Well, just like the Home Secretary, I disagree. 'For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services – but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country. We are changing that and building a system that benefits all.' The Tory minister said the Government's drive to reduce immigration has never been simply an economic one. But Mr Brokenshire will warn that mass immigration has made life harder for 'ordinary, hard-working people' His speech echoes that of former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, who last month called for curbs on benefits for young people to encourage them to fight immigrants for jobs. He said the influx of migrants has led to a Downton Abbey-style culture where rich foreigners hire fellow countrymen for roles once done by young working-class Britons. Mr Field – a former poverty adviser to David Cameron – wrote in the London Evening Standard that the 'unemployment figures contain one particularly disturbing element – the stubbornly high number of young people who are still out of work, 917,000 of them. 'The awful truth is that huge numbers of unemployed young people either don't try, or lose out to new arrivals eager to work,' he claimed. Business Secretary Vince Cable insisted critics of immigration were wrong . 'A new servant class, equal to that of Downton Abbey times, has been recreated. It's not upstairs and downstairs any more, though. The elite bring the servant class in when they want cleaning done, ironing, gardening, decorating and so on.' Mr Cable, by contrast, will tell business leaders that it would do great harm if the Government gave the impression that Britain was 'closed for business'. He will say: 'Bearing down on economic migration is a clear example of a restriction on trade. In medieval times, guilds used to prevent travelling artisans from plying their trade outside their native area, with a deadening effect on competition and innovation. 'What was true then is true now. Bear down on immigrants, and you lose some of the most dynamic, innovative and imaginative workers in your economy. The costs are huge.' Mr Cable has clashed repeatedly with Home Secretary Theresa May over border controls. He has also found himself out of step with public opinion – with eight of ten voters wanting further restrictions on immigration. 'Uncontrolled mass immigration can force wages down and house prices up and put pressure on social cohesion and public services. 'And let me be clear – it can also cause displacement in the labour market.' But, controversially, he will blame 'scare stories' about migrants shopping for benefits and claim the public are not being asked the right questions by opinion pollsters. Mr Cable will say the issue is 'politically toxic' and those who put their heads above the parapet need a 'reinforced tin hat'. He will then add: 'I don't think anyone is arguing for unrestricted immigration – in particular of unskilled labour. 'But we just have to stop treating people coming to work here as if they are a problem. We need to kill all the scare stories.'","James Brokenshire said well-off benefit from cheap builders and nannies .

"Dressed in a shapeless top and sandals and pulling a plastic shopping trolley, it is difficult to imagine that this woman was once one of the world’s most photographed – and infamous – beauties. But the pensioner pictured here is Christine Keeler. Her sexual liaisons 50 years ago with Tory Minister John Profumo and a Russian military attache based in London led to one of the biggest political scandals of modern times. This is the first time Keeler has been photographed in public for seven years, and the 71-year-old is unrecognisable from the fresh-faced model and showgirl who found herself embroiled in Profumo affair in 1963. Humble lifestyle: The former model Christine Keeler pictured out shopping near her home . Although she revelled in her notoriety at the time and sold her story to newspapers all over the world, Ms Keeler now lives in a sheltered accommodation block in South London, and is estranged from her two sons. Beauty: Keeler in her prime back in 1964 . In an interview last year to publicise her latest book about the affair that rocked the British Establishment, she said: ‘My children don’t want to be associated with that bloody whore Christine Keeler. It’s awful but that’s the way it is.’ The scandal happened at the height of the Cold War when it was discovered that Keeler had been sleeping with both Profumo, the then Conservative Minister for War, and Yevgeny Ivanov, a naval attache based at the Russian Embassy in London. Keeler and Profumo began their affair after being introduced at a party at the Cliveden estate in 1961 by their mutual friend Stephen Ward, a high-society osteopath and portrait-painter. Profumo, who was married to actress Valerie Hobson, had no idea that Keeler was also sleeping with Ivanov. In March 1963 he told the House of Commons that rumours of his affair were untrue, but  he was forced to resign three months later after admitting he had lied. Ward, who was prosecuted for living off immoral earnings, took an overdose the day before his trail ended and died on August 3, 1963. Keeler was found guilty of unrelated perjury charges and was sentenced to nine months in prison. The passage of time has done little to diminish the public’s fascination with the scandal. Andrew Lloyd Webber has written a musical, Stephen Ward, due to open in December. It is understood Keeler declined to co-operate with the project.

"World number one Rory McIlroy has been voted PGA Tour player of the year for the second time in three seasons. McIlroy won the Open Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA Championship in consecutive appearances and did not finish outside the top 25 in any of his 17 PGA Tour events in 2014. The 25-year-old had already claimed the Arnold Palmer Award as the tour's leading official money winner (£5.1million) and won the Byron Nelson Award for adjusted scoring average (68.83). Rory McIlroy was voted PGA player of the year ahead of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championships . McIlroy won three consecutive high profile tournaments to claim his second award in three years . 'It means a lot to win it for the second time in three years,' McIlroy said. 'Being voted player of the year by your peers is something that's very important. 'They are the guys you are trying to beat week in, week out and if they appreciate what you have done over the year, see the hard work that you've put in and the golf that you've played and think that's been the best of the season that means a lot to me.

"Nicola Sturgeon today launched her bid to replace Alex Salmond as leader of the SNP, putting on course to be Scotland's first female First Minister. She is the clear favourite to succeed Mr Salmond, who dramatically quit on Friday after voters rejected his dream of independence in the historic referendum. Miss Sturgeon said she wants to 'serve my party and my country' and insisted she is the 'best person for the job'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon today launched her bid to replace Alex Salmond as Scotland's First Minister, with bookies make her almost a dead cert for the job . She used a press conference at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall to announce his bid, insisting Mr Salmond's were big boots to fill . Miss Sturgeon has been Deputy First Minister since the nationalists came to power at Holyrood seven years ago, has been the clear favourite to take over from Mr Salmond. He announced last Friday that he would be stepping down from the job after Scots voted by 55 per cent to 45 per cent to remain in the Union. He said 'party, Parliament and country would benefit from new leadership'. Bookies immediately named Miss Sturgeon as the favorite to succeed him. Today Ms Sturgeon said: 'To be the first minister of my country, especially at this exciting and optimistic time, would be both a great honour - without doubt, the greatest honour - and an immense responsibility. 'I am putting myself forward for two simple reasons: I want to serve my party and my country. And I believe I am the best person for the job. 'I also hope that my candidacy, should it succeed, will send a strong message to every girl and young woman in Scotland: no matter your background or what you want to achieve in life, in Scotland in 2014 there is no glass ceiling on ambition.' While Ms Sturgeon paid tribute to Mr Salmond, she was also keen to state: 'I will be my own person and set my own course. 'At risk of stating the obvious, I am not Alex Salmond. His are big boots to fill, but if given the opportunity to lead, I will wear my own shoes - and they will certainly have higher heels!' Although she said the case for Holyrood having more powers was now 'urgent and irresistible', Ms Sturgeon stressed that if she becomes first minister, 'my responsibility will also be to use those powers we already have to make life better, now, for those we serve'. As she watched the results of the referendum at the Glasgow count in last week, Miss Sturgeon went from jubilation to reluctant acceptance of defeat . As Miss Sturgeon announced her bid, Alex Salmond spent the day posing for photographs at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles . Miss Sturgeon, 44, is a former solicitor and is married to the SNP's chief executive Peter Murrell. Her almost-certain elevation to the top job raises the prospect of all the main parties in Scotland being led by women. Ruth Davidson is the Conservative leader north of the border, while Labour's leader is Johann Lamont. However, there has been speculation in recent days that Miss Lamont will quit after a lacklustre performance during the referendum campaign. At the party's UK conference in Manchester there are strong rumours that Miss Lamont is 'ready' to quit, although this was slapped down by her supporters. The party is bracing itself for more in-fighting and soul-searching following last week's referendum. Miss Sturgeon's leadership bid will pit her against Labour's Johann Lamont (left) and Conservative leader Ruth Davidson . Former Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy is said to be already being lined up as the next leader. Miss Sturgeon has been an almost permanent fixture by Mr Salmond's side during his time in government. In his resignation speech on Friday, Mr Salmond refused to be drawn on supporting a successor, but said 'party, Parliament and country would benefit from new leadership'. He will quit as First Minister after the SNP conference in Perth on November 15.' Mr Salmond said that at the age of 59, after 20 years as SNP leader and seven years as First Minister, it was time to hand over the reins. He said it was 'time to give someone else a chance to move that forward'. Deputy First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon smiles as she launches her leadership bid . Alex Salmond likes a flutter, but he will get terrible odds on his likely successor. Within minutes of the SNP leader announcing his decision to quit last week, bookies were as good as paying out on his deputy Nicola Sturgeon taking the reins. She issued an almost comically-worded statement declaring that she could think of 'no greater privilege' than to take the top job, before adding the decision was 'not for today'. The 44-year-old former solicitor has been by Salmond's side as his deputy for the last decade, forming what Labour's Johann Lamont today admitted was a 'formidable team'. She is married to the SNP's chief executive Peter Murrell, and with Salmond and spin doctor Kevin Pringle, they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the United Kingdom. Though she does not have children, her frequent appearances at schools and nurseries have helped to soften the blokey image of Salmond's SNP. William Hill made Miss Sturgeon the 1/3 favourite to take over the SNP leadership. Almost out of politeness, the bookies named other possible contenders including Angus Robertson, the SNP's successful election strategist, Alex Neil, the Scottish Health Secretary, and Derek Mackay, a local government minister. But in the contest to succeed racing fan Salmond, Sturgeon is the frontrunner in a one-horse race.","Deputy First Minister is the clear frontrunner to take the top job .

"The remarkable rise of Yorkshire trainer David O’Meara continued on Sunday as Move In Time landed the Prix de l’Abbaye at 25-1. The five-furlong sprint is always the most likely Group One race booked for export on the glittering Longchamp card but Move In Time had not looked the most likely horse to bag it. His biggest success had come at Listed level and he spent part of this summer in handicaps. But former jump jockey O’Meara loves an upset, as he has proved in racking up more than 100 winners in a season for the second time in only his fifth season with a licence. Daniel Tudhope rides Move In Time (black cap, pink stars) to victory in the Prix de I'Abbaye at Longchamp . Move In Time trainer David O'Meara's star continues to rise with his Prix de I'Abbaye win no surprise . He said: ‘The unique nature of this track suits Move In Time. He has run three times, been beaten half a length, a head and now won.’ Moviesta, trained by Move In Time’s old handler Bryan Smart and part-owned by QPR boss Harry Redknapp, was beaten half a length having had his run hampered, although not as badly as favourite Sole Power in eighth and Pearl Secret in 14th. Two more of the seven Group One races were won by British runners. Richard Hannon-trained Olympic Glory broke the track record in the Prix de la Foret, while James Fanshawe’s High Jinx was a neck winner of the Prix du Cadran. His jockey Ryan Moore had earlier won the Prix Marcel Boussac on Aidan O’Brien’s Found, who now disputes favouritism for the 2015 1,000 Guineas at 5-1 with Ladbrokes.

"Treve's racing career appears to be over after her owner's racing manager said she would probably be at Sheik Joaan Al Thani's French stud in little over three weeks. Trainer Criquette Head-Maarek had floated the possibility of one final run for the dual Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe winner in either the Breeders' or Melbourne Cup immediately after the filly's dramatic triumph at Longchamp on Sunday. But the proposal never seemed more than wishful thinking and Harry Herbert, spokesman for the Sheik Al Shaqab racing admitted as much. Treve crosses the line two lengths in front of second placed Flintshare to seal dramatic victory at Longchamp . Herbert said: 'It is almost certain she will be retired. She has done enough and has nothing to prove. To win the Arc twice is remarkable. 'She has come out of the race well and is 100 per cent this morning. I imagine she will go to the Sheik's (Normandy) stud Bouquetot in about three weeks.' Treve's Arc win was all the more dramatic coming after what had previously been a winless and disappointing season but Head-Maarek always retained faith in her filly. Treve leaves the chasing pack for dust en route to another victory at the Prix De L’Arc de Triomphe . Herbert added that although no firm plans for which stallion Treve will visit first had been made, there had been discussions and it will be surprising if the name Frankel didn't feature in those talks. Treve's success completed a great weekend for Sheik Joaan when the only major disappointment was the last place of his John Quinn-trained The Wow Signal in the Prix Jean Luc Lagardere. His colours were also carried to success at Newmarket by Osaila at Ascot, by Al Thakira and by Richard Hannon's Olympic Glory in the Prix de La Foret at Longchamp Olympic Glory is also destined for stud and only seems likely to run again if the ground for Champions Day at Ascot turns soft and he has to stand in for stablemate Toronado in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Jarnet, riding Treve (C) celebrates after crossing the finish line to win at the Longchamp race track . In the aftermath of Treve's 2013 Arc win, the Sheik broke records by paying £5.25million for a Galileo yearling filly subsequently named Al Naamah at the premier Tattersalls sales in Newmarket. Those sales start again today and Tattersalls will be hoping the cash will again by flying. Herbert said: 'The Sheik has no plans to be there but his team will be.' Thierry Jarnet sheds a tear after riding Treve to the first back to back wins at the event since 1978 .","Treve's career could be over despite her dramatic victory at Longchamp .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has called for a rethink on the away goals rule and questioned whether the method for settling knock-out games still makes sense. The system - where the team who has scored the most goals away from home wins the tie if the scores are level - has been used since 1965 in European competition and still applies in the Champions League and Europa League. Blatter claims the rule favours teams playing away from home in the second leg because those games can go to extra time meaning more time to score an away goal. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has questioned the fairness of the away goals rule in knock-out competitions . In his column in the FIFA Weekly magazine, which is being published on Friday, Blatter pointed out the rule was scrapped in the Championship play-offs in 2000. Blatter says: 'It is time to rethink the system. Football has progressed since the 1960s, so the away goals rule may now be questioned. Does the away goals rule still make sense? 'The idea dates back to a time when away games were often an adventure, involving journeys that could be long and arduous - and the playing conditions would vary considerably. Blatter, pictured with actor Gerard Depardieu, said the rule favours teams who play away from home second . 'In reality it favours the club that play away from home in the second leg. Where the scores are tied, that team has 30 minutes more than their opponent to score a valuable away goal. After all, in the first leg there is no extra time. 'Such an imbalance has already been disposed of in various competitions. The away goals rule is no longer used in the semi-finals of the promotion play-offs in English football.' Blatter suggested a modification could be used such as in employed in MLS play-offs in the USA and in the CONCACAF Champions League where away goals only count 'double' until the end of normal time in the second leg and not in extra time. The rule has been used in European competition since 1965, it's used in the Europa and Champions League .","Sepp Blatter has questioned the validity of the away goals rule .

"She had never lost faith as the crown wobbled, never doubted her filly’s ability, and trainer Criquette Head-Maarek was emphatically vindicated on Sunday as Treve scorched to a two-length victory in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. The margin of victory from Flintshire may not have been as big as last year’s five-length procession in the mud but it was probably even more emphatic or, as the track announcer bellowed, ‘extraordinaire’. Unbelievable, he could well have added as she sprinted clear of John Gosden’s third Taghrooda and Roger Varian’s St Leger hero Kingston Hill in fourth, both making excellent efforts from poor draws. Treve leaves the chasing pack for dust en route to another victory at the Prix De L’Arc de Triomphe . Taghrooda’s jockey Paul Hanagan thought he would win turning for home. He said: ‘I just saw this flash of Treve up the inside — she is some horse, isn’t she?’ Treve is one of the greats now but few who watched her crab-like gait in defeat at Royal Ascot in June or her fourth in last month’s Prix Vermeille — a performance that had vin ordinaire written all over it — would have put much money on her becoming the first back-to-back Arc winner since Alleged in 1978 and the seventh dual winner. This is a filly with ropey feet and a dodgy back who could not be ridden for six weeks in the summer as she rehabilitated after her Ascot setback. Her 11-1 starting price reflected that. Minutes after her first win 12 months ago, bookmakers were handing out quotes of 2-1 that she would be back in the Arc winner’s enclosure. Thierry Jarnet sheds a tear after riding Treve to the first back to back wins at the event since 1978 . Jarnet, riding Treve (C) celebrates after crossing the finish line to win at the Longchamp race track . Replacing jockey Frankie Dettori with Thierry Jarnet, at Head-Maarek’s insistence after Treve had been beaten in the Prix Ganay and Prince of Wales’s Stakes, was part of the masterplan. Perhaps to assuage the hurt, 43-year-old Dettori had insisted last week that the 2014 Treve was a mere shadow of the 2013 model, all of which must have made the result yesterday hard to swallow, especially when a broken ankle meant he missed Treve’s first success here, too. Dettori’s comments seemed to make Head-Maarek bristle with indignation as she promised to prove him wrong...and she did. As Dettori passed the post in ninth on Ruler Of The World, it must have felt like a blow to the solar plexus. A later victory in the Prix de la Foret on Richard Hannon-trained Olympic Glory, in the colours of his boss and Treve’s owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani, must have been scant compensation but he was putting on a brave face. Treve crosses the line two lengths in front of second placed Flintshare . Dettori said: ‘This was the Treve of old. Unfortunately when I rode her here (in the Prix Ganay) she wasn’t like that.’ But Dettori’s judgment was not too wild as Head-Maarek admitted Jarnet had initially recommended retirement for Treve after her Vermeille defeat. The trainer, who has now won three Arcs after first landing the race in 1979 with Three Troikas, said: ‘I want to say thank you to Sheik Joaan because he always believed what I told him. ‘A lot of people were saying Treve was no good and was finished and I asked him to have faith in me. It is not a surprise — she is the best. ‘In the Vermeille she was beaten but she did an incredible time in the (home) straight. I was sitting next to my Papa and he said, “Don’t rule her out of the Arc”.’ Jamet collects the trophy while trainer Criquette Head-Maarek (3R) stands behind . Displaced jockey Frankie Dettori had previously claimed that Treve was not the same horse anymore . Papa is Alec, 90, a four-time Arc-winning trainer himself, who still keeps an eye on his daughter’s stable. He had convinced himself that the filly was still good enough to win and phoned his old friend Sir Peter O’Sullevan last week to advise the 96-year-old former BBC horseracing commentator to back Treve. Interestingly, all the first four raced prominently throughout. The hopes of Japan were dashed again and annoyingly Harp Star, the first of their trio in sixth, sped home from an impossible position.","Treve, ridden by Thierry Jamet won the Qatar Prix De L’Arc de Triomphe .

Macleod’s eighth-minute overhead finish  secured a 1-0 win and ensured no further ground was lost on Hearts . It was not all good news, though, as the match was blighted by crowd trouble just before half-time . Livingston safety officer Alan Scott later confirmed that five arrests had been made, following an incident in the away section of the ground, and there were also reports of post-match scuffles outside. Macleod had been missing with an ankle injury as Rangers lost 3-1 to Hibs last Monday but his return helped galvanise the Ibrox men and McCoist admitted he could not recall scoring a comparable goal during his own prolific playing career. ‘I don’t remember striking too many with venom like that,’ he said. ‘I thought his one at Ayr United last season would take a bit of beating but that one might better it.’ Hearts’ 3-0 victory at Queen of the South ensures that Rangers remain six points off the top and McCoist acknowledged his own position will remain under scrutiny. ‘I don’t remember striking too many with venom like that,’ said McCoist after Macleod's fine overhead finish . ‘I’ve tried to explain that sometimes there’s no real middle ground,’ he said. ‘With us, it’s either up there or down there but we have a reasonable concept of what’s going on and know our own jobs.’ Of the crowd trouble, safety officer Scott said: ‘There were five people arrested and they will be reported to the procurator fiscal in due course.’ McCoist said: ‘I did see it and it looked pretty unsavoury but, until I get a report on it, I would be loath to comment — but we can do without incidents like that.’","Ally McCoist thanks match-winner Lewis Macleod on Saturday night for taking pressure off the Rangers manager .

"Scotland's central defensive duo have vowed they are ready to do what Germany couldn’t and stop Poland’s rampant goal-machine led by the fearsome Robert Lewandowski. The Bayern Munich striker laid on the second goal for Sebastian Mila in a shock 2-0 win over the world champions in Warsaw on Saturday night as the Germans sank to their first qualifying defeat since October 2007. The free-scoring Poles now top Group D on goal difference from Ireland with a 100-per-cent record from two games, scoring nine and conceding none. Scotland will have to do better than Germany at keeping the likes of Poland's Robert Lewandowski (L) quiet . Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney scored the match winner in Scotland's 1-0 victory over Georgia . But Scotland centre back Russell Martin insists Lewandowski and Co hold no fears. And his defensive partner, Grant Hanley, is also confident Gordon Strachan’s Scots can handle what is thrown at them in the Polish capital on Tuesday night. After Scotland’s 1-0 win over Georgia on Saturday, Martin said: ‘Robert Lewandowski is one of the best in the world in his position – but it’s up to us to nullify his threat. ‘And I’ve competed week in week out against guys of his quality in the Premier League so I know what’s coming. ‘Luis Suarez was the toughest - he is just a brilliant player. And with Scotland we kept a clean sheet against Croatia and Mario Mandzukic. I’ve also played against Christian Benteke of Belgium and Germany have good players too. Scotland defender Russell Martin (L) and Steven Naismith (R) celebrate Maloney's winner . Scotland will also have to contend with substitute Sebastian Mila who scored the second goal in Warsaw . ‘Grant Hanley and myself are both desperate to get back to the Premier League as soon as possible and tests like these against Poland and Lewandowski are tests you need to pass. We need to prove we are still ready for it, that we can compete at that level. ‘I’ve not seen as much of Lewandowski as the others strikers (in the English Premier League) because he plays in Germany but the staff will make sure we see all about him before the game. We will be prepared. There will be no excuses. ‘But Lewandowski’s not Poland’s only threat – and it’s going to be a team effort to stop him. But we will be ready. And we go there confident after getting a clean sheet against Georgia.’ Blackburn captain Grant Hanley (R) claims Scotland have a game plan to deal with the Poles . Poland lead Group D while Scotland are surprisingly ahead of World Cup winners Germany on goal difference . Hanley also welcomes the challenge in Warsaw after shutting out the Georgians at Ibrox. The Blackburn Rovers skipper also takes confidence from Scotland winning a friendly 1-0 out in Poland in March, thanks to a Scott Brown goal, even though he and Lewandowski were both missing that night. ‘We know Poland have got the big name in their team but we are going there with a game plan,’ said the 22-year-old. ‘And, hopefully, we’ll get something out of the game. ‘Of course, playing against Robert Lewandowski will be difficult but we’re confident we can handle it. We’ll give them the respect that they’re due but we’ ve got to remember that we coped with Mario Mandzukic. It’s going to be a test, though. ‘We’d be happy if David Marshall doesn’t have a save to make in Poland (like against Georgia) but we know it will be a different game out there. Scotland defeated Poland 1-0 in friendly in March courtesy of a goal from Celtic captain Scott Brown . ‘I wouldn’t like to say whether a draw would be a good result over there but, with the confidence we have now, we’ve got to go into it looking to produce another performance like this one and then who knows what might happen? ‘I wasn’t involved when we won in Poland in March but that result has given the boys belief. We have players who can make an impact and, with a wee bit of luck, I don’t think we’ll be far away. ‘There’s no reason for us to be afraid of them because we’re playing with no fear.’","Poland host Scotland in their next Euro 2016 qualifier in Warsaw .

"There will be little to learn, so the theory goes. Once England have knocked over the country ranked 208th in the world by FIFA, they will then dismantle the nation who occupy 81st position. Two more victories, most likely achieved without having to break sweat, will take England a step closer to confirming their place at Euro 2016 but with neither San Marino nor Estonia being regarded as top-class opposition, what is there for Roy Hodgson’s squad to gain in the next week? Plenty, if you ask Adam Lallana. The Liverpool midfielder, who is just starting to find a groove after recovering from a medial ligament problem, believes the stakes are as high as they have been for him, after a year of skirting around the edges with his country. Adam Lallana faced the press at England's base at St George's Park on Tuesday afternoon . The England midfielder has featured for just 440 minutes since his debut against Chile last November . Lallana (far left) said that he is always looking for an opportunity to impress Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson . England's 0-0 draw against Costa Rica at the World Cup was not the perfect stage for Lallana to thrill . So far, Lallana has been in 12 squads. He made his debut in a 2-0 defeat to Chile last November and the memory of a bright early impression has evaporated since he was shoved out of the starting line-up for the World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus, as Roy Hodgson went with Raheem Sterling. In total, Lallana’s England career amounts to just 440 minutes – 29 of which were in the tedious 0-0 dead rubber with Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte – and he recognises the time has come for him to re-establish himself in Hodgson’s thinking. Don’t tell him, then, that the next seven days are an exercise in futility. ‘Definitely,’ came Lallana’s instant response when it was suggested there was a lot at stake for him against San Marino and Estonia. ‘It's always good, even in training, to show the manager what you can do and remind him so if I get my chance, I'll be looking to take it and impress him. Since his summer move to Liverpool, the 26-year-old has also gained valuable Champions League experience . Lallana featured in Liverpool's disappointing 1-0 defeat to FC Basel in the UEFA Champions League . ‘There's always going to be competition at this level. The amount of English players we have playing in the Premier League... there's no shortage really, so there'll be people pushing you for your places. I still feel I have a lot to learn and prove. ‘I don't think by any stretch I'm an established international. I have hard work to do to get to this level consistently. 'As a footballer, you want to play every game possible. But the manager has big decisions to make. He has a squad and 11 places to choose for. ‘I have huge respect for the manager and every decision he makes. The World Cup was disappointing but because we went out. 'Each game is different so you have to be versatile. We have different players to suit different kinds of games in our selection.’ The midfielder's performances have improved over the last fortnight, culminating in a goal against West Brom . Lallana celebrates his opener against the Baggies, which was his first Premier League goal since March . Lallana looked to be full of confidence when he faced the media at St George’s Park yesterday, something which stems from the fact his performances have significantly improved over the last fortnight, culminating in his goal against West Brom on Saturday. If the knee ligament injury he suffered in Boston in July could not have come at a worse possible time, he made his first appearances in a Liverpool team that was out of sorts last month and his form suffered as a consequence. A positive display in the 1-1 draw against Everton, though, was a step in the right direction and he now feels as if he is adjusting to the pressure and scrutiny that comes with playing for Liverpool; there is no longer the possibility for him to have a ‘quiet’ game. ‘It's just something you have to learn to deal with,’ said Lallana. ‘It happens. People move for big sums of money, to a team that will always be challenging for silverware, and that comes with pressure. It's normal. I'm dealing with it and enjoying it. I hope it pushes me on a notch. ‘Working with the players at Liverpool and playing in elite competitions is only going to improve my game. I really hope it does. It's hard to be at your best every game nowadays, and the manager has the chance to use his squad in certain games. ‘I wouldn't say I was in great demand. I was aware of Liverpool's interest. Knowing that was attractive for me. I was delighted in the end when I got the opportunity for the deal to be finalised and happen.’","England face minnows San Marino and Estonia in Euro 2016 qualifiers .

"Wigan demonstrated their determination to hang on to their Super League crown with a hard-fought 21-6 win over Leeds that lifts them into second place in the table. The Warriors played like champions to establish a 14-0 interval lead and withstood a tremendous second-half fightback from the Rhinos to secure only their second win in five games in front of a Super League best attendance of 20,265 at the DW Stadium. Leeds tasted glory with their long-awaited Challenge Cup success at Wembley a fortnight ago but a fourth successive league defeat leaves them trailing in sixth place with one round left of the regular season and with much to do if they are to complete the elusive double. Premiership: Wigan Warriors kept up the pressure on St Helens with a hard-fought win over Leeds Rhinos . The Rhinos were still without evergreen stalwarts Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow and they had centre Jimmy Keinhorst making his first appearance of the season in place of the suspended Joel Moon. Wigan coach Shaun Wane welcomed back full-back Matty Bowen and second rower Joel Tomkins but was forced into a late change when centre Anthony Gelling pulled out through illness, the versatile Jack Hughes taking his place. Wane also sprung a surprise by recalling 19-year-old wing sensation Joe Burgess after a two-month absence and it was he who opened the scoring on 12 minutes. Bowen was in full flight for the line when Leeds' veteran prop Jamie Peacock cut him down with a last-ditch tackle but in the next set Burgess got on the end of stand-off Blake Green's slide-rule kick to score his 20th try of the season on only his 23rd appearance. Scrum-half Matty Smith added the conversion, the first of four successsful kicks at goal, and picked off a forced pass by Leeds' under-fire full-back Zak Hardaker to race 30 metres for Wigan's second try on 22 minutes. Smith kicked his second conversion and, despite losing his footing, added a penalty on the stroke of half-time to stretch his side's lead to a 14-0, which was a fair reflection of the play in the opening 40 minutes. Dejected: Leeds players looked dejected after their defeat, the fourth they have suffered in a row . Hardaker, under an investigation for alleged homophobic abuse, was roundly booed by the Wigan fans with every touch but he responded well to his blunder and was at the heart of the Rhinos' limited attacking opportunities. They went closest to scoring when second rower Carl Ablett weaved his way to within a couple of feet of the line but generally failed to trouble the Warriors defence up to the break. They were the first to score in the second half but it came in fortuitous fashion after Wigan passing broke down on halfway. Keinhorst hacked the ball ahead and when Ryan Hall beat his England team-mate Josh Charnley to the loose ball Liam Sutcliffe was in support to race over at the corner. Kevin Sinfield's superb conversion made it 14-6 and the Yorkshiremen were suddenly full of confidence. A run of three successive penalties enabled them to pile the pressure on the home side but, with skipper Sean O'Loughlin setting a magnificent example, their defence held firm. When Wigan got their second wind, a dash from industrious hooker Michael McIlorum got centre Dan Sarginson charging for the line and, although the home fans were convinced it was a try, video referee Richard Silverwood ruled the player lost control of the ball. Sinfield kept his side in the game with a clever drop-out that enabled his side to regain possession but the telling moment came 10 minutes from the end when strong-running prop Ben Flower took O'Loughlin's short pass to power his way over the winning try. Smith landed his fourth goal and wrapped up the scoring in the last minute with a drop goal.","Wigan Warriors beat Leeds Rhinos 21-6 .

"Arsenal suffered yet another defeat at the hands of London rivals Chelsea on Sunday, going down 2-0 at Stamford Bridge courtesy of goals from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa. After Arsene Wenger's latest setback we asked Arsenal fan site Le Grove what went wrong in west London and where the Frenchman is going wrong. Nothing at Arsenal will improve until the three years of Arsene Wenger's contract are up and we can bring in fresh ideas with an approach that puts planning and detail at the core. The failings of Wenger's summer transfer planning were once again exposed against Chelsea, who delivered two killer blows to extend the Arsenal manager's winless streak to 12 against Jose Mourinho. This lack of foresight is always our undoing. The same mistakes are made every year. The same result occurs every year. Fourth place is where we'll finish because that's where we deserve to finish. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger watches from the touchline as his side lose 2-0 to London rivals Chelse . Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Santi Cazorla (right) react during their defeat at Stamford Bridge . Eden Hazard (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring from the penalty spot against Arse . The game itself was an improvement on the kamikaze tactics of last season that saw us lose by six goals. We turned up with a plan and on a different day, with a referee who had guts, the result may have been more favourable. What the game exposed was the lack of forward thinking from Wenger, a man traditionally synonymous with the act. That result wasn't a blip, it was the continuation of a managerial slide from grace which has seen Wenger go from one of the most revered masters of the beautiful game, to a man who is cannon fodder against the great teams. Our summer wasn't a complete disaster, but it was tantamount to the amateur DIYer who leaves every project half baked. The rooms are liveable, but they're never going to draw gasps of awe, and every so often a window will pop or a bookshelf will drop. A constant reminder of a lack of planning and effort to deliver the best possible product. Arsenal made three huge mistakes this summer. Firstly, we didn't address our need for a better striker until Olivier Giroud picked up a severe injury. We let superstars such as Mario Mandzukic pass us by when really, we should have had competition in place for that role in June. The result is a very disjointed front line that doesn't know how to trouble top teams at the moment. That will come, but the importance of bedding players in early can never be underestimated. Wenger should've moved for striker Mario Mandzukic (right), who joined Atletico Madrid from Bayern Munich . Summer signing Diego Costa seals Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal with a neat lob late in the game . The second major failing is one we've struggled with since Alex Song left three years ago. We don't have a defensive midfielder. We need one. The purists bleat on about the position being redundant, despite it being clear we need a big cynical lump in place to block the goal. Chelsea have that in Nemanja Matic, a total monster who allows Cesc Fabregas to do his job. We have Mathieu Flamini, an average free transfer who couldn't find a club until we let him train with us and Mikel Arteta - a player well past his peak. If we had a Matic, we'd have secured three points against Manchester City and on Sunday Eden Hazard would have been wiped out on his way to winning a penalty. Massive oversight. The Gunners have failed to replace defensive midfielder Alex Song (centre), who is on loan at West Ham . Mathieu Flamini (right) cannot compare to Chelsea's Nemanja Matic in the defensive midfield role . Finally, we didn't secure a third senior centre back. This was an obvious requirement since last season when Thomas Vermaelen fell out with the manager. We have Laurent Koscielny who looks disinterested and Per Mertesacker who looks dead on his feet. We can't make any changes because we don't have any options. Inept centre back displays can't be rectified because we sold without a plan in place. Brede Hangeland was free in the summer, Joleon Lescott was also available and West Ham's captain Winston Reid is a contract rebel. Not the best players, but more than capable of coming in at third choice. Why didn't we move? Why is inaction always preferable with Wenger? Follow Le Grove on Twitter @LeGrove .

'In hindsight, I should have said to myself: 'Go, go to Spain, live there for a year and a half, learn the language, learn the culture.' 'I took a negative approach.

"Arsene Wenger is no stranger to touchline bust-ups. Be it brow to brow, fist to fist or boot to bottle, the fiery Frenchman isn’t afraid to treat his technical zone as a boxing ring. His latest flashpoint came at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when he took on Jose Mourinho. Here, Sportsmail look back at five bouts involving the Arsenal boss… .

Catching the Portuguese off guard, Wenger planted his palms in Mourinho’s chest, knocking him off balance.

VERDICT: This was as good as a technical knockout for angry Arsene who emerged as the clear victor… .

Wenger and Mourinho had to be separated by fourth official Jonathan Moss as their rivalry showed itself . Wenger vs Kenny Dalglish, 2011 . The game was 11 minutes in to injury-time when Dirk Kuyt rescued a 1-1 draw for Liverpool from the penalty spot. Wenger wasn’t happy with the award of the spot-kick, nor the time added on, and approached Dalglish. But the Scot wasn’t in the mood to entertain Wenger’s moan, telling him to ‘p*** off’, which he duly did. VERDICT: Dalglish’s sharp tongue gets him a TKO over Wenger, whose protest was a little lame.

Wenger managed to keep reasonably calm on this occasion, despite being told to p*** off by Dalglish . Wenger vs plastic bottle, 2009 . After celebrating Robin van Persie’s goal at Manchester United - only to see it disallowed for a marginal offside - Wenger took his frustration out on a plastic bottle, booting it in the air. The fourth official took exception to his thuggery and quickly informed referee Mike Dean of his attack on the unsuspecting water bottle. Dean, equally enraged, sent Wenger to the stands where he took his position on a platform behind the dugout, much to the amusement of United’s supporters.

For once, Wenger played peacemaker when a mass brawl broke out during the 2007 Carling Cup final. Three players – Arsenal’s Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor and Chelsea’s John Obi Mikel – were sent off, but Wenger remained unflappable. He and Mourinho quickly entered the pitch as tempers – and fists – flared, but the Arsenal boss kept his own emotions in check and pulled his opposite number away from his own players. VERDICT: A rematch was needed to settle this score… . Wenger entered the field of play during the 2007 Carling Cup final, but it was to act as peacemaker . Mourinho and Wenger argued as several players had to be pulled apart during the heated final . Wenger vs Alan Pardew, 2006 . When West Ham boss Pardew celebrated Marlon Harewood’s late winner at Upton Park, Wenger wasn’t impressed. A Pardew fist pump – in Wenger’s direction – was the source of his ire. Pardew protested against Wenger’s displeasure but was met with a hefty shove. But the Frenchman wasn’t finished there and, when he again went for his opposite number, the intervening fourth official felt Wenger’s wrath. Pardew attempted to explain his actions but his adversary wasn’t having any of it and refused to shake hands on full-time. Wenger was subsequently fined by the FA while Pardew was cleared of all charges. VERDICT: Wenger wins on points but pays the price for his brutality… .

Spurs boss Jol instructed his players to carry on while two Arsenal men lay injured on the turf, and it resulted in a Robbie Keane goal.

"Louis van Gaal's expensively-assembled Manchester United have come together for the team's official photograph on the back of their first Premier League win of the season. Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie were all smiles as United posed for the annual snap. Van Gaal has stripped and sold the scraps of last year's disappointment in what appears to be an exciting new attacking era for those in the red half of Manchester. They managed to offload the likes of Danny Welbeck, Shinji Kagawa and Javier Hernandez, although the trio will be in Champions League action this week while team-mates at their old side are watching at home.

A LOOK AT WHO  DEPARTED OLD TRAFFORD THIS SUMMER . Danny Welbeck (back row, far left) The striker was sick of playing second fiddle to Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co and joined Arsenal for £16million in a deadline-day move. Under Moyes, he averaged just 58 minutes per game. Danny Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million, described as the 'bargain of the century' Rio Ferdinand (back row, third from right) The defender makes a tasty return to Old Trafford on Sunday with Queens Park Rangers and will be told to try and contain Radamel Falcao and United's new attacking line-up. Former England international Ferdinand turned down two other London clubs in favour of joining Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road. Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand will line up for Queens Park Rangers against his former club at Old Trafford on Sunday . Wilfried Zaha (third row, sixth from right) Zaha never truly got going at United, making just two Premier League appearances, and the winger was given permission to return to Crystal Palace, a club he helped win promotion to the top flight in 2013, on a season-long loan. Fabio da Silva (third row, fourth from right) Now on the books of Cardiff City, the full-back left United after spending a year on loan at QPR. In his six years in Manchester, Fabio managed just 22 Premier League appearances, compared with his brother, Rafael, who has broken the 100 mark. Fabio da Silva marks Wilfried Zaha and the pair are both no longer at Manchester United . Alexander Buttner (second row, fourth from left) Buttner joined Dynamo Moscow after spending two years with United. The 25-year-old left for £4.4m, having made just 13 Premier League appearances and scoring twice. Van Gaal deemed Buttner surplus to requirements following the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton. Alexander Buttner moved from Manchester United to Dynamo Moscow after two years at Old Trafford . Coach Phil Neville (second row, third from right) Former Everton defender Neville was reunited with Moyes at United, becoming the first-team coach. The 37-year-old is now concentrating on his career as a pundit for the BBC, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Gary. Phil Neville walks with Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford but only the latter remains at Manchester United . Shinji Kagawa (front row, far left) Kagawa was never loved at Old Trafford the same way he was at Borussia Dortmund and the attacking midfielder returned to the Bundesliga club for £6.3m on a four-year contract. Nani (front row, fourth from left) Nani left to join former club Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan and, in his own way, helped with the arrival of Marcos Rojo. Nani made 147 appearances in the Premier League and scored 25 goals. Shinji Kagawa laughs with Nani in the background during the pair's time together at Manchester United . Assistant manager Steve Round (front row, fifth from left) The departure of Moyes caused a ripple effect which was felt by his back-room staff. Round, United's assistant manager during the year they finished seventh, was relieved of his duties. Manager David Moyes (front row, centre) United did not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years and the Old Trafford club had never finished outside of the Premier League top three before. Both records were smashed. The former Everton boss and his coaching staff were paid £5.2m compensation for the sacking. Manchester United assistant manager Steve Round (left) left Manchester United with David Moyes (centre) Nemanja Vidic (front row, sixth from right) After eight years at the club and five Premier League titles - not to mention a Champions League win - Vidic decided enough was enough. The centre-back joined Inter Milan after seeing out his contract. Nemanja Vidic spent eight years at Manchester United and won five Premier League titles during his stint . Coach Jimmy Lumsden (front row, fifth from right) Another to suffer the same fate as Moyes. Lumsden parted company with the club at the same time as assistant manager Round after it all fell apart at Old Trafford. Patrice Evra (front row, fourth from right) After a mammoth 273 Premier League appearances, Evra joined Serie A club Juventus on a two-year deal. The fee was £1.2m for the 33-year-old, who now seems destined to see out his career in Italy. Patrice Evra moved to Serie A club Juventus after 273 Premier League appearances for Manchester United . Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez (front row, third from right) Hernandez was surplus to requirements up front and fell behind in the pecking order, particularly with the arrival of Radamel Falcao. The striker joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan and the Spanish giants have the option to buy at the end of the deal. Javier Hernandez became surplus to requirements at Manchester United and fell behind the pecking order . Mexico international Javier Hernandez joined Real Madrid on a one-year loan deal with an option to buy . Tom Cleverley (front row, second from right) Cleverley has been in and out of Manchester since 2009, taking in loans at Leicester, Watford and Wigan, and the midfielder has joined Aston Villa for another temporary spell. The 25-year-old would have warmed the bench with Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind arriving as summer signings. Everton attempted to sign Tom Cleverely on deadline day but the midfielder joined Aston Villa . Tom Cleverley avoided warming the bench at Manchester United by joining Aston Villa late on deadline day . And the rest: . Chris Woods - goalkeeping coach - Woods was told alongside Phil Neville that he would no longer be needed at the club after Moyes' departure in May. Rob Swire - physio - retired in July after being at Manchester United since 1999. He was replaced by assistant Neil Hough.

"Paolo Di Canio applied for the vacant Bolton manager's job as he looks to return to football. The Italian apparently threw his hat into the ring as Wanderers look to replace Dougie Freedman, who left 'by mutual consent' last week. However, Di Canio is unlikely to get the job, say the Telegraph. He has been out of work since being fired by Sunderland in September last year but has good lower-league credentials from his time at Swindon. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Di Canio booed by his own fans (ARCHIVE) Paolo Di Canio applied for the Bolton job but is unlikely to be appointed by Wanderers . It is thought Bolton are looking for someone with a connection to the club and their former midfielder Peter Reid is keen on a role.

Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton are the bookies' favourites, while ex-Bolton captain and assistant manager Phil Brown - who is boss of Southend - is also linked.

"We all know that it sometimes suits football's coaches and players to speak with forked tongue. If you are exceptional at reading what's said, but dyslexic about what's between the lines, then you're in trouble. However it may well be that when Joachim Low pin-pointed Germany's impending matches with Poland and Ireland as the most difficult he expected to face this season there was no subterfuge. Germany manager Joachim Low poses with his medal after his World Cup win in July . A few days ago I was speaking to the club coach of one of Germany's World Cup-winning players and he admitted that the footballer had come to him not long before our chat to confess that he was mentally and physically shattered - that suddenly he ached all over. Die Mannschaft is already missing central parts of their vorsprung machine - Phillip Lahm retired, new captain Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira injured. Thus if others are going through the post-world cup blues and blisters then Herr Low has an interesting job of work on his hands. His prognosis is: ‘For me, it is perfectly clear: the months leading up to the end of the year will be incredibly hard. ‘We have players who are tired, affected physically and who haven't recovered emotionally after the World Cup. ‘First of all, we have to take a step back, solidify ourselves and try to find the players who are in the best physical condition and are not battling against injuries.’ There's context. The last time Germany won the World Cup, under Der Kaiser Beckenbauer in 1990 their Autumn results included a 1-1 draw with Portugal and a remarkably narrow 3-2 win over Luxembourg. More recently, Spain lost 4-0 to Portugal and 4-1 to Argentina in friendlies and squeaked past Scotland 3-2 in the months post Soccer City in 2014. Beckenbauer isn't automatically a natural ally of Low's. Famously idiosyncratic in some of his declarations and decisions [recently banned by FIFA for failing to comply with their ethics investigator] Der Kaiser can, now, spark as much derision as respect for some of his football views. Bayern Munich and Germany legend Philipp Lahm has retired from international duty . Bastian Schweinsteiger is yet to play this season due to injury . Sami Khedira is also currently sidelined with injury problems . He's taken several pot-shots at Pep Guardiola's Bayern for example. Pre-Brazil, in fact, Beckenbauer admitted he thought winning the tournament was beyond Löw's Mannschaft and that a semi-final appearance, plus positive publicity for the Bundesliga, would be an acceptable product from a tournament in which German football normally regards domination as a birthright. Yet his choice of phrases nicely reflects the predominant zeitgeist in Germany. Purring with pride at being the world's number one again, and content with the velvet football which Low's team can lay on at will. But still looking for a bit more of that iron fist. Not just the Joachim Low way. The German way. According to Beckenbauer: ‘In aesthetic terms Germany has never played so well. Joachim Low has done a wonderful job and has transformed German football culture so that we now play a much more seductively. We have exceptional attacking power - never better. ‘However the important thing always is to retain our combative mentality. Players must be prepared to sacrifice themselves. They should be ready to put up with a bit of pain. 'It's absolutely wonderful to have such technically gifted players but I worry that some of our them are too fragile physically. ‘A few fall over at the slightest contact and they´re immediately looking for the referee.’ Beckenbauer and Low are the only two living men to have lifted football's greatest prize as German coach. Obviously, in terms of playing pedigree, trophies and even managerial pedigree they are ill-matched. The all-time thoroughbred and the whole-grain brown bread. Franz Beckenbauer celebrates as West Germany boss after winning the World Cup in 1990 . And the German legend remains an influential figure presiding over  football in the country . Although Low has the air of the maverick his squad atmosphere is high-tech, calm, modern. Controlled. The fact that Germany now face Poland is, for some of us, a throwback to the 1974 World Cup when the Poles' greatest ever side, Lato, Gorgoń, Deyna, Kasperczak and Gadocha, were narrowly beaten (14 minutes from time, Gerd Muller) in the quarter-final. Compared to the rigid discipline and immense strategic planning of Löw's victorious era, Der Kaiser recalls his first World Cup win as a harum-scarum, riotous affair. He admits: ‘We got up to all sorts in my day but nobody found out . There was no social media back then. I remember we trained for the that World Cup in Malente, (Northern Germany) and we were bored rigid. I used my status as captain to persuade the local police to escort me into the town without anyone finding out. ""I couldn't possibly tell you what I got up to of course... Martin O'Neill and his assistant Roy Keane could take advantage of Germany's potential fragility with Ireland . There was a dispute about our bonus payment system and, as captain I warned the federation that we players were prepared to stop training and even refuse to go to the World Cup if they didn't meet our demands. ""We managed to find a compromise position in the end but things were very tense between us and Helmut Schön, the coach. ‘We certainly didn't start the competition in the best situation but we were all in warrior mode, particularly against Holland, so we ended up winning. I remember my pep talk to my team mates before the final. I said: “Just one more big push and we'll make history and our country proud”. ‘Even as I said it though, I knew that nobody was listening. They were all thinking about the game.’ However, just to continue the theme there was a post World Cup dip 40 years ago too. Missing several stars from the final, injured or retired, West Germany's handful of matches post winning in Munich against Johan Cruyff's Holland included draws with Greece and Bulgaria, defeat to England and a narrow 1-0 win over Malta. Embarrassing for the Germans, schadenfreude for everyone else. So, the message is clear. For Mario Götze, Manuel Neuer, Mesut Özil and co. - beware the ides of October.","Germany boss Joachim Low pin-pointed Germany's qualifiers against Poland and Ireland as the most difficult he expected to face this season .

"Michael Schumacher is making such good progress in a Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer, a Swiss newspaper has claimed. It has been reported the Formula 1 legend has been improving since he was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a unit near his Swiss home. The news comes at the same time as reports in Croatian media claiming neurosurgeons who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique have been approached to see if they can help. Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher (pictured with his wife Corinna) is making such good progress in a Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer, a Swiss newspaper has claimed . Schumacher was transferred to the University Hospital Lausanne, in Switzerland, on June 16 to begin rehabilitation . Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick reported: 'There are signs that Michael will leave the clinic soon and be cared for at home.' Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him, complete with state of the art machines and a separate building for carers to live in. The newspaper reported that a new building with no outside steps has been constructed on the grounds of the mansion. It is thought that this will be used as the long-term care home for Schumacher. Some experts say that such home-care for a coma patient is unwise. But with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts. Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps. Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps . Four months ago it was reported that his devoted wife Corinna and his family had invested heavily in transforming parts of their mansion home in Gland into a medical centre for him . It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes. Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks. According to the Croatian media meanwhile, Croatian doctors Darko Chudy and Vedran Deletis, who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique, have been approached to see if they can help. It is believed that the microchip may be able to help him to walk and talk again after his extended period in a coma. It has been reported the Formula 1 legend has been improving since he was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, (pictured) to a unit near his Swiss home . It has been claimed the family of Schumacher made the initial contact with the two doctors from the Croatian capital Zagreb after reports in specialist publications indicating that their technique had already helped other patients. The medics reportedly confirmed when questioned that there had been contact but declined to discuss the case in detail. 'We've had a case with Croat schoolboy and he started to walk after two months,' Doctor Darko Chudy confirmed in a short interview with local media. But he added that he cannot talk about the Schumacher case, other than to confirm that there had been contact and it is believed his technique would be able to help.","Swiss media report the Formula 1 legend 'will leave the clinic soon and could be cared for at home'

"Swindon closed the gap on League One leaders Bristol City thanks to a 2-1 win over a Kevin Nugent-led Leyton Orient at Matchroom Stadium. Michael Smith and Nathan Byrne scored for Town, who held on for a third straight league victory despite Darius Henderson responding for the O's deep into stoppage time. That result leaves Swindon four points behind Bristol City with a game in hand after the pacesetters drew 1-1 at Walsall, where Romaine Sawyers equalised late on for the Saddlers after Joe Bryan had struck early. Nathan Byrne of Swindon celebrates scoring his team's second goal during the League One match between Leyton Orient and Swindon Town at The Matchroom Stadium . Peterborough also had to settle for a point after a 2-2 home draw against Oldham, with Michael Bostwick and Marcus Maddison netting for Posh but Jonathan Forte and Genseric Kusunga replying for the Latics. MK Dons took full advantage of Ben Nugent being sent off for Yeovil as goals from Will Grigg and Daniel Powell helped the visitors to prevail 2-0 at Huish Park. Preston also made a forward move thanks to a 4-2 defeat of Colchester at Deepdale, where Scott Wiseman, Alan Browne, Paul Gallagher and Chris Humphrey all hit the target for North End. Down at the other end of the table, Crewe remain bottom following a 2-0 loss at Bradford, with Aaron McLean and Gary Liddle doing the damage for the Bantams. Scunthorpe also continued to struggle as Doncaster came from behind to prevail 2-1 at Glanford Park with goals from James Coppinger and Nathan Tyson, while Port Vale went down 1-0 at Fleetwood after having Jordan Slew dismissed and then conceding a Stephen Dobbie penalty late on.

Chesterfield overcame the first-half dismissal of goalkeeper Tommy Lee to beat Sheffield United 3-2, with Jimmy Ryan, Gary Roberts and Eoin Doyle putting the Spireites in control before Marc McNulty and Neil Collins netted in a late rally by the Blades. Shaun Harrad bagged the only goal of the game as Notts County beat Gillingham 1-0, while Barnsley prevailed by the same scoreline at Rochdale through a Peter Ramage strike. Josh McQuoid and Simeon Jackson appeared to have put Coventry in control against Crawley, but Gwion Edwards and Izale McLeod hit back to make it 2-2 at Ricoh Arena.","Swindon close gap on Bristol City at the top thanks to 2-1 win over Orient .

"Germany coach Joachim Low knew he would have to inject fresh legs into his squad to replace veterans after the World Cup, but a raft of injuries means he has had to delve deep into his playing stocks for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland. With former captain Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose ending their international careers after the tournament in Brazil in July, Low was already forced to replace several first choice players. Against Poland on Saturday, however, the coach will also be without more than half a dozen key players including new captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, Marco Reus, Benedikt Howedes, Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira, Marcel Schmelzer and Mario Gomez. Germany manager Joachim Low has an injury crisis with seven regulars out . Former captain Philipp Lahm (second left) was one of three players to retire after the World Cup win in Brazil . New captain Bastian Schweinsteiger is one of several players unavailable for the two qualifiers . To fill the void, Low has recalled Borussia Monchengladbach forward Max Kruse, who did not make the World Cup squad, and in-form Bayer Leverkusen winger Karim Bellarabi, courted also by Morocco. 'We had him on our list for some time,' said Low of the 24-year-old Bellarabi. 'In the games against Poland and Ireland we have the chance to increase our lead at the top and move away from the competition. ' Germany, top of the group following their opening win over Scotland, play Ireland in Gelsenkirchen next week. 'Karim Bellarabi has earned his chance after several outstanding performance for his club. He is very strong in one-on-one situations and an outstanding alternative for our attack,' Low said. Bayer Leverkusen winger Karim Bellarabi is one of the new faces hoping to impress . Kruse has been equally impressive since the start of the season and will fill the void in attack left by the absence of Klose and Gomez, with Mario Gotze also an option up front against the Poles. Low will need all the firepower he can get from Kruse and Bellarabi, who have each netted three times in the league. Especially with winger Andre Schurrle missing training this week with an injury and Lukas Podolski spending most of the season so far on the Arsenal bench. Schalke 04's Julian Draxler, who was nursing a fever this weeek, was also doubtful for the game but has joined up with the team and could be ruled fit for Saturday. Real Madrid playmaker Toni Kroos will have a key role to play in the absence of Schweinsteiger . The coach is also aware, however, that his team will have to defend as well as score goals against their eastern neighbours, with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski in fine form. The Bayern Munich forward, last season's top scorer in the Bundesliga, has already netted four times in seven league games, including twice last week in their win over Hannover 96. 'He is exceptional. Few players can control the ball like he does under pressure,' said Low. 'He is ice cold in front of goal and overall a complete player.'","Germany face Poland on Saturday and Republic of Ireland next week .

"Leaders Bristol City overcame a second-half MK Dons fightback to win 3-2 and maintain their five-point lead at the top of Sky Bet League One. A seventh win in 10 league games seemed assured when Kieran Agard had netted twice in the first half but goals from Dean Bowditch and Benik Afobe levelled things up after 73 minutes. But the Dons - who slip from second to fourth - were level for less than two minutes as Wade Elliott's second goal of the season ensured all three points for the Robins. Wade Elliot's late winner made sure that Bristol City kept their lead - and his team-mates seemed delighted . Elliot led by example to see off the MK Don's fightback and make sure that Bristol City were winners at home . Peterborough moved up to second with a first win in four games. Conor Washington popped up with the decisive goal on the stroke of half time in the 1-0 win against Fleetwood. Sheffield United recovered from falling behind in the 83rd minute to secure a 2-1 win over Gillingham, with Jamie Murphy scoring the winner seven minutes into stoppage time. Leyton Orient began life without Russell Slade by squandering the lead twice in a 3-2 defeat to Rochdale, who had Ashley Eastham sent off. Jobi McAnuff and Romain Vincelot both put the O's ahead, but Matt Done and Peter Vincenti replied on each occasion before Done popped up again to net the winner as Chris Dagnall's first-half penalty miss proved costly. Conor Washington celebrates his decisive goal in Peterborough's 1-0 win over Fleetwood . Oldham also came from behind twice to record a 3-2 victory over Scunthorpe.

"Prices at petrol pumps across the U.S. are rising so quickly that television reporters are struggling to keep up. Footage of ABC News' Cecilia Vega reporting from a California forecourt has gone viral after each of the three grades of fuel rose 10 cents before viewers' eyes. 'It's almost too unbelievable to believe,' she said during her live report for Diane Sawyer's World News Tonight. Scroll down for video... Staggering: Footage of ABC News' Cecilia Vega reporting from a California forecourt has gone viral after each of the three grades of fuel rose 10 cents before viewers eyes . Fast paced: In the blink of an eye, the prices rose by another 10 cents each . She added: 'Just while we were on the air during those two minutes of that story, the gas prices here at this station went up by 10 cents. 'It was $4.99. Now, it’s $5.09 for a gallon of regular gas here at this station in downtown Los Angeles.' Some sceptics believe the extraordinary rise in the cost came because of a deal between the TV crew and the station owner. They agreed to rise the price at that time, they claim, to further highlight the problem of spiralling fuel costs. But that has been denied by ABC News. The real-time rise came at the start of a live report into the escalating cost of fuel in the U.S. The station sign, at the beginning of the video, clearly showed fuel prices stood at $4.99 a gallon for regular, $5.09 a gallon for plus and $5.19 a gallon for super premium. Claims: ABC News has denied speculation it asked the station's owners to change the prices when they were live on air . But as Vega spoke to the camera, the sign in the background can be clearly seen blinking as an employee altered the digits. The news report then cut to pre-recorded interviews with struggling motorists in states across the country. And when the camera returned to the live spot two minutes later, the sign behind Vega read $5.09, $5.19 and $5.29. A stunned Sawyer could not believe her eyes, and warned drivers not to 'blink at the gasoline station'. Broadcasting of the rise could not have come at a worse time for President Barack Obama, who is seeking to confront rising public anxiety about soaring prices. Worry: President Barack Obama is facing rising fuel prices . They are threatening to undercut his re-election prospects and offer Republicans an easy target. Obama was seeking to rev up his supporters as he hauled in campaign cash yesterday in the important battleground state of Florida, which he may need to capture to hold the White House in November. He accused his Republican presidential rivals of peddling a philosophy that is ""wrong about America,"" casting them as protectors of the wealthy who would leave everyone else to fend for themselves. Obama assailed Republicans for offering what he described as flawed and dishonest plans to lower gasoline prices. He said dismissively that all the Republicans can talk about is more drilling - 'a bumper sticker... a strategy to get politicians through an election' - when America's energy challenges demand much more. In a speech in Miami, he promoted the expansion of domestic oil and gas exploration but also the development of new forms of energy. For all the political claims, economists say there is not much a president of either party can do about gasoline prices in the short term. But it is clear that people are concerned - a new Associated Press-GfK poll said seven in 10 find the issue deeply important - so it is sure to be a political issue through the summer. Obama aides worry that the rise in prices could reverse the country's economic gains and the president's improved political standing. The poll shows that though Obama's approval rating on the economy has climbed, 58 percent disapprove of what he's doing on gas prices. Obama insisted there are no short-term solutions to high gas prices, and that anyone suggesting otherwise was not being honest. Still, he sought to offer something to anxious voters by saying he had ordered his administration to search for every possible area to help consumers in the coming months. He sought to take credit for rising oil and natural gas production, a greater mix of energy sources and decreased consumption. He promoted an energy strategy that the administration says will reduce dependence on foreign oil in the long term. Obama said that despite political criticism of his policies 'America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years'. He also noted that, for the first time in 30 years, the United States is now exporting more petroleum products than it imports.","Live ABC News report shows three grades each increasing by 10 cents .

"A late spin failed to stop Lewis Hamilton from setting the fastest time in final practice ahead of Sunday's inaugural Russian Grand Prix. At the Sochi Autodrom, in the heart of the Olympic Park that was the setting for the Winter Games earlier this year, Hamilton was clear of Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg by 0.3seconds. But on another flying lap minutes from the end after just setting his best time of one minute 38.726secs, Hamilton locked up heading into the penultimate turn. Lewis Hamilton is odds-on to secure pole for tomorrow's race after setting the pace in final practice .

With plenty of run-off area at that part of the circuit, Hamilton avoided any damage to his car and swiftly returned to the pits, bringing his session to an end. None of his rivals, however, could match the 29-year-old Briton who has so far found himself at one with Formula One's newest venue. Rosberg, who conceded after Friday practice to taking a wrong turn with a creative set-up that kept him a second adrift of Hamilton, vaulted into second late on with a lap of 1:39.016secs. That relegated Williams' Valtteri Bottas to third, with the Finn 0.371secs adrift of Hamilton, and the only other driver to finish within a second of the championship leader. After three successive victories, and eight overall for the season, Hamilton has a 10-point lead over Rosberg going into the final four races. Whilst the title race is likely to go down to the wire and the final race in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes can seal the constructors' championship on Sunday. Nearest rivals Red Bull are 190 points adrift, and so far at this circuit have been off the pace, although after a tough day on Friday, Daniel Ricciardo at least improved to fourth quickest, 1.029secs adrift. Less than a second covered Ricciardo down to 13th-placed Sergio Perez in his Force India such is the tight nature of the rest of the field. Mercedes are on course to win the constructors' championship this weekend after their dominant campaign . Hamilton leads the drivers' championship with only four races remaining - including the inaugural Russian GP . Williams' Felipe Massa was fifth on the timesheet, followed by home hero Daniil Kvyat in his Toro Rosso, with Ferrari duo Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso seventh and eighth. Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne was ninth, with outgoing four-times champion Sebastian Vettel down in 10th, 1.6secs down. As for McLaren, after looking like strong podium contenders on Friday, Jenson Button was down in 11th, whilst team-mate Kevin Magnussen was 17th, albeit completing just four laps due to a mechanical failure. The young Dane will serve a five-place grid penalty after qualifying due to a gearbox replacement. The sole Marussia of Max Chilton, with the team opting to run one car this weekend as a mark of respect for the critically-injured Jules Bianchi, was 20th, six seconds down. Pastor Maldonado brought up the rear without a time to his name due to his own technical woes with his Lotus that resulted in him completing only two installation laps.","Hamilton was three tenths clear of title rival Nico Rosberg .

"Kevin Nugent has been placed in caretaker charge of Leyton Orient following Russell Slade's resignation, the Sky Bet League One club has announced. Slade quit Brisbane Road on Wednesday night having been denied permission to speak to Cardiff about their vacant managerial position. His departure came after an tumultuous couple of weeks at the east London club, during which Slade was told by Orient's new owners that he had one game to save his job following their poor start to the season. Kevin Nugent is the new caretaker manager of Leyton Orient after Russell Slade's resignation . Russell Slade shakes the hand of Vincelot shortly before he left the club as Kevin Nugent takes over . Leyton Orient hand the reins to Kevin Nugent after Slade resigned as manager on Wednesday evening . Slade is hoping to become Cardiff boss, despite Leyton Orient denying him permission to speak to them . The 53-year-old survived the 1-1 draw with Notts County and then oversaw a 2-1 win at Scunthorpe and Tuesday night's Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield United despite growing speculation linking him with the Bluebirds. Slade is now expected to be confirmed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's successor at Cardiff, although Orient are consulting their lawyers over his resignation. He was the fourth-longest serving manager in the top four divisions, having taken over in April 2010, and guided Orient to the League One play-off final last season.

"More than half of British women who work out are ditching sugar-dense cereals for protein-packed breakfasts. Most female gym bunnies (57 per cent) reveal that health concerns have led them to pack in Frosties, Cheerios and Special K in favour of options they feel are of better nutritional value. The amount of women having high-protein breakfasts has more than doubled in the past five years (3 per cent up to 7 per cent). Almost two thirds (63 per cent) of women used to have cereal for breakfast five years ago, now just two in five (42 per cent) do. Scroll down for video . Most female gym bunnies have packed in Frosties and Special K in favour of options of better nutritional value . The results from their survey of 2,000 people reflects recent statistics that show cereal brands are continuing to struggle. An increasing number of women are even opting for protein supplement-based breakfast products as convenient on-the-go meals. Sales of products such as protein pancakes, shakes and even protein coffee are up 46 per cent since February at sports nutrition company Bodybuilding Warehouse, and it's women who are driving the change. The amount of women taking protein snacks and supplements has almost tripled in the past year (6 per cent up to 17 per cent), as opposed to a smaller increase of a quarter in men (25 per cent to 31 per cent). A spokesperson says: 'These statistics about more and more women taking protein snacks and supplements aren't surprising. Often cereals are empty calories and don’t offer much by way of nutrition at all. 'People are exercising more control over what they put into their bodies and, with even some cereals containing more sugar than a doughnut, understandably people are looking for alternatives. 'We've seen huge growth in the popularity of protein products being used as an alternative breakfast. 'This is often used alongside a morning workout or as part of a general fitness regime. 'They provide a satisfying, filling and tasty alternative to traditional breakfasts, with the added benefit of being part of a healthy lifestyle for those who exercise regularly. Bodybuilding Warehouse has responded to demand by taking popular breakfast items and redeveloping them into healthier options with reduced sugar and fat. 'Having a protein-filled breakfast in the morning is great because it fills you up for longer and means you will eat less throughout the day,' continues their spokesperson. 'This is ideal if you’re on a diet or healthy eating plan. However, whilst high-protein breakfasts offer a number of benefits, you need to be careful to choose options that aren't too high in ""bad"" fats. Cereal isn't all bad though - dietitian Nichola Whitehead who runs the website nicsnutrition.com believes that certain types of grain are just as nutritious as a protein-packed meal, it just depends on the ingredients. She said: 'If anyone ever asks me ‘is this cereal healthy’ the first thing I do is ignore any claims and branding on the front and turn it straight over to the ingredients list.. if sugar is near the top then I’d probably suggest picking another. 'The good news is though that most cereals are fortified with nutrients such a iron and folic acid meaning that a bowl of cereal beats a greasy-spoon takeaway any day.' 'But having eggs for breakfast has been shown to reduce feelings of hunger later in the day, and all protein sources including milk, greek yoghurt, salmon and whey protein will contribute to our daily protein needs. 'People who work-out or who are trying to lose weight and preserve their lean muscle mass may need more than the recommended 0.8g of protein per Kg of body weight a day, and so including protein at breakfast is a great start to the day.'

Ingredients . • 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites . • 75g of chicken, turkey or lean bacon, chopped . • 1 onion, chopped finely . • 1 tomato, sliced thinly . • 50g of crumbled goats cheese or cheddar . • Green vegetable options chose any combination of: Handful of peas, 1 green pepper, de seeded and chopped, a handful of spinach or broccoli, diced . • 1 tbsp of butter or coconut oil . Method . Heat the butter or coconut oil in an omelette pan. If using raw meat ingredients cook these first. Chicken or turkey should be opaque all the way through with no raw pinkness. Once you’re happy that the meat is cooked, remove it and add the vegetables, omitting any spinach as this can become overcooked and soggy. Sauté to your liking - they retain more nutrients if they are softened and not over cooked. Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking return the cooked meat and any other cooked ingredients for your frittata and heat them through. Beat your eggs with salt and pepper. In the skillet organise the contents to give an even spread of different ingredients then scatter all or some of the cheese across the surface. You may want to reserve some for a cheesy topping. Add any spinach you are using. Pour the beaten egg over the surface of the cheesy vegetables. On medium heat, cook the frittata for about two minutes, scraping the sides and bottom with heat-resistant spatula and lifting the vegetables to let the egg down to the bottom of the pan. When eggs are mostly cooked, but still wet, stop stirring. You want to see cooked egg scattered throughout, but loose egg in between. Continue cooking on the stove for another minute. Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top, put the pan under the grill and cook the top until the cheese is hot and melted. Allow to stand for a minute. Cut into wedges and serve.

"From the exasperatingly dull to the garishly kitsch, lunchboxes are not usually seen as a bastion of style. This may all be about to change, however, because today sees the launch of some seriously fashionable food receptacles. Introducing The Hemsley Slice, which claims to combine the everyday necessity of a lunchbox with the luxury of a designer bag. The Hemsley Slice looks every part the normal designer bag but folds out into a lunch box . Making its debut at London Fashion Week the stylish sandwich bags have been created in a bid  to encourage women to love their lunch. The Hemsley Slice appears to be nothing more than a fashionable accessory but once unfolded it reveals itself as the perfect container for a packed lunch, including a square sandwich wallet. Commissioned by the Federation of Bakers and designed by up and coming handbag designer Jayne Hemsley of Hemsley London, the limited edition bag provides fashion conscious women everywhere the chance to bring their lunch to work in a brand new design. A spokesman for the Federation of Bakers laments the laments the absence of sandwiches in the modern fashion fan's lunchbox and blames extreme food trends for the loss of interest in sandwiches: 'Due to fad diets, women have forgotten about the benefits of eating bread. We want to remind women that sandwiches are a healthy, nutritious lunch option, and that they are back in fashion.' This isn't the first time gluten has invaded the catwalks of London Fashion Week. Last year saw the launch of Eau de Toast, where models were given the chance to hit the catwalk smelling of freshly made toast. The designer of the bag, Jayne Hemsley wants her creation to encourage women to eat more bread . Both 'The Hemsley Slice' and 'Eau de Toast' were created as part of the Federation's Slice of Life Campaign, which promotes bread in daily life. For Jayne Hemsley the design is a must have and she created the bag with herself in mind. 'I love making sandwiches at home, because I know exactly what I'm putting in them, so I know I'm eating a healthy lunch. The idea to do this in style really inspired me.' The Hemsley Slice is available in five unique colours, including pertunia (pink), anemone (dark blue), mertyl (aqua green), seedem (yellow) and sky (light blue). Dietitian Lucy Jones is also supporting the campaign and says that bread is not something to be frightened of. 'Bread is an important part of a healthy balanced diet; it's high in fibre and calcium, and low in fat and calories - an average slice contains only 80 calories. 'Sliced bread is a great option if you're looking after your figure, as it can really help with portion control by keeping track of exactly how many calories you are consuming per slice. If you're trying to lose weight, it's important to try and choose healthy fillings for your sandwich at lunch such as egg and cress, or chicken and salad.'

"Japanese researchers found that high rice consumption, or eating lots of high GI foods, led to good quality sleep . If you can't sleep at night then it might be worth changing what you have for dinner. Scientists have discovered that eating lots of rice can trigger a deep slumber, while pasta and noodles can actually hinder sleep. The Japanese researchers also found eating bread products - including white bread, pancakes and pizza - had no effect on the quality of sleep. They say eating food high on the glycaemic index (GI) - such as rice - was found to be associated with good quality sleep. Foods with a high GI release sugar in the blood more quickly, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels that can last for a longer time. Low GI foods, on the other hand, tend to cause small blood sugar rises that don’t last as long. A high GI diet may affect sleep quality because of the effects of tryptophan, an amino acid known for its tranquilising effects and link to the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. This backs up previous research which found eating a meal high in carbohydrate - with a high GI - increased the amount of tryptophan being transported into the brain compared with other amino acids. In the brain, tryptophan is converted into serotonin and then to melatonin, which induces sleep. According to the study, people in Japan consume up to ten times more rice than those in Europe and North America. Rice accounts for approximately 28 per cent of the Japanese people’s daily energy intake. The study analysed data from the annual health examinations of 1,848 factory workers (1,164 men and 684 women). The Industrial Health and Safety Law in Japan requires that employers offer annual health examinations to all of their employees, so this data could be used by researchers. The participants also answered a questionnaire in 2003 and a year later in 2004 on health-related behaviours such as their diet, whether they smoked and how much exercise they took. To assess the participants’ sleep quality, researchers used the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which assesses a person’s quality of sleep. This looked at sleep quality; the amount of time it took to fall asleep after the lights were turned off, duration, efficiency, disturbances, use of medication and how the workers felt and performed during the day. Those with a higher rice intake and higher GI intake scored much better on the sleep scale - i.e. they slept well. The researchers also found a higher rice and GI intake were linked with better sleep duration. Higher noodle intake, however, was associated with a more frequent sleep disturbance, higher levels of daytime dysfunction, increased use of sleep medication, poorer subjective sleep quality, and taking longer to get to sleep, they found. Bread consumption was not found to be linked to sleep quality. Writing in the study, the researchers said: ‘The present study indicates that high consumption of rice and a high dietary GI are associated with good sleep, especially good sleep duration. 'Meanwhile, higher noodle consumption is associated with poor sleep quality. The effects of starchy foods on sleep may differ according to their GI values. 'Diets with a high-GI, especially those with high rice intake, may contribute to good sleep.' The research was published in the journal PLOS ONE. Experts said that high GI foods might lead to good sleep because of the effect of the amino acid tryptophan (pictured), known to have a tranqilising affect, and sleep-inducing hormone melatonin .","High rice intake or high GI intake associated with good sleep, study found .

"McDonald's is attempting to trademark the term 'McBrunch and filed the trademark application for McBrunch back in July. It's unclear what the The Golden Arches actually plan to do with the trademark, however four years ago Burger King trialed a brunch menu in select markets, but ultimately scrapped the idea. A McDonald's spokesperson confirmed the application but cautioned, 'We routinely file intent to use trademark applications as a regular course of business. We can't share details at this time as to how the trademarks may or may not be used.' Scroll down for video . New ideas? The Golden Arches filed the trademark application for McBrunch back in July . The fast-food giant has toyed with the idea of brunch before. McDonald's applied for a trademark on 'McBrunch' in 2001 but abandoned that application . The idea for introducing a brunch menu would call in line with the trends of many other fast food franchises. Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, Chick-Fil-A and Burger King have increased the number of breakfast options on their menu. The fast-food giant has contemplated with the idea of brunch before. McDonald's applied for a trademark on 'McBrunch' in 2001 but abandoned that application. However, pundits are suggesting the company may be more serious this time around due to flagging sales. McDonald's saw same-store sales decline 2.8 percent in August, which was slightly worse than analysts' estimates of a 2 percent decline. The fast-food giant reported its worst global monthly same-store sales in a decade. The move comes as fast food franchises like Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King have been ramping up breakfast options . It continues to test more upscale breakfast items, like the recent mini bundt cakes and chorizo breakfast burritos. The competition has been particularly fierce at breakfast time, which McDonald's relies on for about 25% of its sales. McDonald's has been focusing on coffee in the past few years, as Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks have ramped up their food offerings. Taco Bell, which is owned by Yum! Brands, has introduced new breakfast items, such as the Waffle Taco and the Biscuit Taco, with great fanfare. McDonald's has also been losing ground to regional chains, such as Sonic and Jack in the Box, that appeal to younger consumers. In the fast-food business, among the most common — and least expensive — ways to grow sales is to create new so-called 'day parts' to lure customers during times of the day that they don't usually stop by. That's why some chains have been pushing late-afternoon smoothies and late-night snacks. A Brunch program at McDonald's would likely be limited to weekends and holidays and extend the breakfast hour to noon or even 1 p.m. as well as introduce new items not currently on the breakfast menu. McMozzarella sticks were intorudced last month. McDonald's have been branching out with new items in the hopes of attracting new customers over the past year-and-a-half . Last month, McDonald's added mozzarella sticks to its menu - with the obligatory 'McMarinara' sauce on the side. The fast-food chain is test-running the snack in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with three pieces being sold for a dollar. The menu item is not entirely new - the cheesy item was previously available in the UK and called Mozzarella Dippers.","Fast food chain has been struggling in recent years.
