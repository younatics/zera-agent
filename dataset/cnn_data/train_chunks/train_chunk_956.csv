"Speaker of the House John Boehner pressed President Barack Obama to come up with a strategy to defeat the Islamic State today, telling reporters at a press conference this morning that it is eight months overdue. 'I’ve been calling for a strategy to deal with the growing terrorist threat since January, when ISIS came across the border in western Iraq,' Boehner said this morning ahead of a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office. 'We have a very serious problem, and what we need is a strategy, he added. Boehner's office said later that the Speaker looks forward to hearing about the president plans to decimate the extremist group that has taken over large swaths of land in Iraq and Syria during his address to the nation tomorrow night. The statement suggests Obama did not reveal his strategy to Boehner during their meeting today. Still waiting: House Speaker John Boehner said today that Obama's strategy for destroying the Islamic State is eight months overdue . Obama pow wowed with Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell this afternoon at the White House. Administration officials will also meet with key Senators tomorrow. Members of the House won't have the opportunity to question the president until Thursday, after his address. An aide to the Speaker told reporters in an email Tuesday night that Boehner 'made it clear that ISIL is preparing to fight us' during his meeting with Obama and told the president 'that as we learned in Syria, the longer we wait, the more difficult our choices become.' 'It is in the best interests of the United States and our allies to put in place a strategy that rises to the challenge of the threat we face, and takes the fight directly to ISIL in a decisive fashion,' Boehner said, according to his office. Boehner also expressed concern during the meeting that there may be weaknesses in border and homeland security policies 'that could expose the homeland to an immediate ISIL-linked attack,' the aide said. 'The Speaker looks forward to hearing the president outline a comprehensive strategy for destroying and defeating ISIL tomorrow night,' the aide added. The White House was even more tight lipped about Obama's meeting with Congressional leadership. It said in a statement after the meeting that President told attendees 'he would welcome action by the Congress that would aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat from ISIL.' 'The President and his team look forward to continuing extensive consultation with Congress,' the statement said. Obama has kept his plans under close wraps since announcing tomorrow's address during an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd last weekend. The Commander in Chief told the Meet the Press host that his strategy would include military, economic and political components but gave out few other details. Obama indicated that his plan would likely take 'some resources above...what we are currently doing' while declining to provide specifics. The president suggested he would not need the legislative branch's approval to take action, however, and plainly stated he had no intention of putting troops on the ground Iraq or Syria. 'This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war,' he said. The Hill reported on Monday that the Obama may ask Congress to revisit his request for a $5 billion counter terrorism fund, however. When the White House first asked Congress for the money it said $2.5 billion would go toward providing training and weaponry to international partners, according to the Hill. Another $1.5 billion would be directed to Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq to support Syrian refugee camps. Just $500 million of the fund was to be allotted to 'unforeseen contingencies related to counterterrorism or regional instability.' President Barack Obama, right, was tight lipped about his grand plan to defeat Islamic extremists during an interview last weekend with Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, right . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the counterrorism fund ' is a core component of the president’s strategy for dealing' with extremists in Iraq and Syria and 'and other issues like it around the globe.' Earnest said Obama would use the money to 'build up effective partners so that when the United States has to confront threats like this, that we have well-trained, well-equipped, effective partners that we can work with to confront these problems.' What is unclear is how Obama plans to stop jihadists ransacking Iraq and Syria at present. The United States had already launched 153 airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq as of Tuesday afternoon. It has not engaged the group militarily in Syria. Lawmakers are divided over whether the president needs authority from Congress to continue its bombing campaign in Iraq and whether it ought to begin striking Syria. The president is legally required by the War Powers Resolution to ask for Congress' approval of military action after 60 days of war with a country. A bipartisan group of lawmakers are claiming that Obama must ask for the legislative branch's permission to carry out airstrikes in Iraq after the 60 day cut off on October 7. Boehner said Tuesday he wasn't convinced that the situation in Iraq constituted as a war, though, and refused to speculate further on possible military actions Obama could take. 'I am looking for a strategy from the president that takes on this terrorist threat and defeats it,' he told a reporter who asked whether he was 'opposed to ground troops' at the presser. Other congressional leaders have avoided advocating specific action in Iraq and Syria as well. House Democratic caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra told reporters on Tuesday that members of the president's party were waiting for Obama to articulate his strategy before forming an opinion on the issue. 'Don't ask us what you think we should do, just tell us what you're going to do,' Becerra said, according to The Hill.","'We have a very serious problem, and what we need is a strategy,' Boehner told reporters .

"Mimi Anderson is no ordinary grandmother. She has conquered deserts, the Arctic and the jungle on foot in a number of gruelling 'ultra marathons'. Now she is set to challenge herself again by running 1,460 miles across South Africa. The 52-year-old from Kent is joining forces with Australian ultra runner Samantha Gash, 29, to take on the epic journey. Long journey ahead: Mimi Anderson is an experienced distance runner but she said taking on the Freedom Trail in South Africa will be her biggest challenge yet . The pair will run together along the Freedom Trail, an off-road route starting in Pietermaritzburg and finishing in Paarl, just outside Cape Town. The route requires navigational skills, river crossings and scrambling across rocks in parts and will take the pair just over a month to complete - running a total of 56 marathons back-to-back. Although both are experienced endurance athletes, Mimi told MailOnline that taking on the Freedom Trail will be one of the hardest things she has ever done. 'For both of us this will be the biggest . challenge of our running careers,' she said. 'Running an average of 80km per day . for 32 days isn't something to be taken lightly and . technical running isn't my forte. Road ahead: The Freedom Trail in South Africa starts in Pietermaritzburg and finishes in Paarl, just outside Cape Town . 'But I believe that in order to grow as a . person we all need to do things that take us way out of our comfort . zone, each time pushing just that little bit further – this project will . push me further than I have ever pushed myself before, in many ways.' Mimi and Samantha are putting themselves though the long-distance run with the support of NGO Save The Children Australia in order to raise money for girls and women in South Africa. Mimi, who has achieved three World Records including being the fastest woman to run from John O'Groats to Land's End, said: 'Both of us felt that if we were to take on a challenge as big as this we wanted to raise money to help South African girls and women. Samantha is 29 and I'm 52, two women, two generations and two pairs of legs supporting others.' Not going it alone: The grandmother-of-three, pictured here during another endurance race, will be joined by Samantha Gash as they run about 80k a day for 32 days . They are aiming to raise awareness . and . funds to set up of a social enterprise business in the Free State . of South Africa that will employ a dozen South African women to make . re-usable sanitary pads in order to keep girls in education. The pair . were shocked at how many girls are missing out on school . because of a lack of adequate sanitary products. Mimi explained: 'Once they reach . puberty, one . in three South African girls miss out on four or five days of . school per month because they cannot afford to buy sanitary pads. Instead they stay at home and use anything from old rags and rolled up . newspapers - anything they can get their hands on. Eventually . they drop out of school altogether.' The grandmother-of-three said . thinking about the cause will keep her pushing on when the going gets . tough when the race gets underway in September. Accomplishment: Mimi has previously ran the Badwater ultra marathon in Death Valley twice in a row . She said: 'Many people have asked me . what is driving us to run this ridiculously long distance. The answer is . simple; we are absolutely passionate about the cause for which we are . running. 'We are both lucky and have had . privileged backgrounds where education was a given, enabling us to make . choices about our futures, the South Africa girls in rural communities . aren't always so lucky. 'By supporting girls to remain in . education it will enable them to make a lasting and positive impact on . the communities they live in and society as a whole.' Mimi is no stranger to such endeavors for charities. Her . many other endurance feats include the fastest crossing on foot across . Ireland (345 miles in three days, 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes), doing . the infamous Badwater Ultra in America twice back-to-back and . completing the Marathon Des Sables ultra in the Sahara desert. Inspirational: Mimi only took up running at the age of 36 and it has helped her overcome an eating disorder . What makes Mimi's achievements ever . more remarkable is that in her youth, she suffered from an eating . disorder and only took up running at the age of 36. It was the joy of running that gave her the impetus to overcome anorexia. She explains: 'Running means I have to eat, otherwise my body simply wouldn't have . enough energy. So I'm no longer afraid of food, it's not the enemy but an . essential part of life. Running quite literally has given me back my . life which otherwise may have turned out so differently.'

"One in five ‘suicide tourists’ going to Switzerland to end their lives is British, say experts. A new study found a doubling of the number of people of all nationalities travelling to Dignitas, an organisation founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses end their own lives. Britons make up the second highest number of foreigners going to Zurich for assisted suicide between 2008 and 2012 – exceeded only by Germans. While euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK, other countries, like Switzerland, do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and Dignitas is one of the few to accept foreigners. Scroll down for video . Research: A new study found a doubling of the number of people of all nationalities travelling to Dignitas, an organisation founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses end their own lives . Academics from Zurich University behind the study argue that other countries have changed the law, or at least had a serious debate about the issues, as a result of the rise in suicide tourism. However, British experts claim there has been little impact in the UK despite increasing numbers seeking help to die abroad. The Zurich Institute of Legal Medicine produced data on 611 cases of assisted suicide of non-Swiss people from 31 countries around the world during the five year period. The highest number was 268 Germans followed by 126 Britons – making two thirds of the total. The study, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, found in 2008 there were 123 cases of suicide tourism. This dipped to 86 cases in 2009 and increased steadily to 2012 when it reached 172 cases. Overall, 58.5 per cent of cases were women and the average age of those using these services was 69 - although the range was from 23 years to 97. There are six ‘right to die’ organisations operating in Switzerland offering assisted suicide to their members providing they meet certain criteria. Law: While euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK, other countries, like Switzerland, do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and Dignitas is one of the few to accept foreigners (file photo) Four of these bodies offer services to foreign nationals, including people from the UK. These organisations deal with around 600 cases of suicide each year, some 150 to 200 of which are suicide tourists, the researchers found. Most cases of suicide tourism used Dignitas which charges between 9,000 to 10,500 Swiss francs (about £6,000 to £7,000) for assisting suicide, says the study. Neurological diseases including paralysis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis were the most common reasons for assisted suicide - accounting for almost half of cases. Dr Charles Foster, of Green Templeton College at Oxford University, in a commentary in the journal, said there may be growing public acknowledgement of something ‘intellectually, if not morally uncomfortable, about getting another country to do your dirty work’. But, he said, this was not a reason for changing English law on assisted suicide. In the House of Lords, when he presented the Assisted Dying Bill, Lord Falconer said ‘The current situation leaves the rich able to go to Switzerland, the majority reliant on amateur assistance, the compassionate treated like criminals. ‘It is time for a change in the law but only a very limited and safeguarded change. ‘It would not lead to more death but to less suffering.’ The second reading of the Bill, which would offer the chance of assisted dying to terminally ill patients deemed mentally capable and within six months of likely death, took place in July and is to be moved to the next Parliamentary stage - the committee stage - at a date yet to be set. Other countries in the top 10 between 2008 and 2012 were France with 66 cases, Italy 44, USA 21, Austria 14, Canada 12, Spain and Israel (eight each).","Study finds doubling in numbers of all nationalities travelling to Dignitas .

"Police stopped a pensioner with dementia driving the wrong way down a motorway – after crashing head-on into his vehicle to bring it to a standstill. Officers were sent to the M6 Toll motorway at 9.50pm on Tuesday night after the Honda Jazz was spotted heading south on the northbound carriageway near Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. The vehicle was travelling at around 50mph and traffic officers from West Midlands Police and the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) took the decision to make deliberate head-on contact with the Honda to bring it to a stop. The manoeuvre was a success and the vehicle was stopped. The driver of the car was uninjured while one of the officers suffered a minor injury. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Police stopped a pensioner with dementia driving the wrong way down the M6 toll road after crashing head-on into his vehicle to bring it to a standstill this morning . A rolling road-block was in place to safeguard other motorists on the road during the collision. The driver was found to be a 77-year-old man who has dementia and had been reported missing from his home in Rowley Regis just hours earlier. He was checked over by paramedics at the scene and then returned home to his family. Inspector Mark Watkins, from the CMPG, said: ‘This was an extremely unusual situation where the driver of the car had shown no intention to stop travelling in the wrong direction. ‘Traffic officers bravely took the decision to engineer a collision with the vehicle and I am sure that their selfless actions have prevented serious injury or worse to the driver and other motorists on the road. ‘We were relieved that we could bring this situation to a safe conclusion and return the man home safe and well to his family.’","Officers were sent to the M6 Toll motorway and stopped man at 50mph .

"Many people may not have heard of Jo Pavey before she struck gold at this month's European Championships. But athletics fans know the Exeter-based athlete has put in years of training to finally achieve a major title. And to her own surprise, victory has come when she's least expected it. She told MailOnline: 'I'm really chuffed. I have been trying to get a gold medal for so many years at a championships so to finally achieve it at the age of 40 with two young children is quite funny in some ways. Years ago I would never had thought this would be the circumstances in which I achieve a gold medal.' Scroll down for video . Life begins at 40: Jo Pavey became the oldest European champion in history when she won the 10k this month . Jo has been a successful runner from a young age, winning English School titles after her P.E. teacher spotted her talent and recommended she join her local running club. She trained and worked as a physiotherapist in the nineties before deciding to pursue a full-time career in athletics. Since then, she has been to four Olympics and won silver and bronze European and Commonwealth medals. But she adds that her dream was to get that 'elusive gold'. It was winning gold that has kept her motivated to train after becoming a mother to Jacob, five, and Emily, who will be one in September, with husband Gavin - who is also her coach and manager. After she gave birth to Emily last September, Jo said she gradually returned to training but wasn't sure if she would be able to return to form in time to qualify for this summer's European Champs and Commonwealth Games. Team effort: Jo said she couldn't have won the gold without the support of husband Gavin, right, who helps her juggle training with being a mother to their children Jacob and Emily . She said: 'When I was pregnant I carried on jogging but I didn't do any hard running and I wore a heart rate monitor at all times. After I had Emily I took my time getting back into training as I just wanted to enjoy having a newborn. I carried on breastfeeding until April so in the early stages I just fit in what training I could around her. 'When I got back into track sessions earlier this year my times were nowhere near what I needed to achieve so I thought it would be unrealistic for me to try and make the GB team this summer. The trial for the European 10k was in May and I really felt up against it. But I just kept working away and I qualified.' She qualified in style, beating athletes half her years and proving age and motherhood is no barrier to sporting success. As well as going on to win the European title over 10k - making her the oldest champion in the event's 80-year history - she also took a bronze at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games over 5k, roared on by the British crowd. Go Mummy! Emily watches as Jo trains on the track (babysat by Gavin behind the camera here) Jo said she hopes her success inspires other people not to give up on their dreams. 'I think because I'm still able to enjoy it, I am still able to run well,' she explained. 'I think some people retire too early from sport. I've been pleasantly surprised in training at what I can still achieve and haven't noticed a reduction in speed. I can still be competitive. So I say to other people get out there and enjoy it, you're not over the hill yet!' She certainly doesn't have any plans for retirement herself just yet. Other races this year will include taking part in the IAAF Continental Cup in Morocco in September and doing a half marathon in the Autumn. Battling to bronze at the Commonwealth Games: Jo thinks being a mother has improved her endurance . She said she would love to do another marathon in the future with the aim of lowering her 2 hour 28 minute Personal Best time set in 2011. The Rio Olympics in 2016 remains 'a realistic possibility' but she'll decide nearer the time whether to target the 5k, 10k or marathon distance. As a mother-of-two, Jo said fitting in her 100-mile-a-week training requires being flexible and she and Gavin always ensure their children's needs come first. She said: 'I'm lucky that I have a supportive husband and it's very much a team effort. Gavin is also my coach and manager and he looks after the children while I'm training. 'Sometimes I will train on my own or on other days they will all come with me to the track or the forest. 'We fit the training in around the kids' needs because being a mum is my priority.' Jo added that she thinks being a mother is one of the secrets to her recent success. 'I think it has done me good because now I don't stress about training like I did when I was younger. All I did then was eat, sleep, train,' she said. 'Now I don't stress about my training, I train harder than ever but I don't worry if I'm not hitting my targets. 'I am so happy because I have two lovely children and a supportive husband. Being happy gives me a lot of motivation and being busy as a mum has given me more endurance in a lot of ways.' As well as training and racing, Jo is also currently working as an ambassador for the charity Dreams Come True, who fulfil the wishes of seriously and terminally ill children. Jo said: 'I am honoured to promote the charity and give advice to their runners who are doing races like the London Marathon to raise money for them. 'The charity is close to my heart being a mum. Given what the children are going through, it’s so important to find ways to make their lives better.'

"Underworld figure Carl Williams would not have been lying when he implicated a former Victorian detective and a hit man in the murder of a police informer, his ex-wife Roberta says. Terence Hodson and his wife Christine were found shot dead at their Kew home, east of Melbourne, in May 2004, shortly before Mr Hodson was due to give evidence in a criminal trial against drug squad detective Paul Dale. Mr Dale and contract killer Rodney Charles Collins were charged with the Hodsons' murders in 2009, but the charges were dropped in 2010 when Williams was killed in prison. Scroll down for video . Carl Williams' ex-wife Roberta fronted Victorian Coroners Court on Wednesday for the inquest into police informant Terence Hodson and his wife Christine's deaths in 2004 . Ms Williams told an inquest on Wednesday into the couple's deaths that before he died, Carl had told her he was going to implicate Mr Dale in 'murder matters'. Ms Williams denied making quotes attributed to her in The Australian newspaper that suggested her husband had lied about Mr Dale's involvement to reduce his prison sentence. She said she never thought he would make things up. 'I don't believe that Carl would sit there and tell lies,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court. During a heated exchange with Mr Dale's barrister Geoff Steward, Ms Williams said her former husband's crimes did not make him a bad person. Detective Paul Dale and contract killer Rodney Charles Collins were charged with the Hodsons' murders in 2009, but the charges were dropped in 2010 when Carl Williams (pictured left) was killed in prison . 'Carl was a loving, caring, family man that adored my three children,' she said. A witness, who cannot be named, told the inquest that Williams told him that he had organised for Mr Hodson to be killed. 'He (Williams) said ""I ordered the hit for Paul Dale"",' the witness told the inquest. Both Mr Dale and Collins deny any involvement in the Hodsons' deaths. The witness said Williams had paid Mr Dale, who was then a drug squad detective, for information on police investigations. Mr Dale (pictured), who was a former Victorian drug squad detective, and Collins denied any involvement in the Hodsons' deaths . He said Williams was too 'shy' to find a second police source. 'Carl wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. He only had one source,' the witness said. The inquest was told that Williams once tried to source a rocket launcher so he could kill Jason Moran and blow up his house. Moran was gunned down in front of children at a football clinic in 2003 during Melbourne's gangland war. The inquest, before State Coroner Judge Ian Gray, continues.

"Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and threatened to shut down the Taj Mahal Casino Resort, which would make it the fifth Atlantic City casino to close this year. The company owns Trump Plaza, which is closing in a week, and the Taj Mahal, which has been experiencing cash-flow problems and had been trying to stave off a default with its lenders. The company said the Taj Mahal could close November 13 if it doesn't win salary concessions from union workers. The Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, in Atlantic City N.J. (pictured in 2013) Trump Entertainment Resorts today filed for protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware saying it has liabilities of more than $100 million . It's the fourth such filing for the struggling casino company or its corporate predecessors. The company filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, saying it has liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, and assets of no more than $50,000. It missed its quarterly tax payment due last month, and says it doesn't have the cash to make an interest payment to lenders due at the end of the month. It also says both its Internet gambling partners have taken steps to end their contracts with Trump Entertainment. It said cost-cutting negotiations with the main casino workers' union have stalled and the company is preparing notices warning employees the Taj Mahal may close. Donald Trump owns a 9 per cent stake in the firm, but neither controls it nor has any involvement in it. Donald Trump (pictured at Joan Rivers funeral last week) has no involvement in the company and is suing the firm to remove his name . He is suing the company to remove his name from the properties, which he says have fallen into disrepair and do not meet agreed-upon standards of quality and luxury. If the company makes good on its threat to close the Taj Mahal, it would further rock an already shell-shocked casino market in what just a few years ago was the nation's second-largest gambling market after Nevada. Now, New Jersey has fallen behind Pennsylvania. Three other Atlantic City casinos closed this year, as the industry struggles with competition in nearby states. Atlantic City began the year with 12 casinos, but could end it with seven. So far this year, the Atlantic Club, Showboat and Revel have gone out of business, and Trump Plaza closes next Tuesday. Trump Entertainment has struggled since the day it emerged from its last bankruptcy in 2010, having filed the year before. It came out of bankruptcy with $350 million in debt, and currently has more than $285 million in debt. As of the end of July, the company employed 2,800 people. The company has been trying to reduce expenses and debt, including selling its former Trump Marina casino for $38 million to Landry's Inc., which now runs it as the Golden Nugget Atlantic City. It also sold the Steel Pier for $4.5 million; a warehouse for $1.9 million, and its former corporate offices in a converted firehouse for $3.1 million. That building now houses the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. It has been trying for years to sell Trump Plaza. A deal to sell it to a California firm for $20 million last year fell through. The company also said it has been in negotiations with Local 54 of the Unite-HERE union on cost-cutting measures it says it needs to survive, but that the union has rejected them. Bob McDevitt, union president, said Trump Entertainment wanted union members to surrender their health insurance and pension plans. McDevitt said that even if the union agreed to those concessions, they would only total $11 million per year, which would hardly make a difference in the company's finances. 'If our members were to work for minimum wage with no benefits, it wouldn't be enough to keep this property in the hands of its current owners for a year,' he said. The concessions would be on top of a separate $4 million round of union concessions the company won in 2011. If the Taj Mahal closes, Trump Entertainment would have no remaining properties and would presumably go out of business.","The group said the Taj could close on November 13 - making it the fifth Atlantic City casino this year to close its doors .

"Arrested: Brad Davis, a former Marine, has been accused of suffocating his stepfather by giving him an 'atomic wedgie' with the victim's own underwear on December 21 . A former Marine allegedly suffocated his 58-year-old stepfather by giving him an 'atomic wedgie'. Police found Denver Lee St. Clair dead in his McLoud, Oklahoma home with the waistband of his . underpants pulled over his head on December 21. The man's stepson, 33-year-old Brad Davis, allegedly told police he pulled out the schoolyard bullying move after his stepfather 'jumped him' during a night of drinking. 'I'd never seen this before, but when we first looked at our victim seeing the waistband of his underwear was around his neck,' Pottawatomie County Sheriff Mike Booth told NewsOK. Davis told detectives the altercation began when St. Clair badmouthed his ex-wife Tressia St. Clair - Davis' mother. The men began to fight before St. Clair allegedly tried to punch Davis. Father and son brawled before Davis allegedly pulled the elastic band of his victim's underwear over his head from behind, killing him. Davis said he acted in 'self-defense'. However the man's death has been ruled a homicide, with the State Medical Examiner's office finding St. Clair died of suffocation and blunt force trauma to the head. Police believe Davis altered the crime scene to make it look like the men had had a fight before he called 911. 'We . continued our investigation and uncovered evidence that led us to . believe that this was more than just a fight,' Sheriff Mike Booth said. Victim: Denver Lee St. Clair, 58, was found dead in his Oklahoma home on December 21 with his underpants pulled over his head . The District Attorney is now handling the case and Davis will likely face a murder charge. Breitbart TV reported St. Clair was under a permanent . protective order filed in 2008 by his wife Tressia St. Clair. The woman claimed she found her husband embracing, in a 'sexual way', a drinking buddy and that he later grabbed her by the neck and threw her through a bathroom door, NewsOK reports. Pottawatomie County court records show his wife filed for a . divorce against him in 2010 but the divorce was dismissed. Denver St. Clair then filed for a divorce against her last year. A Facebook page was set up after St. Clair's death last year to remember the motorcyle-lover. His funeral was held on December 28. 'He was one of a kind a man, he will be missed dearly,' his daughter Carol St. Clair wrote. 'Uncle Denver would be proud of all motorcycles riding in his honor. Thank you to each and everyone who rode in his honor and helped with memorial service,' his niece Tonya Renee Lester Dawson wrote.

Sorted: Even Ryanair couldn't quibble with this tiny but thoroughly stylish case of clothes . Anything above that may have to be checked in on busier flights, leading to long waits by the baggage carousel at the other end. So is it really possible to pack for a week’s short-haul sunshine trip inside those tight parameters? Yes, if you choose every item carefully and use some nifty packing tricks. Luckily, we have done the hard work for you and here is our no-nonsense guide to travelling light. COVER-UPS . There is no better way to switch from beach to restaurant than an elegant kaftan (£12, clothingattesco.com). Pick a material that dries quickly and won’t crease too much so it can be folded small and slotted into your case. You can easily throw this on over a bikini, but it also doubles up for evening when teamed with trousers and a necklace. The only other top you need is a silk shirt — the one luxury piece to give any outfit a glamorous edge. Florence and Fred kaftan,£12, clothingattesco.com . Silk shirt, £220, Equipment at trilogystores.co.uk . Choose a bright shade like this pink to give a real pop of colour (£220, Equipment at trilogystores.co.uk). You can button it up, tuck it in, wear it over your swimwear, knot it over a maxi dress — the possibilities are endless. This is the toughest item to pack, so fold gently and put in your case last to avoid creasing. LINGERIE . A lingerie pouch or drawstring bag (Lingerie Bag, £15, phoebecarlyle.com) is a brilliant idea for space and practicality. You can pack all your underwear flat inside it, which keeps it together in one place. This is especially handy if your bag gets searched at the airport, as it avoids your undies being on display to security and nosy passers-by. TOILETRIESA see-through plastic toiletries case (Travel Toiletry Set, £22, greenandspring.com) will make your life, and your packing, so much easier. These cases aren’t as bulky as some, plus they can be whipped out to go through airport scanners without having to dig around in your case and disrupt your neatly-packed clothes. As for the toiletries themselves, either pick travel-size items or decant your favourite creams and cleansers into mini containers. White trousers, £29, Mango at johnlewis.com . Nautical shorts, £39, toast.co.uk . TROUSERS AND SHORTS . You need just one pair of trousers and one pair of shorts to complete your wardrobe — and ideally you should choose neutral tones to allow you to play with colour on the top half and avoid clashes. We’ve opted for this simple pair of smart white trousers (£29, johnlewis.com), which are easy to dress up or down and can be neatly folded and slotted on top of the dresses. These lightweight nautical shorts (£39, toast.co.uk) are a great staple as they can be teamed with swimwear or a shirt and they fold up into a tiny square to be stacked into the case. DRESSES . Forget skirts and tops — three multi-tasking dresses are far more space-efficient. Choose a casual day dress, a comfortable but stylish maxi and a glamorous evening dress for that special dinner out. Pick your materials wisely: chiffon and jersey are great, as they fold away to very little and tend not to crease. We’ve opted for: a white and navy-striped Breton jersey dress (£35, oasis-stores.com) perfect for day-trips and sightseeing; an aubergine jersey maxi dress (£220, heidiklein.com), which can be worn casually or dressed up with a necklace and wedges; and a wow-factor red chiffon dress (£145, coast-stores.com). Roll the jersey dresses into tubes to slot into spaces in your bag and lay the chiffon dress along the bottom of the case — the floaty fabric takes up little depth. Breton dress, £35, oasis-stores.com . Chiffon dress, £145, coast-stores.com . Aubergine maxi, £220, heidiklein.com . Thong sandals, £85, russellandbromley.co.uk . Raffia wedges, £60, office.co.uk . SHOES . If you are tight for space, make do with two pairs of shoes for your trip — flat sandals and wedges. Flats like these thong sandals (£85, russellandbromley.co.uk) are easy to pack by lying them sole to sole and slotting them down the side of your  case. Choose a slightly dressier style, rather than flip-flops, to take you from beach to bar. Although they will be your bulkiest item, a pair of raffia wedges (£60, office.co.uk) is more versatile than standard high heels. Use up the space inside by stuffing them with your swimwear. SWIMWEAR . Two bikinis and a one-piece swimming costume is plenty for a week away. If you choose a sleek bandeau swimsuit, like this white one (£199, Melissa Odabash at Fenwick), it can double up as a top to go under your shirt. Ideally, choose notably different styles of bikini. We went for a purple triangle (top, £100, bottoms, £85, olgaolsson.com) and a navy nautical style (top, £19.50, bottoms, £16, marksandspencer.com), which will look more varied and interesting on the beach. Try to be creative with the way you pack your swimwear. A triangle bikini, for example, can be folded in half and then tied in a tiny package with the strings, to then be pushed inside your wedges.

Statement necklace, £31, reiss.com . ACCESSORIES . To keep to your limit, you only really need two accessories: sunglasses and a statement necklace. Sunglasses (£9.99, zara.com) are a style staple and essential to protect your eyes — but they can be easily breakable so put them in the middle of your case to protect them. A statement necklace (£31, reiss.com) really updates your outfit for the evening, if you throw it on with your maxi dress or your kaftan. If it’s delicate or  valuable, pop it into your underwear pouch to keep it safe. And finally: To broaden your choices even more, choose a travelling outfit to mix and match with the rest of your capsule wardrobe and wear your bulkiest items to go in.","Easyjet's hand luggage limits are now a tiny 50cm x 40cm x 20cm .

"Three men involved in a deadly terrorist attack on the Presidential Palace in Mogadishu have been executed by a firing squad. The men, all members of al-Qaeda linked al-Shabab, had been found guilty of killing civilians and masterminding the July attack, and were sentenced to death by a Somali military court. Pictures show the three men tied to poles shortly before they were executed by a firing squad in Mogadishu today. Scroll down for video . Punishment: Three men found guilty of involvement in an Al-Shabab attack on the Somali Presidential Palace are tied to poles ahead of their execution by firing squad in Mogadishu . The attack on July 5 saw al-Shabab insurgents attack the presidential palace with guns and bombs while President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was away. The militants entered the presidential palace by placing a car bomb near the entrance to the compound, after which the militants attacked from two directions, officials said at the time. A spokesman from al-Shabab said 14 government soldiers were killed, while a security official later added that nine attackers involved in the raid had been taken out. The images of the execution emerge as a roadside bomb detonated in a busy market in the Somali capital, killing three women, and wounding seven others. Execution: The men were sentenced to death as part of a series of executions of members of the Al-Qaeda linked militant group, as the Somali government cracks down on Al-Shabab . Possible retaliation: At least three women were killed and seven others wounded when a bomb hidden in a rubbish pit exploded in the Somali capital while they were cleaning the streets . Family and friends gather outside Medina Hospital to check on loved ones following the bomb blast in Mogadishu . It was not immediately clear who was behind the bombing, but it is possible it was a retaliation for the execution of the three al-Shabab fighters. The women killed in the blast were city workers, who were cleaning the streets when a bomb hidden in a rubbish pit exploded in the busy market sector known as Hodan district of Mogadishu, police said. ‘We heard a big blast, and then I could see the old mothers who were cleaning the scene lying, some of them dead and others screaming. 'The bomb was wrapped in a big, black plastic bag and then placed inside the rubbish along the Taleh street,’ Nuria Ahmed, a mother of four who lives near the scene, said. Nurses wheel a victim in to Medina Hospital following a  the explosion near a busy Mogadishu market . Terror attack: A wounded Somali woman rests after being treated at Medina Hospital on Sunday afternoon . ‘I counted three dead and seven others injured. I was the first person who arrived for help. It is very unfortunate if mothers are the target.’ ‘A remotely controlled roadside bomb killed three female city cleaners and injured seven others in Hodan district. The militants hid the bomb inside a rubbish pit,’ Major Ali Afrah, a police officer said. African Union forces along with the Somali army launched a new offensive this year against al-Shabab, which is fighting to impose a harsh version of Islamic law on Somalia. Several towns have been taken back from the group, but officials say the Islamists still control large sections of countryside and some settlements, from where they have been able to continue their guerrilla-style campaign. The militants have also staged attacks outside Somalia, including one at a Kenyan shopping mall in September that killed at least 67 people.","Three al-Shabab members executed by firing squad in Mogadishu .

"CNN has hit back at two EMTs who sued the company after star-reporter Arwa Damon became 'seriously intoxicated' and bit them in Baghdad, Iraq in July. Instead of settling with Tracy Lamar and Charles Simons, the news network's lawyers hit back with a move to dismiss the case from New York Supreme Court claiming the two paramedics are money-grabbers out to ruin the reputation of CNN and a respected journalist. The two men were allegedly injured when the 36-year-old  Beirut-based correspondent got belligerent. CNN is trying to dismiss a lawsuit filed by two paramedics who were apparently bitten by correspondent Arwa Damon in July, after she became 'seriously intoxicated' The medics were called to calm the correspondent after she became 'totally out of control,' reports the New York Daily News. She allegedly tried to deter them by attempting a 'don't you know who I am?' tactic, telling them she was a 'major reporter for CNN,' but when this failed she became physically violent. 'She was biting them both pretty furiously. She has good teeth. Eventually they subdued her,' David Jaroslawicz, an attorney for Simons and Lamar, told the Daily News. The suit claims she bit both Lamar and Simons on their left arms. Simons says his knees and elbows were also injured, and Lamar says she sustained bruising in the attack. The suit claims that CNN was aware Damon had a history of drunken aggression, and was even known to be violent when sober, reports TMZ. CNN says the paramedics are just trying to embarrass the journalist and get a million-dollar payout . Lamar and Simons are suing CNN for $1 million each. The network's lawyers recently filed the motion, pointing out that Lamar and Simons sued the wrong company and  in the wrong jurisdiction. They claim that Damon is actually an employee of subsidiary Cable News International, Inc., which is located in Atlanta, Georgia and Delaware - not New York. The paramedics were also criticized for their 'casual disregard' to the medical privacy of their patient, and in leaving out the fact that Damon was so injured after hitting her head that she lost consciousness and began bleeding. 'They also omit that Damon’s head injury was significant enough that U.S. Embassy personnel required her to be transported by helicopter to have a CT scan,' the dismissal reads. Arwa Damon is a Beirut-based correspondent who won an Emmy for Outstanding live Coverage of a Current News Story . CNN's lawyers finally ask for the case to be dismissed since Lamar and Simons' 'plan is evident: omit material information from their Complaint, name the wrong parties in the wrong jurisdiction, try to embarrass a widely-honored journalist and claim that they are each entitled to a million-dollar payday because of an alleged bite they sustained while treating a reporter in a war zone who had a serious head injury. 'This is apparently done in the hopes that CNN America and CNN Productions settle for a large sum instead of litigating.' Damon's biography on CNN states that she's an award-winning journalist whose recent focus has been on the situation in Syria. She won an Emmy for Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story for her reporting on the Arab Spring, as well as a Peabody Award. Recently, she was given the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation. She is from Boston but spent much of her childhood in Morocco and Turkey.","Two paramedics working for a contractor in Iraq claim reporter Arwa Damon bit them in July after becoming belligerently drunk .

"Australia Post confirmed it will axe 900 senior management and administrative staff over the next year. Managerial, administrative and support staff will bear the brunt of redundancies with most of the job losses to come from the postal service's head office in Melbourne. Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour on Tuesday said the cuts, while regrettable, were necessary for the postal service to remain sustainable with fewer letters and more parcels being delivered. Scroll down for video . Major losses: Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour announced on Tuesday that 900 jobs will be cut within the week . The savings from the job cuts will be less than the cost of its new services which include extended trading hours and Saturday deliveries. 'By making these changes now, we can minimise the impact for our people, our broader workforce, our business and the community,' Mr Fahour said in a statement on Tuesday. The company is still working out job cuts in other states but says it will be 'small'. Retail workers and posties will not be affected. It plans to merge its retail and delivery businesses under the Australia Post brand while its parcel and express services businesses will fall under the StarTrack banner. Unions were told of the job cuts concurrently with staff on Tuesday. The majority of the cuts announced will be from Melbourne, however redundancies across the country are expected to be announced shortly . The Communications Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU) called on the company to come clean about its long-term plans. It wants Australia Post to give workers the opportunity to retrain or be redeployed to other divisions. 'It is a time of great uncertainty for workers, with job losses set to hit families and their budgets hard,' CEPU NSW state secretary Jim Metcher said in a statement. Australia Post's failing letter delivery service has been flagged as one of the main reasons for the enormous cuts. 'Australia Post has made it very clear that it is confronting dramatic change due to the impact of declining revenues in our letters service,' an Australia Post spokeswoman told MailOnline. 'Our Managing Director and CEO Ahmed Fahour has publicly stated that the losses in letters business have already overwhelmed the profits in parcels and without reform, the letters services will lose over $1 billion annually in a few years.' Posties and retail workers will not be affected by the cuts: without reform, the letters services will lose over $1 billion annually in a few years . The spokeswoman added: 'Australia Post is already responding and is a much leaner organisation than it was three years ago. 'Part of the modernisation of Australia Post involves shifting resources and investing in areas in response to customer needs, such as recent announcements around the extension of Express Post services and parcel delivery to Saturdays and extended weekend trading hours.' The news that the service will axe 900 jobs in the next few days, is in bitter contrast to Mr Fahour's current pay packet. Despite working for a public utility, he was paid a whopping $4.8 million in 2013. His earnings were higher than the bosses of some of Australia's biggest companies, including Woolworths, Woodside Petroleum, David Jones and JB Hi-Fi.

"A ramshackle garage next to a south London industrial estate has become the most expensive ever to sell in Britain after going under the hammer for £550,000 in a 'frenzied' bidding war. The brick-built former coach house, used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark’s car, sold at auction for almost triple the guide price and £150,000 more than the average house in Camberwell. The price paid for the 'empty shell' of a building by an anonymous buyer beat the previous record, held by a garage near Harrods in Knightsbridge, west London, by £25,000. A ramshackle garage next to a south London industrial estate has become the most expensive ever to sell in Britain after going under the hammer for £550,000 in a 'frenzied' bidding war . The brick-built former coach house, used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold at auction for almost triple the guide price . The coach house is next to Vanguard Court, a thriving hub of 40 small workshops and studios off Peckham Road, whose tenants have included ceramicist Edmund de Waal and Turner Prize short-listed sculptor Cathy de Monchaux. The 568sq ft double height brick building, which has vaulted ceilings, a roller steel door and a cobbled drive, was given an estimate of £200,000 by auctioneers Andrew Scott Robertson. Associate director and auctioneer Jeremy Lamb, who supervised the sale, said he was 'surprised' the building, which was previously owned by Southwark Council, had fetched so much. He said: 'It’s an empty shell of a building. The coach house is next to Vanguard Court, a thriving hub of 40 small workshops and studios off Peckham Road, whose tenants have included ceramicist Edmund de Waal and Turner Prize short-listed sculptor Cathy de Monchaux . The 568sq ft double height brick building, which has vaulted ceilings, a roller steel door and a cobbled drive, was given an estimate of £200,000 by auctioneers Andrew Scott Robertson . 'It’s in a reasonable state, but there are quite a few cracks in the walls. 'We had about six or seven bidders at the auction - a mixture of residential developers, investors, potential occupiers and artists. However, the number of bidders quickly dropped as the price went up.' Mr Lamb put down the high price to London’s housing crisis - with demand for properties far outstripping supply. He said: 'Free-hold properties of this type are very scarce, and there is a high demand for properties like this in the area. The marker 'A' shows where the garage is situated in south London's Camberwell . A view from the road which shows the entrance to the garage in south London . 'A terraced house here sells for between £500,000 and £600,000 and the coach house, subject to planning permission, would make a good home.' He added any buyer wishing to turn it into a house, could expect to invest £100,000 in it. More than 200 artists and small business owners working in the court signed a petition opposing Southwark Council’s sale of the building on the grounds any new owners would object to the noise created by the 'busy and thriving' light industrial estate. The buyer is anonymous but there have been rumours it has been bought by one of the artists in order to save the studios. The coach house sold for £150,000 more than the average house in Camberwell, pictured (file photo) Mr Lamb added: 'The coach house would make an ideal artist’s studio and I’ve heard rumours it has been bought by a wealthy artist to save it from being turned into housing, though I haven’t a clue if that is true.' Cllr Richard Livingstone, Southwark’s Cabinet Member for Finance and Resources, added: 'Like most councils, Southwark has experienced big cuts to our budgets in recent years, and we need to ensure we are making the most of all viable opportunities available to us to generate income. 'We are therefore delighted to have sold this garage for such a good price, having already made savings from no longer running the Mayoral car it housed. 'The proceeds will help the council to invest in our capital programme which pays for improvements to libraries, parks and facilities for older people, for example, allowing us to continue delivering excellent services for all our residents.' The Camberwell garage is not the only London lock-ups with a hefty asking price. Many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential. In 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping £1.25million asking price. But the new owner could rest assured that they would own property in the same trendy area as Kate Moss. In 2012 a 6-metre long garage went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's richest people. In October 2013 a double garage sold in Highgate sold for a cool £251,000. For the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages, and there is an option of connecting to water on-site. And in August 2013 a 224sqft Highgate lock-up, which had been converted into a studio flat went on the market for £250,000.","Brick-built former coach house sold for almost triple the guide price .

"An Australian man is facing up to six years in jail over a motorbike crash that killed an Indonesian woman in Java. Jake Drage, 23, has been West Java police custody since the collision happened on June 30. Police on Friday said they had finished investigations and the former personal trainer would likely be charged with 'reckless' driving causing death. If found guilty, Mr Drage faces a maximum six years in jail and/or a maximum fine of $1102. Jake Drage, from Western Australia, could face up to six years jail if he is charged with 'reckless' driving causing death . The West Australian man was on a surfing holiday when his motorbike clipped another one. According to his mother Tiena Drage, who has joined her son in Indonesia, the second bike was ridden by a teenage girl. The crash injured her mother, who was riding on the back, and died the next day in hospital. Police have confirmed they received a letter from the victim's family, saying they did not blame Mr Drage for the crash, which will be admitted as evidence at his trial and considered by the court. In a statement released earlier this week, Mr Drage extended his sympathies to the family involved. 'The accident leaves me with a sadness that is very difficult to describe and I want to thank her family for all the kindness and goodwill they have shown me,' he said. Drage had been receiving assistance from consular officials, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed earlier this month. Local police have confirmed the victim's family do not blame Drage for the mother's death . Last week, The West Australian reported that Mr Drage pleaded his innocence on his Facebook page, claiming he is being held in jail near small West Java town Cimaja against the wishes of the family of the deceased. 'The police are holding me. I was awoken in a room, forced to sign some papers and was taken to another room. Something really dodgy is going on,' he said. Mr Drage, from Geraldton - north of Perth, also wrote he was not driving dangerously nor was he intoxicated. Last Thursday, his mother Tiena Drage posted on Facebook that the Australian Embassy had said her son had not been formally charged or arrested. 'They are just ""keeping"" him for now,' she wrote. 'The embassy staff will visit him tomorrow mainly to see how he is being treated and his well being. 'Will know more then.' Drage could also face a $1102 fine if he is found guilty of causing the mother's death . Ms Drage has told local news website Everything Geraldton about the events before her son's accident last Monday. She said he was facing uphill behind a small truck when he tried to see if it was safe to pass. 'All of a sudden a motorbike with two people on it was there and clipped Jake's bike. 'The bike was being driven by a 16-year-old girl, and her mother was on the back not wearing a helmet.' The woman died on July 1 in hospital. An online appeal has been launched to raise $5,000 to help bring Mr Drage back home. 'Our fun and kind-hearted Jake had been living his dream when a few days ago it all came crashing down,' friend Melissa Dowling wrote. 'We would like everyone to dig deep to help Jake. 'Please note that the family of the deceased have also tried to help Jake. They know he is not to blame.'

"Lorraine Bayless, an 87-year-old woman who was being cared for at the Glenwood Gardens retirement facility died after a nurse at the facility refused to perform CPR on her . The family of an 87-year-old woman who died in a California retirement facility after being denied CPR - have said she would not have wanted to be revived. Lorraine Bayless, collapsed in the dining room of the Glenwood Gardens independent senior living complex in Bakersfield on Tuesday. The firm whose staff member refused to administer the CPR said the person involved - who is not a nurse - had wrongly interpreted its policy. But Ms Bayless's family have now revealed she would not have wanted life-prolonging aid, CBS News reports. The family released a statement to the Associated Press absolving the staff member involved of blame.The move came shortly after the company involved issued its own statement saying the staff member's actions was the result of a misunderstanding of the company's emergency medical practices. Ms Bayless is reported to have had no Do Not Resuscitate form on file, and it is against the policy of the retirement home to give CPR to residents of the independent living complex. Following her collapse, a staffer who identified herself as a nurse quickly called 911 from her cell phone, but refused to administer CPR, citing it was against company policy. Ms Bayless was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 'Is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die,' dispatcher Tracey Halvorson asked on a dramatic seven-minute 911 tape released by the Bakersfield Fire Department. 'Not at this time,' said the woman, who didn't give her full name and said facility policy prevented her from giving the woman medical help. Christopher Finn, a spokesman for Brookdale Senior Living, which owns the Glenwood Gardens facility, told the Los Angeles Times that the unnamed caller was 'serving in the capacity of a resident services director, not as a nurse.' Finn would not say if the director was licensed as a nurse. It was later revealed that Ms Bayless . had no Do Not Resuscitate form on file.

Jeffrey Toomer, said in a statement: ‘In the event of a health emergency . at this independent living community, our practice is to immediately . call emergency medical personnel for assistance and wait with the . individual needing attention until such personnel arrives. ‘This is the protocol we followed,’ he said, adding that there would be an internal review of the incident.' Unlike . nursing homes, independent living facilities like the one where Ms . Bayless had lived resemble senior apartment complexes and generally do . not provide medical care. According to Toomer, all potential residents . are informed about and agree to the facility's policy regarding CPR . before they move in. At the beginning of the Tuesday . morning call, the woman asked for paramedics to come and help the 87-year-old who had collapsed in the home's dining room and was barely breathing. Ms Halvorson . pleaded for the caller to perform CPR, and after several refusals she . started asking her to find a resident, or a gardener, or anyone not . employed by the home to get on the phone, take her instructions and . help the woman. NBC affiliate KGET reported that Ms Bayless, a resident of Glenwood Gardens’ independent living facility, collapsed in the dining room on Tuesday morning. Policy: The director for Glenwood Gardens said the woman had signed a DNR form, and that it was against policy to administer CPR in independent living facilities . The staffer previously believed to be . a nurse, who identified herself as Colleen, called 911 and was patched . to the Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher. The dispatcher begged for her to give the woman CPR. Ms . Halvorson even requested the nurse to pass the phone to anyone else in . the room – another senior citizen, or a gardener. The woman refused, . saying: ‘I can’t do that.’ Obviously frustrated, the dispatcher . said: ‘I don’t understand why you’re not willing to help this patient… I . understand if your boss is telling you, you can’t do it. ‘But…as a human being… you know…is there anybody that’s willing to help . this lady and not let her die,’ Ms Halvorson asked. By the time EMT workers arrived on the scene about seven minutes after the 911 call was placed, Ms Bayless had no pulse and was not breathing. She was taken to Mercy Southwest Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her daughter, who is a nurse, later told KGET that she was satisfied with the retirement home’s handling of the incident. First responders said that CPR often does not work on elderly patients, and even if they do survive, many end up suffering from severe health complications. Sgt. Jason Matson, of the Bakersfield Police Department, told Fox News that an investigation into the incident so far had not revealed criminal wrongdoing, but the probe is continuing. Reports of the tragedy have sparked outrage among advocates for the elderly, prompting calls for legislation to prevent this from happening in the future. Assemblywoman Mariko Yamada, chair of the California Assembly Aging and Long-term Care Committee, called Bayless' death a 'wake-up call.'","Lorraine Bayless, 87, collapsed in dining room of retirement facility .

"A volunteer fire service worker has been sacked for tarnishing the fire service's reputation by posing for provocative photographs in her uniform.

However, Miss Deloughrey, who . distributes advice and fits smoke alarms, fell foul of bosses and she . was sacked for potentially harming the service's 'brand'. The mother-of-one, from Prestwich, Greater Manchester, accused fire chiefs of 'overreacting' and being sexist, claiming male firefighters who had posed for . raunchy pictures had not been sacked. Volunteer: Clare Deloughrey worked as a volunteer fitting smoke alarms and distributing safety advice . She said: 'I think they were very unprofessional in the way they acted. 'They could simply have asked me about this and I would have taken the pictures down no question. 'Instead they chose to sack me without any notice or warnings.' Ms Deloughrey also works as a self-employed function planner. A fire service spokesman said: 'What staff do in their private lives is a matter for them. 'However when they do so using our brand they are representing our organisation. 'It would not matter if they are male of female, paid or unpaid, we would not want our brand used in any commercial venture without our permission.' Her dismissal follows the sacking of fellow volunteer Danny Harper, 22, who stole a brigade car and took it to Tatton Park where he carried out a bogus inspection in a historic hall. Union bosses urged brigade chiefs to review the volunteer recruitment policy in light of his case and repeated calls for volunteers to wear different uniforms to regular fire fighters. There are more than 400 volunteers currently serving with GMFRS. A spokesman for the Fire Brigade's Union said: 'Again this reinforces the need for a review into clothing given to volunteers. It needs to be different from operational firefighters. You have people pretending to be something they are not and that is dangerous.' Clare Deloughrey, 26, claims she was sacked without any notice or warnings over the provocative images .

"Burmese model May Myat Noe, 18, was crowned winner of Miss Asia Pacific in May but has been dethroned . A Burmese beauty queen has allegedly disappeared with a £120,000 jewelled tiara after being dethroned as Miss Asia Pacific World for 'being rude'. May Myat Noe, 18, was crowned as the most beautiful woman in south-east Asia in May by the South Korean pageant, but the organisers wanted her to have breast enhancement surgery before they could get her a record deal. David Kim, director of media for Miss Asia Pacific World, said Miss Noe had been a disappointment from the outset. Following her victory, the organisers and sponsors wanted the 5ft 7in pageant winner to change her looks so she could become a singer. Mr Kim said: 'We thought she should be more beautiful ... so as soon as she arrived we sent her to the hospital to operate on her breasts.' Adding that the competition's sponsors paid £6,000 for her breast enhancement, Mr Kim said: 'It's our responsibility. 'If she has no good nose, then maybe, if she likes, we can operate on her nose. If it's breasts, then breasts.' From there it went downhill. The pageant organisers say they paid for a 10-day trip for her and her mother to Seoul, South Korea, but that quickly turned into three months, incurring extra cost. She 'lied' and 'never had respect for the main organisation, the national director, the manager, media or fans who made her the winner,' organisers said in a statement. Miss Noe was given a flight back to Burmese capital Rangoon, but did not show up, with Malaysian news sites reporting that she got on an earlier plane. The pageant organisers are now demanding she hand back the jewel-encrusted Swarovski tiara - worth between £60,000 and £120,000. Mr Kim said: 'Everyone knows she is no longer the queen, but she thinks as long as she keeps this crown she's the winner. She's not.' Organisers bought her a £6,000 boob job to make her 'more beautiful' after she won the beauty pageant . Miss Noe's icture has been taken down off the competition's website and it says 'dethroned' next to her name . Her picture has been taken down off the competition's website and it says 'dethroned' next to her name. Miss Noe was unavailable for comment and her phone was switched off, local reports said, but it is believed she will hold a press conference soon. Hla Nu Tun, who initially acted as her unofficial manager, said Miss Noe and the organisers had disagreed over who should oversee her career. Miss Noe's mother wanted control but so did the organisers, she said. Burma, which only recently emerged from a half-century military rule and self-imposed isolation, started sending contestants to international beauty pageants for the first time in decades in 2012. British model Amy Willerton took part in Miss Asia Pacific in 2011, but left the competition early, labelling it 'a shambles'.

"It is a town which has struggled with its image for many years. Previous 'awards' for Luton include being voted the 'dirtiest town in Britain' and the 'worst place to live in the UK'. And if these pictures are anything to go by, it looks like the town is still struggling to shake off its poor reputation. Concerned with Luton's image, a local photographer,  who did not . want to be named, wandered the streets of the Bedfordshire town and took . this disturbing series of images. Feeding time: A group of rats pictured near Luton town centre in Bedforshire . Unattractive: Luton has previously been voted as one of the worst places to live in the UK . Destruction: Broken glass scattered on the ground after a car window was smashed following a break-in . Break-in: A car window after being broken into by thieves . With large groups of rats pictured . eating on discarded food, cars left with shattered windows following . break-ins by thieves and . litter left lying on the streets, it paints a grim picture of the town. But it seems his concerns about the town may well fall on deaf ears. Michael Garrett, the leader of the . Conservative group on Luton Borough Council, defended the town and said . it does not have a problem with street cleaning and refuse collection. 'Yes, the town has got problems but I cannot agree that it is a dirty mess,' he said. 'I cannot agree with that at all. What a mess: Bags of overflowing rubbish discarded in the Marsh Farm area of Luton . Wrong award: Luton was voted the dirtiest town in the UK in 2002 . 'The government has made local government cuts and Luton, as with other places, has had to cope with that. 'In . terms of street cleaning, I have not noticed that it has gone downhill. Parts of the town are run down but that is not really a fault of the . council. It is doing its best under difficult circumstances. 'I . would not say that refuse collection and street cleaning has suffered . in any way. With less staff they are still managing to keep the streets . tidy. For years Luton has suffered with this bad image but I do not . think it deserves it.' With all councils across the country . facing cuts in central government grants, the images reflect the . challenges faced by towns across Britain as they struggle not to slide . into neglect. The concerns about rubbish in Luton . follow the decision by the borough council to approve cuts to street . cleaning services last year. Luton is best known for its airport, football club and carnival - the largest of its kind in Europe. The town, which has a population of around 255,000, has long been proud of its football team, which currently plays in the Conference National division. Its history includes a number of spells in the top flight of English football. In 1988, Luton Town won the Football League cup. International links: Despite the concerns over rubbish, Luton has plenty going for it, including one of the largest airports in England . Bright: The Luton Carnival is the largest one-day carnival in Europe . One of the biggest employers in the town and a huge source of visitors is London Luton Airport, which opened in 1938 and is one of England's major airports. Also based in the town is the University of Bedfordshire, attracting students to the area. One of the most popular events of the year in the town is the Luton Carnival which is held on the final May bank holiday. It is the largest one-day carnival in Europe. Rich pickings: A pigeon feasting on food that has been thrown on the ground . Smashed: A disused factory that has been vandalised reflects how Luton is struggling to clean up its streets . The cutbacks, which the council said would save £262,000 a year, resulted in the loss of 12 jobs from the council's street cleaning team. The . cuts also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of streets with an . 'acceptable level of cleanliness', with a decline from 97 per cent to . 87.5 per cent. Cleaning was . not reduced in the town centre and other busy shopping areas, but the . response time of the graffiti removal service was increased to two days . from one, except in cases of racially-motivated or offensive graffiti. Speaking after the cuts decision last year, Lib Dem group leader David Franks criticised the decision. He said: 'The big issue is that they chopped £100,000 out of the budget last year and £34,000 the year before. 'They clearly believe that this is . not making any difference, but I’m getting people saying to me that . there is more litter, more fly posting. 'Are we going to go back to 2002 when Luton was voted the dirtiest town in Britain?' Staff expressed concerns that blood spillages and graffiti would not be cleaned up at weekends during a consultation on the cuts. Borough council spokesman Chris Hall today defended its record for cleaning. He said: 'We believe the recent demolition of a multi-storey car park disturbed some rats but there is no evidence to suggest the population is any greater in Luton than in other towns and cities across the country. 'The number of reports of rats and requests for treatment received by the council has actually fallen by around 30 per cent from 886 in 2008/9 to 618 in 2011/12. 'We put this down to proactive baiting, integrated pest management (treating an area rather than individual properties) and working with home owners and landlords to educate about pest proofing measures. 'It should be noted that the council’s standards of street cleansing have improved in each of the last seven years and last year 98 per cent of streets were rated good or satisfactory, placing our borough in the top ten per cent in the UK. 'We are also ranked in the top 30 per cent of councils nationwide for taking action against illegal fly-tipping, and the number of incidents has decreased steeply over the last two years - from 3,394 in 2011/12 to 2,134 so far this year. 'Luton council continues to provide an in-house pest control team that carries out proactive and covert baiting in areas that rats are attracted to in the town centre. 'We also provide a free service to home owners in the borough experiencing any public health pest problem which means they can get a rat problem dealt with at no expense to themselves and helps keep vermin levels to a minimum.' Decline: The cuts also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of streets with an 'acceptable level of cleanliness', with a decline from 97 per cent to 87.5 per cent . Councillors criticised the cutbacks, saying that they feared the standard of cleanliness will slip further .","Photographs taken in Bedfordshire town show it in state of chaos .

"A couple were forced to flee their council home a week after moving in after it became overrun by giant rats - some of which were 12 inches long. Jade Newborn and Chris Walley moved into the house in Stoke-on-Trent on August 12 after waiting months for a home. But within a week, the couple had found 11 vermin at the house, some of which were 12 inches long. Chris Walley and his partner have left the home after finding 11 rats in the council house in just one week . The couple say the move has been an 'absolute nightmare' and that they have been forced to flee . 'It's been an absolute nightmare,' said Mr Walley, 21. The self-employed builder caught 11 of the animals on his own after his partner moved out. 'My girlfriend’s moved out because she’s so scared of them. 'I’m worried they could kill my puppy, and I’ve lost hundreds of pounds in wages while I’ve tried to sort this out. 'I’ve had to completely strip the kitchen to try and find them, and when I did I found so many rat droppings and loads of holes where they’ve been getting around the house.' 'I’ve caught a lot of them, but most have only been babies.' 'It took a month for pest control to come out, and all they did was put two pots of poison down. 'Half of one of them went in one night, which shows how bad it is. Mr Walley, a self employed builder, has ripped apart the kitchen to find where the vermin are coming from . The 21-year-old claimed droppings and tiny holes in the walls made him think there were more than 11 . Miss Newborn said she has gone to stay with her mother as she is petrified of the creatures . Pest control visited the property when the couple complained but, they say, only left two pots of rat poison . 'At first we didn’t know what was going on around the house - we had some strange marks and thought it might have been a ghost. 'It’s just got worse since then, and I want it to stop.' Mr Waller has been returning to the house to try and solve the problem as his 'petrified' girlfriend stays at her mother's house. 'It's just horrific in there, I can't stand it,' said Miss Newborn, also 21. 'I’m absolutely petrified of rats, so I’ll stay with my mum until they’re gone. 'We’ve had all sorts of problems - we can’t use the cooker as rats were running all around it, so we’ve had to live off takeaways and use money we don’t have. 'I’m so scared of what could happen to Rex - rats are so dirty, one bite might kill him.' 'Petrified': The couple said they feared for their dog as rats are known to carry many diseases and could bite . The 21-year-olds say they waited months before being moved into the semi-detached house in Stoke-on-Trent . Councillor Joy Garner, the city council’s cabinet member for housing, neighbourhoods and community safety, said: 'Our environmental health team was alerted to the rat problem by Mr Walley on July 18, and a pest control officer went out on August 4 to investigate and deal with the problem. 'We contacted Mr Walley afterwards and he told us he was satisfied with the action we’d taken, but we’re going back next week for a routine follow-up check to make sure the problem has definitely been resolved. 'We take the welfare of all of our council tenants very seriously and we understand that discovering vermin in your home can be very upsetting.

"An Australian man could be detained by Indonesian police for two months without charge over a motorbike crash that killed a woman who was riding with her daughter on Monday. Jake Drage is in police custody while the accident is fully investigated, West Java police, in Bali's west, said on Friday. The Western Australian 23-year-old is being assisted by consular officials, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says. Jake Drage, from Western Australia, could be detained by Indonesian police for two months without charge over a motorbike crash that killed a woman who was riding with her daughter on Monday . Traffic officer Indra Darmaputra said the victim's family had produced a letter saying they didn't want the Australian charged. But that didn't close the investigation. 'A settlement letter can't abolish a crime, it's only a factor for leniency before the court,' he said. 'Operationally, we must work based on the law.' The officer was not authorised to discuss the possibility of bail. The 23-year-old is being assisted by consular officials, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says . The West Australian reported that Mr Drage pleaded his innocence on his Facebook page, claiming he is being held in jail near small West Java town Cimaja against the wishes of the family of the deceased. 'The police are holding me. I was awoken in a room, forced to sign some papers and was taken to another room. Something really dodgy is going on,' he said. Mr Drage, from Geraldton - north of Perth, also wrote that he wasn't driving dangerously nor was he intoxicated. Mr Drage's mother Tiena Drage posted on Facebook on Thursday that the Australian Embassy had said her son hadn't been formally charged or arrested. 'They are just ""keeping"" him for now,' she wrote. 'The embassy staff will visit him tomorrow mainly to see how he is being treated and his well being. 'Will know more then.' Traffic officer Indra Darmaputra said the victim's family had produced a letter saying they didn't want the Australian charged. But that didn't close the investigation . Ms Drage has told local news website Everything Geraldton about the events before her son's accident on Monday. She said he was facing uphill behind a small truck when he tried to see if it was safe to pass. 'All of a sudden a motorbike with two people on it was there and clipped Jake's bike. 'The bike was being driven by a 16-year-old girl, and her mother was on the back not wearing a helmet.' The woman died the next day in hospital. An online appeal was launched on Wednesday to raise $5000 to help bring Mr Drage back home. So far more than $1000 has been raised for Mr Drage. 'Our fun and kind-hearted Jake had been living his dream when a few days ago it all came crashing down,' friend Melissa Dowling wrote. 'We would like everyone to dig deep to help Jake. 'Please note that the family of the deceased have also tried to help Jake. They know he is not to blame.' His mother arrives in Indonesia on Saturday when she will begin speaking with lawyers.

"Amazon has drastically dropped the price of the Fire phone in the US from $199 to just 99 cents, when taken on a two-year AT&T contract . Compared to rivals Apple and Samsung, Amazon is a newbie in the smartphone market and it is making bold moves to try and attract customers. Amazon has drastically dropped the price of the device in the US from $199 to just 99 cents, when taken on a two-year contract. It has also dropped the price of an unlocked handset from $649 to $449. This has been seen as a radical move, and is believed to have been prompted by the poor sales of the device in the US. In August, Chitika advertising network revealed that the Amazon's Fire phone was achieving just 0.02 per cent of web share. The move comes ahead of the Fire phone launching in the UK at the end of this month, and Apple launching its iPhone 6 handset tonight. The two-year contract is available exclusively on an AT&T contract, and comes with a year’s Amazon Prime membership. This membership includes Prime Instant Video, Kindle Owners’ Lending Library and unlimited one-day shipping, for free. The announcement comes less than a week after the Seattle-based firm unveiled plans to bring its TV streaming box, Fire TV, to the UK for the first time as well. Amazon Fire comes with a unique screen that uses four cameras built into the front of the phone that track head movement. These cameras and movement sensors position images on the screen to create a 3D, holographic effect. Amazon calls it Dynamic Perspective and claim it is one of the reasons the Fire Phone can challenge rivals such as the iPhone. This 4.7-inch screen has a 720 x 1280 resolution, and a 315 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), compared to the iPhone 5S' 640 x 1136 resolution, and 326 PPI. The Fire phone's Firefly feature (pictured) lets users scan food, DVDs, music and games, and instantly link to the product on Amazon . The Amazon Fire phone also has a 13MP rear-facing camera, a 2.1 front-facing sensor, plus a minimum of 32GB of storage. Scroll down for video .

"Ultimo has unveiled a capsule collection of bras for fuller busts and has found the perfect person to help model them-founder Michelle Mone's daughter, Rebecca. Like mother, like daughter, the 22-year-old has showcased the new DD-G styles, designed to shape and empower the fuller busted woman. In a series of beautiful and sophisticated shots, Rebecca looks gorgeous showing off the new designs. Scroll down for video . Family business: Rebecca Mone, 22, pictured, makes her modelling debut by showcasing the new DD-G styles designed to shape and empower the fuller busted woman . Rebecca says: 'I've grown up on photoshoots and surrounded by models and lingerie, so it wasn't too far out of my comfort zone and was a really empowering experience. 'I have always struggled to find good fitting underwear that's not ugly and bulky. 'This new collection is so much better than anything I have ever seen on the market, and I'm really excited to be part of the launch campaign.' Modelling debut: Rebecca Mone is pictured showcasing the new designs that includes an everyday balcony bra and a sexy plunge bra . Developed over 18 months, the new collection features three super-sleek products, including an everyday balcony bra, a sexy plunge bra and a 'wear 5 ways' multi-way bra – all available in black, white and nude. Built for a perfect fit on the body, each Ultimo DD-G product is completely seam free with wings reinforced with power mesh for extreme support. Rebecca's mum Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, says, 'Of course, I had my doubts about involving Rebecca in a campaign given that she's my daughter, but she's a young woman now and has been so involved in the development of the new collection it made complete sense. A natural: Rebecca Mone (pictured) poses in the new Ultimo DD-G t-shirt bra which is completely seam free with wings reinforced with power mesh for extreme support . 'I think she showcases the product beautifully and I'm really proud of her.' Michelle added: 'The large-cup market is growing rapidly and, as one of the UK's biggest lingerie brands, we felt that it was high time we launched a range that catered for fuller busts.

The new Ultimo styles will be priced in line with Ultimo's A-D offering – at £27.00. Michelle explains: 'Fuller bust bras are legitimately more expensive to produce, but we took the decision to put our customers first and absorb the costs elsewhere in the business – and I'm thrilled. 'There will be no price differentiation, which is exactly how it should be.' Adding to the new core D-G products available in white, nude and black, Ultimo will unveil a range of fuller bust fashion styles in January 2015, as part of their Spring Summer 2015 collection.

"Lukas Podolski has hinted that he might leave Arsenal before his contract expires in 2016 because he was not playing enough. The German forward is finding Premier League opportunities difficult to come by under Arsene Wenger and could see his future elsewhere. 'I am a full blooded player, a street player and I love competition,' the 29-year-old told RTL television. Lukas Podolski (right) poses with summer signing Danny Welbeck after the latter scored a hat-trick . Podolski has had to deal with a bit-part Arsenal role of late, mainly warming the bench at the Emirates . 'If I don't have this competition every weekend then a change must occur.' Podolski, who has scored 47 goals for Germany in 118 internationals, joined the London club in 2012. He was not involved in the opening four matches of the season following Germany's successful World Cup in Brazil, and has been an unused substitute four times in Arsenal's last eight matches. He has come on for the last few minutes of the Premier League games against Leicester City and Aston Villa and the Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund and has only played an entire match once - Arsenal's 2-1 home defeat against Southampton in the Capital One Cup last week when he looked a peripheral figure. He did not feature in Arsenal's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday where again he was an unused substitute and has yet to find the net this season.

Podolski (centre) alongside Alexis Sanchez walk out for the warm-up at the Emirates on Wednesday . 'We will have to see. But it is certainly something one has to think about', he said when asked if he would see out his deal with the club for whom he has scored 28 goals in 73 appearances. As far as his career with Germany is concerned, Podolski said it was not the first time he was seeing little action at club level but kept his place in the squad. Podolski only made two appearances for Germany in Brazil -- playing for the last eight minutes against Portugal in their opening group match and the first half of their last group match against the United States, and was an unused substitute in the final when they beat Argentina. 'I have been with Germany a long time and have gone through phases where I did not play a lot at club level but was convincing with the national team. That is no problem,' he said despite no longer being a regular first team choice for his country.

"A Michigan man has been freed 16-years after he was convicted of the murder and rape of a 68-year-old woman. Jamie Lee Peterson, 39, walked to freedom after DNA evidence cleared him of the brutal killing of retired school teacher, Geraldine Montgomery. The crime rocked the small town of Kalkaska and Peterson quickly confessed to the murder before denying it. On Friday the county prosecutor said that all charges would be dropped after new evidence proved the guilty verdict for the 1996 killing was unsafe. Jamie Peterson, (left), is released from the Kalkaska County jail in Kalkaska, Michigan on Monday after 16 years in a Michigan prison . 'I'm very elated,' said Peterson's former attorney, Robert Carey to the Traverse City Record Eagle. 'It's been a long wait, 18 years to finally get justice, but we did get justice today and I'm very happy about that.' Mike Perreault, the Kalkaska County Prosecutor said that he won't pursue any new charges against Peterson. Petersen's conviction was vacated on August 14 after a new sample of DNA found at the crime scene and retested last year matched someone else entirely to the rape and murder. 'Time and time again facts were fed to him and when he got facts wrong, the officers told him he got the facts wrong and told him when he got the facts right,' said Peterson's current attorney, David Moran to the Traverse City Record Eagle. Shocking: The town of Kalkaska was rocked by the murder and rape of schoolteacher Geraldine Montgomery, 68, in 1996. Jamie Lee Peterson, (right) admitted the crime initially, but then recanted his confession . Release: More than 16 years after his conviction, Jamie Lee Peterson has been freed by a Michigan court . 'That’s a real red flag when you see somebody who doesn’t get the facts right initially. That’s a real indicator that you have a likely false confession.' Moran, who is the director at the University of Michigan's Innocence Clinic, said that the result was 'a great relief.' 'It is inconceivable that Jamie could have done this crime without leaving any evidence. All the evidence points to one man. We now know who that is,' he added, according to NBC. Despite his wrongful conviction, Peterson will struggle to get any compensation. Michigan is one of 22 states that do not have a compensation law. However, his legal team are going to look at a civil lawsuit.","Jamie Lee Peterson, 39, freed after Michigan court vacated conviction .

"A New York district attorney has admitted to a past career as a porn star in the 1970s after denying his involvement in the final days of his second campaign – dropping a bombshell not only to voters but his shocked family as well. Mark Suben, DA since 2008 in Cortland County near Syracuse who’s now also known for his roles in X-rated films like Deep Throat Part II, The Love Witch, Lecher and Bedroom Bedlam, according to IMDB, admitted his past in a news conference on Friday. 'Recently materials have been circulated alleging that I was involved in the adult film industry about 40 years ago in New York. Those allegations are true,' he said facing the press. Also seen as: Cortland County District Attorney Mark Suben, both left and right, has admitted acting in pornographic movies in the 1970s and lying about it when questioned during his second campaign . 'I was an actor in adult films for a short period in the early 70s. I was also an actor in other venues including off Broadway, soap operas and commercial advertisements.' He apologized for his actions and said he used 'bad judgment' by acting in porn and by lying about it. Remaining tight lipped, he wouldn't take questions, including whether he should resign. On his way out of the news conference, several people said: 'You lied to me, Mark.' Mr Suben's spokeswoman, Aimee Milks, said he will not resign. 'This was nearly 40 years ago. It was not illegal. Mark Suben was not yet married. He was not practicing law and he was not a law student,' said Ms Milks. 'It has nothing to do with his law practice or his current position as the district attorney of Cortland County.' Pseudonym: A YouTube video compilation of his past work linked the DA to the scandalous roles when he called himself Gus Thomas, here seen in film The Devils Due . 'I think the situation is really irrelevant to the campaign,' she said. 'His record as the DA for the last four years speaks for itself.' Some others may disagree though including one who posted a video compilation of his work to YouTube one day before his admittance. The videos including him in roles of seducing a girl scout in his apartment, performing a sacramental ritual on a naked woman, and whipping another woman during what appears to be intercourse. Acting under the pseudonym Gus Thomas, the IMDB online database links Mr Suben an alternative name. Mark Suben also appears in the credits for the non-pornographic 1976 movie 'Angels.' Acting: In the 1973 film Lecher, Mr Suben is seen inviting a Girl Scout into his home, one of several women he seduces . Other roles: Seen as Jose the janitor in one film, left, he also appears in the credits for the non-pornographic 1976 movie 'Angels', right . 'A few weeks ago, when asked, I denied this to members of the press,' Mr Suben said. 'I regret that and I apologize for it. I was shocked and embarrassed to be confronted with this so many years later. I was embarrassed for my family and friends who have stood by me. I also denied my actions to my family, my friends and my staff.' His opponent in the November election, Cortland lawyer Keith Dayton, did not return a call from The Associated Press seeking comment, but told the Syracuse Post-Standard he wasn't concerned about Mr Suben's acting history. 'I think the more important part is the lying,' he told the newspaper. Mr Suben has been an acting city court judge, city corporation counsel and a county attorney. He is past president of the Cortland County Bar Association. He graduated from the University of Rochester, the University of Wisconsin and Fordham Law School, according to the biography on his election website. The bio says he worked seven years as an assistant district attorney in Bronx County then moved to Syracuse. He has taught criminal trial practice as an adjunct professor for 17 years at Syracuse University Law School.","Mark Suben admitted to shocking past days after winning his second campaign while denying the then allegations .

"The DiGiorno Pizza Twitter account accidentally crashed a conversation about domestic violence yesterday by misunderstanding the meaning behind a trending hashtag, and sending out a joke tweet. Following the release of a video that clearly showed footballer Ray Rice's brutal domestic assault of then fiancée Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City hotel elevator, other abused and battered women took to Twitter to bravely share their stories, using #WhyIStayed. That is when the DiGiorno account tweeted, '#WhyIStayed You had pizza.' Scroll down for video . Big mistake: DiGiorno Pizza used a trending hashtag to make a joke about pizza, not knowing the hashtag was being used by abused  women who were sharing their stories following the release of the Ray Rice video . Many were angry and outraged the brand would joke about something so serious. The person behind the account quickly realized their mistake and apologized, writing, 'A million apologies. Did not read what the hashtag was about before posting.' That's not all either, as they also then spent the entire day writing back individual responses on Twitter to the thousands who voiced their disgust that the brand would make light of something so horrible. Apologies: So the person behind the Twitter account started apologizing... and apologizing ... and apologizing... and apologizing . The flub seems to have been forgiven by most as a result, including MSNBC TV host Ronan Farrow, who retweeted the brand's apology after he wrote to them, 'It's not delivery, it's domestic violence.' This, of course, is a rife on DiGiorno's popular slogan, 'It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno.' For good measure, the brand offered up one final apology this evening on Twitter, writing, 'We heard from many of you, and we know we disappointed you. We understand, and we apologize to everyone for this mistake.' Forgiven: After spending almost an entire day responding to complaints, it seems that many have forgiven the pizza brand . As for Rice, he was fired by the Baltimore Ravens and has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL following the release of yesterday's video. Earlier today, he spoke for the first time since the video surfaced, saying he and his wife 'are in good spirits' and that he must focus on being 'strong for my wife.'","After video of Ray Rice punching his then fiancée went public, other abused woman shared their stories on Twitter using #WhyIStayed .

"Scientists have found a cosmic supermom. It's a galaxy that gives births to more stars in a day than ours does in a year. Astronomers used Nasa's Chandra X-Ray telescope to spot this distant gigantic galaxy creating about 740 new stars a year. By comparison, our Milky Way galaxy spawns just about one new star each year. The galaxy is about 5.7 billion light years away in the center of a recently discovered cluster of galaxies that give off the brightest X-ray glow astronomers have seen. 'Phoenix' rising: This handout illustration provided by Nasa shows a cosmic supermom galaxy that gives births to more stars in a day than the Milky Way does in a year . It is by far the biggest creation of stars that astronomers have seen for this kind of galaxy. Other types, such as colliding galaxies, can produce even more stars, astronomers said. But this is the size, type and age of galaxy that shouldn't be producing stars at such a rapid pace, said the authors of a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. 'It's very extreme,' said Harvard University astronomer Ryan Foley, co-author of the study. 'It pushes the boundaries of what we understand.' The unnamed galaxy - officially known by a string of letters and numbers - is about 3 trillion times the size of our sun, said study lead author Michael McDonald of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There's another strange thing about this galaxy. It's fairly mature, maybe 6 billion years old. Eyes in the sky: The distant gigantic galaxy was spotted by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was launched into space in 1999 . Usually, this kind 'don't do anything new... what we call red and dead,' McDonald said in an interview. 'It seems to have come back to life for some reason.' Because of that back-to-life situation, the team of 85 astronomers has nicknamed the galaxy cluster Phoenix, after the bird that rises from the ashes. The galaxy that is producing the stars at a rate of two per day is the biggest and most prominent of many galaxies there. It's 'helping us answer this basic question of how do galaxies form their stars,' said Michigan State University astronomer Megan Donahue, who wasn't part of the study but praised it. There's lots of very hot hydrogen gas between galaxies. When that gas cools to below zero, the gas can form stars, McDonald said. But only 10 per cent of the gas in the universe becomes stars, Donahue said. That's because the energy from black holes in the center of galaxies counteract the cooling. There's a constant 'tussle between black holes and star formation,' said Sir Martin Rees, a prominent astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge in England. He was not part of the study, but commented on it during a Nasa teleconference Wednesday. In this case, the black hole in the central galaxy seems to be unusually quiet compared to other supermassive black holes, Rees said. 'So it's losing the tussle,' he said. But this massive burst of star birth is probably only temporary because there's only so much fuel and limits to how big a galaxy can get, Foley said. 'It could be just a very short-lived phase that every galaxy cluster has and we just got lucky here' to see it, Foley said. Little sister: By comparison, the Milky Way, pictured above, produces just one star per year .","Unnamed galaxy produces more stars in a day than the Milky Way spawns in a year .

"Diners have been left spitting feathers after a second branch of Nando's ran out of chicken this week. Customers in Wimbledon, London were left astounded when staff told them the restaurant had run out of its famous Peri Peri dish. It comes just days after the Leicester branch of the popular Portuguese-themed restaurant chain also ran out of poultry. Customers at the Russell Road branch of Nando's in Wimbledon, London were left astounded when staff told them the restaurant had run out of its famous Peri Peri chicken this week . It is thought the shortcomings have been caused by a new online takeaway service launched by the chain resulting in an increase in orders, as well as customers trying to redeem points on their paper loyalty cards before they expire. However, the Wimbledon branch may also have experienced a surge in diners this week as thousands descended on the town for the annual tennis championships. One customer, Susan French, 30, tried to dine at the Wimbledon branch after watching the action at the All England Club this week but was told by staff there was no chicken left. She told the Standard: ‘When I went in they told me they had run out of chicken. It was absolutely ridiculous. ‘They’re a chicken restaurant that can’t serve chicken. I could not believe it. It was a complete joke.’ It came just days after customers took to Twitter to vent their despair after the Leicester restaurant was temporarily unable to serve some of its poultry dishes after running out of the meat. One user called NestaMcG wrote on Wednesday night: ‘I don’t want to cause mass hysteria but @NandosUK in Leicester has run out of chicken. ‘I’m still coming to terms with what happen [sic]. One colleague is inconsolable.’ Diners in Leicester took to Twitter to vent their despair earlier this week after the branch was temporarily unable to serve chicken dishes after running out of poultry . Another customer, Steffan Powell, posted: 'So I'm in @NandosUK in Leicester...and there is no chicken... I repeat NO Chicken...' Customers have been desperately trying to redeem the final ‘chillies’ on their paper loyalty cards which were set to be made redundant from the beginning of July and replaced with plastic loyalty cards. Nando's said this, along with the launch of its online takeaway service, had contributed to the chaos. A spokesman said: ‘The launch of Online Takeaway has been incredibly popular, and with many customers also wanting to use their final remaining chillies on their old paper loyalty cards, unfortunately some restaurants ran out of certain options for a short period of time. ‘We would like to apologise to everyone who couldn’t get their meal of choice, and assure our customers that our restaurants are fully stocked with Per-Peri chicken.’ Nando’s specialises in flame-grilled chicken basted in Peri-Peri sauce and has around 300 restaurants across the UK. Its popularity has soared over the last few years, partly thanks to its celebrity devotees who often boast about eating at the restaurant.","Diners left in a flap after Nando's branch in Wimbledon runs out of poultry .

As one of the most popular members of the Coronation Street cast over the last decade, actor Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent on the TV soap,  has become something of a poster boy for this new age of unusual parenting. The 40-year-old and his partner Cameron Laux, 49, share daughter Georgia, four, and son Hal, two, with their friend Catherine Kanter, who is also the children's mother. Scroll down for video . Charlie Condou (left) has co-parented two children with his partner Cameron Laux (centre) and their friend Catherine Kanter (right) The trio have had such success with their own co-parenting experience that they are now spearheading Alternative Parenting Week in an effort to convince other gay couples that they also have a chance of starting a family. Speaking on This Morning, Charlie said: 'I think it’s important that people recognise there are families like ours out there . 'When I was growing up, there were no role models, there was nobody doing what I’d done and it was one of the big things when I came out, that I worried that I wouldn’t be a parent. 'I really wanted to be, but I didn’t know how to go about it. 'So it’s really important to talk about this as much as I can, so that other gay people realise that it is a possibility and that it isn’t something that has to be closed to them.' Catherine and Charlie first started to discuss the possibility of children more than a decade ago, but the friends took their time with the decision in order to make sure they weren't making a mistake. Charlie became a household name after playing the role of Marcus Dent in Coronation Street. Here he is pictured on set with the actress Samia Smith . Within this time, Charlie met Cameron and the idea of two parents then became three. Charlie said: 'It was an arrangement that we came up with a few years ago. 'She really wanted to be a mum, we really wanted to be dads, so we had a serious conversation about it and decided to go down the route of co-parenting.' The three adults took the decision making very seriously, with several years spent discussing the pros and cons of having a family together, as well as what their personal styles of parenting would be. Charlie said: 'We talked about it for a very long time, like a decade. Charlie Condou with daughter Georgia at the 'Tinkerbell and the Pirate Fairy' film premiere in London in February . 'We really did discuss every eventuality. 'We had all of the conversations to start with about school, etc we wanted to make sure we were on the same page. 'Morally, politically we wanted to make sure that nothing was going to come up that was a big issue.' While Catherine lives apart from Cameron and Charlie, the three adults share all parenting, with the children living in both homes equally. Although Catherine did move in with the men for a period after the birth, she has now moved back into her own home and the three parents relish the freedom co-parenting gives them. Charlie Condou (left) and his partner Cameron Laux at the Attitude Magazine 20th Birthday Party in London on 29 March 2014 . Catherine said: 'With both children we lived together for a while at the beginning. 'It was great, I couldn't have done it without them - especially when it was a newborn and a two year old. 'But we aren't designed to live together- it works because we don't live together. 'It can be tough sometimes, it's freedom as well though - I can go out and not get a babysitter, go see friends, got to the theatre. 'There are of course moments when you think you would like that other person, we do help each other out though, if the others have commitments. 'I'm very proud of what we've done, because for me being single and hitting 40, there was no opportunity for me to do it on my on without being a single mum.' Charlie is an ambassador for the Alternative Parenting Show, taking place this weekend in London.

"Accusations: Aliyah Weekes, 19, orchestrated the attack on the alleged victim and said girl she must perform the sex act or face a violent attack, the court heard . A 15-year-old girl was pinned down in an  alleyway and raped after being told 'snitches get stitches', the Old Bailey heard. The terrified girl was forced to the floor and held against a wall by a 17-year-old boy who forced her to perform a sex act after being accused of spreading rumours, it is alleged. Aliyah Weekes, 19, orchestrated the attack, telling the girl she must perform the sex act or face a violent attack, the court heard. Weekes is accused of demanding the punishment when the girl had 'snitched' on her to others. 'Aliyah instigated it, questioning (the girl) why she had said certain things about her to others', said prosecutor James Dawes. 'She tried to explain, saying she hadn't said it but Aliyah wasn't interested in listening to the answer. 'She was more interested in interogating her, questioning her in a threatening way.' The court heard the victim was going to the shop to get a drink when she was confronted by Weekes and her friends, just after 9.45am on April 29 last year. The confrontation is said to have happened on a patch of grass outside the College of North West London campus in Willesden, northwest London. 'Aliyah said she had snitched and she told her snitches get stitches', said Mr Dawes. 'Aliyah said she was lucky because they weren't going to hurt her. 'She said ""Do you know what I do to whores like you, make them do a line up"". 'This meant she had to perform a sex act on a number of boys, one after another.' Scroll down for video . Mr Dawes said the 17-year-old boy, who cannot be identified, tried to drag the victim into nearby bushes, egged on by a 16-year-old who was also part of the group. When the girl fought back, he took her to an alleyway nearby and forced her to perform the sex act while she was pinned against a wall, the court heard. The 17-year-old boy is on trial for rape, while Weekes and the 16-year-old girl are alongside him in the dock accused of aiding and abetting the attack. Scene: The confrontation is said to have happen on a patch of grass outside the College of North West London campus in Willesden, north-west London (pictured) before the girl was led to an alley . Mr Dawes said the boy told her 'don't worry' but when she continued to struggle and started crying, he told her: 'If you don't let me, it will be worse for you.' 'He forced her down so her back was to the wall, he told her to stop crying and pushed her down.' The court heard the attack only stopped when two passersby passed the alley and the boy backed away. He told her: 'I was never here' and allowed her to get away, it is said. The girl ran home and was greeted by police officers who had been called by her mother fearing she had gone missing. The boy was arrested later the same night, and claimed in interview he and the girl had been dating. He said she agreed to the sex act, and helped unbutton his trousers before it happened. Weekes was arrested the next day, and admitted having a row with the girl but denied any involvement in the sex attack. Weekes, of Willesden, northwest London, and the 16-year-old girl both deny aiding or abetting rape. The 17-year-old boy denies rape.

"NYPD officers will be given three days of training every year on how to use force after Eric Garner, 43, died after being placed in a chokehold . New York cops will be given  training on how to use force properly after a father-of-six died while being held in a chokehold by an off duty officer this summer. Police will attend three days of classes each year where they will learn how to talk to the public, how to de-escalate tense situations and how to use force. At the moment, they are only given regular firearms training. Eric Garner, 43, died after being restrained by an officer who accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes. A video of the arrest shows Mr Garner struggling on the pavement, saying 'I can't breathe' before passing out. The initiative is part of an effort to repair community relations and change the culture of the NYPD, Commissioner William Bratton said. Three precincts will initially send their officers for the training in November, before the programme expands to include the 20,000 officers who regularly work patrol. The department also recently began testing body-worn cameras in five precincts. Mr Bratton said: 'I'm fully confident that through partnership and collaboration with the community, we can uphold the law, protect human life and ensure the safety of the police and the public alike.' He added that at least $25million of funding will be needed for additional instructors and overtime to cover posts as officers are trained. Mr Bratton also plans to put rookie officers in precincts with mentors, instead of funneling them into high-crime areas right out of the academy, so they can learn  how to police correctly. To do this, Bratton said, the NYPD will need at least 1,000 new recruits. There are currently around 35,000 officers, compared to the nation's second-largest department, Chicago, which has 13,000. Scroll down for video . Video of Mr Garner's arrest shows him saying 'I can't breathe' before passing out (left). The father-of-six (right) later died and the state medical examiner has ruled the death as a homicide . Only a few months ago, Mr Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio said they didn't need more officers. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who had suggested more officers were necessary, said the council would work to give police 'the resources they need to serve New Yorkers.' A Grand Jury is currently reviewing the death of Eric Garner. Mr Garner, a black man, died after a white police officer placed him into a chokehold - a move prohibited by the NYPD, but not illegal. A video of the arrest, shot by a passerby on his mobile, showed Mr Garner struggling on the ground before passing out. In the seven minutes it took for an ambulance to arrive, nobody performed CPR. The death, which came around the same time as the shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked weeks of protests demanding justice . New York cops are also testing new body cameras in order to help rebuild relations with the community . The state medical examiner ruled the July 17 death was a homicide, saying Mr Garner was killed by 'the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.' The death, along with the shooting of unarmed teenager Mike Brown in Missouri this summer, sparked weeks of protests with family and community members demanding justice. The NYPD is currently under investigation for two restraint-related deaths. Ronald Singleton, 45, died after being arrested by officers while high on hallucinogenic drug PCP. He suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to hospital on July 13. The state medical examiner's officer ruled the death a homicide, saying 'physical restrain by police' was a factor.","Eric Garner, 43, died after being placed in chokehold by police on July 17 .

"Students returning back to school after the summer vacation are finding out what First Lady Michelle Obama's new rules for healthy eating in schools, truly mean. Gone are the the signs marketing high-sugar sodas to thirsty kids, so too are the fattening chips and chocolate. Instead, those having cravings for all-things-fattening will have to make do with protein bars, vegetable snacks, bottles of mineral water and diet soda. Mrs Obama's new rules which were approved by her husbands administration now see vending machines across the country featuring healthier options in an overall effort to fight obesity. Scroll down for video . Now what'll I eat? Paola Garcia is one of several students who are unhappy at new rules that means healthier snacks are the order of the day in school vending machines . New choices: Chips and chocolate are out in exchange for healthier protein bars, smaller packets of chips and grain-type products . Mrs. Obama has spent a great deal of time on her school lunch agenda. Will it be derailed by outraged adolescents? Mmm delicious: These snacks may be healthier, but they have irritated students at schools across the country who preferred their diet of chips and sodas . With many schools back in session, teens have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration at the lack of options that the new vending machines provide. 'Michelle Obama is single-handedly ruining my life by changing school lunch and the vending machines,' tweeted one student who was craving calories. 'How about Michelle Obama quit worrying about the vending machines and worry about how terrible school lunches are. Like that’s cardboard,' tweeted another angry student. Some students seem to have taken matters into their own hands, however, and are starting to bring in their favorite sugary snacks from outside of school. 'Smuggling junk food in my purse to school because there’s only healthy food in the vending machines,' wrote one Twitter user. The . new rules phase out the advertising of sugary drinks and junk foods . around campuses during the school day and ensure that other promotions . in schools are in line with health standards that already apply to . school foods. That means a . scoreboard at a high school football or basketball game eventually . is no longer allowed to advertise Coca-Cola, for example, but it could . advertise Diet Coke or Dasani water, which is also owned by Coca-Cola . Co. The same rules apply to the front of vending machines. Cups, posters and menu boards . which promote foods that don't meet the standards have been phased out. Ninety percent of such marketing in schools is related to beverages, and in advance of the new rules coming into effect, many soda companies already began to transition their sales and advertising in schools from sugary sodas and sports drinks to their own healthier products. The rules are part of first . lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative to combat child obesity, . which is now in its fourth year. Everything's bigger in Texas: But maybe not for much longer as healthier snacks come into play . Chosen partner: Subway is one of the few fast food brands that will work with the Partnership for a Healthier America to help advance the goals of Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign . 'The idea here is simple — our classrooms should be healthy places where kids aren't bombarded with ads for junk food,' the first lady said in a statement released before the announcement. ""Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be undone by unhealthy messages at school.' The rules also would allow more children access to free lunches and ensure that schools have wellness policies in place. The rules come on the heels of USDA regulations that are now requiring foods in the school lunch line to be healthier. Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools. Concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt. The healthier food rules have come under fire from conservatives who think the government shouldn't dictate what kids eat — and from some students who don't like the healthier foods. Banned: Under the new rules, companies are now limited in what products they can advertise on signs, vending machines, cups and menu boards on school grounds . Aware of the backlash, the USDA is allowing schools to make some of their own decisions on what constitutes marketing and asking for comments on some options. Rules for other school fundraisers, like bake sales and marketing for those events is still up to individual schools or states. Off-campus fundraisers, like an event at a local fast-food outlet that benefits a school, are still permitted. But posters advertising the fast food are no longer allowed in school hallways. The rules also makes allowances for major infrastructure costs — that scoreboard advertising Coca-Cola, for example, won't have to be immediately be torn down, but school has to get one with a healthier message the next time its replaced. Where there's a will... Students have found other ways to get around the unpopular new rules on school nutrition . Positive marketing only: Snapple is the exclusive beverage in city public schools as well as at parks and other public areas. For $166 million Snapple will promote New York - all over a five year period, with most money going to the schools). Only water and juices will be sold in the schools . The beverage industry — led by Coca-Cola Co., Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and PepsiCo — is on board with the move. American Beverage Association President and CEO Susan Neely said in a statement that aligning signage with the healthier drinks that will be offered in schools is the 'logical next step.' 'Mrs. Obama's efforts to continue to strengthen school wellness make sense for the well-being of our schoolchildren,' Neely said. Although Mrs. Obama lobbied Congress to pass the school nutrition bill in 2010, most of her efforts in recent years have been focused on the private sector, building partnerships with food companies and retailers to sell healthier foods.","First Lady has introduced new rules that saw companies limited in what products they could advertise on signs, vending machines, cups and menu boards on school grounds .
Food industry spent nearly $150 million in 2009 on marketing in schools, 93 percent was promoting drinks .
Schools now require drink companies to promote their diet sodas or water on signs and scoreboards, rather than full-calorie options like Coca-Cola and Pepsi .

"Murder suspect Shrien Dewani appeared in a South African court today ahead of his long-awaited trial for allegedly killing his wife on their honeymoon. Dewani, a 35-year-old from Bristol, was travelling in a taxi with his wife Anni, 28, through a poor township in South Africa in 2010 when their vehicle was hijacked.

"This is the moment a cautious driver holds up a busy London street while doing a seven-point turn in his £294,665 Lamborghini Aventador supercar. The motorist, spent almost one minute edging his 217mph car forward and backwards as he attempted to turn around in South Kensington in London. The display was captured on the dashboard camera of by a taxi driver who was held up by the display. Scroll down for video . The £294,665 Lamborghini Aventador attempts to turn in the road in South Kensington in London . The driver carefully edges the 217mph super car between the kerbs despite the annoyance of other motorists . The footage was captured by taxi driver Chris Kareban who said: 'Owners of supercars in London usually drive slowly as they want to show off their ""toys"". I have noticed new crazy driving styles too.' The Lamborghini Aventador features a sophisticated all-wheel drive system which delivers the 700bhp produced by the 6.5litre V12 engine to all four wheels to increase grip and make it safer to drive. Luckily for the driver concerned, the car also comes as standard with power steering as well as parking sensors. The Aventador's massive engine is placed behind the driver's cabin, over the rear wheels to produce the ultimate weight balance. However, even though the driver took seven attempts to turn in the road, he would not have automatically failed his driving test. The driver consciously avoids getting too close to the pavement in case he damages his expensive bodywork . The Aventador can hit 60mph in less than three seconds and is capable of reaching 217mph on a race track . Peter Rodger, chief examiner of the Institute of Advanced Motorists said it was understandable why the driver appeared to have some difficulty in turning his car. 'The Aventador has a particularly large footprint on the road and it is fairly clear that the driver isn't exactly certain where the front of the car ends. UK list price: £294,665 . Engine: 6.5 litre V12 . Power: 700bhp at 8,250 rpm . Fuel efficiency: 16.4mpg combined . 0-60mph: 2.9 seconds . Top speed: 217mph . Transmission: 7-speed semi-automatic all wheel drive . 'It is also very low, so I guess the driver did not want to touch the kerb as repairing the carbon fibre bodywork would be quite expensive. 'I would expect that controlling the clutch during such a delicate manoeuvre could be tricky as well.' 'It is better to take an extra shunt than to hit something. Although the driver could have considered finding an alternative place to turn in a less busy location.' Mr Rodger, who has more than 40 years' driving experience said that there is a common misconception among motorists with the three-point turn. 'It has been called the three-point turn since before I started driving. But the examiner will ask you to turn in the road using forward and reverse gears. The examiner will be looking to see if you have the car under control at all times and are keeping an adequate look out. The driver has to make adequate progress but you wouldn't automatically fail with seven turns. In that car it would be difficult to complete the manoeuvre in less than five. 'I don' think the Aventador would be a good car for doing the driving test as the examiner would have difficulty seeing out, so it might not be an acceptable vehicle.' Eventually after almost a minute, the Aventador squeezes past a taxi who is busily searching for a fare .","The 217mph super car took seven attempts to turn in a busy London street .

"Dave Lee Travis arrives at London's Southwark Crown Court today. A female TV personality told the court Travis 'squeezed' her breasts . A female television personality has told a court she 'froze' when veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis 'squeezed' her breasts while she was working on the Mrs Merton Show. She said the former Radio 1 star approached her in the corridor of a television studio  and his hands on her chest. The woman told Travis's retrial at Southwark Crown Court in London that the alleged assault in the mid 1990s was 'unbelievably weird' and she thought the former Top Of The Pops presenter, who was booked as a guest on the show, got a 'sexual thrill' from the incident. The alleged victim, who cannot be named, said: 'I started smoking my cigarette and he came out of his dressing room over to me and said; 'You shouldn't be smoking. Think about your poor little lungs'. 'He started to touch the bottom of my ribcage. Without saying anything else, he slid his hand up to my breasts and then kind of left them there and started squeezing.' Asked by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC how she felt at the time, the woman replied: 'Shocked. I couldn't believe what was happening. It was just unbelievably weird. 'I had not had any interaction with him. I didn't even know if he knew my name.' The woman, who was working as part of the production crew in Manchester, described the alleged assault as a 'squeezing grope'. 'I kind of froze,' she said. 'I was standing there just looking up. I didn't know what to say. I was kind of pinned against the wall.' The woman, who gave evidence without a screen, in view of Travis in the dock, said he let go of her breasts after 10 or 15 seconds. 'I was just kind of looking up at him and thought he's not going to say anything,' she said; 'I put my cigarette out and kind of backed away really.' She added: 'I had a real adrenaline rush. He was massive. He was looming over me. When I got away....it was like a fight or flight feeling.' The alleged victim said Travis had an 'intense' stare during the incident, which she reported to a senior producer. The alleged victim said she was told Travis was known as an 'octopus' because 'his hands go everywhere' She went on: 'I said; 'Oh my God, Dave Lee Travis just touched my t***'.' She added: 'It was absolutely the weirdest thing that happened in my life. It was definitely a deliberate attempt. He held on to my breasts for a long time. He was staring. 'I absolutely know he had some weird sexual thrill from this. I felt like I had been punched. It was that feeling of being violated.' The woman, who was in her early 20s at the time of the alleged incident, said she did not make an official complaint or contact police at the time because she was young and did not want to make 'a fuss'. She told the court a colleague later told her that Travis was known as an 'octopus' because 'he's got hands that go everywhere'. The woman said she had since spoken in public about the alleged assault. Stephen Vullo QC, defending Travis, told the court his client had 'no recollection' of the alleged victim. Peter Kessler, a producer on the Mrs Merton Show, said the woman appeared 'astonished' when she told him about the incident. 'She said words to the effect of 'You'll never guess what's happened - DLT [Travis's nickname] just grabbed my t***,' he told the court. 'DLT had emerged from his dressing room and seen her smoking and gone up to her and said, words to the effect of 'You shouldn't be smoking, it's very bad for your lungs, here and here', and as if illustrating his words, rubbed his hand on her breasts.' Travis (pictured, left, today) denies two counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault . Mr Kessler told the court he had worked with around 200 celebrity guests during his career as a television producer. He said: 'I was well used to celebrities misbehaving in various ways. I had personal experience of being at the sharp end of celebrity behaviour. 'This was the only occasion anything of a sexual nature happened to my team.' Asked by Ms Moore about the woman's reaction to the alleged assault, Mr Kessler replied: 'I would say she was slightly stupefied but in her control of herself. She wasn't in tears. It was almost like the most bizarre thing has just happened.' Mr Kessler said he and the alleged victim decided not to take the matter any further. 'He (Travis) was going to be gone in the next couple of hours, we would never see him again,' he said. 'There were plenty of other things to worry about, put it down to experience. It's a bit of a weird case, let's move on to the next problem.' Mr Kessler said he contacted police about the incident without the alleged victim's knowledge after seeing a press report in 2012 about an unnamed Radio 1 DJ who had groped a female presenter. Former Radio One DJ Travis is accused of assaulting a crew member on the Mrs Merton Show. File photo . He told the court he had a phone conversation later with the alleged victim and they were 'surprised' that their recollections of the incident were 'exactly the same'. Under cross-examination, Mr Kessler said he believed the incident was a sexual assault. He said: 'I can only go by her demeanour and it looked to me like it had been sleazy bad behaviour which might in some cases have been scarring and in other cases, unwelcomed. In her case it looked like she was coping pretty well.' Mr Kessler told the court he reported Travis's alleged assault after he was prompted by his wife, a barrister, who worked on a BBC review in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Another woman told the court Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, put his hand between her legs as she served him drinks at a venue in the Isle Of Man in the 1980s. She said she came forward to police last year in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal and after seeing footage of Travis's 'smug grin' walking into court. In a police interview played to the court, she said she was left 'dumbfounded' when Travis pinned her against the wall ahead of a celebrity appearance, but when she told a security guard and later her husband, both said he was 'just messing about'. The jury at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) also heard evidence from another woman, who is not a complainant in the case, who claims Travis put his hand between her legs in the 1980s . The woman, who is not one of the complainants in the case, told police: 'He just pinned me against the wall, one hand out, one hand between my legs.' She added: 'I was so taken aback. I was like, ""Don't touch me!"" He was very cocky and very sure of himself.' The woman said she told her cousin about the alleged incident years later. 'She said, ""Are you mad?

"An explosive Geoffrey Edelsten has hit back at claims made by the American woman who revealed intimate details of their brief relationship by calling her a 'fat, ugly liar.' The 71-year-old told his version of events on Channel Nine's A Current Affair on Tuesday night - the same program 21-year-old American Shirley Moore appeared on a night before to air damming allegations about him. Mr Edelsten refuted all but one claim made by Ms Moore - that they met on a 'sugar daddy' website - by stating that she 'told  Australia a whole lot of lies' when she spoke of bribes, possible marriage and payments he made to her during their  time together. Scroll down for video . Geoffrey Edelsten has called Shirley Moore a liar after she appeared on A Current Affair on Monday . He also said Ms Moore broke a legally binding agreement to delete emails she gained access to which she said contained information about Mr Edelsten's many lovers. A fuming Mr Edelsten said: 'She appeared on your program with a whole lot of lies.' 'She is ugly, she is fat, a gold digger with no morals and she is dangerous.' Mr Edelsten said he never made a 'verbal agreement' with Ms Moore about their paid-for relationship, nor did he buy her a BMW to keep her quiet about emails which allegedly revealed he was cheating on her. Speaking on the program, he said money was only a 'minor' attraction of what women see in him and that his relationships with women are anything but 'business transactions.' Mr Edelsten was happy to hear that his fiancée Gabi Grecko was supporting him after Monday's program . Mr Edelsten agree to do the interview after speaking with his fiancée on Tuesday morning . He said the  Ms Moore's appearance on the program was financially motivated. 'The whole reason she has done this is to cause me harm and to make money.' He also said there was never a proposal contract made between him and former lover Brynne Gordon, also known as Brynne Edelsten - which Ms Moore claimed was worth $50 million. 'There was never a contract with Brynne.' 'There were private emails - but I don't recall $50 million ever being mentioned.' He said despite Ms Moore seeing all his emails - she has 'made up stories' about the 'document' which is alleged to have contained  details of the agreed proposal. Claims that Ms Moore made about the money she was afforded, starting at $8,000 a month or $96,000 a year to be in a relationship with him, he said were also false. One element of the interview Mr Edelsten was happy to hear was that his fiancée Gabbi Grecko was supporting him. Gabi Grecko  hit back on social media after her fiancé exposed her 'paid for' relationship with the septuagenarian businessman. Gabi, 25, took to Instagram in the early hours of Tuesday morning to upload a series of images, illustrating her turmoil. Mr Edelsten said he wasn't aware that she had been supportive of him, but spoke with her on Tuesday where he said he would out Ms Moore as a liar. 'I said that I would make it clear that if I did an interview with A Current Affair that what a horrible person she is , that she is ugly, she is fat and that her activities in trying to abuse and stalk other people close to me is just not acceptable' I got to be blunt - I'm facing a girl who told a whole lot of Australia a whole lot of lies.' Scroll down for video . Hitting back: Gabi Grecko took to social media to vent her feelings after her fiancé Geoffrey Edelsten's ex-secret lover Shirley Moore exposed her 'paid for' relationship with the 71-year-old businessman . Gabi Grecko pictured parting shots onto Instagram of Ms Moore sitting on a park bench, exposing a length of leg, beside which Gabi wrote: 'WTF'. Hours later the Maxim model posted a series of hilariously captioned film stills from an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm in which Larry David propositions a female prostitute and offers to pay her to attend a Dodgers game with him. In the comic television sequence the pair argue over the amount of money she should receive for the entirety of the game - Gabi appeared to be drawing similarities between her situation and the fictional characters. WTF, REALLY? After the Channel Nine A Current Affair expose Gabi uploaded three images in the early hours of Tuesday morning, she captioned the first (pictured above) REALLY? Not happy: The 25-year-old uploaded a second image of Ms Moore (pictured), she wrote beside it WTF . Venting her feelings: Later Gabi continued her Instagram rampage seemingly comparing Geoffrey and Ms Moore's relationship to a scene from Curb Your Enthusiasm . One caption read 'At the Brownlow' presumably alluding to the fact that Geoffrey and Ms Moore had reportedly ended their relationship after she failed to attend the lauded event by his side. In another shot where the couple are in driving in a car, Gabi wrote 'Can you drive this BMW?' referring to Ms Moore's claims that Mr Edelsten gifted her with a vehicle to keep her quiet. At 21, Ms Moore, a waitress from Chicago, claims she became one of 71-year-old Edelsten's kept women after meeting the Australian businessman on a sugar daddy website. Exposing the details her lavish relationship with the former general practitioner on Monday night's ACA, Ms Moore says the Australian - who was then three times her age - paid her a monthly allowance that grew from $8,000 to $250,000 over the course of their relationship. 'At the Brownlow', wrote the blonde next this image, alluding to when Geoffrey reportedly ended his relationship with Ms Moore after her failed to attend the event with the 71-year-old . Revealing: Ms Moore claimed she met Edelsten at the age of 21 on a sugar daddy website during her interview on Monday Night's A Current Affair . She told Channel Nine's ACA she had a 'verbal agreement' with Mr Edelsten about the nature of their relationship, which she says was 'purely business' and that she did not love him. The busty brunette says she went on the show because the public deserve to know the truth about the businessmen's multiple relationships, revealing that  the pair even discussed marriage. However, it was at that point that she unearthed email exchanges between Geoffrey and other women, but after threatening to go public with their arrangement when she found the emails, she says she was gifted with a BMW. Shortly after the pair split and Ms Moore was outed for another 'sugarbaby' - Brynne Gordon formerly Brynne Edelsten - who Ms Moore claims he met online and offered a $50 million proposal, including an engagement ring worth at least $250,000. Engaged to be married: Gabi, 25, has been dating Edelsten since March, he split from his estranged wife Brynne Edelsten late last year . Heated exchange: Ms Moore claims she contacted Gabi to warn her that she was still in contact with Geoffrey and they had planned to meet up . Kept woman: Ms Moore claims Edelsten paid her a monthly allowance that grew from $8,000 to $250,000 over the course of their relationship . Reality TV star Ms Edelsten has previously denied meeting her ex-husband - who is now dating New York model Gabi Grecko - online. Ms Moore contacted Ms Grecko soon after her relationship with the businessman began when he claimed they were just friends and exchanged words. 'I emailed her: ""Who are you to Geoffrey?"",' she said. 'The first email that she sent me was: ""Go away you dumb b****. He's mine, we're getting engaged.' Ms Moore said she emailed Ms Grecko because she and Mr Edelsten had been in contact with each other and they had planned to meet up. In love: Beauty queen Gabi shared an image of an engagement ring on Friday, perhaps hinting at things to come . Ms Moore will now take the stand to give evidence in the 71-year-old Edelsten's bankruptcy proceedings in the US. A lawsuit has been launched in an effort to reclaim millions of dollars from the former millionaire  in order to repay his huge debts in the US. Twice-married Geoffrey split with his estranged second wife of four years Brynne late last year amid rumours that he'd cheated on her. In March he went public with his relationship with Gabi after the couple met in New York. They announced their engagement in July with Gabi sharing an image of a stunning 2.11 carat Classic Winston engagement ring on social media on Friday. The pair, who have yet to set a date, are expected to marry in 2015.

"Many of us have been on cheap package holidays where old noisy buses are used to ferry tourists around, but nobody ever expects a steering wheel to come off in a driver's hands in the middle of his route. However, that is precisely what happened in Malta recently and a video, which was captured by an unfortunate passenger on the bus, has now appeared online. The bus had just navigated a corner when the dangerous incident occurred. The driver can be seen struggling to handle the wobbly wheel which becomes more unstable as the journey progresses. The wheel eventually comes off in the bus driver's hands and he reacts  to the incident by subsequently lifting the steering wheel up to show a passing bus driver. Tourist Hannah Billen filmed the footage and she was very unhappy after the incident. She wrote online: 'Luckily the bus had just finished driving round a corner before it came off. The driver then waved it to a fellow bus driver before telling the passengers to get off and wait for another bus, leaving us stranded in the middle of nowhere!' Local reports claim that Malta Public Transport have suspended the driver for unsafe conduct. Normal journey: Everything seems normal on the bus during the first few seconds of the video . First sign of trouble: After six seconds the wheel wobbles worryingly for the first time . Carry on: The bus driver seems unperturbed by the wobbly steering wheel and continues driving .

"A 12-year-old girl who suffers from a foot complaint was forced to write 'decent people take pride in their appearance' 40 times after turning up to school in the wrong shoes. Laura Rawsterne was sent home by Excelsior Academy in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, yesterday as part of a purge by teachers on incorrect uniform. But before the youngster - who suffers from inflammation in her feet - was sent home, she was put in so-called 'isolation' and ordered to write out lines. Scroll down for video . Laura Rawsterne was sent home by Excelsior Academy in Newcastle yesterday for wearing canvas shoes . The school's action have caused fury with Laura's mother, Shirley Kirkup, who says she had no idea the black canvas shoes broke the school's strict code. Ms Kirkup, 49, said: 'I think it is absolutely diabolical. So does that mean by daughter is not decent? Children should not have to write out things like that. 'She was taken into a different room for half a hour before she was sent home. Other children were still in isolation when she left. 'The school planner says no trainers, it does not say no canvas shoes allowed. Laura has sore feet as she has had an infection in her foot for quite a long time. 'She is unable wear leather shoes as they make her feet sweat so the doctor suggested she wore canvas shoes instead. 'It took me by surprise when she was sent home, she has always worn them. I can't go out and buy her leather shoes which she can't wear.' Before she was sent home, the youngster was told to write out 'decent people take pride in their appearance' Ms Kirkup understands Laura was one of 22 pupils sent home for wearing the wrong school attire as part of a clampdown at the beginning of the school year. She says Laura has been a pupil at Excelsior Academy for one year and has worn canvas shoes during her entire time at the school. She said it was only when Laura returned to the school after the summer holidays as a Year Eight pupil when the problem arose. Full-time mother Ms Kirkup, who also has a 15-year-old daughter, was told that she needs to obtain a doctor's note which proves Laura's medical condition. Ms Kirkup, from West Denton, Newcastle, said: 'Now I am going to have to pay for a doctor's letter which will cost £20 to prove Laura is not able to wear leather shoes.' Laura's mother says the lines her daughter was forced to write out 40 times suggest she is 'not decent' She added: 'I can't afford to pay that until next week. Laura is not happy. She keeps saying I am bored and I want to go to school. 'Her education is being effected, I am worried that she will fall behind at school. She loves school and wants to learn but because of this she can't go to school.' The school insist the uniform policy is clear and its actions were necessary to lay down the law ahead of the new term. Phil Marshall, Excelsior Academy Executive Principal, said: 'Our uniform policy at Excelsior Academy has remained unchanged for the past seven years and we reminded parents and pupils about it before the summer holiday break and again when we returned to school last week.' The school insist the footwear - which Laura says she needs to help her foot problems - do not meet their rules . He added: 'The parents of pupils not wearing correct uniform were called and children sent home to return to school the same day changed into the correct uniform. Canvas shoes and trainers are not acceptable footwear. 'If any parent has a medical issue regarding their child's wearing of school uniform, the school principals or one of the welfare officers is always available to talk and help. 'Wearing uniform is important as it teaches young people that there are rules in life and also prepares them for when they go to work and the expectations of a dress code. 'We try to work with parents as much as we possibly can to ensure they understand what their children need to wear to school. 'We have high standards of dress code and we thank the overwhelming majority of parents who help us meet those.'","Laura Rawsterne wore canvas shoes to school due to foot condition .

"A 19-year-old died in a car crash while she was looking for her boyfriend after the two had a fight in the early hours of Mother's Day, an inquest heard. Emily Morfitt, 19, died instantly after her blue Ford Ka left the A1174 on a bend at Woodmansey, at around 4am on Mother's Day. The car smashed into a concrete post and flipped over a 8ft-high hedge, before coming to rest in a field close to Lakeminster Park, near Beverley, East Yorkshire. Jack Davies and his girlfriend Emily Morfitt, who died when she crashed her car while following him after a row . An inquest into her death heard how she had been arguing with her boyfriend of around a year, Jack Davies, 21, following a night out with friends at The Sugar Mill in Hull. The teenager, who worked in the restaurant at Brown's department store in Beverley, suffered head, neck and abdominal injuries. On the night, Mr Davies had visited Napoleon's Casino, also in the city centre, with his friends. Giving evidence, Mr Davies told how he had arranged for a taxi to collect him and Emily from outside Bodrum's takeaway close to the nightclub his girlfriend had visited. Emily did not know where the takeaway was, so Mr Davies walked to The Sugar Mill where he saw his girlfriend and her friend being 'chatted up' by a group of men. He said: 'I did not like what I saw.' Her friend took a separate taxi home, while Mr Davies and Emily took the taxi back to her home. Mr Davies said there was a 'strained atmosphere' in the car and said his girlfriend had 'nipped' his arm on the journey home, while taxi driver Neville Huntley said Mr Davies was verbally abusive to her. Joanne Morfitt (left) told the inquest she tried to stop her daughter Emily (right) from following her boyfriend . Back at the house an argument broke out between the two and Mr Davies went to sit in his car outside the house. He claimed Emily had got into her own car and drove up the road, negotiating a roundabout, before returning home. Mr Davies then said he drove on to The Robin pub in east Hull, before returning to Emily's home, where he parked up. She was not there, and so he sat parked and waited for her. He woke a few hours later to a phone call from his girlfriend's father John Morfitt telling him of the accident. The inquest also heard from Emily's mother Joanne, who had confronted her daughter in the house as she was rushing off to 'stop' Mr Davies. Mrs Morfitt said she and her husband John had expected trouble between the two that evening. She said: 'They were both intently jealous of each other. We were dreading it.' Mrs Morfitt said she was woken at 3.37am by the sound of a car engine. 'I went downstairs,' she said. 'Emily passed me in the hallway. She was in a rush. I could see that Emily had been crying. She had mascara all over her face. Emily Morfitt had been drinking but was not over the legal limit when she got behind the wheel, police said . 'I said to her, ""Emily, what are you doing?""' She said: ""I am going to my car"". 'I told her she can't. She had been drinking. She said: ""It's OK. I've not been drinking but Jack has. I need to stop him"".' 'I saw no sign that she had been drinking. She kept saying, ""I need to stop Jack"".' Mrs Morfitt said she opened the front door and saw her daughter and Mr Davies sitting in their respective cars. 'Emily had her lights on and the engine was running. 'I thought this was not right so I went to get a coat. My intention was to get the keys for both cars. When I went back outside they had gone. I thought about ringing Emily on her mobile phone, but realised she would be driving.' She and her husband were visited a few hours later by police who informed them their daughter had died in a crash. Emily had 76mg of alcohol in her blood, which 'may have affected cognitive functions', say police. The legal limit is 80mg per 100ml of blood. Checks on the car showed insufficient tread on one tyre, but crash investigators said this would not have caused the accident. Officers believe it was likely Emily, described as an 'inexperienced driver', was travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit. Police also noted four calls had been made from her iPhone to Mr Davies shortly before 4am, although it is not clear if she had made these while driving. He did not answer the calls. Rosemary Baxter, deputy coroner for Hull and the East Riding, returned a verdict of accidental death.","Emily Morfitt, 19, died in car crash when she was looking for her boyfriend .

"Six Australian tourists have been injured after the railing they were leaning on at a temple in Cambodia suddenly collapsed, sending them tumbling down an embankment. The Australians were part of a tour group who had been sightseeing on their final day of a seven-day Mekong River cruise when the the railing surrounding Han Chey pagoda outside Phnom Penh  gave way at 9.30am on Monday causing the six to fall about four metres below, reported The Cambodia Daily. Four of the unlucky tourists - Sandra McIntosh, 63, Heather Todd, 73, Steven Burgess, 65, and Patricia Jachimowicz, 68, - were treated at the Kompong Cham Provincial Hospital for minor injuries. The remaining two injured Australians - Christine Menzel, 63, and Ian McIntosh, 66 - were rushed to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh. The stairs where the railing collapsed (left) leading to the temple at the top of mountain.   Han Chey pagoda (right) Phnom Penh Post reporter Chhay Channyda told the ABC that the tourists were leaning on the railing as it crumbled. 'All six of them were leaning on the banister on the stairs up to the temple, which is obviously decayed because the rock is so old,' Ms Channyda said. Ms Menzel suffered serious back injuries and a possible broken rib, while Mr McIntosh underwent surgery for a dislocated elbow. Ms McIntosh, from NSW, who received four stitches to her head, said the accident had not ruined what had been an enjoyable holiday with plans to travel on to Siem Reap for six days once her 'tough-as-nails' husband was released from hospital. '[The railing] all of a sudden gave away and all these people just fell into the jungle,' she told The Cambodia Daily. 'Everyone has been wonderful helping us—the staff at the original hospital, at this hospital [Calmette], and all the travel-company people who carried everyone out.' Meanwhile the Menzel's had no intention to include temples in their future holidays. Ms Menzel's husband Phil, who was not injured in the accident, said the couple would return home to Adelaide in South Australia, as soon as possible for his wife to receive further treatment. 'We'll never go to another temple again,' he said.

"Newlyweds Edith Hill, 96, and Eddie Harrison, 95, married in Alexandria, Virginia, earlier this year after being companions for over a decade. But their union is now being investigated because Hill has been declared legally incapacitated for several years and some family members are worried about their inheritance. A judge said at a hearing earlier this month that he believes the co-guardian over Hill - her daughter - along with a sister who opposed the marriage, acted improperly by taking the elderly woman to get married without the court's permission. Just married: Edith Hill and Eddie Harrison (pictured) married earlier this year but didn't get the court's permision . Cary Cuccinelli, representing the sister who opposed the marriage, Patricia Barber, said at the hearing that the wedding occurred without other family members' knowledge, and that it complicated the matter of how to eventually distribute Hill's estate. The estate includes property on the edge of Old Town Alexandria, worth about $475,000, according to real estate assessments. 'Legally, Mr. Harrison now has a right to a portion of Ms. Hill's estate,' she told the judge, saying it also complicates decisions over who will care for Hill, and where she will live. While the judge, James Clark, found the marriage to have been improper, he also worried that breaking up the couple could 'create a circumstance in Ms. Hill's life that she doesn't deserve.' Clark ended up removing Hill's daughter Rebecca Wright and Barber as Hill's guardians, and appointing a lawyer, Jessica Niesen, instead. The judge instructed Niesen 'to investigate the marriage and take all actions appropriate and reasonable to protect the best interests of Edith Hill.' Niesen, in a phone interview, said she is still gathering facts and has an upcoming appointment to meet Hill and Harrison. While there are numerous issues to be sorted out, including questions about inheritance and where the couple will live, she would just as soon let the marriage continue. 'I see no reason to break this couple up, if there is no harm,' she said. One solution might be a postnuptial agreement preventing Harrison from inheriting Hill's estate. Niesen said that if she finds that the marriage is not in Hill's best interest, she has the authority to pursue a divorce or possibly an annulment on Hill's behalf. Rebecca Wright said she remained concerned authorities would try to break up the marriage. She also opposes a postnuptial agreement, saying the marriage should be respected just as any other. Wright joked: 'Anybody who wants to get married must have a little dementia.' Edith and Eddie have been best friends for more than 10 years after a Hollywood-style meet-cute — they struck up a conversation while standing in line for lottery tickets, with one of the tickets turning into a $2,500 winner. They married earlier this year, with a 95-year-old church elder presiding over the ceremony, no less. 'I guess I wanted company,' Hill said in an interview, explaining why she married. 'I wanted somebody I could help, and they could help me. We were both single. My husband was gone. His wife was gone. We became the best of friends.' Robin Wright, Hill's granddaughter, said the relationship is more romantic than Hill's explanation allows. 'You catch them kissing all the time,' she said. 'They're actually in love. Really in love.   I know he's part of the reason she gets up every morning.' The interracial aspect of their marriage is unique as well. She is black and he is white. In fact, the longtime Virginians would not have been allowed to marry if they had met in their 20s or 30s or 40s, given Virginia's law banning interracial marriages at the time. Wright says she has concluded after doing some research through Guinness Book of World Records that the two are likely the nation's oldest interracial newlyweds. Edith Hill, for her part, doesn't give the interracial aspect of her marriage too much thought, despite the fact that for half of her life it would have been illegal. Asked about the old laws barring interracial marriage, she said, 'That's done away with, isn't it?' For now, the two live together in Annandale, with Rebecca and Robin Wright helping care for them. Rebecca Wright said the two do a good job taking care of each other — his hearing is not great, and her vision is not great. They dance, listen to music and take walks, which has improved their health. And Rebecca Wright said the companionship two people of the same age provide each other can't be underestimated. 'They can talk about things that nobody else knows about,' she said. Eddie Harrison said he and Hill never fight, and they both understood what getting married would mean. 'The first time I married I didn't know what I was doing,' he said. 'I was 18. She was 26. Two weeks later I wanted a divorce.'","Edith Hill and Eddie Harrison married in Virginia earlier this year .

"Anyone who was anyone in London society in the 1830s was expected to attend the Royal Academy exhibition. The playwrights and actors of the Drury Lane theatres, the Fleet Street art critics, the moneyed nabobs returned from India with grand town houses to fill with art from the masters of the day. For the artists who exhibited in the Academy’s high-ceilinged rooms, the exhibition was the culmination of a year’s work. It had the power to make an artist’s name — or ruin him. Each year, more than 1,000 pictures were exhibited in the crowded galleries, hung frame-to-frame from skirting board to ceiling. The power of the Academy’s Hanging Committee was immense. John Constable's The Opening of Waterloo Bridge ('Whitehall Stairs, June 18th, 1817') and exhibited in 1833 . A spot opposite the doors could mean an artist spent the next year being courted by aristocratic clients with commissions to paint their country estate, their beautiful wife or their adored King Charles spaniel. A painting unfavourably hung up by the cornice meant another year starving in a garret. In this competitive field, painters resorted to all manner of dirty tricks to gain advantage. The days before the opening of the exhibition, when artists were allowed to apply a final coat to their paintings in situ, were particularly fraught. Painters at war: John Constable (left) and Joseph Mallord William Turner (right) In 1833, two of the giants of British painting J.M.W. Turner and John Constable found that their paintings had been hung side-by-side in one of the main galleries. Turner, who was touching up another picture in the next room, came several times to cast an eye between his ‘Helvoetsluys’ — a Dutch seascape — and Constable’s ‘The Opening of Waterloo Bridge’. This must have infuriated Constable, who was carefully applying flecks of vermilion paint to the flags decorating the barges of his own painting. The Grove: The Hampstead two-bedroom cottage that artist John Constable lived in during the 1820s . After several trips back and forth, Turner finally returned with his palette and, leaning close to the canvas, applied a daub of red, no bigger than a shilling, over his grey sea. He left without saying a word, the paint still wet and glistening. It was another day-and-a-half before Turner returned, and then, in the last moments allowed for alterations, he glazed the scarlet shilling and turned it into a buoy bobbing in the harbour. Constable told a fellow Academy member: ‘He has been here and fired a gun.’ What he meant, of course, was that this last-minute dash of elan — of sheer, breathtaking colour — was tantamount to an act of sabotage against his own painting hanging alongside. The exhibition was a disaster for Constable. Even his friend the painter Thomas Stothard pronounced Waterloo Bridge: ‘Very unfinished, sir.’ The Morning Herald critic wrote: ‘What a piece of plaster it is!’ Then, adding insult to injury: ‘Mr Constable appears to think he is a Turner.’ If Constable did not already loathe Turner, there is no doubt he did from that moment on. Turner seems to have detested Constable with equal force. This month, the rivals will be pitted against each other once again in two blockbuster exhibitions. In one corner of the ring is Late Turner at Tate Britain; in the other, ‘Constable: The Making Of A Master at the Victoria & Albert Museum. City of Utrecht, 64, Going to Sea, 1832 (oil on canvas) by Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) The two artists, pioneers of a revolutionary style of landscape painting, were opposites in birth, looks and temperament. Turner, born in Covent Garden in 1775 to a father who had a wig-trimming and barber’s business, was a monomaniac who preferred his palette and brushes to the convivial company of the dinner table. A Miss Dart, who knew Turner in his youth when he stayed with her uncle near Avon, disobligingly described him as ‘singular and silent . . . mean and ungrateful . . . careless and slovenly in his dress . . . anything but a nice-looking young man.’ It is an image captured so brilliantly by the actor Timothy Spall in a new film about the painter that he won the Best Actor award at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. Turner cared little what others thought of him. When a fellow member of the Academy, Sir Francis Bourgeois, called him ‘a little reptile’, he replied coolly that he was ‘a great reptile — with ill manners’. He never married, but lived with his ageing father, who was always catching cold. Turner affectionately called him ‘Daddy’ even into middle-age. Constable was a country lad. Born in 1776, he grew up in Suffolk, still known today as Constable Country. His father, an affluent miller, was keen his son should continue the family business rather than pursue the precarious living of a painter. While Turner was just 15 when he first exhibited at the Academy, Constable was nearly 40. The scene at Dedham where John Constable painted the Haywain, as it is today . Unlike bachelor Turner, Constable was happily married to Maria Bicknell, the granddaughter of a Suffolk neighbour. He fervently believed his artistic success depended on her love. ‘All my hopes and prospects in life,’ he wrote to her, ‘are included in my attachment to you.’ They had seven children, and Constable’s friend and biographer C.R. Leslie recalled that the babies were as often in their father’s arms as their mother’s. What the rivals had in common was an astonishingly vivid new way of looking at landscape. While artists of the previous generation had set out to paint the landscape with topographical accuracy, Turner and Constable wished to capture its spirit. Turner painted tumultuous storms over harbours, blazing fires, the smoke and steam of the new industrial age. He thrilled to weather at its wildest and most violent. This recklessness is evidenced in an account given by a Cornish newspaper editor of a boat trip with Turner off the coast of Plymouth. While the other passengers suffered crippling sea-sickness in the ‘boisterous’ waters, Turner sat in the stern muttering admiringly: ‘That’s fine! Fine!’ Constable was intensely interested in the quality of light: the way scudding clouds cast shadows over fields, the haze after a downpour, late afternoon sun on a riverbank. He proudly wrote of his delight in decay and neglect: ‘Old rotten banks, slimy posts and brickwork — I love such things.’ Dedham Lock and Mill was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Constable's daughter Isabel in 1888 . They might have found much to admire in each other’s work, but Turner saw Constable as a young pretender with an eye on his crown. To Constable, Turner was a king to be toppled. The Royal Academy, to which they both belonged, was a cauldron of ego, resentment, back-stabbing, in-fighting, factions, cronies and coups. When Constable first began to exhibit in London, he eagerly took to scheming, politicking and alliance-making. He was delighted when in 1803, Turner, who had been feted as a ‘genius’ the previous year, had an unsuccessful exhibition. One of the reviews said Turner’s seas looked like ‘soap and chalk’, and enemies piled in with their own criticisms. At one party, wealthy patron Sir George Beaumount was scathing about Turner’s ‘blots’. Constable, perhaps hoping to toady to Beaumount, chimed in with his view that Turner’s technique was extravagant and inattentive to detail. When Constable was finally elected an Associate of the RA in 1820, after a long-fought campaign, he must have been sorely put out when one of the senior academicians took him to one side and advised him to make a study of Turner if he wanted to improve his own technique. At times, the rivalry descended into pettiness and schoolboy insults. In his new book about the 19th-century art market, A Strange Business, the art historian James Hamilton quotes a letter from the painter Francis Chantrey to Constable, asking if it was true that Constable had said that ‘Turner’s pictures are only fit to be spit upon’. If only we had Constable’s reply. Turner, for his part, could be just as childish. While making plans for a sailing trip with his friend C.R. Leslie, Turner discovered that Constable had been a guest at the house just a few days earlier and had put up the boat’s sail. Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows. John Constable's painting sold for £23.1million . ‘What does he know about ships?’ scoffed Turner. ‘This is how it ought to be.’ He immediately started untying and retying the knots on the boat, which to Leslie had looked perfectly ‘ship-shape’ as they were. When it came to the Royal Academy exhibitions, Turner had an unnerving habit of looking over the shoulders of fellow painters and suggesting alterations. You can imagine the rage Constable must have felt at Turner’s last-minute stunt with the scarlet buoy. As the two major exhibitions open, art historians and gallery visitors will again ask the question: which is the greater artist? The tempest-tossed Turner, or the romantic Constable of rainstorms and sudden sunshine? If there is one defining difference, it is this: stand in front of a painting by Constable and you are instantly cast back to late summer in the country, when the wildflowers were thirsty and toppling over in the heat and the harvested fields were as gold as ingots. Or to an afternoon walk on an October weekend when the rain cleared and the sun shone and you thought you might keep on for another mile because the light was so unexpectedly bright and clear. There is a nostalgia to Constable, who reminds you of the English landscape at its most beautiful and beckoning. With Turner, there is something else. Constable — for all his own technical verve — reminds you of the landscape as you have seen it, Turner makes you feel it then and there with blustery immediacy. A Turner painting whips you up in its storms and lashes you with its winds. The salt and spray from the waves settle on your lips, the steam and coal dust from his rattling trains make your eyes itch. And when he paints the Houses of Parliament caught in a raging fire, the heat, felt even across the Thames, even across the centuries, leaves your cheeks glowing and your skin prickling from the blaze.","The two artists were opposites in birth, looks and temperament .

"An Iowa man faces hate crime charges after allegedly ordering his pit bull to viciously attack a black man while screaming a racial slur at him. Des Moines resident Joshua Charles Stoll, 21, has been charged with assault in violation of individual rights causing injury as well as probation violation. Iowa law regards any assault in violation of individual rights as a hate crime. Joshua Charles Stoll, 21, says he was assaulted by a group of black men after he allegedly sicked his dog on one while screaming racial epithets . Though the bites are severe Pierce should recover without serious lasting injury . The Des Moines Register reports that Stoll was taken into custody after police received a report of a fight at roughly 5:30 p.m. Sunday on he 2200 block of East 41st Street. Six to eight people were standing at the scene, two of which were identified as brothers. One of those brothers, 24-year-old Kanin Pierce, had arms that had been savaged by pit bull bites. According to police, Pierce said a car stopped in his path while he was walking to his own car. Stoll, who had been driving while intoxicated, and one other man got out of the vehicle and began using racial slurs when asking him what he'd said. Pierce said he did not know the men or their reason for stopping and called for his brother. Witness Laroyia Haywood told reporters she heard Stoll yelling racial epithets. 'He was calling him the ‘n-word’ repeatedly and wouldn’t stop. They were . asking [Stoll] to leave and he wouldn’t leave,' she told KCCI. Stoll then removed his pit bull terrier from the car and allegedly said 'Sic 'em, Rider.' The dog then attacked Pierce as Stoll repeated the racial slurs. 24-year-old Kanin Pierce (right) had arms that had been savaged by pit bull bites . The men finally got the dog off of Pierce's arm, which had been severely injured. Stoll later told police he stopped because a man threw something at his car. Stoll also claimed that the men with Pierce called in reinforcements who then attacked him. X-rays later determined Stoll had a fractured rib while a breath test registered a blood alcohol level of 0.128. Stoll is being held at the Polk County Jail on $6,000 bond and the dog is in quarantine with the Animal Rescue League of Iowa. Pierce told reporters he did not blame the animal. 'It's not the dog's fault. It's really not the dog's fault,' he said. 'It's [Stoll's] fault. He should have left his dog in the car.'","Witnesses say Des Moines man Joshua Charles Stoll, 21, sicked his dog on Kanin Pierce, 24, during an altercation .

"Customers who are owed £153million by rip-off energy firms could get their money back under a scheme unveiled by the industry today. The huge sum has built up over the last six years after the energy giants held on to money paid by customers who then switched to a cheaper rival supplier. These are customers who effectively overpaid on their gas and electricity monthly direct debits and were in credit when they decided to move to a new energy firm. Scroll down for video . Ofgem, the industry has drawn up a scheme that will go some way to repaying customers who are out of pocket . The money became a windfall for the energy firms, who have been accused of deliberately dragging their feet on making efforts to make sure departing customers got their money back. Now, following pressure from the industry regulator, Ofgem, the industry has drawn up a scheme that will go some way to repaying customers who are out of pocket. In February, Ofgem called on suppliers to give customers their money back, use balances that cannot be returned to individuals in a way that would benefit consumers more widely and make sure there is no repeat of the scandal. Ofgem’s chief executive, Dermot Nolan, said repaying the money is the very least that the energy companies should do. ‘Today’s industry announcement is an encouraging first step by the six largest energy companies to address Ofgem’s call to reunite customers with their cash,’ he said. ‘This issue is part of a wider challenge of delivering good customer service that the industry must crack if they are to rebuild customer trust and confidence. ‘And while Ofgem welcomes the progress made to date, suppliers must now do everything within their powers to return the money and prevent a similar situation from happening again. Failure to deliver on the initiatives announced today could trigger further action by Ofgem, including enforcement.’ The huge sum has built up over the last six years after the energy giants held on to money paid by customers who then switched to a cheaper rival supplier . He urged the public to contact their former energy suppliers to establish whether they are owed money. Amber Rudd MP, the Minister of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘People should rightly be returned money that is theirs and was left behind when they moved house or switched. ‘Earlier this year, the Government and Ofgem announced plans to get to the bottom of problems with outstanding credit balances and an agreement was reached with the major energy companies to ensure they automatically refund direct debits to customers who are in credit.’ Energy UK, the industry trade body, has set up the website myenergycredit.com to help families track down money they are owed by its members. The group’s chief executive is Angela Knight, who previously ran the British Bankers Association, whose members have been found guilty of routinely ripping off their customers on everything from payment protection insurance to mortgages. She described the energy industry’s efforts to ensure customers get their money back as a ‘great campaign’. Miss Knight said: ‘This money has been left behind and we are urging former customers to come forward and make a claim. ‘Customers who think they haven’t left a forwarding address or a final meter reading when they moved or switched should contact their old supplier. The web site www.myenergycredit.com will help you do this. ‘Inevitably, there will be some former customers who will not be found and so the major suppliers are announcing what will happen to credit balances from now on. ‘In future, after two years, the credit balance will be used to help vulnerable customers - and suppliers will make it very clear what is happening. By 2018, these new arrangements are expected to add up to around £65 million of help to those in difficulties. The suppliers will kick start this process now by donating £38 million for the first two years combined.’ Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. Don't forget, prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"A mother of three who was left bald after spending 30 years pulling out her hair due to stress has told of how it was her 'horrible secret'. Karen Fisher, 42, from Broadstairs, Kent, allowed her family and friends to believe that alopecia was the cause of her severe hair loss. But instead, she was actually suffering from trichotillomania, a rare condition whereby she felt compelled to pull out her locks. Karen Fisher, 42, was left bald after spending 30 years pulling out her hair due to a rare condition caused by stress. Above, Mrs Fisher is pictured today with shorter hair (left) and with a large bald patch in 2007 (right) Mrs Fisher, pictured with her two daughters, now wears her short hair tied up to prevent her from pulling it . Now,  she has finally revealed the truth behind her baldness - and is speaking out in a bid to help others deal with the condition. Mrs Fisher, who still suffers from trichotillomania but is receiving professional help, said: 'I’ve lived with trichotillomania for more than 30 years and it isn’t my dirty secret any more. 'If people ask me about my bald patch now I tell them truth. I’m not proud that trichotillomania is a part of my life, but it doesn’t mean that I’m not proud of who I am and I won’t let this condition change that.’ Mrs Fisher, a florist, first began pulling her hair out at school aged 13 to cope with stress. She said she felt a 'sense of relief' after tugging hairs from the centre of her scalp - something she continued to do every time she felt anxious. By the time she was 15, she had a bald patch on her scalp the size of a 50 pence piece. Treatment: Mrs Fisher, from Broadstairs, Kent, allowed her family and friends to believe that alopecia was the cause of her hair loss. Above, she is seen having a hair weave attached to her scalp to cover the bald patch . More confident: The florist suffers from trichotillomania, a condition whereby she feels compelled to pull out her locks. Above, Mrs Fisher is pictured having the weave done (left) and after, with a full head of hair (right) Mrs Fisher's mother took her to the doctor, who diagnosed her hair loss as likely alopecia. But at the time, the teenager was too embarrassed to reveal the truth. When she met her future husband Del in a pub, Mrs Fisher told him the same story to explain her bald patch. The couple married in August 1993 and had their first daughter Nevada two years later. Exhausted from tending to her newborn Mrs Fisher noticed she had stopped pulling out her hair, but when the baby started to settle and sleep though she began tugging at it again. The couple's second daughter Arizona was born in December 1997, followed by their son Memphis in September 2005. Over the following years, Mrs Fisher went to great lengths to hide her condition, burying hair she had pulled out under rubbish in the bin. Couple: When she met her future husband Del in a pub, Mrs Fisher told him she had alopecia. Above, the couple . Only when she read an article about trichotillomania did she realise she was suffering with the condition. 'Until then I didn’t even know it had a name,' she said. 'It was my horrible secret.’ Mrs Fisher said she contacted NHS direct, who urged her to see her GP, but she remained too ashamed to do so . 'I was just relieved to know there were others out there even though I didn’t yet have the confidence to seek help,' she said. But as time passed, she began pulling her hair our more frequently and by 2007, the bald patch on the top of her head was so big she resembled, she said, a 'medieval monk'. Only when she read an article about trichotillomania did Mrs Fisher realise she was suffering with the condition . Tattoo: With her 40th birthday approaching, she decided to have a tattoo of the medical diagnostic code of her condition on her wrist along with the words: ‘You don’t define me' (left). She later shaved off her hair (right) Attempts to style her hair with hairpieces failed so she began wearing a hat to hide the pink skin. It was only months later, while chatting to a friend, that Mrs Fisher suddenly admitted for the first time the truth behind her bald patch. She said: ‘I just blurted it out. I waited for my friend to look shocked and horrified, but instead she just asked me why I did it and how it felt. ‘It felt wonderful to finally tell somebody the truth and I realised I had to tell my family.’ Mrs Fisher said her husband was disappointed she had not confided in him sooner but understood her reluctance to do so, while her close friends also rallied round in support. Brave: Mrs Fisher, who is still suffering from the condition but is receiving help, said: 'The more this is talked about the less stigma and taboo there will be' With her secret out, she began looking for professional help and contacted a clinic that specialised in helping people with the condition by attaching a hair weave to the scalp to cover the bald patch. In October 2010, Mrs Fisher went to the Hair Solve clinic in Barnet, London and left with a full head of hair. 'It felt fantastic not to have to try and cover my bald spot. I could walk out in a breeze without worrying it was going to be exposed,' she said. Mrs Fisher said that the weave also prevented her from accessing the hair underneath the weave, meaning she had no urge to pull it. She returned for treatment every six weeks and by August 2011, 96 per cent of Mrs Fisher's hair had grown back. With her 40th birthday approaching, she decided to have a tattoo of the medical diagnostic code of her condition on her wrist along with the words: ‘You don’t define me'. She hoped it would help stop her from pulling her hair when she saw it. But the urges grew stronger and eventually she started again and by December last year her scalp was once again visible. Finally, Mrs Fisher decided to shave all her hair off in a bid to fight the temptation to pull and turn the tables on her condition, which she described as 'not very well understood'. 'It is a constant battle for me. But the more this is talked about the less stigma and taboo there will be attached to it making it easier for others,' she said. ‘I have found a brilliant community of online support and we all agree that educating people about trichotillomania is the best way to help those living with this secret. ‘This disorder can have crippling effects on individuals and there needs to be better understanding and support.’ For more information and support, visit www.trich.org.","Karen Fisher, 42, allowed relatives and friends to believe she had alopecia .

With opinion polls suggesting the referendum is now too close to call, Mr Salmond dismissed Westminster’s promises about more powers. ‘This is the day the No campaign finally disintegrated and fell apart at the seams,’ the first minister said. ‘Together, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are the most distrusted Westminster politicians ever – and their collective presence in Scotland will be another massive boost for the Yes campaign. ‘The message of this extraordinary, last-minute reaction is that the Westminster elite are in a state of absolute panic as the ground in Scotland shifts under their feet.’ Anger: Alex Salmond prompted ridicule by comparing the vote to South Africa's elections after Apartheid . Disarray: The first attempt to raise the Scottish flag above Number 10 failed - on live TV. After starting to be hoisted the workers were watched on as it fluttered back down due to an ill-fitting attachment yesterday . The Saltire, was finally raised above No 10  as Westminster politicians headed north to try and save the Union . There were also reports that the First Minister had made provocative remarks about his threat to default on Scotland’s share of the UK’s national debt if the pound was not shared. Sources close to the Scottish leader told ITV News he had exclaimed: ‘What are they going to do? Invade?’ In a desperate bid to halt the momentum of the campaign for independence, Mr Brown this week returned to frontline politics to propose a rapid timetable to give the Scottish Parliament greater control over finance, welfare and taxation. He said yesterday: ‘This proposal means faster change, fairer change, safer change and better change. Faster change because these powers can be in place very quickly.The major pro-devolution parties have told me they agree with that timetable.’ The Prime Minister had not planned to be in Scotland until early next week, when he is expected to make another visit. Our Union is precious. Don't tear it apart . By PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON . As the people of Scotland put pen to ballot paper next week, you will be writing the UK’s future in indelible ink. It’s a momentous decision: there will be no going back. That is why the main party leaders – Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and I – have agreed the right place for us to be today is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister’s Questions in Westminster. There is a lot that divides us, but there’s one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together. At this crucial moment, we want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face. Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: ‘We want you to stay.’ It’s difficult to put into words what our United Kingdom represents. This is the group of small islands in the North Atlantic that have punched above our weight for centuries – and we’ve done so together. Dramatic: The 'Yes' vote took a surge in the last few days and the two sides are now roughly neck-and-neck . When the world wanted representation, we gave them democracy. When they wanted progress, we had the Scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution. When slavery bound innocent people, we abolished it; when fascism threatened freedom, we defeated it. A hundred years ago, our boys went off to war together – and they did so as comrades, united by purpose and hope for a better world. As individuals and as nations, we have done extraordinary things. This is the special alchemy of the UK – you mix together Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland and together we smash expectations. And that’s just as true today as it’s ever been. Together we ensure that the sick are cared for in our NHS; that no one has to reach for their credit card to get decent medical help. Together we ensure dignity and security for our elderly, with a pension system that we all pay into, from Land’s End to John O’Groats. Together, the United Kingdom embodies the values that the world looks on with awe and envy. Just because our countries are great together, that does not mean we cannot be even better. That is why a No vote doesn’t mean a vote for the status quo – No doesn’t mean no change. It means significant further devolution for Scotland – major new powers over tax, spending and welfare all being passed to Scotland. This is not about Scotland versus the rest of the United Kingdom. It is about two competing visions of Scotland’s future. This week, the No campaign set out more detail on this. Power for Scotland over how much money it borrows, what taxes it raises, how it spends that money – all agreed by November, all put into draft legislation by January. This is the package that Gordon Brown outlined on Monday. It is one I wholeheartedly support. Because we know that brighter future for Scotland rests not only on staying in the UK, but also on having significant new powers. This is the sort of clarity you need as you make this decision, knowing how it will affect your life, your job, the security of your country, the money in your pocket – especially when you’re not just making this decision for yourself, but for your children, your grandchildren, and their children too. Big plans: Power for Scotland over how much money it borrows, what taxes it raises, how it spends that money - all will be agreed, and all were in the package which former PM Gordon Brown (pictured) outlined this week . United front: Liverpool City Council leader Joe Anderson and Labour's Ed Miliband raised a Saltire yesterday . With this timetable, we are giving people that clarity, showing that by voting No, Scotland gets the best of both worlds: power over the policies that matter, and the stability of the United Kingdom; the freedom to chart its own destiny, and the support of three other nations; the reputation in the world as a successful nation, and the clout of a world-renowned union. But where we offer clarity, those who support separation offer only question marks. Just eight days away from the referendum, they are still unclear on what money Scotland could use without the pound sterling. The plan for Scotland to enter the EU is a blank page. The formula for filling the public services funding deficit is a blank space. While a Yes vote may be a lucky dip, a No vote is a guaranteed win for anyone who wants a stronger, more autonomous Scotland. The United Kingdom is a precious and special country. That is what is at stake. So let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart. Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together. If we pull together, we can keep on building a better future for our children. We can make sure our destiny matches our history, because there really will be no second chances. If the UK breaks apart, it breaks apart forever. So the choice for you is clear: a leap into the dark with a Yes vote, or a brighter future for Scotland by voting No. You can have the best of both worlds in the UK. You can have more powers in Scotland. And you can be part of a United Kingdom – standing tall, forging a more secure future in this world, building more opportunities for our children and grandchildren and the generations yet to be born. That is the next chapter in our history; we can write it together – but only if Scotland votes No next week.","EXCLUSIVE: PM issues rallying cry for the 'special alchemy of the UK'

"A coroner has accused a council of ‘gross failings’ after a housebound pensioner with dementia died when she was left without food and medication for nine days. Social workers did ‘absolutely nothing’ to help Gloria Foster, 81, after the care agency which visited her four times a day was shut down by immigration officers. An inquest heard that council staff failed to find replacement carers because they assumed Mrs Foster would do it herself because she was well-off enough to fund her own care. Ann Penston(left), a friend of Gloria Foster (right) who was left to starve  for nine days after the council-contracted agency supplying her with care was shut down by immigration police . In fact, Mrs Foster was never told that her care provider, Carefirst24, had been closed down by the UK Border Agency. Eventually a nurse visited her home to carry out a pre-scheduled blood test in January last year, and found Mrs Foster suffering from dehydration, starvation and bed sores. She died 11 days later at Epsom Hospital, in Surrey. Yesterday, Richard Travers, senior coroner for Surrey, said the case was a ‘grave indictment’ of Surrey County Council’s adult services department. ‘The failure to provide even the most basic needs can be regarded as a gross failure,’ he added. Gloria Foster as a young woman (left) and as a pensioner (right). An inquest heard that council staff failed to find replacement carers because they assumed Mrs Foster would do it herself . Mr Travers said he intended to send his report to the Care Quality Commission and to write to the council’s chief executive with concerns about staff training and communication procedures. Concluding that Mrs Foster died of ‘natural causes contributed by neglect’, he said: ‘The council ought to have known here was a woman in receipt of care four times a day which naturally included night time care. Gloria Foster (left) was left for nine days after the council-contracted agency supplying her with care was shut down by immigration police. She died in Epsom Hospital in February . ‘What is plain is absolutely nothing was done about providing Mrs Foster with alternative care. The gross failure to provide Mrs Foster with the care she required during that period contributed to her death.’ The task of finding replacement care for Mrs Foster and other Carefirst24 customers fell to social worker Elizabeth Egan, who left the inquest in Woking in floods of tears yesterday. She told the coroner last week she was struggling to cope with her workload at the time and was suffering from ‘burn out’. She admitted she had ‘failed’ Mrs Foster. The inquest heard Mrs Egan told senior managers ‘everything was in hand’, yet Mr Travers ruled in his closing remarks that there had been no ‘balances and checks’ to ensure Mrs Foster had been catered for. He said there was a ‘general assumption’ that those who fund their own care would make their own arrangements. In 1967 Gloria married Shell accountant Bob Foster, but just four years later, he was killed in a motor accident in Saudi Arabia. Mrs Foster, from Banstead, Surrey, never remarried or had children . After the verdict was delivered, Mrs Foster’s friend Ann Penston said of Mrs Egan: ‘Social workers are caring people. She has to live with that mistake. I do not have any animosity towards her.’ The council has already implemented new protocols following a Serious Case Review. A spokesman said: ‘We would again like to say how sorry we are for our failure to help Gloria Foster get the support she needed. We should have done more and we completely accept that. ‘While we have already made changes we’ll continue to do all we can to prevent anything like this happening again.’ Keen golfer Mrs Foster was described as ‘glamorous and vivacious’ by friends. Her father was an Army officer in India, and she went to an English private school. After her family moved back to Britain in 1947, she became a secretary for oil company Shell. In 1967 she married Shell accountant Bob Foster, but just four years later, he was killed in a motor accident in Saudi Arabia. Mrs Foster, from Banstead, Surrey, never remarried or had children.

"Interim chief executive Kim Hodgson received up to £95,000 for two-and-a-half months' work . A temporary NHS boss was paid more than £1,000 a day when she was parachuted in to help a health trust. Interim chief executive Kim Hodgson received up to £95,000 for just two-and-a-half months’ work. This is equivalent to £450,000 a year – or more than three times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary. Temporary finance boss Ian O’Connor was handed as much as £50,000 for 56 days, which works out at more than £358,000 annually. The fat cat pay packets were paid by Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Colchester General Hospital and Essex County Hospital. It was put into special measures following a damning report by the Care Quality Commission last November. Details emerged in the trust’s annual report, which showed wages for senior staff took up 12.7 per cent of the wage bill between April 2013 and the end of March this year, helping to push it £2.4 million into the red. Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell said no hospital chief executive should be paid more than the Prime Minister. ‘It calls into question the whole stewardship of the NHS,’ he added. ‘What message does that send out to the hard-working medical and support staff who have been let down by the management and are then being told someone who has come in to a managerial role has been paid that huge sum of money?’ Karen Webb, of the Royal College of Nursing, added: ‘Colchester has been through a very difficult, challenging period and there is a need for experienced executive directors to help guide a trust through that process. ‘But that said, hard-working and dedicated nurses will be appalled at the scale of the pay that interim executives receive. ‘It won’t be lost on nursing staff that it comes at a time when the Government has refused to pay nurses the one per cent pay rise.’ The average NHS nurse is paid £23,038 per year. Former trust governor Des McCarron warned ‘having all these interim people’ was not good for the organisation. Temporary finance boss Ian O’Connor, left, was handed as much as £50,000 for 56 days. The large pay packets came after Dr Gordon Coutts, right, stepped down as chief executive the day before a damning Care Quality Commission report was published about the Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust . Miss Hodgson replaced Dr Gordon Coutts, who resigned as chief executive the day before the CQC report was published. It revealed cancer staff had been bullied into falsifying patient data. The trust’s financial report showed he had received up to £145,000 for the nine months to December 31. Miss Hodgson’s pay scale meant she received between £90,000 and £95,000 from January 13 to March 31. She remained in her role until May when she was replaced by Dr Lucy Moore – suggesting she received around £180,000 for the four-month period. Colchester General Hospital, pictured above, was put into special measures last November after the CQC report said cancer staff had been bullied into falsifying patient data . Mr O’Connor - who earned between £50,000 and £55,000 from February 3 to March 31 - held his post until July, when he moved to a similar position at Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The huge remuneration packages will fuel the debate over public sector pay. Thousands of senior staff, including headteachers, council bosses, quangocrats and civil servants, are paid more than the Prime Minister. Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said using interim staff saved on benefits permanent staff are entitled to, such as pension contributions and paid holiday leave. It added: ‘These individuals were available at relatively short notice and each was highly qualified with the appropriate skills and experience for these posts, which are extremely demanding and challenging.’ A report published in November 2013 by healthcare watchdog the Care Quality Commission suggested officials falsified data to make it look as if crucial cancer treatment targets were met. The CQC said the records of 22 cancer patients had been changed to cover up the fact they had faced ‘extensive’ delays for treatment – which could have put their lives at risk. It found that at least three of the patients waited more than 100 days for treatment, including one who waited 126 days. Government guidelines state patients should wait no longer than 31 days for surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy after their doctor has decided on the best course of treatment. When hospitals are unable to treat patients within the target timeframe they have a duty to investigate and offer alternative hospitals. The investigation also found that staff had been ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to change figures on cancer waiting times to meet government targets. The CQC spoke to three staff members who were asked by bosses to change waiting times figures. After the report was published, NHS England launched a probe involving the files of as many as 25,000 cancer sufferers who had undergone treatment at the hospital in the past three years. Essex Police also confirmed a criminal investigation would begin into the alleged manipulation of cancer waiting lists. One patient, four-year-old Mackenzie Cackett, died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at Colchester General Hospital. Two months before Mackenzie died, a touching picture was taken of him with the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited him in a nearby hospice. Although Mackenzie is not one of the patients identified in the report, the hospital launched a separate investigation into his death over concerns ‘administrative errors’ led to delays in diagnosis and treatment. In December last year, it emerged that Dr Gordon Coutts, who was on sick leave, would not return to the trust by ‘mutual agreement’. A trust spokesman said Dr Coutts, who served as chief executive for three years, would not get any payoff and would not be receiving further salary payments. Every year, around 6,000 people are treated by Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust for cancer.","Kim Hodgson paid up to £95,000 for just two-and-a-half months' work .

"The Dalai Lama has said he should be the last Tibetan spiritual leader, as a weak successor would only disgrace the position. He told a German newspaper that the centuries-old religious tradition should finish with a 'popular' Dalai Lama. He has previously said that 'the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose'. The Dalai Lama has said he should be the last Tibetan spiritual leader, as a weak successor would disgrace the position . In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper he said: 'We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries. 'The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular. Let us then finish with a popular Dalai Lama.' 'If a weak Dalai Lama comes along, then it will just disgrace the Dalai Lama,' he added with a laugh, according to a transcript of the English language interview. He also said: 'Tibetan Buddhism is not dependent on one individual. We have a very good organisational structure with highly trained monks and scholars.' China has governed Tibet since 1951, a year after invading, and the Dalai Lama fled across the Himalayas to India after a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama and his 13 predecessors have wielded political and religious power over Tibetans for hundreds of years. Each dead Dalai Lama has been thought to be reincarnated in the body of a male child. He told a German newspaper that the centuries-old religious tradition should finish with a 'popular' Dalai Lama . The Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2011 retired from political duties and has upgraded the role of prime minister of the Tibetan exile community. Though he remains the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, his decision to abdicate as political leader was one of the biggest upheavals for the community since a Chinese crackdown led him to flee Tibet in 1959 into exile in India. But he is still the most powerful rallying point for Tibetans, both in exile and in their homeland, and remains the universally recognised face of the movement. Asked by the German newspaper how much longer he may carry on his advocacy duties, the 79-year-old said: 'The doctors say I could become 100 years old. But in my dreams I will die at the age of 113 years. 'I hope and pray that I may return to this world as long as sentient beings' suffering remains. I mean not in the same body, but with the same spirit and the same soul.' On the question of whether he may ever be able to return to Tibet, he said: 'Yes, I am sure of that. China can no longer isolate itself, it must follow the global trend towards a democratic society.'","Said centuries-old religious tradition should finish with 'popular' Dalai Lama .

"It's a good yarn that's certainly one to be re-told by pro skier turned sheep rescuer Pete Oswald. The 29-year-old was on Hector Mountain, south of New Zealand's South Island, when he noticed 'a little bundle of wool' snowballing down the slopes which then landed 100 metres away from him. The New Zealand native skied over to the ewe to discover that it was bleeding from its nose. And so began his rescue mission. Pete Oswald rescues a 40kg sheep stranded high up in the snowy mountains in New Zealand . The 29-year-old was on location for a photo shoot when he noticed 'a little bundle of wool' snowballing down the mountains . The semi-pro skier says it was a difficult ride down and he nearly fell over a few times . 'It was trying to walk but was totally exhausted. It wouldn't have survived if I had left it there,' he told The Marlborough Express. The sheep was fine when it reached flat grassy land . He was with photographer Dan Power, setting up for their last day photo shoots, when a piece of snow fell on Oswald's ski boots. He glanced over and noticed the sheep sliding down the slopes. Seeing that the animal was injured, he lifted its 40kg body weight and held it by its legs as he skied down slowly to safety. 'It was really hard to ski, there was a lot of wool in my face when I carried it,' he said. It was a challenging ride down for Oswald, who says he nearly fell over a number of times before they reached grassy. After a good feed, the sheep went on its way - seemingly untroubled by its potentially near death experience. Oswald is not stranger to the woolly mammal as he grew up on a sheep farm in Marlborough - northeast of the South Island. He began skiing at five-years-old and is now a semi-professional skier. He is also a cinematographer based in Austria. Oswald told The Marlborough Express he has come across mountain goats, marmots and bears whilst on skiing trips but the sheep by far is the best.

"Ashya King has today made his first visit to the  Proton Therapy Centre in the Czech Republic where he is expected to receive the pioneering treatment that prompted the legal wrangle over his care. With his parents by his side, the five-year-old was taken to the centre in Prague today for his first tests as doctors prepare him for the treatment for his brain tumour. The little boy was yesterday flown to Prague from Spain after leaving the Materno Infantil hospital in Malaga in Spain, where he has been treated since his parents were arrested more than a week ago. Scroll down for video . Brett and Naghemeh King arrive at  the Proton Therapy Centre . with their  five-year-old son Ashya to prepare for the treatment of his brain tumour in Prague, Czech Republic.

Ashya King lies on a stretcher as he arrives with his parents at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague today . He was then admitted to University Hospital Motol in the Czech capital, while his father Brett King visited the Proton Therapy Centre Czech (PTC) to discuss the potential treatment. Ashya was pictured today as he was taken into the centre to begin examinations prior to the start of the treatment. A spokeswoman for the hospital told the Press Association: 'He will be undergoing the first MRI examination and a special mask (will be prepared) for his head. 'This will be used for fixing him in the same position during the treatment every day. 'He will be put asleep before that and he will wake up after noon.' The Kings triggered an international police pursuit when they removed Ashya from Southampton General Hospital on August 28.

The treatment room at the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague, where Ashya is expected to arrive to begin the treatment which is not available on the NHS . They were desperate for him to be given the proton therapy, which was not available to them on the NHS. Speaking after arriving in the Czech Republic, Ashya's father told Sky News they were 'just so happy to be here'. He said: 'This is what we wanted from the beginning. Things went from bad to worse at one stage. 'We just want the best for Ashya. He's got to get through this, he's got to get better.' Mr King said his son was 'a little bit depressed' when they were first reunited. 'He's building up his strength now. We are sure he can see us and he can definitely hear us,' he said. Parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 45, were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a High Court judge to allow Ashya to undergo proton therapy in Eastern Europe . 'I am sure they are going to give him the best treatment. We just hope for the best for him.' The Proton Therapy Centre arranged for a private Cessna Citation Mustang jet fitted with medical equipment to transport the young patient from Spain. In an earlier statement yesterday, the clinic said: 'In late afternoon today, Proton Therapy Centre Czech is expecting a visit by Mr Brett King, Ashya's father. 'Mr King will be shown the facility, he will be introduced to the process of treatment and to a team of the attending physicians and physicists.' Ashya will undergo tests ahead of the possible proton treatment next week, according to reports. It is expected to last for around five weeks, with Ashya staying at Motol hospital and travelling to the Proton Therapy Centre each day. The High Court judge who approved Ashya's transfer to Prague made no criticism of anyone involved in the saga. The family travelled on a private jet from Malaga to Prague after being released from prison where they spent 72 hours . Mr Justice Baker said there had been reason to believe that Ashya was at risk when his parents took him from the hospital in Southampton. He said social workers had been justified in asking the High Court to take responsibility for the youngster. And he said any parents in Mr and Mrs King's position would have wanted to explore all options. 'The local authority acted corrected in applying to the High Court,' said Mr Justice Baker. 'There were reasonable grounds for believing that Ashya was at risk of significant harm. 'A week later the picture had changed that the court was faced with a completely different decision.' He added: 'Any parents in the position of Mr and Mrs King would do whatever they could to explore all options.' An ambulance carrying the child arrives at the centre where Ashya's treatment is expected to cost £70,000 . Mr Justice Baker was speaking as he outlined his reasons for allowing Ashya to travel to Prague - at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. He said he 'made no comment' about the decision to issue a European arrest warrant - a move which led to Mr and Mrs King being held in custody in Spain and separated from their son. He said he 'merely observed' that 'whatever the rights and wrongs', it had not been in Ashya's interests to be separated from his parents. The judge said he hoped Ashya made a good recovery and sent his best wishes to his 'loving parents'. He said Asyha's arrival in Prague meant he was no longer a ward of the English High Court. Ashya hit the headlines after his parents took him from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without the permission of doctors. They were arrested and held in custody in Spain after British police raised the alarm. They were released when prosecutors withdrew an arrest warrant in the wake of a public outcry.","Ashya King taken for pre-treatment examinations at Proton Therapy Centre .

"Most brides-to-be pick a cute niece or a friend's angelic daughter to scatter rose petals as she walks down the aisle at her wedding. But Michigan bride  Laura VanPelt made a rather less traditional choice for her flower girl at her nuptials last weekend.

'I thought she was kidding, of course. 'But then she said: ""No, grandma, I'm not. I want you to be my flower girl"".' The grandma walked down the aisle carrying her cane - which was wrapped in lace for the occasion - in one hand and a basket full of flower petals strapped over her shoulder.

"Billions were wiped off the value of Scottish companies yesterday: Lloyds lost £1.1billion of its market value in the space of a day . The pound slumped and billions were wiped off the value of Scottish companies yesterday as markets reacted to the growing risk posed by independence. Sterling slipped to a ten-month low against the dollar and also fell against the euro. It led to warnings from currency traders that the pound could continue to fall even beyond the referendum, making holidays more expensive for visitors to the US and Europe and inflating the cost of imports. Concern about the potential end of the Union also sparked a sale of shares in FTSE firms based in Scotland or with strong ties there, resulting in a combined £2.5billion fall in their value. Banks, which have warned that independence could have a significant impact on their future, were worst hit. Lloyds lost £1.1billion of its market value in the space of a day, amid fears that Scottish independence could add to its costs. It is considering moving its registered office from Edinburgh to London in the event of a victory for nationalists, it emerged last week. Shares in TSB, which is owned by Lloyds and does a quarter of its mortgage lending north of the border, also fell. And Royal Bank of Scotland, still 79 per cent owned by the British taxpayer, saw £284million wiped off its share value by the end of the day. It also emerged that some businesses and consumers in Scotland have started moving bank deposits to England. WedoScotland, a support organisation for 164 business owners, said: ‘Some of our members have moved their bank accounts to England. Some are looking at registering their businesses in England if independence goes through.’ The slump in the shares of RBS and Lloyds and the complications of moving corporate offices from Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively in the case of a ‘yes’ vote will almost certainly mean UK taxpayers will have to wait even longer to see the return of the billions pumped into the failed banks. Among high-profile victims of the fall in value of Scottish firms yesterday were power supplier SSE and defence company BAE Systems. Other companies likely to be most affected by a Yes vote include Diageo, the dominant Scotch whisky distiller. It is one of Britain’s biggest exporters but has no choice but to remain in Scotland. It would need to renegotiate trade agreements with its customers overseas as well as new arrangements for the collection of excise duties. British companies with relatively few Scottish ties performed better in the markets, triggering warnings that Scotland would be harder hit than the rest of the UK by independence. Professor Roy Batchelor of the Cass Business School in London: ‘The risks to the UK are trivial compared to those triggered in Scotland by the likely flight of capital and business talent if the Yes campaign wins.’ The Scottish share sell-off comes just a fortnight after 130 business leaders signed a letter warning of the consequences of independence. Economists have warned that a Yes vote would trigger a protracted period of political negotiations that would weigh on Britain’s attractiveness to investors. And they say Scotland would be forced to lean far too heavily on the unpredictable income from North Sea oil and gas. Managers of global investment funds at Fidelity Worldwide Investment predicted that there would be a ‘strong bounce in sterling’ if there were to be a ‘no’ vote. In the case of a ‘yes’ vote ‘things would get messier’.","Lloyds lost £1.1billion of its market value in the space of a day .

"Police have found the bullies suspected of filling a bucket with faeces, urine, spittle and cigarette butts then pouring it over an  autistic teenager in a depraved twist on the Ice Bucket Challenge. The 15-year-old boy was filmed standing under a garage in his underwear before the bucket of brown slurry was tipped on his head from off-screen. The clip, filmed in Bay Village, near Cleveland, Ohio, caused an outcry when it emerged, sparking appeals to track down those responsible. Scroll down for video . Unaware: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him . Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, faeces, saliva and cigarette butts . And now police in the area say they have identified almost everyone responsible and are poised to hand over a dossier of evidence to local prosecutors. Mark Spaetzel, a police chief in Bay Village, confirmed that his officers had tracked down the culprits in a statement to Cleveland.com. He added: 'We are being very thorough in gathering all the necessary facts before presenting to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.' Cyber-bullying: The teen's tormentors used his cell phone to record the prank and upload it onto Instagram . The clip was filmed on the boy's own mobile phone and then posted to the Instagram social network. According to the boy's mother, who gave her name only as Diane so as to protect her son's identity, the victim was so embarrassed by the cruel prank that he wanted to keep it a secret. But when his family discovered the clip, they decided to share it more widely to raise awareness of how he had been bullied. Horrified: The 15-year-old's mother, Diane, later discovered the shocking video on her son's phone . Furious: The boy's parents and his older brother (centre) now want the bullies responsible for the sickening bucket challege held accountable for their actions . Diane told the Fox8 news station that the bullies had perverted the charitable aims of the Ice Bucket Challenge - which is meant to raise cash and awareness for ALS, a muscle-wasting disease. She said: 'The bucket challenge is supposed to be raising awareness for this disease and now they’ve turned it into a sick joke. I just can’t understand why kids would do something this cruel.’ The hunt for the culprits also caught the attention of several American celebrities. Actress and model Jenny McCarthy offered $10,000 as a reward for information leading to the bullies' prosecution, as did gameshow host Drew Carey. However, Bay Village politely declined the offer, pointing out that a reward was not necessary as the culprits have already been found.","Foul mixture was dumped on unsuspecting boy, 15, in Bay Village, Ohio .

"Pressure: Shaun Wright is facing calls from many, including David Cameron,  to resign from his current post running South Yorkshire police . The police and crime commissioner at the centre of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal faces a showdown with MPs today amid claims he ignored the plight of victims who turned to him for help. The account of another abuse victim increased the pressure on Shaun Wright, who was the councillor in charge of children’s services for five years before being elected to run the police in South Yorkshire. Yesterday Martin Kimber, Rotherham council’s chief executive announced he was quitting his £160,000 a year job in December ‘to enable the town to recover’ under new leadership. Mr Kimber, who joined the authority in 2009, made the decision two weeks after Professor Alexis Jay’s report revealed how failures by agencies left 1,400 youngsters open to sexual exploitation by predominantly Asian men over a 16-year period. The council’s Labour leader Roger Stone quit his position when the report was published. The Prime Minister has led calls for Mr Wright to go, but he has stubbornly refused to quit his £85,000 a year job and is due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee today. The latest allegations come from an abuse victim who said he had been given detailed accounts of the shocking crimes in face-to-face meetings with victims more than eight years ago. The sex-grooming victim told the Times: ‘He seemed genuinely shocked. He talked like he was going to go away and see that something was done, but we never saw him again. It was the end of it for him, but not for us. ‘I sat two feet from him and told him really, really private things. I don’t know how he can go on national television and say he wasn’t aware, that he didn’ t know anything about it. For years they had all the reports and information, but they just ignored it.’ Previously Mr Wright said he was aware child exploitation was happening in Rotherham, but he didn’t realise it was taking place on an ‘industrial scale.’ He also admitted meeting victims and became ‘more aware that there was a problem.’ Mr Wright has been keeping a low-profile since the fallout over Professor Jay’s report led to widespread calls for his resignation. Resigned: Yesterday Martin Kimber (above), Rotherham council’s chief executive, announced he was quitting his £160,000 a year job in December 'to enable the town to recover' under new leadership . He is to give evidence at the House of Commons along with Chief Constable David Crompton and Rotherham’s social services boss Joyce Thacker, who have also been widely criticised. Meanwhile, chief executive Mr Kimber announced his decision to stand down in a statement, repeating his previous admission that the report ‘does not make comfortable reading.’ ‘I would like to reiterate my sincere apology to those who were let down when they needed help,’ he said. PCC Shaun Wright will be quizzed by MPs over allegations he failed to help sex abuse victims in Rotherham . ‘The events of the past fortnight will again have been an incredibly traumatic time for them and their families, and have shaken the town as a whole. ‘The council has now decided what it must do to give the best possible protection for the children and young people of Rotherham. I believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks, and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery. The time is therefore now right for me to leave.’","Shaun Wright was councillor in charge of children’s services for five years .

Ms Stevens said the six firefighters looped a large strap around the horse, before 'manually encouraging him up the steep bank'. She added: 'It was a bit hairy at times and a lot of brute force was needed to reign him in, but eventually we got him to safety, much to the relief of his concerned owner.

"A fraudster who forged the signatures of notable British figures scammed more than £33,000 out of collectors and enthusiasts by claiming they were real. Allan Formhals, 68, lived a 'criminal lifestyle' by selling books that he said were signed by top historical and literary names such as Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Winston Churchill, Southampton Crown Court heard.

"A British adventurer is planning to spend an entire year living on the tip of an iceberg off the coast of Greenland. Explorer Alex Bellini hopes to stay on the iceberg for up to a year so long as it does not melt too quickly. His stay will begin in spring 2015 and will take place North West of Greenland. Scroll down for video . Alex Bellini plans to spend a year living on an iceberg and says finding the right one will be an adventure in itself . He hopes to identify an iceberg to live on that is flat and measures 60metres long by 20metres wide . Due to icebergs' varying lengths of existence, Mr Bellini and his team are yet to identify the exact iceberg on which he will live. They will also examine other survival factors, such as how the 36-year-old will gather or store food and the water he will be drinking. Mr Bellini's previous feats include running more than 14,000 miles, rowing more than 21,000 miles and spending 560 days in isolation. He has rowed both the Atlantic and Pacific and insists he favours challenges where there is a perceived lack of control. His latest venture was inspired by Italian pilot Umberto Nobile who in 1928 flew over the North Pole. Mr Bellini says he is aware of the risks involved but is confident he will be home in 12 months' time . But on his return his airship crashed leaving 11 individuals stranded on ice for 40 days. Mr Bellini said: 'This adventure will force me to survive and teach me important lessons about this issue. 'Finding the right iceberg - size, shape, position and safety - will be an adventure itself as well as minimising the risk.' While he has not yet identified the exact iceberg which will become his new home, he knows he will require one that is flat and is approximately 60metres long and 20metres wide. Mr Bellini's previous adventures include spending 560 days in isolation and running more than 14,000 miles . He said: 'There is no way to predict the date which the iceberg will have completely melted - it depends on many factors. 'The iceberg we choose could be either a new one or an old one, carved in the past, but whatever happens, after 12 months I'll be back home.' Should the iceberg melt to a size that is too small to continue accommodating him, he'll use his shelter as a life raft to go adrift and await rescue by a passing ship - which he expects to take seven to 10 days.","Alex Bellini plans to live on an iceberg off the coast of Greenland for a year .

"Shamed South Yorkshire crime tsar Shaun Wright holds a key role in tackling child abuse across Britain, it emerged last night. MPs said it was an ‘outrage’ that the man at the centre of the Rotherham abuse scandal sits on a Home Office panel on behalf of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners. He was appointed as Labour’s representative to the national group on sexual violence against children and vulnerable people and has still not quit – despite resigning the party whip. The news came in evidence to the home affairs committee, which is investigating how failures left 1,400 youngsters open to horrific abuse by predominantly Asian men. Scroll down for video . Defiant: Shaun Wright was appointed as Labour’s representative to the national group on sexual violence against children and vulnerable people. He has still not quit over the Rotherham child abuse scandal . Before being elected South Yorkshire PCC in 2012, Mr Wright was Rotherham’s councillor in charge of children’s services for five years. MPs said Mr Wright – who refuses to resign from his £85,000-a-year post – was ‘clinging on against almost unanimous opposition’ and was ‘not fit to hold office’. Mr Wright said it would be the ‘easy option’ to step down, but insisted he was doing a ‘good job’. Incredibly, he then revealed his key role dealing with child abuse in the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners. Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘Is that not an outrage? Is it not a disgrace that you are currently responsible for the sort of area we are investigating?’ Tory MP Michael Ellis called Wright's appointment 'an outrage', adding: 'Is it not a disgrace that you are currently responsible for the sort of area we are investigating?' Professor Alexis Jay’s report on how 1,400 children were exploited led to national fury. Rotherham council’s Labour leader, Roger Stone, resigned. On Monday, chief executive Martin Kimber said he will quit in December. But Mr Wright refuses to go – and current rules do not allow for his removal. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the law should be changed. Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘You are a busted flush, a dead PCC walking... I’ve been an MP for more than 20 years and you are the least credible witness I’ve come across. You are a charlatan, in love with office and the salary.’ MPs also urged Joyce Thacker, the head of Rotherham’s children’s services, to resign. They said she had failed to take responsibility for the scandal. Mr Kimber and Miss Thacker came under fire for using public money to prevent a journalist from reporting the abuse. Applause broke out in the public gallery as MPs said the Press had done more to expose the problem than officials. Unusually, the committee made witnesses give evidence on oath. Former South Yorkshire chief constable Merredyd Hughes said he had ‘no idea’ the abuse was going on and was ‘embarrassed’. He told MPs: ‘I have had a 32-year police career and, yet on this issue I have signally failed the victims of these criminals and it hurts.’ A Home Office researcher who wrote a 2002 report into sexual abuse in Rotherham said two police officers had threatened to give her details to grooming gangs. She has also said that evidence used in her report, which was ignored by officials, was taken from her office.","Shaun Wright was appointed as Labour’s representative to the national group on sexual violence against children and vulnerable people .

Pop star Pixie Lott, 23, is one of the most experienced, having trained in dance for eight years as a child at the elite Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London. Even before she joined the academy on a scholarship aged 11, she went to nightly dance lessons after school and learned to tap dance. Two years ago, she told an interviewer: ‘I had a double bedroom, which was decorated like a ballet studio. I loved dancing, so there were mirrors and a ballet bar on one wall. Dad even had a wooden floor laid so I could practise on my own.’ Fellow singer Frankie Bridge, 25, also benefited from rigorous dance training as a young girl. Not only was her mother a ballroom dancing coach, she was given classes at primary school and has spent much of her music career learning the choreographed moves in her pop videos. Meanwhile, presenter Caroline Flack, 34, and boy band star Simon Webbe, 36, have benefited from training on previous reality shows. Simon Webbe, who was in boy band Blue, benefited from dance training while on previous reality shows . Viewers and experts have complained some of this year’s celebrity contestants have more dance experience than others taking part, such as Judy Murray (pictured) Mr Webbe had a taster of the demands of Strictly training when he competed in the Christmas special in 2011, dancing the cha cha with professional Katya Virshilas. In 2010, Miss Flack trained with Strictly professional Kristina Rihanoff on another BBC show, called Dancing On Wheels, in which contestants were paired with dancers in wheelchairs. Finally, Casualty actress Sunetra Sarker, 41, is the daughter of a professional dancer and lists Indian dance as one of her hobbies. Some of the contestants have dismissed claims they are at unfair advantage, claiming they have not been specifically trained in ballroom dancing. Miss Lott has said her stage school training was ‘completely different’ to what she will be doing in Strictly, while Miss Flack said Dancing on Wheels was ‘more of a documentary style programme’ than a competition. However, one of the UK’s leading dance coaches told the Daily Mail that any previous experience – particularly as a child – will be a ‘significant advantage’ as the competition progresses. There is disquiet among Strictly Come Dancing fans after it emerged a third of this year's line-up of 15 contestants (pictured) have had previous dance experience . Former national dance champion Warren Bullock, who runs the Zig Zag Dance Factory said: ‘It doesn’t matter what kind of dance it is, if you’ve got any type of training it will help you do ballroom and Latin dancing. ‘Even if you only did ballet as a child, it will still have taught you how to move your body. These contestants will have a real edge over the others. If she’s been to the Italia Conti, she will have been trained to the highest level. She will be heads and shoulders over the others, especially over some of the older ones. ‘It counts for even more when you’ve been trained from a young age. That kind of dance education never leaves you’. Some viewers said it was ‘unfair’ that Strictly will pit trained dancers against complete beginners. Writing on Twitter, Hayley Douglas said: ‘Doesn’t it seem a bit unfair that Pixie Lott is competing on #strictly this year when she has ballroom dance training already.’ Luke Harrison added: ‘I’m calling frankie to win already. Seems a bit unfair to put someone in who’s been performing professionally since she was ten!’ And Tina Campbell said: ‘Has Caroline Flack got an unfair Xtra advantage?’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Ballroom dancing is a specific discipline and none of our celebrities have had enough in-depth training to give them an advantage.’","Viewers have complained that some of this year's contestants have an unfair advantage over their rivals as they have previous dance experience .

"Around seven children a day accidentally swallow liquid nicotine from e-cigarette refills, a new study has today revealed . Around seven children a day accidentally swallow liquid nicotine from e-cigarette refills, a new study has found. Toddlers and young children are at risk of dying if poisoned by the refill cartridges, unless designs and safety rules are changed, doctors have today warned. Severe nicotine poisoning can cause dangerous irregular heartbeat, coma, convulsions, confusion and dizziness as well as prompting the heart to stop pumping blood around the body causing cardiac arrest. Nicotine can be lethal in adults at doses as low as 40 mg, with the threshold for children likely to be much lower at around 1mg per kg of weight. Yet nicotine cartridge refills are available in various strengths, ranging from 6 mg/l (0.6 per cent) to 36 mg/l (3.6 per cent), and at the higher strength, just a few drops could have serious side effects in a child under five. The warning came after a toddler was rushed to casualty at the Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham and nearly dying after swallowing nicotine from a device. The two-year-old vomited after picking up a cartridge containing the chemical and putting it in her mouth. The child was given the all-clear after being monitored for several hours. Figures released by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this year showed a 'massive rise' in calls to poison centres related to accidental swallowing of liquid nicotine contained in e-cigarette refill cartridges. These rose from one in September 2010 to 215 a month by February 2014 with more than half the calls involved children under the age of five. Dr Sanjay Gupta, who treated the child at Good Hope in March, urged parents to be careful with the refills. He also called for more legislation around the safety of e-cigarettes, in a letter to publication Archives of Disease in Childhood. The consultant said: 'Our case highlights an important emerging issue related to the use of increasingly popular e-cigarettes. 'The exploratory nature of young children and the attractive packaging of refills is a dangerous combination likely to lead to a growing incidence of accidental exposure to concentrated nicotine solution. 'We don't want to see children die from this, but there is a possibility that they could depending on the concentration of the liquid and the size of the child. 'In the worst case scenario it could kill a very small child who ingests the substance. 'Two or three drops are enough to cause palpitations, vomiting, dizziness and high blood pressure.' Dr Gupta said the girl's case was the first of its kind seen at Good Hope. It comes as it emerged a two-year-old was rushed to the Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham and nearly died after swallowing nicotine from a device. Doctors have called for increased safety regulation of e-cigarettes . But he said he had researched several incidents of adults needing medical treatment over similar alerts. 'Some refills have screw-cap type lids and others simply snap into the e-cigarette and are a lot safer,' he said. 'It is the screw-cap type, which are dangerous and the risk has grown because there are so many products like this being developed by companies. 'What started out as a beneficial thing has now turned into a risk for children. 'It can be quite a concentrated solution and there needs to be more awareness around it. These refills, which are in colourful attractive packaging, need to be kept away from children. 'The risk posed by nicotine liquid to children needs to be recognised, acknowledged and acted upon by all. This includes public education and legislation to improve the safety profile of e-liquid containers.' Birmingham Director of Public Health, Dr Adrian Phillips, said: 'E-cigarettes are a new product and, while they are undoubtedly less harmful than traditional cigarettes, they are not without risks. 'This report clearly highlights the need for regulation and more needs to be done to protect children and young people.' The study was published in Archives of Disease in Childhood.","Around seven children a day accidentally swallow liquid nicotine from e-cigarette refills, scientists have revealed .

"Two Washington, D.C. reporters were able to drive through the outer security gates of a Maryland nuclear power plant without being challenged, according to a report published Tuesday. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Lusby, Md., had an unattended and padlocked guard gate when journalists drove through – on two separate occasions. They easily accessed a parking lot within 550 feet of a working nuclear reactor without prompting any kind of contact with uniformed security. 'No one stopped or even seemed to notice them,' The Daily Caller reported. Terrorist jackpot: Reporters with the online news website The Daily Caller were able to drive onto the premises of a Maryland nuclear power plant and approach a working reactor without any challenge . Drive-thru: The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, just 50 miles from Washington, DC, has an open front gate . Nuclear plants, including those on bodies of water, like the Calvert Cliffs facility, provide a tantalizing target for terror groups bent on causing mass-casualty events in the United States. But a previous visitor to the site told the Caller that the nuclear facility 'is the softest target I have ever seen in my life.' With a camera rolling, the journalists approached the front gate expecting to be challenged. But the guardhouse was padlocked shut and there was no security to be found anywhere. On their second visit, they saw a lone security vehicle driving around the premises but it drove right past them without any sort of inspection. And a large civilian delivery truck, more than amply sized to serve as a giant bomb, also rolled through the gates without anyone stopping it. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants via commissioners appointed by the President of the United States. Diane Screnci, a spokesperson for the agency, told The Daily Caller that 'based on the security inspections we've conducted on an on-going basis, security at Calvert Cliffs is appropriate to protect the public health and safety.' It's unclear how often those checks are performed, or if the NRC plans to ramp up its efforts following the embarrassing public report. But it has cited the plant's 'security deficiencies' before, in 2011, without describing exactly what it found lacking. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday, more than 7 in 10 Americans said they think it's likely that terrorists with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) are already inside the United States and poised to attack the American homeland. ISIS has cut a swath of torture, death and destruction through more than half of Iraq and much of eastern Syria. Padlocked: The guard shack outside Calvert Cliffs was deserted and locked up . The nuclear power plant is run by the Exelon Corporation, which insists that it's not required to post guards outside its nuclear plants' grounds . The Exelon Corporation operates the Calvert Cliffs plant. Its spokesman Kory Raftery told TheDC that it's 'not required' to maintain manned checkpoints at all of its nuclear plants. He claimed Calvert Cliffs and the company's other facilities are 'highly-secure, virtually impenetrable facilities.' 'The fences and checkpoints you see at Calvert Cliffs are only a small part of our defense in depth security strategy,' Raftery told the center-right online outlet. 'In fact, much of our defense lies in the things you can't see.' He insisted that officers who used to man the front gate had been redeployed in a way that 'enhanced overall site security' and 'increased safety for our officers.' An expert with the left-leaning Union of Concerned Scientists told the Caller that having a 'visible defense' on the outer perimeter of a nuclear plant can make terrorists think twice about mounting an attack. The 9/11 Commission report includes frightening descriptions of an al-Qaeda plot, ultimately abandoned, to attack an American nuclear power reactor. And a pair of University of Texas professors concluded in a 2013 report that the U.S. risks 'deliberate sabotage of nuclear facilities, such as by aircraft attacks, vehicle bombs, anti-tank weapons, or the disabling of pumps by an insider or an intruder facilitated by an insider who disables locks and alarms.' 'Terrorists may commit radiological sabotage to provoke public fear, showcase their ability to inflict societal harm, or potentially induce an energy crisis in areas dependent on power reactors,' wrote the experts.","Journalists saw a padlock on the guardhouse at a Maryland nuke plant just 50 miles from Washington, DC .

"For most planning to study in London, the high cost of accommodation is an unavoidable burden. But the Tindle family have come up with a novel way to get out of paying thousands on student halls for their daughter – by buying her a narrowboat. Instead of paying for expensive halls in the capital, Charlotte, 18, will live on the three-bed barge while she studies for her music production degree. Miss Tindle, a keen musician, and her parents, Harry and Gill, spent the summer refurbishing the vessel, to include glamorous black and white decoration and furnishings. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Tindle, 18, will live on this narrowboat for her three-year music course in Fulham, south west London . Charlotte hopes to find a permanent mooring for her newly-renovated narrowboat, Alleluja Free Spirit . Miss Tindle, a keen musician, and her parents spent the summer refurbishing the vessel . The student accommodation suggested by the Tech Music School in Fulham, south west London, where Miss Tindle will study, cost £1,000 a month – so around £36,000 for her three-year degree. To buy the boat and carry out the renovation cost the family £37,000 – so around the same it would cost to pay for student halls for three years. But Mr and Mrs Tindle plan to sell the boat when their daughter graduates and expect it to fetch at least £40,000 – therefore making a profit. Miss Tindle, who hopes to be at their destination, Brentford Island Marina, within ten days, before the start of term on September 29, said: ‘It’s so exciting. The boat’s been done up so nicely with ashwood interior. 'It’s such a luxury and glam place to be and something to be proud of.’ She has her own room with double bed, a dining room with a table turning into another double bed and a lounge with a large sofa bed. The kitchen boasts all mod cons including cooker, fridge, microwave and washing machine and the trendy bathroom with black sparkly floor and white walls features a corner power shower . There is also a 32-inch flat screen in the lounge, Beatles' pillows and an internet hotspot for her laptop .

The student accommodation suggested by the Tech Music School in Fulham costs £1,000 a month - so around £36,000 for her three-year degree . This would cover the mooring costs, which are expected to be an additional £5,000 to £6,000 a year. Speaking yesterday from her new floating home, as she travelled through Leicestershire, she said the idea was her father’s. ‘He mentioned it to me but I was a little bit unsure at first, then I warmed to it. I’ll probably be the envy of all the other students!’ she said. Mr Tindle, 52, a design consultant and his wife, Gill, a beautician bought the boat from a vicar who never sailed it.

Miss Tindle said: ‘It’s called Alleluja, quite a fitting name and it’s staying. It’s bad luck to change name until a boat’s been taken out of the water and this one hasn’t.’ Once they arrive in London, Miss Tindle’s parents will stay with her until they find a mooring spot in a marina, before returning home. She has been living in Leicester Marina for the past week to get used to her new home. ‘I was most worried about being in the dark, but as soon as I was here, I felt safe. I feel like it is my home,’ she said. All aboard: Charlotte is currently navigating her way down south with her parents, Harry and Gill . Mr Tindle, who owns a design consultancy, said the trip down to London is the family's summer holiday this year . Mr Tindle said his friend used to live on a narrowboat and it struck him as a nice place for Charlotte to live. ‘I thought it would be a suitable alternative. Charlotte has the right character to do this,’ he said. ‘Myself and my wife, Gill, have been working on it and we have been taken in by the boating scene. Everyone seems helpful. It seemed a better environment for Charlotte to live in, instead of a basement bedsit. ‘I would be more worried about Charlotte in a bedsit in a dodgy area of London on her own than living in a lovely marina. ‘It might be a bit more unusual, but it makes sense to me.’ Mr Tindle, who owns a design consultancy, added that the trip down to London is their summer holiday this year. ‘It has turned in to an adventure. I have stuck a couple of Leicester Foxes on the front of the boat for good luck.'","Charlotte Tindle, 18, will study music production at the Tech Music School .

"A Good Samaritan Royal Marine lost his leg after he was hit by flying debris when he stopped to help the victims of a motorway car crash. Lee Spencer, 45, had stopped to help the stricken driver and passengers, but as he tried to alert other motorists another car smashed into the BMW. In the force of the crash, the BMW's engine was torn from the vehicle and flew across the motorway lanes, hitting the Colour Sergeant from Horrabridge, Devon, and knocking him over the crash barrier onto the grass verge. Royal Marine: Lee Spencer lost his leg after he was hit by flying debris when he stopped to help the victims of a motorway car crash . His right leg was severed in the impact, but the serviceman's Forces training kicked in and he was even able to instruct bystanders on how to tie a tourniquet around his leg, and help paramedics to save his life. Doctors were unable to save the limb, which had to be amputated, but CSgt Spencer, formerly of 3 Commando Brigade, has now dedicated his life to helping others, having raised thousands of pounds for charity before his accident. Speaking for the first time about the  incident, the married father-of-two said: 'I was extremely close to death, but now I’m in this position where I’m just glad to be here today. 'Now I just want to help people.' CSgt Spencer had been driving on the M3 through Surrey on January 5 when he spotted hazard lights flashing in the distance. He could see a BMW had collided with the central reservation, and was partially blocking the middle and outside lanes. 'My immediate thought was well, I’m a first aider, if anyone is left in that car they are in mortal danger and I need to get them out,' he said. 'I pulled over onto the hard shoulder. Caring: CSgt Spencer, pictured with his wife Claire and children Billy and Harriet, says he has 'no excuses but to get on with life', and wants to use his experiences to help others . Staying positive: CSgt Spencer spent five weeks in hospital, and is now undergoing rehabilitation at Devonport Naval Base’s Hasler Company . 'There I saw two men and a woman who were originally in the car, and another person who had stopped to help. 'I made sure they were okay, and that no-one was left in the car. 'I then walked about 200 metres up the hard shoulder using my phone as a torch to try and make drivers aware of the accident.' CSgt Spencer said he then remembers hearing a loud 'bang' before the sound of people screaming. He was then hit by something, which he at first thought was a car. In fact, an Audi had collided at speed with the BMW and the force of the impact between the two cars was so great that the engine of the BMW was thrown from the vehicle. CSgt Spencer said the engine hurtled 70 metres across the lanes of the motorway, striking him with full force. In action: CSgt Spencer, pictured in Afghanistan, completed three tours in the country, as well as serving in Northern Ireland and Iraq . The impact knocked him several metres from the hard shoulder, over the barrier, and onto a grass verge. 'I came to a stop, and I was thinking I could feel myself moving and I could hear people screaming,' he said. 'I looked down and saw my left leg at right angles to my body, my right leg was barely still attached. 'I guess it was my training because I started shouting ‘medic, medic’ without thinking where I was. Lifeline: CSgt Spencer with wife of 21 years, Claire (left), and receiving a police commendation alongside Frank and Zanele Sibindi (right), who helped to save his life . 'I could see I had a catastrophic bleed in my right leg. I knew from my medical training that I had to stop the bleeding fast. 'I knew I had four to six minutes before I was dead. I could feel the symptoms of shock coming on.' CSgt Spencer’s wife, Claire, said her injured husband had called her from the roadside. 'He rang me and said he’d been in an accident, and then hung up - he later said he didn’t want me to just get a knock at the door with someone bringing the news,' said the 47-year-old. Charitable: Even before his accident, CSgt Spencer was a keen charity fundraiser, and raised £11,000 by running a 52-mile double marathon . Kind hearted: He ran the back-to-back marathons in aid of Dominic Lovett - a former Royal Marine also from Horrabridge - who was paralysed from the neck down in an accident while on exercise in Norway . Determined: CSgt Spencer also ran a marathon across Dartmoor, which took him nine hours due to a severe snow storm hitting the high moor . 'Apparently he was telling people how to save his life. That was the Royal Marine training in him. 'Everyone was panicking and he was just so calm telling people how to tie a tourniquet using a belt. 'He even helped the paramedics when they arrived. 'It’s unbelievable really but that’s how Lee is.' When he came around from his medically-induced coma in the Intensive Care Unit at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, CSgt Spencer was told that doctors had been forced to amputate his right leg. While being treated at the Headley Court rehabilitation centre earlier this year, a Warrant Officer suggested Csgt Spencer attend an event supporting Royal Marines  completing the final phase of their ‘1664 Challenge’. As part of the event, the six marines took on a moonlit 30-mile march from Greenwich to London, and Prince Harry was there to wish the marines good luck. 'I planned to do a sponsored one-mile walk, leading them on the first mile,' said CSgt Spencer. 'After I finished I met Prince Harry and his first question to me was ""why wasn’t I doing the whole 30 miles"". 'I don’t think he realised I had only lost my leg six months previously, and had only been out of a wheelchair for a month.' CSgt Spencer completed the mile in 19 minutes and 38 seconds, and has so far raised more than £7,000. His left leg had been dislocated and had to be totally reconstructed, while CSgt Spencer was told he had lost more than half of the blood in his body. He spent five weeks in hospital, and is now undergoing rehabilitation at Devonport Naval Base’s Hasler Company. Mrs Spencer said her husband is a true hero in every since of the word. 'He’s served in Afghanistan three times, as well as tours in Northern Ireland and Iraq,' added Mrs Spencer, who works for West Devon Borough Council. 'He’s served his country. 'He comes back unscathed from war, and then loses his leg on leave while helping someone. 'He just amazes me. 'We’ve been together for 28 years, and married for 21 years, and he’s always amazed me. 'He is inspirational to others - a lot of others - but to me and our children he’s just amazing. 'He has dark days, which is understandable, but he just gets up and gets on with it.' Csgt Spencer, whose bravery has been recognised with nominations for the Pride of Plymouth, and Pride of Britain Awards, said he was 'lucky to be alive'. 'It has been hard and I wouldn’t recommend it,' he said. 'It’s been far from a totally negative experience. 'I’ve done three tours of Afghanistan, and an untold amount of patrols. 'Every soldier who has done that and gone outside the gate, you’ve mentally prepared yourself for an injury like this. 'I think that mentality is still in me. Bizarrely it wasn’t a massive shock for this to happen to me. 'I look at other marines like Plymouth marine Mark Ormrod who lost both his legs and an arm and they’ve been in a worse position than me. 'I feel like I have no excuse but to get on with my life. You can’t just wallow in self pity.' Joining forces: CSgt Spencer joined fellow Royal Marines for a one mile sponsored walk through London . Even before his accident, CSgt Spencer was a keen charity fundraiser and last year raised £11,000 by running two back to back marathons in aid of Dominic Lovett - a former Royal Marine also from Horrabridge - who was paralysed from the neck down in an accident while on exercise in Norway. He also raised £2,000 through running a marathon over Dartmoor, which took him nine hours due to a severe snow storm hitting the high moor. While in hospital recovering from his injuries he began planning his future fundraising efforts, and is considering undertaking a variety of challenges. 'Crazy things like swimming the Channel, running a marathon and using what happened to me in a positive way,' he said. 'My main aim is to continue with the rehab and I want to use the experience to help others. 'I’ve loved my time as a Royal Marine. When I look back what I have enjoyed so much is the service; there is something meaningful in service - it is very much a part of me.'","Lee Spencer, 45, had stopped to help  driver on the M3 in Surrey .

"Is he to blame?: Kevin Stange faces charges after video of his grandson abusing a puppy surfaced online . Flint-area officials are investigating a suspected case of animal cruelty after a video posted online showed a 4-year-old boy, and grandson of an already convicted felon, repeatedly throwing a puppy into the street. Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell tells The Flint Journal he was 'very disturbed' by the video posted by neighbor Karl Collyer, which he saw after it was shared on Facebook. The newspaper says it shows a 4-year-old boy carrying the Puppy, named Tippy, toward the street several times as the animal tries to run back into a yard. In the video, the dog sometimes lands on his legs, head or back. Pickell says the boy was at the home the puppy's owner, his grandfather Kevin Stange. Pickell told reporters that Genesee County Animal Control retrieved the puppy, which wasn't injured. In a Facebook update posted a few hours ago, Pickell said that Stange, who was in charge of watching the boy at the time, faces charges. After interviewing Stange, police discovered that Stange was a convicted felon in possesion of a firearm. Pickell also wrote that he has ordered Child Protective Services to conduct an investigation into the state of the 4-year-ols'd care. 'We’ve got to get this little boy help so that he doesn’t do…down the road nothing worse happens,' Pickell told WNEM. 'I just couldn't believe my eyes,' Pickell added. 'When you see the way he picked this puppy up and threw it again and again and again, you know it just didn't start.' Plans call for finding a new home for the dog.

"Criminals are being locked up for longer as the government keeps its promise to be tough on those who break the law, new figures show. Convictions of celebrity sex abusers are believed to be partly responsible for a larger number of sex offenders being prosecuted, as victims feel more confident about coming forward to expose their abusers. The average jail term now stands at 15 1/2 months, three months longer than the average in 2004, and prisoners are getting longer sentences now than they have done for 20 years, Ministry Of Justice MOJ) figures reveal. Jailed celebrities: Rolf Harris, 84, left, and Stuart Hall, 84, right, were both jailed for indecently assaulting girls . A source close to Justice Minister Chris Grayling told MailOnline: 'Criminals who break the law and ruin the lives of decent hardworking people have to realise they will go to prison. 'A slap on the wrist isn't acceptable for those who make others' lives a misery.' The average custodial sentence length (ACSL), or length of time people are sentenced to, has increased year on year over the last decade, according to the MOJ's new criminal justice statistics update. The new figures, which don't include life or indeterminate sentences, show that while fines are the most commonly given punishment by all courts, offenders who are sent to jail are facing a longer period inside, particularly sex offenders. Criminals jailed for sex offences are jailed for longer than any others, with an average sentence of 58.7 months.  The custody rate for these offenders is also up, with 60 per cent of those convicted of sex offenders being sent to prison, second only to robbers, of whom 64 per cent are jailed. This is thought to be due in part to an increase in the number of celebrity sex offenders being convicted for abuse giving victims confidence to come forward. In the last year alone, celebrity publicist Max Clifford, broadcaster Stuart Hall and former children's television presenter Rolf Harris have all been jailed for sex offences. In July, Rolf Harris was jailed for five years and nine months after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults against four girls. The 84-year-old artist and children's presenter was jailed by Mr Justice Sweeney, who told him he had taken advantage of his celebrity and had shown 'no remorse'. A source close to justice secretary Chris Grayling, left, says people convicted of serious crimes, like publicist and sex offender Max Clifford, 71, right, will face prison sentences rather than a 'slap on the wrist' Former It's A Knockout presenter Stuart Hall was sentenced to 30 months in jail after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 over a period of 20 years. Earlier this year, the 84-year-old was jailed for a further 30 months after admitting indecently assaulting an under-age girl. But the judge told him he would have received a 'considerably greater' sentence had he been prosecuted under current laws. Under his first sentence, Hall would have been due for early release this month at the earliest, but now he will not be eligible for parole until December 2015. Celebrity publicist Max Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1966 and 1984. The sentence imposed by Judge Anthony Leonard was far longer than expected, partly, the judge said, because of his 'quite extraordinary' attitude during the trial, in which he was seen laughing and shaking his head as evidence was given. Clifford was told that had some of offences been tried under today's law, they would have been considered as rape or assault by penetration with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The tide of celebrity sex abuse cases is thanks to Operation Yewtree, a national police investigation into decades-old sex crimes perpetrated by television icons such as the late Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter. The government has introduced automatic life sentences for anyone who commits a second violent or sexual offence, ensuring the most serious criminals are dealt with severely. The justice minister has said he wants criminals to know that a serious offence will earn them a jail sentence rather than a caution. Mr Grayling is currently pushing a bill through parliament to ensure that criminals will no longer receive cautions for serious offences, and for less serious offences they will no longer receive a second caution for the same or similar offence committed in a two-year period.","Convicted criminals are facing longer jail terms as government cracks down .

"A thief appears to have been caught red-handed stealing from a fashion boutique after the store's owner took the bold step of posting footage of the alleged crime on Facebook. Shop owner Robyn Boyd was so outraged when she discovered four items were missing from her women's clothing store in Adelaide that she filmed CCTV footage of a woman appearing to stuff clothes into her bag and shared it online. 'Here is 3 minutes worth of yesterday thief! She stole 4 items in total! Please like and share! We want to find her! [sic],' she wrote on Facebook on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Red-handed? A boutique owner shared footage of another woman taking dresses of their hangers . The almost four minutes of footage, filmed at the Liberty Boutique store in Unley Shopping Centre, in the inner-southern suburb of Adelaide, has been shared over 1000 times so far. A dark haired woman can be seen looking up at the shop's security camera as she moves between a few clothing racks outside the store's entrance. At one point she takes a long multi-coloured dress of a hanger, puts the hanger back on the rack and folds the dress up as she turns her back to the camera. Some people questioned why she didn't stop the thief, as in the video Robyn seems to be filming the incident on her phone. Outrage: She appears to put a blue dress in her bag without paying for it (left) and the woman was seen sifting through the dresses on the racks (right) But she explained she had filmed the CCTV footage on a screen on her mobile so that she could post it online. When asked why nobody stepped in she also said:'Unfortunately the staff member was working alone, and was preoccupied with loyal & paying customers in the store, who she was helping. 'The woman was in and out within 3-4 minutes with the garments - not once stepping foot inside the store. The other camera angles show that she was keeping an eye on the staff member. 'Unfortunately you cannot trust anyone these days, and the staff member was doing the right thing by assisting other customers who needed her help.'

"Jailed: Paul Burnett, 45, ran a sophisticated benefits swindle over 17 years using dead friends' names . A benefits cheat has been jailed for stealing two dead friends' identities in a 17-year 'campaign of deception' which netted him £232,000. Paul Burnett, 45, set up alter egos as 'tenants' in a string of houses he had bought - then claimed incapacity, housing and council tax benefit, jobseekers' allowance and income support in their names. His sophisticated swindle, which included posing as one friend who died in a 1988 motorcycle crash and another who drowned in 1996, was only discovered when one of his living victims returned from Australia. By the time he was caught, Burnett was having to keep 16 diaries to organise his life as a 'full-time fraudster', Bradford Crown Court heard. When Department of Work and Pensions investigators finally caught up with him, he confessed: 'It was easy money. 'It started off because I was skint but then it turned into a game.' The court heard Burnett claimed benefits using his own name and those of four other men between 1996 and 2013. The first, Michael Gilmartin, was a friend who had died in a motorcycle crash in Leeds in 1988. Posing under the fake name, Burnett bought a house in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and took on a tenant by the name of Ian Wright. But 'Ian Wright' was actually Burnett under a second fake name - and he claimed £61,174 in incapacity benefit, housing benefit of £35,629 and council tax benefit of £6,487 from Calderdale Council. To claim the incapacity benefit, which has since been phased out by the government, Burnett had to obtain an NHS card for 'Ian Wright' and complain he was unfit to work due to depression. The court heard how 'Ian Wright' - whose real-life double had in fact left Britain to live in Australia - was prescribed Prozac, declared unfit to work and even referred to a counsellor. Burnett's third identity was Michael Wells, a friend who had drowned in Greece in 1996. He bought a house in Bradford, West Yorkshire, under Mr Wells' name and then pretended he was a tenant to claim a string of benefits. Burnett's claims had a deep effect on his dead friend's sister - who was offered a 'glimmer of hope' that he had not drowned after all, the court heard. Burnett's fourth identity was Stephen Hackett, who was still alive but had moved to France following a family fight. Scam: Burnett operated his fraud by buying several houses under false names in West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and Rochdale, Greater Manchester, then claiming benefits. Pictured: One of his homes in Bradford . As Stephen Hackett, Burnett again managed to obtain an NHS Medical Card and even a birth certificate. 'Stephen Hackett' then claimed £11,845 housing benefit, £2,501 council tax benefit, £9,271 jobseekers' allowance, £24,190 incapacity benefit and £16,476 of its successor, the employment and support allowance. He had a bank account with Cheltenham and Gloucester and - as with 'Ian Wright' - was signed off as unfit to work after telling doctors he had depression and suicidal thoughts. Burnett was only discovered after the real Ian Wright returned home from Australia and found letters demanding money and claiming he had been receiving benefits. He contacted the authorities and police traced Burnett to the home where 'Stephen Hackett' was living in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire. Justice: Burnett was jailed for three years today at Bradford Crown Court. Judge Jonathan Rose told him: 'Benefits are to help those in need, not those who are seduced by greed. You are a greedy man Paul Burnett' Records showed Burnett - using his real name - had bought the house in cash for £70,000 and 'Stephen Hackett' was supposedly living there as a tenant. But they found the 16 diaries which exposed the scale of the scam, linking him with the other properties in Halifax and Bradford. They also showed he had links to Keighley and Todmorden in West Yorkshire and Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Burnett pleaded guilty to 20 separate counts of fraud and making false representations. Judge Jonathan Rose told Burnett he had seen the benefits system as 'a portal to riches'. 'Benefits and the benefits system are to help those in need, those unable to finance their lives without the support and assistance of the state,' he said. 'They are not there, in your own counsel's words, for those who are seduced by greed. You are a greedy man Paul Burnett. 'Your case has a deeply unpleasant and deeply hurtful aspect of you stealing the identities of men who have lost their lives.' Stephen Wood, defending, said Burnett has an 18 year old daughter and told police he 'was seduced by greed'. 'He was encouraged by the ease with which these offences could be committed,' Mr Wood said. 'They didn't require special tools or special knowledge'. Speaking after Burnett was sentenced, Bob Gallacher, from the Department for Work and Pensions' fraud and error Service said cases such as Burnett's cost taxpayers' money. 'The majority of people claiming benefits are honest, but there are some who abuse our welfare system and we will catch them,' he said. 'Cases like this cost hardworking taxpayers money that should be used to help those in need. 'DWP financial investigators are pursing Burnett to recover the money that he has fraudulently claimed, and this will go back into the public purse.' 'If you suspect someone of benefit fraud, please call the Benefit Fraud Hotline on 0800 854 440 so we can continue to tackle the problem in our area.'","Paul Burnett, 45, bought homes and claimed benefits under friends' names .

Prosecutor Simon Bravery told the court: 'Mr Georgescu failed to see her and knocked her to the ground as he was turning. 'She . remained under the lorry for some while, but he didn't stop the lorry. He reversed and she was taken to the Royal London Hospital by air . ambulance. 'She suffered serious injuries, but has been released from intensive care and her condition is described as stable.'

She . said: 'He made full admission at the police station and the officer on . the case noted he showed genuine remorse throughout the interview. 'He . wants to make it known to the court today that he understands the . tragic consequences of his driving on this day and told me he could not . express in words how remorseful he is.' However, her neighbours fear the widow - whose husband, Glyn, died three years ago - may never be able to come home again due to the nature of her injuries. One lady said: 'She goes up to the cemetery regularly, that's where she was going and those flowers were from her garden. 'She was going to lay flowers on the grave. She goes up there every week. She's not only my neighbour, but we are friends to each other and we look after each other.' She called the sentence 'disgusting'. The elderly woman, who asked not to be named, added: 'Rose won't be back home, she is very, very ill. 'She's been critically ill but there's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. 'Please God she will come home because her garden is her life. She does the communal garden all herself, it's immaculate.

I dread to think. 'She is out there in her garden from morning until night, especially since her husband passed away.' Mrs Lethbridge, who is now off life-support, is believed to be estranged from her children. Barry Newman, manager of the Southend branch of Formula One Autocentres, witnessed the horror crash. He said there was a lot of anger about the sentence handed down at Southend Magistrates' Court. He said: 'If you had an industrial accident with those kind of injuries, you would get tens of thousands of pounds. 'It was horrific. We watched as the air ambulance came and the poor lady spent a long time under that lorry before she could be freed.' His colleague, Michael Hart, was on a break and saw the impact. He said: 'It was like it happened in slow motion in front of me. It was horrible and not something I'd ever like to see again. 'From the force of the impact, it didn't look good and she was under there for quite a while as medics treated her.' Rachel Weller, a courier driver for Motex, also witnessed the crash and remained with Mrs Lethbridge while she was treated. She said: 'To put it politely, the sentence is totally unfair given her injuries.' Mrs Lethbridge also suffered a fractured collarbone, seven fractured ribs and had a collapsed left lung.","Rose Lethbridge, 77, was struck by Marcel Georgescue's 40 ton lorry .

"Poet: A rare handwritten draft of A E Housman's most famous First World War poem that derided the Germans for suggesting the British soldiers were mercenaries is set to sell for £15,000 . A rare handwritten draft of A E Housman's most famous First World War poem that derided the Germans for suggesting the British soldiers were mercenaries is set to sell for £15,000. ‘Epitaph On An Army of Mercenaries’ was written by the poet and is an angry denouncement of German propaganda stating that British troops fought for money not patriotism. Housman was a favourite of the troops serving in the trenches, and the draft is expected to attract a number of bidders when it goes under the hammer at Auction house Bonhams's First World War Centenary sale in London on October 1. The eight line poem was published in The Times in October 1917 and the draft, which was written in pencil, shows Housman’s deletions and revisions. It was intended as a response to the German propaganda insult at the start of the conflict, which claimed the British Expeditionary Force was made up of professional soldiers who were out for themselves, unlike the German army mainly consisted of conscripts and fighting for the Fatherland. Alfred Edward Housman uses the concept of mercenary ironically to honour the small force of professional soldiers sent to Belgium at the start of the war who fought and died at the Battle of Ypres in October 1914. They were pitched against a well-equipped and larger German army suffering heavy losses. These ‘Old Contemptibles,’ adopted from a slur from the Kaiser when he described the BEF as a 'contemptible little army' for holding up the German advance, saved the nation and paid with their lives. Working drafts by the classical scholar and poet are very rare  because he left instructions to his brother Laurence to destroy them on his death. Although he did give his brother discretion to retain any documents he felt would be worth keeping and the poem was probably saved because another poem. ‘Oh Were He And I Together’, was written on the back of it. Draft version: ‘Epitaph On An Army of Mercenaries’ was written by the poet and is an angry denouncement of German propaganda stating that British troops fought for money not patriotism . Saved: The draft (left) may have survived because another poem, ‘Oh Were He And I Together’, (right) was written on the back of it . The text, again in pencil, is very faint and a deliberate attempt has been made to erase it but Laurence Housman clearly felt it should be retained and some experts believe it referred to Housman’s other brother Herbert, who died in the Boer war. Others suggested it was connected to his unrequited love for his Oxford University friend Moses Jackson who had married and emigrated in 1897. This second poem was never published in Housman’s lifetime though he did consider including it in his 1922 volume, Last Poems, only to withdraw it at the proof stage. These, in the day when heaven was falling, . The hour when earth’s foundations fled, . Followed their mercenary calling . And took their wages and are dead. Their shoulders held the sky suspended; . They stood, and earth’s foundations stay; . What God abandoned, these defended, . And saved the sum of things for pay. 'Whichever interpretation is correct, the poem clearly caused some soul searching for both Housman and his brother,' said a Bonhams spokesman. 'Housman’s family and friends almost certainly knew of his deep attachment to Moses Jackson. 'On A E's death in 1936, Laurence consulted another of the poet’s close friends, Alfred Pollard, about what to do with the more intimate material in his brother’s papers. 'Pollard recommended that he keep them which accounts for the fact that this very personal hand written work survives.' The poet was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in 1859 and is best known for his cycle of poems called 'A Shropshire Lad'. His work has inspired a broad range of writers, from American crime writer James Ellroy to the production team behind the James Bond film Die Another Day. Houseman is considered one of the most prominent English classical scholars of the early 20th century. He was also Professor of Latin at University College London and later Cambridge where he died aged 77 in 1936. Alfred Edward Housman, was born in the tiny hamlet of Fockbury, Worcestershire, England, on March 26, 1859, the eldest of seven children. His family later moved to Bromsgrove, where he grew up, and in 1877, he attended St. John’s College, Oxford where he was awarded a first class honours in classical moderations. He had unexpectedly failed his final exams after becoming distracted when he fell in love with his roommate Moses Jackson, but managed to pass his final year and went on to work at the Patent Office in London. Jackson was the greatest love of Housman's life, but he never reciprocated Housman's feelings, and went on to marry - without inviting Housman to the wedding. Housman continued to study classics, and became professor of Latin at University College, London, in 1892. Housman was heralded as one of the foremost classicists of his age, and in 1911 took the role of professor of Latin at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he worked until his death.

Just two volumes of poetry were published during his lifetime. A Shropshire Lad, which was published in 1896, and Last Poems in 1922. As well as themes such as pastoral beauty, unrequited love and youth in the English countryside, the 63 poems in A Shropshire Lad depicted the brave patriotism of soldiers, and as such became popular reading material among troops fighting in the First World War. Housman published Last Poems, most of which had been written before 1910, in 1922 - prompted by the fact Jackson was dying, and he wanted his friend to read them. Housman, who despite his fame lived largely as a recluse, died aged 77 on April 30, 1936 in Cambridge. After his death his brother Laurence published two further books - More Poems in 1936, and Housman's Complete Poems in 1939.","A E Housman's Epitaph On An Army Of Mercenaries was published in 1917 .

"A baby boy born with eight limbs is said to be recovering well after doctors removed his 'parasitic twin'. Three-month old baby Paul Mukisa was born with four legs and four arms in Nabigingo, a small village in eastern Uganda. Parents Margaret Awino and Boniface Okongo rushed the child to a nearby district hospital but were told there was nothing medics could do. Scroll down for video . Three-month old baby Paul Mukisa was born with four legs and four arms in Nabigingo, a small village in eastern Uganda . They were then referred to Mulago Hospital in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, where a team of surgeons led by Dr John Sekabira, a consultant Paediatric surgeon, assessed the little boy and discovered that not only did he have four extra limbs and what appeared to be an extra chest, but  that his heart and the liver were on the wrong sides. Doctors also discovered that the parasitic twin shared part of the boy's pelvic bone. Surgeons then discharged the baby for three months, allowing him to grow large enough for them to safely operate on him. On August 18, three surgeons performed on Pail at the Ugandan hospital. Over three hours they carefully separated parts of the parasitic twin from his body. Dr Nasser Kakembo, one of the surgeons who carried out the operation, told CNN: 'The baby was given general anesthesia and the torso and trunk of the parasitic twin -- which had two arms but no head or heart -- was detached from the host baby. A team of surgeons led by Dr John Sekabira, a consultant Paediatric surgeon, assessed the little boy and discovered that not only did he have four extra limbs and what appeared to be an extra chest, but that his heart and the liver were on the wrong sides . On August 18, three surgeons performed on Pail at the Ugandan hospital. Over three hours they carefully separated parts of the parasitic twin from his body . 'Then we also detached the lower limbs of the parasitic twin from the host, which included disarticulating the right and left lower limbs as they were attached by joints. We controlled the bleeding and fashioned skin flaps to close the resulting wound. He said there was only minor blood loss and no post-operation complications. Now, three weeks after surgery the baby looks set to make a full recovery and is now breastfeeding from his mother. Earlier this year doctors successfully removed a baby's extra limbs after it was born with four hands and four feet at a hospital in China's southern Guangdong province. The 13-day-old boy, from Huizhou, was born joined to a headless parasitic twin joined at the torso on April 2. Now, three weeks after surgery at Mulago Hospital the baby looks set to make a full recovery and is now breastfeeding from his mother . An an eight-limbed girl, Lakshmi Tatma, made headlines when she underwent a similar separation surgery from a parasitic twin in 2007. Parasitic twins are extremely rare. Identical twins form when a single egg splits during fertilisation - as opposed to two eggs both being fertilised. Conjoined twins form when a split egg fails to fully separate. A ‘parasite’ conjoined twin can survive but not when one absorbs the other. In 2012 surgeons in Peru operated on a three year old boy to remove a 9in-long parasitic twin weighing a pound and a half. In 2008 doctors had to remove a 2in embryo from the body of a nine-year-old girl in Greece. The brain, lungs and heart are some of the last parts of the body to develop. Removing a parasitic twin is usually easier than attempting to separate conjoined twins.","Paul Mukisa was born with eight limbs in Nabigingo, eastern Uganda .

"This is the unassuming California pad where Elvis Presley would secretly wine and dine women away from the prying eyes of the media and jealous fans. The hideout, which was largely unknown while The King was alive, is tucked away in Palm Springs, two hours' drive from Los Angeles. It was photographed by a Hollywood insider in the late 1960s, who kept the pictures away from the public eye until now. Fit for The King: This home in Palm Springs, California, was Elvis Presley's secret hideaway . Black sheets and a mirror headboard: Elvis would reportedly bring women to the home for secret getaways . Memorabilia: Elvis coated the walls of the property in posters for his films - and the occasional cut-out . Although the property, just miles from his famed Honeymoon House, is humble in comparison to his more lavish residence, the photographs still show touches of Elvis's trademark style. One bedroom features a huge double bed with black silk sheets, with a second decorated in garish pink. In a light-hearted gesture, the singer had also placed cardboard cut-out of himself behind the home's well-stocked bar. The residence was so secluded that Elvis reportedly felt safe enough to sunbathe nude by the pool. Guest room: A second bedroom was rumoured to have often been used by starlet Natalie Wood . Sunspot: According to Hollywood gossip reporter Roger Asquith, Elvis would sunbathe naked by this pool . The walls were adorned with personal photos of the with his wife Priscilla and daughter Lisa Marie, along with gold discs and film posters. Outside, the pool stood in the shadow of Mount Jacinto - and had chairs with the names of Elvis and his manager Tom 'the Colonel' Parker on the back. Photographs of the home were taken by gossip reporter Roger Asquith, a journalist who sold Hollywood stories to UK publications for 40 years. Speaking for the first time about the pictures, Roger, 82, said: 'It wasn't a film star's mansion, but it wasn't supposed to be. Love nest: The photographs were taken in the 1960s when Mr Asquith was visiting the house with an estate agent friend . Staring back at you: Some of the walls were adorned with pictures of the singer himself . 'It was just a little love nest for him to go there and stay for weekends and stay out of everyone's way. 'Nobody knew it was there and these pictures have never been printed.' As well as interviewing the stars, Mr Asquith had property interests and had a friend who helped manage the home for Mr Presley. She was sent over to check the house on one occasion before Elvis visited and Mr Asquith joined her to look around. Speaking from his home in Gloucester, he said: 'It was just a little two-bedroom place with a kidney-shaped pool. Wall of rock: The house contained this display of 15 gold discs, awarded for his smash-hit songs . Sense of humour: Elvis had decorated this bar inside the house with a cardboard cut-out of himself . 'It was just a very nice house, very comfortable and ideal for him to take girls with him. 'It was in an immaculate condition so I just took a few photographs and left.' Mr Asquith said the palm tree-fronted house was chosen by Elvis because the secluded pool meant he could sunbathe with his guests away from prying eyes. The guest room was reportedly used by former child star Natalie Wood, rumoured to have had a relationship with the singer in the 1950s before he married Priscilla. The room had a TV, en-suite bathroom and a picture of Elvis playing guitar. Elsewhere in the house 15 gold discs hang on the wall alongside framed newspaper cuttings, posters for his 1957 film Loving You and his movie from the following year, King Creole. It is understood the home is now a private residence. Ornamental: The single-storey home, the living room of which is pictured, is now a somebody's house .

"Eman Abdou is the head of an organisation which has been accused of sending funds to terror group Islamic State . A registered not-for-profit group is denying it has ties to an extremist group in the Middle East, despite its members' association with Islamic State militants. Mothers and Children Fundraiser for Syria has been accused of sending its funds to the Middle East to aid the activities of the al-Qaeda off-shoot. The group is registered with Consumer Affairs Victoria and among its membership is Susan Dahman - the sister of a Northcote suicide bomber - and a sister-in-law of another Australian on the frontlines in the Middle East serving under the Islamic State flag, according to the Herald Sun. It is believed 18-year-old Adam Dahman, from Melbourne's inner city suburb of Northcote, was one of the people who killed five others at a market in Iraq in July by strapping explosives to his body. The Melbourne-based charity group aims to raise funds for medical equipment, educational supplies, food and water through fundraising auctions and dinners. The woman who heads the group, Eman Abdou, told the Herald Sun she was not able to reveal which organisations the money was benefiting. But on social media she said the money was being put to good use the children who were left disadvantaged by the conflict. Ms Abdou said as a mother herself she felt something needed to be done to help them. 'I woke up and decided enough is enough and I am going to do what little I can to help these children,' she wrote on Facebook. 'I have helped in a few charity events that have opened orphanages in Syria, I am also a proud sponsor of a syrian (sic) orphan. She said as a mother she felt compelled to help children displaced by the conflict and had helped open orphanages in Syria . 'My children and I went to Palestinian rallies and raised our voices for the innocent people in Gaza, raised funds for medical supplies to help the doctors cope. 'Have I done enough I haven't, but im (sic) trying we are all humanitarians and human rights activsts. 'We all care, we all weep, we all pray for peace, we all try to help. 'After all we are humans, our hearts beat the same regardless of skin colour or religion. 'I will continue to support the innocent people in Syria and Palestine and everywhere that humanitarian aid is needed.' The National Security Legislation Monitor believes more than $20 million received by terrorist groups fighting in the Middle East in 2012-13 came from Australian shores, the Herald Sun reported.","Mothers and Children Fundraiser for Syria claims it assists children affected by the Middle Eastern conflict .

"The Queen 'will be proud' to be the head of state for an independent Scotland, Alex Salmond claimed today. The First Minister said he had an audience at Balmoral Castle two weeks ago but would not reveal what was discussed. Speaking in Edinburgh today he dismissed press reports that the Queen is ‘concerned’ about the prospect of Scottish independence, adding: ‘I want the Queen as head of state, as Queen of Scots of an independent Scotland as her ancestors were. ‘I think Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots, and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land.’ It came after Prince William urged voters to concentrate on important 'domestic news' following yesterday's revelation that his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is under pressure to ask the Queen to intervene in support of the Union as polls show support for both the Yes and No campaigns for Scottish Independence is locked at 50 per cent . David Cameron is under pressure to ask . the Queen to intervene in support of the Union as polls show support . for both the Yes and No campaigns for Scottish Independence is locked at . 50 per cent. Senior MPs . from all parties have said that the Prime Minister should consider . asking the Queen to speak out against breaking up the union. She . has until now maintained an absolute silence on the issue of . independence. The nearest she has come to passing comment was in her . 1977 Silver Jubilee speech, delivered as Scotland . and Wales were voting on devolved national assemblies. In the address she reminded subjects of the 'benefits which union has . conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants . of all parts of the United Kingdom.' Mr Salmond said he had an audience with the Queen at Balmoral two weeks ago and praised the Palace's neutrality. He said: . ‘And I think the statement from the Palace about the Queen's neutrality . in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one. ‘And, . of course, one thing that the polls showed at the weekend, in addition . to the substantial move to the Yes campaign, is the enthusiasm of the . people of Scotland to have Her Majesty the Queen as our Queen of Scots.’ Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond today insisted the Queen would be 'proud' to be the head of state for an independent Scotland . A senior Tory MP told The Telegraph: 'Now would be a great moment for the Queen to say again and underline those inspiring words that she gave in 1977 at her Silver Jubilee. The referendum looks extremely close and her intervention could make all the difference.' Although . the Queen is assumed to back the union, under her constitutional role . she must stay politically neutral and such an intervention would be highly unlikely and constitutionally unthinkable, according to palace sources. In the speech she said: ‘I . number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales . among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. ‘But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ‘Perhaps . this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union . has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the . inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’ The Queen is the most Scottish sovereign in the history of the United Kingdom, directly descended from Mary Queen of Scots, while the late Queen Mother - daughter of the Earl of Strathmore - was twice descended from Robert the Bruce. Senior MPs from all parties have said that the Prime Minister should consider asking the Queen to speak out against breaking up the union . Her love of Scotland is also widely documented. She spent much of her childhood there, her late sister Margaret was born there, and those close to the Queen note that she is 'never happier than when at Balmoral'. Mary Macleod, a former policy adviser to the queen and now a Conservative MP, said . it was the place where the royals had time to switch off from their . official duties. 'It is where they relax, it goes back to their childhood.' Her only official comment on the referendum came in May in a message to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. 'In this important year of referendum, we pray that whatever the outcome, people of faith and people of good will, will work together for the social good of Scotland,' she said. She is, however, said to be privately concerned at the surge in support for Scottish independence and is said to have asked aides for daily updates on the progress of the campaign. A senior royal . source claimed: ‘The Queen is a unionist... There is now a great deal of . concern.’ The source added: ‘If there is a ‘yes’ vote, that puts us . into uncharted territory constitutionally. Nothing is certain. Her being . Queen of Scotland is not a given.’ Senior . palace aides are increasingly concerned that the Queen will be thrown . into the centre of a constitutional crisis in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote . on September 18. Although the Queen is assumed to back the union, under her constitutional role she must stay politically neutral and palace sources say that a speech similar to that delivered in 1977 would be constitutionally unthinkable today . Experts have suggested she may be forced to appoint an Australian-style ‘governor general’ to rule in her name. Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond has insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in an independent Scotland. But his party is split on the issue. The SNP’s John Mason has called for a referendum to replace the monarch as head of state in Scotland after the Queen steps down or dies. He said: ‘The present queen is very popular, but the mood of society may change when she leaves the throne.’ Scotland Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has also raised the prospect this year of a referendum on the Royals. He said it was ‘for the people of Scotland to decide’ on the Queen’s role. Prime . Minister David Cameron is currently with the Queen in Balmoral, . Aberdeenshire, and is expected to hold talks over the crisis. Mr Cameron has travelled alone without his wife Samantha. As news broke yesterday that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting again, Prince William  suggested the growing threat of Scottish independence was more important than the news of his wife's pregnancy. The Duke said Kate, who is suffering acute morning sickness, was ‘feeling okay’ after a ‘tricky few days’. But in a move that could be seen as a direct Royal intervention on the independence debate, he added: ‘It’s important that we all focus on the big news and the big international and domestic things that are going on at the moment. That’s what my thoughts are at the moment.’","Alex Salmond insists Queen would be 'proud' to be Scotland's head of state .

"An interest rate rise will hit workers long before most see their pay increase, the Bank of England governor warned yesterday. Mark Carney said a rise was ‘getting closer’, indicating it is likely to take place next spring in line with predictions. For workers going through the biggest squeeze on pay since the 1920s, this will mean facing the threat of higher mortgage payments before benefiting from a higher salary. The combination will put impossible pressure on millions of families. Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said 'the Great Recession' had been a 'calamity' for workers . Mr Carney admitted: ‘We are under no illusions. The Great Recession was a calamity. Britain’s workers have borne many of the consequences.’ But he added: ‘The point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer . . . You can expect interest rates to begin to rise.’ Economists expect interest rates, frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009, will be ‘beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually’, he said. It raises the explosive prospect of the first rise for seven years hitting homeowners weeks before the general election in May. Mr Carney said the pay squeeze will go on for several more years, adding that a typical worker’s wages, adjusted for the cost of living, have fallen by a tenth since the start of the crisis. Speaking at the Trades Union Congress in Liverpool, he said: ‘To find such a fall in the past, you would have to go back to the early 1920s.’ Pay rises are still ‘very weak’, he said, 0.6 per cent on average, and are set to show only ‘a modest pick up over coming quarters’. It will take until 2017 for pay rises to reach 4 per cent, he said, but they should exceed inflation ‘around the middle of next year’. Mr Carney said Britons ‘deserve’ a pay rise after a six-year squeeze. He repeated the Bank’s mantra that interest rate rises will be ‘gradual and limited’. Since the Bank was founded in 1694, the average level of interest rates has been 5 per cent. Mr Carney said they will not hit this level in the next few years. He rubbished the idea that the Tories had asked him not to raise rates on the eve of an election. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the annual conference in Liverpool that Britain needed a pay rise . The Bank is ‘absolutely indifferent to the political cycle, to who is in government, who might be in government, who was in government’, he insisted. Mr Carney said unemployment, currently more than two million, will continue to fall. While other countries, such as the US, face ‘a clear danger of a misplaced, if not lost, generation of workers’, he said Britain’s labour market was impressively resilient. The unemployment rate, now 6.4 per cent, will fall to 5.5 per cent ‘over the next three years’ with 1.2million new jobs, he said. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said Mr Carney ‘recognised the pain felt by British workers’. Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, said the speech gave a ‘somewhat depressing’ message that people are working longer for less pay. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the speech ‘seems to support the view that a very gradual increase in interest rates is likely to get under way in February or soon afterwards’.","Bank of England Governor spoke to the Trades Union Congress today .

"Rod Addamo just might be Australia's most dedicated fan boy. The Melbourne-based tiler and father-of-two has been an avid follower of the Marvel universe since he was a child, and is now living the dream in his very own 'Marvel museum' home. 'It encompasses all areas of my life really,' Rod told Daily Mail Australia. 'From our home to the kids to my work and everything in between. It's a real labour of love.' Having fallen in love with comic books at the age of five, Rod has spent the rest of his life collecting, obsessing, and finding ways of incorporating the comics into every area of his life. Rod lost his father as a teenager, and as the eldest child it fell to him to help his mother raise his brothers and sisters. He found that the Marvel universe became more to him than simply a hobby- it became a creed to live by. 'I had to be the man of the house,' explained Rod. 'The creator of the Marvel universe, Stan Lee, put so much pathos into his tales,' 'They taught me about responsibility and about how to do the right thing. I was able to take these lessons and put them into practice in helping out my mum.' Rod Addamo surrounded by his hundreds of collectible figurines in his Melbourne home . In 2011, Rod married his wife Steph in an elaborate Marvel-themed wedding. Taking his fandom to new heights, Rod commissioned a South African artist to design invitations based on a 1980's Spiderman Annual in which Peter Parker marries his long-time love Mary Jane. 'It's an iconic cover, and we made it our own. We used it for the invitations, and created an album for the guests too,' 'I asked the artist to recreate it with myself and Steph as Peter and Mary Jane, and we had all our favourite Marvel characters in the background as wedding guests.' Rod and Steph's invitation for their Marvel-themed wedding in 2011 . Having planned their honeymoon around that year's Comic-Con in New York, Rod started trawling online forums and discovered that the creator of Marvel, Stan Lee, had been announced as a special guest. 'I was so excited,' said Rod. 'I was chatting in a forum with other like-minded fans, and explained to them the story of my dad's passing and how much the Marvel universe had meant to me at that time, and the way it has impacted on my life,' 'Little known to me, one of the members knew Stan Lee's agency, and told them all about my story. They got in contact with me and asked if I'd like to meet him and spend some time together.' The opportunity to meet the man responsible for the world that has meant so much to him was incredible. 'To be able to meet him as an adult, shake his hand, and say thank you to him was just amazing,' said Rod. 'I've actually met him six times now, and I think I can almost call him a friend. Each time he comes to Australia, his agency contacts me and asks if I'd like to come along. I've been so blessed.' Rod has also met many of the other writers and creators of the Marvel universe, including Chris Claremont and Mike McKone. Most recently Rod met Sebastian Stan, who plays Winter Soldier in the latest  Captain America film, at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con. Rod Adammo and his wife Steph with their children Lila, 3, and Logan, 1. It's not only Rod that loves Marvel though. While wife Steph 'has come to love it over time', their two children were involved right from birth. The couple named their daughter Lila Rose, 3, after X-men character Lila Cheney, and their son Logan James, 1, after the character Wolverine. 'They've seen the comic series and I'll introduce them to the movies when they're older,' Rod said. 'All their plates and cups are Marvel. It makes it easy for people to buy presents, so they have Spiderman toothbrushes and X-men pyjamas and other Marvel clothes. All our birthday parties are Marvel themed too- we already have the decorations!' 'It's a real all-in family love now. My friends call our house the 'Marvel Museum'- we've got statues and figurines, posters and costumes, all the movies, comics, novels, and plush toys for all of us.' Rod with a small selection of his extensive collectibles collection . Even the business that Rod co-owns with his brother is dedicated to Marvel. The roof tiling company is called Marvellous Tiling, with the company's logo and van designed with silhouettes of the different characters. 'It's everywhere I go,' said Rod. 'Whether I'm at home with the kids and my wife, or at work, it's a constant in my life,' 'It's a lot of work keeping ahead of the curve in terms of getting the newest collectible and seeing all the movies but's never actually work. It's always fun, and an experience that I get to share with my family'. 'Creeds like Spiderman's ""with great power comes great responsibility"" really resonate with me. Ideas about doing good and doing the right thing have made such an impact on my life,' 'Even though the Marvel characters are 2D images on paper or on screen you can take what they model and apply that to real life,' 'Like most people I gravitate towards heroes, but whilst the broad superhero universe is about adventure and fun, it's also about teaching you about life and giving you a code to live by.' 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is out now on Blu-ray and DVD.","Travels all over the world to meet Marvel writers and artists .

"The mother of a four-year-old girl mauled to death by their pet bulldog has spoken of her agony at losing her 'bubbly' daughter in such horrific circumstances. Lexi Branson was killed when the family's newly-adopted Aylesbury-type bulldog attacked her as watched TV during a sick day off school. An inquest heard how the dog suddenly attacked Lexi, targeting her throat, while her mother Jodi Hudson frantically tried to stop the attack before stabbing the dog to death with a kitchen knife. In a family statement, read today by a police officer outside the coroner's court, Ms Hudson said: 'The last 10 months have been extremely difficult for me and all who knew and loved Lexi. 'She was a bubbly girl who always had a smile and brought happiness to everyone she met. 'We still think about her every day and she lives on in our hearts as we have such wonderful memories of her. Lexi Branson (pictured) died from facial injuries and suffocation caused by the dog's jaws covering her mouth . She added: 'Her death . is still too painful to talk about. I would like to thank all my family, . friends and the members of the public for their support over the last . 10 months. 'Without . them the ordeal would have been far worse and I'm taking each day as it . comes and hopefully in time the tragic events of that afternoon will . ease.' Earlier today, the inquest heard the kennels supplying the large and powerful dog never carried out a home visit. The . dog had been assessed as suitable for re-homing by staff at Willow Tree . Kennels, but with a note it may not be right for a home with 'smaller . children'. Yesterday, Ms Hudson said she had met the dog at the kennels for 15 minutes, and querying the note, was told this was down to its size and 'a tendency to jump up'. Staff also said it showed no sign of aggression, was 'placid', and had 'a lovely temperament'. Senior coroner Trevor Kirkman asked Willow Tree Kennels' owner Michael Watts about its policy and procedures on re-homing. Mr Kirkman said: 'I'm trying to establish the circumstances in which a home visit would be appropriate. 'So we have a large dog, large and powerful - a note it might be better re-homed in a home with no small children.' He added staff also knew Ms Hudson lived in a ground-floor, two-bed flat, then asked Mr Watts: 'When would you consider it appropriate to visit that home?' A sign for Willow Tree Kennels dog re-homing centre, from where the bulldog was picked up by Ms Hudson . Pictured is Mulan, the bulldog which killed Lexi. Unknown to the kennels, the dog had a history of aggressive behaviour and during its time with a previous owner, had attacked another dog . Lexi Branson (pictured) was attacked by the bulldog while she was watching TV during a sick day off school . Mr Watts said it depended on factors including the potential owner's knowledge of dogs and personal circumstances. He also said: 'The dog was not a big dog, it was labrador-sized.' However, yesterday kennel staff said the dog was too big to do a 'pick-up' test, which is used to assess an animal's temperament. Mr Watts added home visits were not always needed in line with industry guidance. None of the staff at the kennels, which was contracted by Leicester City Council to take its strays until last November, had had any external training. At the conclusion of the inquest Mr Watts extended his sympathies to the family. Willow Tree Kennels owner Michael Watts pictured leaving the inquest today . He said the evidence had shown its re-homing procedures were 'in accordance with the principles employed by other similar organisations', and that nobody had 'detected the slightest hint of aggression in the dog' prior to its attack. 'If we had been told that the previous keepers were concerned about aggressive behaviour and were worried about the possibility of such conduct towards their children, then the animal would have been euthanised in our facility and in any other responsible facility.' Flowers and tributes left outside the home of Lexi and her mother last year in the wake of the horrific attack . Recording his short narrative verdict today, Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, said: 'Lexi Branson died as a result of injuries received in an attack upon her by a dog within her home.' He added: 'This must rank as one of the most harrowing cases. 'I know it cannot have been easy to those nearest and dearest to Lexi to have sat through the evidence.' He added: 'I offer my sincere condolences to the members of the family and friends who lost a lovely little girl tragically, in the circumstances we have heard.' Mr Kirkman said there was 'no question of apportioning blame', but said he would be writing a report with recommendations to try and strengthen the rules around re-homing stray dogs. In closing the inquest today, he said his report would be directed at 'the appropriate authorities'. Yesterday the coroner heard Lexi's mother describe the fatal attack. She said the powerful bulldog started 'staring' at her little daughter, before going 'straight for her throat'. Desperate to get the animal - called Mulan - off the girl, she tried to smash a glass over the dog, then pull its legs apart, before trying to pry its jaws loose. She rushed to the kitchen and 'grabbed the largest knife I could find', plunging the blade repeatedly into the dog which eventually released Lexi. The little girl, off sick from school that day, died from facial injuries and suffocation caused by the dog's jaws covering her mouth, a post mortem found. Yesterday the coroner heard an account of the attack from Lexi's mother Jodi Hudson (pictured outside the courthouse today), who described stabbing the animal to death with a kitchen knife after it began mauling her daughter . A series of kennel staff told Mr Kirkman the dog had shown no aggressive behaviour, with one describing it as 'very sweet natured' with a 'lovely temperament'. However, Mulan had recently attacked another family pet at its previous home - a fact unknown to both the kennels and Ms Hudson. The dog only ended up at the kennels when the previous male owner lied to the council dog warden, telling them it was a stray, so he would not have to pay to have it re-homed. Detective Sergeant Kenny Henry, of Leicestershire Police, said it had attacked that previous owner's other dog in the back garden of his Leicester home. That owner also told the RSPCA he was 'concerned for the safety of his own children' following the attack. But while dog warden Jodie Barlow told the inquest Mulan had 'seemed ok' when she first picked it up, a note was shown to court where the warden had described the animal as looking 'like she has been fighting, with marks all over her face'. Mr Kirkman, recording a short narrative verdict, said there was 'no question of apportioning blame', but said he would be writing a report with recommendations to try and 'prevent future such deaths'. Outside the court, the little girl's grandparents welcomed Mr Kirkman's move and said they were 'very surprised' no standard set of rules governing the re-homing of strays already existed. Alan and Kathryn Tait said: 'We're glad he's going to recommend some changes be made regulating the law on re-homing stray dogs. They added: 'We're surprised nothing like that already exists. 'I think people, like we did, just assume those rules are in place, but they're not. It was a shock.' Lexi's grandparents Kathryn and Alan Tait (pictured) said they were shocked to discover there were not rules already in place regarding the re-homing of stray dogs .

"English rower Anna Roots has died after being knocked from her bike during a charity cycle ride . A top woman rower died after being hit by a lorry during a charity cycle ride from  John O'Groats to Lands End. Anna Roots, 34, from London, was killed when she collided with the vehicle on the A836 at Bettyhill in Sutherland, Scotland, on Saturday afternoon. Mrs Roots died on the first day of the 12-day trip, which she was undertaking with friend and fellow rower Rebekah Edgar to raise money for the charity Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. Writing on their JustGiving fundraising webpage, Ms Edgar said: 'On Saturday 6 September, Anna and I embarked on the first leg of a charity bike ride from John O'Groats to Lands End. 'We had been planning the ride for over a year, and were riding in aid of Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research in my memory of Vicky Mustoe. 'The first planned day of our ride took us along the scenic north coast of Scotland to a village called Bettyhill. Tragically as we descended into the village that afternoon Anna was involved in a fatal collision with a lorry. 'Ian, Anna's husband, has asked me to update this page to share pictures of that day, which show Anna enjoying life as she always did.' Mrs Roots, who rowed with the Mortlake Anglian & Alpha Boat Club in Chiswick, west London, rowed successfully in national competitions and represented England at the Commonwealth Rowing Championships in Canada in 2010. Competing in lightweight sculls categories, she also had several trials for Great Britain but did not get into the squad. Mrs Roots, whose husband Ian was a coach at the Mortlake Anglian & Alpha Boat Club, also worked with Mark Edgar, head of GB Rowing's medical services, as an administrator in his private physiotherapy practice. Her mother, Irene, also worked at British Rowing for many years. Mrs Roots (left), who rowed with the Mortlake Anglian & Alpha Boat Club in Chiswick, west London, rowed successfully in national competitions and represented England at the Commonwealth Rowing Championships . The tragic accident happened as Mrs Roots cycled through the village of Bettyhill in northern Scotland . A spokeswoman for British Rowing said: 'We are all saddened by the news and are thinking about all of her close friends and family at what will be a sad time for them.' Tributes were left for Mrs Roots on her JustGiving page, where funds have reached around £10,000. Colin and Sally Thatcher wrote: 'This donation is for the girls' heroic efforts throughout and comes with great sadness over the death of dear Anna. A truly lovely person who will be sadly missed by all who came into contact with her.' A woman who gave her name as Louise added: 'Darling Anna. I will never forget your beautiful smile, your love of life, and your beautiful soul. My thoughts are with Ian and your mum and dad. I'm heartbroken.' Donations have since flooded in to Mrs Roots' just giving page and she has now raised for £10,000 for charity . In a message on Ms Edgar's Facebook page, Emily Booker wrote: 'Such a tragic accident and terrible waste of a truly lovely person, unpretentious and always friendly and smiling. 'I saw her last at Henley Vets Regatta this year (with dog) just after you had won in your quad, hard to believe she is no longer here. Thinking of you and Ian at this time, lots of love xx'. And Suzanne Hutchings said: 'Still shaking after having just read your post and not quite believing what it said at first. What tragic tragic news. 'My heart goes out to you and Ian. The rowing community has lost a true gem and a great national and international champion. I didn't know her that well but I do know she was hugely talented, respected and loved.' A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'At about 3.15pm on the 6th of September 2014, on the A836 at Bettyhill, a collision occurred between an articulated lorry and a bicycle. 'As a result of the collision the female rider of the bicycle sustained fatal injuries.'","Anna Roots was cycling from north Scotland to the southern tip of Britain .

"A jury has convicted a Mississippi man who was declared dead two decades ago only to resurface as a murder suspect. Jurors took just over an hour Monday before finding Thomas Sanders guilty in the kidnapping and slaying of 12-year-old Lexis Roberts. The penalty phase begins next week. Jurors will decide whether the 57-year-old Sanders will be put to death or spend the rest of his life in prison. Back from the dead: Thomas Steven Sanders, who went missing in Mississippi in 1987 and declared dead in 1994, has been found guilty of the 2010 slaying of his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter . Murdered: Lexis Roberts, 10, of Las Vegas, was found dead off a dirt track in remote Louisiana woods on October 8, 2010. She had been and her throat was slit . Prosecutors concluded their case against Sanders on Friday. Defense lawyers called no witnesses after failing to get the case thrown out of federal court. Roberts' skeletal remains were found off a gravel trail in rural Louisiana in October 2010. The body of her mother, Suellen Roberts, was found later in Arizona. Sanders confessed to killing both. Prosecutor Bill Flanagan said Sanders shot the girl's mother, Suellen Roberts, on a trip all three took to a wildlife park near the Grand Canyon, then drove Lexis Roberts to Louisiana, where he shot her four times and cut her throat. Gibbens, who offered no explanation for the shootings called it 'a vacation that went terribly, horribly, sadly wrong'. Sanders was identified as a suspect long after he was thought dead. Sanders had left his family in Mississippi in 1987, and his relatives and ex-wife had him declared dead in 1994 after he had been missing for years. A middle-aged, balding man, Sanders sat quietly with his lawyers as the killings were described, periodically wiping his eyes. Sanders was found guilty of both crimes: kidnapping resulting in death and using a firearm in a crime of violence that caused a person's death. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Killed: Lexi Roberts' (right) skeletal remains were found off a gravel trail. Her mother's body (inset) was later found in Arizona . During the case, witnesses described finding Lexis Roberts' remains on hunting property. Photos of a skull with small pink braces still attached to the upper teeth were shown in court, along with a purple unicorn stuffed animal that was found in the woods near Roberts' bones. Sanders' lawyers didn't dispute that the remains were identified as Lexis Roberts. Flanagan said Sanders met Suellen Roberts while working and living at a storage facility in Las Vegas. Within a few months, they started dating and planned the Labor Day weekend trip that would end with both mother and daughter shot and killed, the prosecutor said. After visiting a wildlife refuge known as Bearizona and stopping at the Grand Canyon, the trio pulled into a remote stretch of desert off an interstate so Suellen Roberts could shoot Sanders' .22-caliber rifle, Flanagan said. Instead, Sanders shot the mother in the head while her daughter sat on a blanket nearby, Flanagan said. Sanders left the body where it fell and drove Lexis Roberts over several days to northeast Louisiana, where he shot her three times in the head and once in the chest, the prosecutor said. Brutal: Sanders (left) shot the mother in the head while her daughter sat on a blanket nearby .

"Former prime minister Gordon Brown last night invoked the memory of his late baby daughter to ‘nail the SNP lie’ that Scotland's health service is at risk of privatisation. Mr Brown was close to tears as he made the personal plea, accusing Alex Salmond of misleading people over the issue, which he described as a ‘Trojan horse’ in the independence referendum debate. The SNP has repeatedly argued that the only way to save the health service from privatisation in Scotland is a Yes vote. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Gordon Brown spoke from the heart as he launched a passionate defence of the NHS . Gordon Brown, his wife Sarah and their children John (left) and Fraser (right), leave Downing Street after he announced his resignation as Prime Minister in 2010 . Addressing activists in Glasgow, Mr Brown's voice wavered slightly as he spoke about his baby daughter Jennifer Jane, who died from a brain haemorrhage in 2002. Mr Brown rarely speaks publicly about his family and is fiercely protective about any of his children appearing in public. The speech yesterday marks Mr Brown's de-facto takeover of the 'No' campaign from his former Chancellor Alistair Darling. Anti-independence campaigners hope the former Prime Minister's continuing respect in Scotland could help convince wavering voters to urge on the side of caution and reject independence. Mr Brown's vitriolic clashes with David Cameron in the run up to the 2010 general election may also help to neutralise the SNP claim that a 'No' vote is a tick in the box for the Tories. As well as invoking the memory of his late daughter, Mr Brown also spoke about how his sight was saved after a rugby accident left him blind in one eye at the age of 16. The Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP said: ‘I love Scotland, I love the NHS. I was born into the NHS, I grew up in the NHS, my family grew up in the NHS. ‘When I lost the sight of my eye and faced the prospect of going blind, my sight was saved by the NHS. ‘When my daughter died it was as the result of not being able, not being able, to do anything to save her life and my respect for the NHS grew as a result of the experience that Sarah and I had. ‘Do you think that I or anybody else who cares about the NHS would stand by and do nothing if we thought the NHS was going to be privatised in Scotland and its funds were going to be cut? Would we stand back and do nothing without a fight? Of course not. ‘We created the NHS, we, not the SNP, built the NHS, we cherished the NHS, in Government we took the pain of a tax rise to double the budget of the NHS. ‘The only people who could put the Scottish Parliament and the health service in Scotland at risk is the SNP, not the Labour Party.’ Mr Brown outlined his plan on devolving more powers to the Scottish parliament at Scottish Labour's Glasgow HQ . Mr Brown, who will speak at 40 events in the days leading up to the referendum on September 18, said it is time to ‘nail the SNP lie’. He said: ‘The NHS cannot be privatised if that's not the will of the Scottish people and the Scottish health service will have the funding that's necessary if that's also the will of the Scottish people. ‘Our proposals for a Scottish Parliament with more powers enhance the prospect for that funding over the next few years, without the disruption, the chaos and uncertainty and the loss that will occur if we break from the United Kingdom.’ The leaders of the three main pro-union parties have come together to pledge more powers for Scotland if it rejects independence. Mr Brown, who set out a proposed timetable for greater autonomy for Holyrood yesterday, said these additional powers would bring ‘faster, fairer, safer and better’ change. The Brown's ten-day-old daughter died in her parents arms  three days after suffering a brain haemorrhage. The funeral (pictured) took place at St Bryce Kirk in Kirkcaldy, Scotland on January 11, 2002 . He said: ‘The choice on September 18th is really between two different kinds of change. ‘The change sought by the nationalists - breaking all constitutional connections with our friends, neighbours and family in the rest of the UK - places the dogma of independence over the needs and interests of the Scottish people. ‘But the proposals supported by the pro-devolution parties offer faster change, fairer change, safer change and better change. It is the change that most of us want and change that brings Scotland together. ‘We have now answered the question that the people of Scotland had for us about the certainty of change within the UK. Now it is time for Alex Salmond to answer the huge questions people have about independence.’","Mr Brown's voice cracked as he spoke about his late baby daughter .

"A retired military pilot survived a horrifying crash over the weekend when his plane went down in the water just off of Miami Beach. Brian Haggerty, a Vietnam War vet who spent 21 years flying for the U.S. Air Force, plummeted into the ocean Saturday afternoon when his engine failed, and thought for sure that was the end. Lucky for him, his military training kicked in, and he was somehow able to get out of his submerged plane just as some jet skiers took off towards the site of the crash to make an astonishing and heroic rescue. Scroll down for video . Saved at sea: Brian Haggerty (above) was taken to safety by a jet skier after his plane crashed in the water off Miami beach on Saturday afternoon . Wreckage: The retired military pilot says his engine died, and less than 20 seconds later he hit the water . 'I thought, ""Okay, I'm going to be dead in 5 seconds,""' Haggerty revealed in an interview with CBS 4. Even as he fell from the sky though, his first concern was making sure no one else would be hurt in the crash. 'It was apparent that I wasn't going to get [the engine] started again, so I looked clear to make sure that nobody was in front of me, boats or swimmers or anything,' he said. 'It was clear that I didn't want to hurt anybody, and I just made a radio call. ""Engine quit, I'm going in the water.""' Less than 20 seconds later he said he hit the water, which felt like 'somebody threw a concrete block at you.' That is when he quickly managed to inflate his life vest and get out an open window, immediately swimming towards the shore. Lucky to be alive: Haggerty (above) was using the aircraft as a banner plane, promoting a nearby club . Back to work: The Vietnam War vet says this is the first time he has had plane tropuble, and he plans on returning to work sooner rather than later . As luck would have it however, nearby jet skiers were already on their way to the crash site, approximately 900 feet off the beach, and managed to intercept the pilot, who other than some scratches and bleeding on his face was not horribly injured. 'I got on a Jet Ski and went out there, the pilot was already out of the plane, he had a floating device on,' said George Daly, who was working on the beach at the time. 'I asked him if there was anybody else on the plane, he said no.' Daly then immediately got Haggerty in from the water. Haggerty was flying a 1951 U.S. Army aircraft. which he now uses as a banner plane, promoting local clubs. He said this is the first time he has ever had any plane problems in his life. The near fatal flight hasn't fazed him either, as he says he is ready to get back up in the air sooner rather than later. 'I'll probably try to get on schedule and tow a banner this week, although my wife told me I'm not,' he said.","Brian Haggerty crashed into the waters off Miami Beach on Saturday afternoon when the engine of his plane died .

"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney addressed the TUC Congress at the BT Convention Centre, Liverpool today . Sharing the pound is ‘incompatible’ with independence, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said today. Mr Carney said a separate Scotland could not forge a currency union with the rest of the UK because it needed a shared central bank and controls over public spending. The Bank chief, speaking at the Trades Union Conference in Liverpool, warned that without these in place Scotland would risk a Eurozone-style crisis. Mr Carney’s remarks are a significant intervention against the Scottish National Party’s plans for independence. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted that the Government is bluffing that it will block a formal currency union after independence. The ‘No’ campaign against intervention will hope to use Mr Carney’s remarks to convince wavering Scottish voters that they risk losing the pound in the event of independence. In January Mr Carney warned that a currency union – like the Eurozone - ‘requires some ceding of national sovereignty’. Today, he went even further, declaring: ‘A currency union is incompatible with sovereignty.’ Unions in favour of Scotland staying within the UK welcomed the comments. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said: ‘The comments were a breath of fresh air. ‘People keep talking about whether there is a Plan B or Plan C, but there aren't any, because it is incompatible, as the governor has made clear.’ Mr Carney said there had to be three things in place to make a currency union work. He said these were the free movement of goods and services across the different parts of the currency, a banking union underpinned by common institutions such as a central bank, and controls on spending. The subject of currency has been a political battleground after George Osborne said earlier this summer that an independent Scotland could not keep the pound. Scroll down for video . Only this weekend Mr Osborne reiterated the prospect of a currency union. The Chancellor said: ‘No ifs, no buts, we will not share the pound if Scotland separated from the rest of the UK.’ That position has been backed by both Labour and the Lib Dems. SNP leaders have refused to offer a ‘Plan B’ alternative to a continued formal currency union. Mr Osborne's threat to block a currency union was trumped this weekend by a stark warning from the Labour leader Ed Miliband that border guards could be deployed in the event of a 'Yes' vote. Mr Carney (left) with TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady (right) in Liverpool today . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has dismissed the threats from Westminster to block a currency union . He said: ‘If you don’t want borders, vote to stay in the United Kingdom.' Asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was Prime Minister, Mr Miliband warned: ‘It would have to be looked at.’ And Mr Miliband’s spokesman added: ‘The last time I looked there were two sides to the border – and we would be in charge of one of them. It would be up to us, not Mr Salmond, to secure our northern border.’","Bank of England Governor warns Scots over currency union proposal .

"Now there's a 'squishy' robot that can be frozen, lit on fire and crushed by a car, and still wriggle away. Researchers at Harvard University led by Michael Tolley presented a robot last month that can withstand extreme environments because its body lacks the rigid parts that hinder traditional robotics. The project was partially funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, a branch of the Department of Defense that finances technology projects for civilian and military purposes. Scroll down for video . Indestructible: Harvard researchers crushed their robot, lit it on fire and subjected it to subzero temperatures, and it still kept crawling . The soft robot in action resembles a dying person crawling on its hands and knees and New Scientist showed a video of it being run over by a car, walking over an open flame and pulling itself through the snow. The new design from Harvard also improves on earlier soft robot designs with a larger size and the ability to move without being 'tethered' to an air compressor, meaning it can operate outside the lab. The silicone rubber body can withstand subzero temperatures, outlasting Winter Storm Nemo in testing in 2013, when temperatures dropped below -15 degrees Fahrenheit and winds blew almost 25 miles per hour. The prototype still has some rigid components that make the final design weaker. The air compressors that inflate and deflate the robot to make it move, as well as a battery pack that provides several hours of energy are exposed on the top. The authors state that the next step is to move these components inside the rubber body to protect them. Some day it may be possible to replace these rigid components with soft ones. Living color: Fluorescent-colored liquid is pumped into one 'soft' robot, showing the channels imprinted in the soft silicone rubber . Under the skin: Colored liquid can be pumped in an out of channels, allowing the robot to be camouflaged in different environments . Soft robots are not a new concept. One of the first soft robots able to walk and crawl debuted in . 2011 and came from the same research lab as the one developed by Tolley. A later model could be camouflaged against its surroundings by pumping colored liquid through its body. In addition to military use, researchers envision soft robotics being used in more advanced prosthetic limbs and assisting in surgery.","A group of scientists led by Michael Tolley presented a robot without rigid components that can handle open flames and subzero temperatures .

"Big Brother winner Helen Wood unwittingly led police to her firearms fugitive lover after he left the country for Cyprus and she then went there on holiday, a court heard. Louis Larsson, 29, was released halfway through a five-year prison sentence but then went on the run to the Mediterranean. But he was arrested after police followed Miss Wood, 27, to his hideout a year later, Bolton Crown Court heard. His ex-girlfriend won Big Brother 2014 last month vowing to use the £100,000 prize to put her past problems behind her. Scroll down for video . Manhunt: Big Brother winner Helen Wood unwittingly led police to her firearms fugitive lover Louis Larsson after she headed to Cyprus for a break at his hideout . She first came to public attention after allegedly sleeping with footballer Wayne Rooney in 2010 ahead of the World Cup in South Africa while his wife Coleen was pregnant. Larsson, who has also used the surname Kettle, was jailed in October 2010, after pleading guilty to possession of firearm parts and reactivation equipment. But after being released on licence, he went abroad in May last year, breaching the terms of his licence. Detectives finally caught up with him just under a year later, thanks to Miss Wood's holiday. Geoff Whelan, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant fled the jurisdiction and was arrested on an international arrest warrant in Cyprus in spring this year. 'Police followed his girlfriend Helen, who gained notoriety in Big Brother, and arrested him there.' Miss Wood won Big Brother 2014 last month vowing to use the £100,000 prize to put her past problems behind her . It is understood Miss Wood is no longer in a relationship with Larsson. He was arrested in Paphos in Cyprus in April 2014, after a joint investigation between Greater Manchester Police, Cypriot police and the National Crime Agency to track him down. Larsson was returned to HMP Forest Bank to serve the remainder of his five-year sentence and, yesterday, he was given a further 20-month sentence, to run alongside his current sentence, for two fresh charges of possession of ammunition, to which he pleaded guilty. These related to a raid at a house in  Little Lever, in May, 2013, the same month that he fled the country. The court heard that police found a working cannabis farm inside the terraced house, although neither the defendant nor anybody else has ever been charged in relation to the discovery. Two rounds of ammunition were found on a shelf in the kitchen. They were found to contain all the ingredients to make ammunition and one fired while the other misfired. Other components, including bullets and casings, were found with Larsson's fingerprints on them. They had been ordered from an online dealer, who informed the police that Larsson had placed the order. Larsson was arrested in Paphos in Cyprus in April 2014, after a joint investigation between forces in the UK and Cyprus . David Bentley, defending, said Larsson had long been interested in military memorabilia and already has a job in the dental industry lined up for when he leaves prison. He said: 'Of the two that were recovered, one misfired, which was expected. 'One fired and the defendant showed a great deal of surprise that this occured although he accepts culpability.' Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'This sentence will not add to your current sentence but with convictions like this behind you, if you put so much as even the smallest foot out of line in the future in relation to firearms you can expect absolutely no mercy at the hands of the court.' Larsson was acquitted of three counts of conspiracy to possess firearms in July after he was accused of bringing firearms to The Lancashire Gunroom for its owner Cyrus Shahabi-Shack to sell. Larsson will not be released before April 29, 2016. Miss Wood was unavailable for comment.","Police found Louis Larsson, 29, after Helen Wood, 27, took break to Med .

"A 22-year-old man studying at University of Canberra has been accused of raping a man after luring the teenager for sex with a fake woman’s Facebook profile. Billy Barthomeuz Tamawiyi, a devout Christian studying in Australia on an Indonesian government scholarship, has been refused bail in the ACT Magistrates Court after allegedly raping his 18-year-old victim in late August. It is claimed Tamawiyi created a Facebook page with the pseudonym ‘Taylor Edwards’ and targeting his victim. When Tamawiyi met with the 18-year-old, it’s alleged he raped the man and threatened him over the phone. Billy Barthomeuz Tamawiyi has been refused bail in the ACT Magistrates Court after allegedly raping his 18-year-old victim in late August . The 22-year-old man has been charged with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent; and one charge of blackmail, using a carriage service for child pornography material and using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend. ‘The alleged offender used a fictitious Facebook profile to communicate with the 18-year-old victim over a period of time,’ ACT Police Media confirm. ‘As a part of this communication, the man sent the victim photographs and a series of demands while pretending to be the young woman.’ The politics and international relations student has been refused bail, as Magistrate Bernadette Boss believes Tamawiyi is a flight risk, will offend again or will be a threat to the victim. Detective Superintendent Paul Shakeshaft of Criminal Investigations warns the public of the various risks they are susceptible to through social media use. ‘Fictitious profiles are becoming more prevalent and are used to deceive people in a number of different ways.

"Those who wish to break ties with the United States will have to pay over four times the price as more and more Americans seek to renounce their citizenship than ever before perhaps to avoid paying U.S. taxes.

Though prices are going up, the number people hoping to leave the county will probably stay about the same. Pushed for change: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas wants to make a law saying anyone who identifies with a terrorist organization should have their citizen revoked . Many of the people leaving are affluent and are hoping to avoid paying U.S. taxes and can afford to pay a bit more. Andrew Mitchel of the State Department told Yahoo News that the fine is designed to weed out those who may not really be committed to talking the step of renouncing citizenship. 'They want to impress upon those individuals that there’s no going back,' he said. 'They’re making sure that you really, really want to renounce your citizenship.' In addition to paying a fee, people wishing to leave the United States behind will need to go in person, overseas before an American diplomatic officer can sign an oath of renunciation. In order to renounce citizenship a person must complete a questionnaire that asks people to say if they ever lived in the U.S., if they've gotten foreign citizenship, and how. The questionnaire does not ask why they have decided to disband themselves with America. Even those citizens who have fought for the extremist Islamic militant group called Islamic State or IS will not be automatically stripped of citizenship unless they fill out the questionnaire. Not opposed: To the chagrin of some liberals, Secretary of State Hilary Clinton said she was not necessarily opposed to Cruz's proposal and that U.S. citizenship is a privilege not a right . By making it harder for terrorists to lose their citizenship, it will make it easier for Americans fighting for a terrorist group to be killed by a drone rather than lose their citizenship against their will. Americans have placed high value on American citizenship and unless someone commits a 'potentially expatriating act,' they will not be denied citizenship. 'The Department has a uniform administrative standard of evidence based on the premise that U.S. nationals intend to retain United States nationality when they perform potentially expatriating acts, ‘an official told Yahoo News. Some politicians like republican Senator Ted Cruz believe that people who fight for militant groups like ISIS should have their citizenship immediately revoked for fear they could re-enter the country to carry out an attack/. The State Department met Cruz's proposal with resistance. 'We have the authority now to revoke their passports under U.S. law if the secretary makes a determination about their threat to U.S. national security.  We already have that power,' Marie Hart, a deputy spokesperson for the department, said. 'We also have the power if there’s a law enforcement request to revoke their passport if there’s an outstanding warrant or something like that.' In 2010, Senator Joe Lieberman also tried to get the law changed so that anyone who provides support or resources to terrorists would have their citizenship stripped from them. Hilary Clinton didn't object to Lieberman's proposal and said she would take a 'hard look' at it. 'Clearly, United States citizenship is a privilege,” she said at the time. “It is not a right.'","The State Department once charged $450 .

She has been trying to get the page removed for the last four weeks, but officials at the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) say they can't take action without his user and password. An investigation has been launched to establish how Kennedy was able to access Facebook in side the unit in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, as inmates are banned from using mobile phones. Shea Wilson told KARK: 'We are still investigating what happened in this case, it is obvious the inmate was able to get an electronic device and get on Facebook.'

"Just three British authors appear on the shortlist for this year's Man Booker Prize after a change to the literary award opened the door for international writers for the first time. Past Booker winner Howard Jacobson and Ali Smith, who has twice made the shortlist, join Calcutta-born and London-based author Neel Mukherjee in representing British talent. For the first time, the six-strong shortlist includes authors from the U.S. after a rule change opened the award up to writers from any nationality writing in English who had their book published in the UK. Previous winner: British author Howard Jacobson, left, took home the prize in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question. This year he will hope to win with his futuristic love story J, pictured right . Previously the competition, which recognises the year's best fiction, was open to entrants from the Commonwealth, Republic of Ireland and Zimbabwe. The announcement last year that the Booker was dropping its geographical . borders came in the wake of the launch of the Folio Prize - seen by . many as a rival award - which attracted an international field. Two American writers - Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler - and Australian author Richard Flanagan make up the rest of the shortlist, which the judges took three hours and 40 minutes to whittle down the shortlist from the longlist of 13. The winner of the prize, which will be announced on 14 October, will take home £50,000. Judges said the strong British presence . on the shortlist was not the result of tokenism and that fears that the . prize would be 'flooded by quality American novels to the detriment of . everything else' following the change in rules had been unfounded. Howard Jacobson, who won the prize in 2010, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as 'What Happened, If It Happened'. Shortlist veteran: Scottish-born novelist Ali Smith is nominated for How To Be Both. She was nominated in 2001 for her novel Accidental in 2005 and Hotel World, published in 2001 . Judges described Jacobson's novel, set in a Britain which has been 'changed . utterly' following 'some kind of national tragedy' as 'very funny, very . troubling and very surprising'. They added that the novel says things that remain unspoken 'except in perhaps the darkest recesses of the internet'. This is the 46th year that the Booker Prize has been awarded - and is the first time that the judges have considered entries from international authors. Previously, the competition was open to entrants from the Commonwealth, Republic of Ireland and Zimbabwe. PH Newby was the first winner of the prize in 1969 with Something to Answer For, while Yann Martel was the first winner of the Man Booker Prize with Life of Pi in 2002 - after Man Group plc came on board as sponsor. The Booker Prize initially awarded £5,000 to its winners. The prize . money doubled in 1978 to £10,000, and today the winner receives £50,000. Each of the shortlisted authors receives £2,500. Since 1969, 30 men and 16 women have won the prize. Hilary Mantel is the first woman and the first British author to win the . prize twice. JM Coetzee was the first person to win twice, in 1983 and . again in 1999, when he described the Booker as ‘the ultimate prize to . win in the English speaking world’. Mantel is also the first and only author to win for two books in a triology - Wolf Hall and Bringing Up The Bodies.Last year's winner, The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, was the longest in the prize's history at 832 pages. Source: The Man Booker Prize . Scottish-born Smith was one of only three women on the 13-strong longlist for her inventive new novel, How To Be Both. The . book tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in . 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the . reader can decide which half to read first. Judges hailed the novel as a 'genre-bending' tale about art and its versatility. The two British authors have been named joint-favourite to win by bookmaker William Hill. Calcutta-born author Mukherjee, who is now based in London, draws on his background in his novel The Lives of Others, which begins in the city in 1967. Judges described Mukherjee's . book as a 'sweeping epic' about a wealthy family in decline in Calcutta . set against a 'tumultuous' backdrop. Joshua Ferris's . third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through . the eyes of a dentist, who spends the day looking at death and decay but . cannot find solace in religion. Fellow author Stephen King called it 'funny, thought-provoking and touching'. Australia's Richard . Flanagan is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep . North, a haunting account of the Australian servicemen who, as Japanese . prisoners of war, were forced to build the so-called Burma railway. The . author, from Tasmania, wrote the book in tribute to his late father who . survived the experience - but thousands more did not. Karen Joy Fowler is best known for her light-hearted novel The Jane Austen Book . Club. She is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. In this latest work, love is again the theme, this time entwined with the family and the notion of such 'stranger' intrusion. Omissions from the shortlist include popular writers David Nicholls and . David Mitchell, both of whom had been included on the longlist which was . unveiled in July. British author: Calcutta-born author Mukherjee, draws on his background in his novel The Lives of Others, which tells the story of the lives of two Bengali families. The author is now based in London . Writer and . philosopher AC Grayling, chair of this year's judges, said: ‘We are . delighted to announce our international shortlist. 'As the Man Booker . Prize expands its borders, these six exceptional books take the reader . on journeys around the world, between the UK, New York, Thailand, Italy, . Calcutta and times past, present and future. 'We . had a lengthy and intensive debate to whittle the list down to these . six.  It is a strong, thought-provoking shortlist which we believe . demonstrates the wonderful depth and range of contemporary fiction in . English.’ Hollywood credentials: Australia's Richard Flanagan, who co-wrote the script for Baz Luhrmann's Australia, is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North . He . said that it was a 'very, very rich year' for literature which 'makes . the task of judging very, very difficult'. He added 'That's just how the . cards fell.' He said that the fiction genre was 'flourishing' despite competition from other media. Judge . Sarah Churchwell said that, while historical fiction had dominated . previous shortlists, 'fiction about the contemporary moment and the . recent past is making a resurgence'. American dream: Karen Joy Fowler, who is best known for her light-hearted novel The Jane Austen Book Club, is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves . She said: 'We had plenty of historical novels but these are all very contemporary novels. The contemporary is coming into its own and finding its teeth again.' She said that some of the novels on the shortlist asked new questions about what it is like to live in a digital world. Grayling and the judging panel of Jonathan Bate, Sarah Churchwell, . Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner will now re-read the . titles to select a winner who will be announced at a ceremony to be . staged at the Guildhall in London on October 14. New rules: Joshua Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a dentist. He is one of two American authors on the six-strong shortlist . Ali Smith (UK), How To Be Both . How to be Both is a novel all about art's versatility.  Borrowing from painting's fresco technique to make an original literary double-take, it's a fast-moving genre-bending conversation between forms, times, truths and fictions. There's a renaissance artist of the 1460s.  There's the child of a child of the 1960s.  Two tales of love and injustice twist into a singular yarn where time gets timeless, structural gets playful, knowing gets mysterious, fictional gets real - and all life's givens get given a second chance. This is the third time that Scottish-born Smith has made the shortlist. She was previously acknowledged for her second novel Hotel World, published in 2001, and 2005 entry The Accidental. Howard Jacobson (UK), J . Set in the future, a world where the past is a dangerous country, not to be talked about or visited, J is a love story of incomparable strangeness, both tender and terrifying. Hanging over the lives of all the characters in this novel is a momentous catastrophe – a past event shrouded in suspicion, denial and apology, now referred to as What Happened, If It Happened. Jacobson won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, beating contenders including double winner Peter Carey. Neel Mukherjee (UK), The Lives of Others . Calcutta-born author Mukherjee, . now based in London, draws on his background in his novel The Lives of Others, which begins . in the city in 1967. Judges described Mukherjee's . book as a 'sweeping epic' about a wealthy family in decline in Calcutta . set against a 'tumultuous' backdrop. Joshua Ferris (US), To Rise Again at a Decent Hour .

"'Considerate': Father-of-one Ashley Barrell, pictured outside court today, was praised for not hitting pedestrians and driving at 20mph in the stolen vehicle . A drunk teenager stole a bus from its depot so he could get home after spending the last of his money on a portion of chips. Ashley Barrell had spent the night drinking in Colchester, Essex, before sneaking into the depot in Magdalen Street in the town centre, where he helped himself to a single-decker bus in the early hours of the morning. The 19-year-old got behind the wheel and started up the engine - using its button-press ignition. He bumped into two parked buses as he pulled away before smashing through locked metal gates and out onto the road. A First Bus security guard reported the theft and Barrell was followed by a police officer as he drove towards his Colchester home. The 20mph chase was brought to a halt two miles later by officers using a 'stinger' device to puncture the tyres. Barrell, a father-of-one, was arrested on the bus and charged with aggravated vehicle taking and driving whilst drunk following the slow-paced pursuit on 24 August. He pleaded guilty to both charges when he appeared before Colchester Magistrates’ Court today and was sentenced to four months in a young offenders institution. Barrell, who works as a roofer, was sentenced to four months for the aggravated vehicle taking and three months for drink-driving, with the sentences to run concurrently. He was also banned from driving for 18 months. The court heard how police officers had remarked on the considerate nature of Barrell’s driving. Ita Farrelly, mitigating, revealed that he had only driven the bus home because he 'spent the last of his money on chips' after his night drinking. She said: 'He was walking home with his chips in hand. He passed the depot and had heard a rumour that the buses were not locked. 'He got in and pressed the button to start up the bus. It is not a usual vehicle, it does not require a key, and the bus started and he drove the bus. 'He thought he could go to his home, get out of the bus and leave it there but, of course, it is going to attract attention and get a lot of comments at the depot when they realised that the bus was missing.' Miss Farrelly praised Barrell for the nature of his driving, saying once out of the depot he did not hit any pedestrians or vehicles and only went onto pavements so he would not smash into pedestrian traffic islands. She added: 'It was an incident which was stupid in nature. Simply to get a bus rise home and put himself at risk and members of the pubic at risk. It was a vary grave mistake.' A First Bus security guard reported the theft from the bus depot on Magdalen Street (pictured) and Barrell was followed by a police officer as he drove towards his Colchester home . Wayne Ablett, prosecuting said: 'At 3.50am Mr Barrell was seen starting up one of the buses within the private property and was driving out of the front of the yard causing damage to two other buses in the process. 'He then drove towards the secure metal gates and through them and out onto the road.' Mr Ablett told the court Barrell’s actions caused about £2,000 of damage to the buses involved. Barrell was breathalysed and gave a reading of nearly twice the legal limit. Barrell faced four charges; aggravated vehicle taking, driving whilst drunk and driving without insurance and driving without a licence. The counts of driving without insurance and driving without a licence were dropped at court today. The court heard that Barrell's driving of the single-decker bus caused about £2,000 of damage to the vehicles involved.

"A hoarder died after it is believed he became trapped inside his flat by piles of his possessions as a massive fire ripped through his home.

Neioghbours, who paid tribute to the . 'kind and caring' man, said they had tried on several . occasions to get him help to clear his flat. Robert Crane died after a fire broke out at his flat. Around forty fire-fighters battled the blaze at a block of homes in Kingsdown, Bristol. He was aid to have been trapped inside his flat by piles of his possessions .

Susan Hill, 40, who lived directly below him, said: 'He was a lovely bloke, really kind and caring. 'He didn’t have a bad bone in his body. He used to love music and would play it on the weekends. 'Unfortunately he probably did get trapped in there. The council had been told time and time again and they just seem to have done nothing. 'It was no good just talking to him. Something needed to be done. People said he needed to go to a residential place to be looked after properly.'

Another resident, Richard Angove, 46, who lives on the fourth floor of the building with his two children, said that it was a miracle no one else was hurt during the fire, .

"The English regions will be given extra powers as a domino effect if Scotland votes to remain in the UK, Nick Clegg said yesterday. The move would also affect Wales and Northern Ireland and would result in a ‘much needed rewiring’ of how the UK is governed. Mr Clegg described England as an ‘unusually over-centralised country’ and said the changes that would occur in the next parliament were the ‘missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle’. Scroll down for video . The Deputy Prime Minister described England as an ‘unusually over-centralised country’ said the changes that would occur in the next parliament were the ‘missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle’ Under questioning from MPs, the Deputy Prime Minister insisted the sudden announcement of a timetable for significant Scottish devolution – dubbed ‘Devo Max’ – was not a panicked move. Devolution in Scotland was an irreversible process and would have knock-on effects for the rest of the UK, particularly the English regions, which would be given greater powers over tax and spending. ‘I think it will signal a much wider rewiring of the governance and constitutional arrangements in the country as a whole, particularly governance within England which remains an unusually over-centralised country,’ Mr Clegg told the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee. When Scotland is granted further powers over taxation, welfare and borrowing ‘that will signal a wider debate about how we can rewire and decentralise the British state… that’s the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle’, he said. Former prime minister Gordon Brown has set out his proposed schedule for new powers to be transferred to Holyrood, saying work on it would start immediately after the referendum. Former prime minister Gordon Brown has set out his proposed schedule for new powers to be transferred to Holyrood, saying work on it would start immediately after the referendum . Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats joined together in Edinburgh yesterday to promise more devolution in the event of a No vote. But there was continued confusion as to what powers would be devolved, as the three parties have each separately published differing proposals. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the parties’ devolution proposals have ‘broad themes’ in common and that voting No would allow the parties to mould them into a single offering. But Alex Salmond said it showed the No campaign had ‘fallen apart at the seams’. The First Minister said: ‘We now know after all of the hype of the last 48 hours they realised that the ground was shifting under their feet. But actually, nothing is new in this package. It’s nothing approaching the powers that Scotland needs to create jobs, to save the health service and build a better society.’ Andrew George, Lib Dem MP for West Cornwall, made an early plea yesterday for his county to be ‘next in line’ for devolved powers. Mr Clegg admitted the Devo Max announcement this week was about ‘timetable and process’ not the substance of the powers – saying doing so would violate referendum campaign rules. He defended the Government against claims it blundered by not offering a Devo Max option on the ballot paper. ‘When you have a referendum it’s very important you have clarity and certainty about what the choice is. That’s why you only devolve powers after a decision has been made by the Scottish people that Scotland will be part of the United Kingdom.’ Scots get home rule, England pays bill . The Scots have been promised an array of new powers if they vote to stay in the UK. JAMES SLACK examines the likely consequences. What extra tax-raising powers will the Scots get? While the final details are still being hammered out, the prominent role taken by Gordon Brown suggests Labour’s blueprint will be at the forefront. This would allow MSPs to vary Westminster’s income tax rate by up to 15p in the pound, giving them the option of raising the higher rate threshold, and restoring the punitive 50p rate for top earners. There would be no new powers over corporation tax, national insurance, VAT or capital gains tax. The Tories say the tax-free personal income tax allowance should remain reserved to Westminster. Under Lib Dem proposals the Scots would raise and spend most of their own taxes and borrow on their own terms. Alex Salmond, pictured with David Cameron in 2012 signing the referendum agreement, has been peddling the myth that Scots should vote Yes to protect the NHS, but it is already run entirely by the administration . How will the money be collected? As now, all income tax will be paid into the UK treasury before being passed on to Scotland in the form of a grant. In future, if Holyrood decides to increase – or decrease – taxes on Scots the HMRC will adjust their bills accordingly and pass the appropriate sum on to Scotland. Will Scotland’s benefits regime be more generous? Yes, if that’s how Holyrood chooses to spend the money. Under Labour’s plan, control of housing benefit – which costs £1.7billion in Scotland – would be devolved, so it’s expected the so-called bedroom tax would immediately be axed, at a cost of £50million. Attendance Allowance, paid to disabled or infirm OAPs, will also be devolved. It’s feared that, armed with the new tax powers, the Left-wing SNP would hammer middle and higher earners with tax rises. Can Scots expect a better-funded NHS? SNP leader Alex Salmond has been peddling the myth that Scots should vote Yes to protect the NHS: in fact, it is already run entirely by the devolved administration. However, should Scots wish to devote more money to fund the Health Service, they would be free to do so using their new tax-raising powers. Who will pick up the lion’s share of Scotland’s benefits bill? The UK as a whole would remain on the hook for the most expensive, big ticket welfare spending. This includes the state pension, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, maternity pay, and bereavement benefits. Will the Scots continue to get a better deal than the English? Labour says it would keep the controversial Barnett formula, with only minor adjustments. Currently, it gives Scots £1,364 per head more spending than the UK average. While no party has spelled it out, it appears certain that Scotland would continue to be free to spend more overall than it receives in taxes. Aren’t Scots already getting extra powers? Yes. The Scotland Act 2012 – intended to spike Mr Salmond’s guns, ahead of the referendum – guarantees the largest transfer of financial powers in 300 years. This includes a new Scottish rate of income tax – which may be varied by 10p in the pound. Income tax can already be varied 3p, but this power has never been used.","Deputy Prime Minister described England as 'unusually over-centralised'

"Sharon Sutton died in February of the little known but deadly condition known as sepsis . Electrical supervisor Michael Sutton had never heard of sepsis when he lost his wife Sharon after a month-long battle with the condition in hospital. The medical receptionist was taken to hospital with an unknown condition in February this year. After being wrongly diagnosed with gastroenteritis and treated with a broad range of antibiotics, Sharon was found to have Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The chemotherapy was so effective that it not only eradicated Sharon's cancer but killed off all her white blood cells, leaving her with no immune system. After contracting an infection in hospital, the sepsis set in, shutting down the organs in her body. Four days after finishing chemotherapy, Sharon passed away. 'I thought she had died of the cancer, but it was only when I looked at the cause of death on her death certificate that it said sepsis,' said Mr. Sutton. 'The doctors mentioned it but I'd never heard of it, and they didn't tell me anything about it,' Mr. Sutton told Daily Mail Australia. Often referred to as septisaemia, sepsis can lead to shock, failure of multiple organs, and death if not recognised and treated properly. The little known but life-threatening condition occurs when a patient's response to infection damages their organs and tissues. Over 30,000 Australians contract sepsis every year, with a quarter of those dying in hospital. Critical care researcher Professor Simon Finfer, of The George Institute for Global Health and The University of Sydney said that the numbers are probably higher, but are misdiagnosed or unreported. Medical receptionist Sharon Sutton with her son Malcolm, now 35, and granddaughter Ava, now 7 . Sharon in her family home with beloved pets Bindi and Digger . Sharon Sutton, then 17, and Michael Sutton, then 18, on their wedding day in 1969 . These statistics come less than a week after the death of an Iranian asylum seeker in detention from the condition, raising alarm bells for many in the medical community. 'Sepsis is the leading cause of death from infection around the world and contributes to or causes between a third and a half of all deaths occurring in hospitals in the USA,' said Professor Finfer. 'Despite advances in modern medicine like vaccines, antibiotics, and acute care, millions of people around the world die of sepsis every year'. This warning has been echoed by healthcare professionals for years, with little community awareness. 'Sepsis kills more people than HIV, prostate cancer, and breast cancer combined,' said Mr. Sutton. 'I got on the internet and did some research and found that there were no support groups in Australia for those suffering from sepsis, or those who had friends or family suffering from the condition,' 'There was no support here for people like myself to understand what sepsis is,' 'There was a leukemia foundation and and I was able to talk to people about leukaemia, and most importantly, get support, but there was no one for me to talk to about sepsis,' There were groups in the UK and the US, so I thought I would do something about it to raise awareness of sepsis in the community,' 'Sharon probably contracted the infection whilst in hospital,' said Mr Sutton. 'That's how most cases of sepsis are caused,' 'I'd love to see better hygiene standards within our hospitals, and to educate doctors and nurses about how to recognise it. If it can be picked up within an hour, it increases survival rate by 8%.' Sharon and Michael with their children and grandchildren in front of the Harbour Bridge last year . Sharon with family members at a birthday celebration with her parents, son Graham (now 42), and cat Tangles . Professor Simon Finfer of the George Institute for Global Health and the University of Sydne . The Australian Sepsis Network is the answer to Mr. Sutton's call. The Network, which launches its website today, is a new alliance of health care professionals who are pushing for greater education and earlier intervention to combat the increasing threat of sepsis in Australia. 'Common symptoms of sepsis are fever, chills, rapid breathing and heart rate, rash, confusion and disorientation,' said Professor Finfer. 'Many of these symptoms, such as fever and difficulty breathing, mimic other conditions, making sepsis hard to diagnose in its early stages,' 'People are often told they have pneumonia or an infected gall bladder where the real issue is that they have sepsis, which is often contracted during or after surgery.' Professor Finfer and the Australian Sepsis Network are passionate about increasing healthcare standards to avoid further cases such as Sharon's. 'Because sepsis occurs both in the community and in patients who are already in hospital our campaign will target increasing awareness in the community and also further increasing awareness amongst healthcare workers,' said Professor Finfer. 'In particular we must ensure that sepsis is treated as a medical emergency in the same way that a heart attack or stroke is.' The Clinical Excellence Commission launched an initiative called SEPSIS KILLS in 2011, which has already had a positive impact on over 180 hospitals across Australia. September 13 is World Sepsis Day and is an initiative of the Global Sepsis Alliance (GSA) to promote sepsis awareness internationally. Information on global World Sepsis Day initiatives is available on their website. Sharon with her daughter Michelle at her son Malcolm's wedding .

"Peter Howes, 53, (pictured with his wife Jane) has been found guilty of cheating his brother out of a £1.5million inheritance . A jealous son has been found guilty of faking his family member's signatures to cheat his older brother out of a £1.5million inheritance - because he was fed up with him being the 'favourite'. Peter Howes, 53, resented his brother Jonathan moving to Hong Kong and then Singapore - leaving him to look after their ailing mother - so he siphoned off cash from their parents' estate. Howes, as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements, wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother Joyce, or 55-year-old brother Jonathan. He also cashed in two life insurance policies, worth just under £100,000 altogether, before pocketing the money. The family estate should have been split equally between Howes and his brother, but he transferred cash into a joint account, set up between himself and his mother, then moved it into a sole account in his name. The cash was then handed to former partners and was used to buy a 40 per cent stake in an online gaming company, set up by a relative of his wife. But the ploy unfolded when Joyce died in November 2011 aged 81. Jonathan discovered his brother's deception during a conversation with family lawyers about funds. Howes was arrested and charged with four counts of fraud. He was also jointly charged with his wife Jane, 51, on another. Yesterday a jury took just three and a half hours to return guilty verdicts on all five counts. They found his wife not guilty. Ed Burgess, prosecuting, told the four-week trial: 'It is a sad case because it is a case about a breakdown in a family, and who knows what lies behind it. 'Peter Howes may well have thought, ""my brother is off living his life in Hong Kong or Singapore, I'm stuck here with mum, I will take what I can get my hands on"". 'Particularly if he has some money to settle with former partners and particularly if he wants to make some money out of online gambling. 'There is some talk of Jonathan always being the favourite son, and Peter and Joyce having a very difficult relationship. 'But what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that he practised deceit, in one case he was knowingly assisted by his wife in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to, otherwise he would not have behaved as he did. 'Effectively Peter Howes was taking for himself all of her [Joyce] money in the last days of her life, although he knew full well that it was her intention that both the boys should benefit equally from their hard earned money. 'The total sums are just in excess of £1.5million.' Bristol Crown Court heard Howes first came into contact with the family accounts when his father Thomas, set up a number of trusts in 2002 - shortly before he died. A letter was sent to both brothers where they were told proceeds of the estate, upon the deaths of both Thomas and Joyce, 'should be divided equally between them'. Howes was given the responsibility for dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father Thomas' death in August 2004. He wound up one settlement, giving half the proceeds, some £109,000, to his brother in Hong Kong, convincing him the rest of the money was still in the trusts. But Howes began to look into other accounts where he faked his mother's signature on an Aviva document enabling him to access the money, before purporting she had signed another to close a settlement. Bristol Crown Court heard that Howes, as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements, wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother Joyce, or 55-year-old brother Jonathan . The court was told that Jane Howes, knowing about the deception, then countersigned the settlement document, so the money would be released. Around the same time Joyce suffered a fall at the family home in Bexhill-on-Sea, Essex in 2009 and her health deteriorated dramatically, forcing her to move in with the couple in Lechlade, Glos. Howes quickly set up an online joint account, and transferred all the proceeds of the policies and settlements into it. Bank statements later show the money being moved to an account in his name only before being withdrawn as cash or cheques. Howes set in motion plans to sell the childhood house, and once he had received permission from Jonathan, via email, sold the home for £1.075million, moving all the money from the sale from Joyce's account into the joint e-saver. Jonathan never received proceeds of the sale. 'This is not a case that a woman who had lost her mental faculties was exploited,' Mr Burgess told the court. 'Mentally, although difficult and showing inadvertent signs of ageing, Joyce was competent, which explains why Peter Howes felt it necessary to resort to fraud, including forging signatures, in order to get his hands on the money to which he was not entitled to. 'This e-saving account was really a vehicle through which Peter Howes enabled himself to get his hands on his mum's money. 'Joyce's various personal accounts were almost always running at a very small balance, and whenever a very significant amount of money was credited it was immediately received to the joint account before it was removed by Peter for his own gain.' It was only when Joyce died, on November 14 2010 and emails were sent between the family solicitor and Jonathan regarding family trusts, that he discovered what his brother had done. The court heard independent handwriting experts had confirmed the signatures were not those of Joyce, or Jonathan Howes, something Howes does not deny. The case has been adjourned for sentencing at a later date.","Peter Howes resented his elder brother Jonathan, 55, moving abroad .

"Is there anything more important to a bride and groom at their reception than getting that all important first wedding dance just right? Perhaps ensuring that there is at least one super-cute kid making everyone smile by busting a few serious dance moves. This little boy was captured on film expressing himself through dance in the way only young children can, and YouTube regular Blake Weir posted it on his page with the title 'The best dancer I've ever seen' - for obvious reasons. One Direction eat your heart out: The boy is clearly enjoying himself as he spins around and points his toes . The dance floor is mainly filled with children but one little boy stands out a mile with his unforgettable dance moves. The phrase 'dance like nobody is watching' might have been invented for this little boy as he spins around, jumps and leaps in the air and generally looks like he's having the time of his life. Oblivious to his surroundings - and to the fact that he's being filmed by one of the wedding guests - he gives One Direction a run for their money with his highly original dance moves. Get your groove on: The boy is certainly light on his feet - perhaps helped by the fact that he's kicked his shoes off and is able to slide around on the dancefloor. The arm movements are pretty cool too . The man filming the footage is clearly impressed by the display, commenting: 'Look at this kid go. Yes, he is fabulous.' As the boy approaches a young girl his age, the man filming says: 'Leave her alone it's all you bro you got this.' Laughing at the energetic display, he adds: 'He is talented.' he's been inspired by modern singers and dance groups or perhaps seen some old films with Fred and Ginger isn't clear, but this boy has certainly got some style. At one point he spins around and nearly loses his balance but manages to recover himself and carry on dancing totally unconcerned about who is watching.","Super-cute kid busts some serious moves at a wedding .

"Stuck: The tabby was found wedged between the steering rack and some gear cables after the car broke down in Malton, North Yorkshire . A two-year-old tabby was found trapped in a car engine when the driver called a mechanic - a week after the cat went for a nap under the bonnet. The cat, which has been renamed Lucky, was found trapped in a Nissan Primera when it broke down in Malton, North Yorkshire. It is thought the cat climbed into the engine and nestled itself between some cables for a 30-mile journey from Ryedale, North Yorkshire, to Rufforth, near York. A week later the car broke down in Malton, North Yorkshire, and a mechanic was called out to find out what was wrong. Mechanic Ian Brindle, who opened up to bonnet to find the starving pet staring back at him, said that she had a 'lucky escape'. He said: 'I plugged my computer into the car and it came up saying there was a faulty fuel pump. 'When I opened up the bonnet I saw the cat staring back at me and wedged between the steering rack and some gear cables.' Mr Brindle, 44, of Norton, North Yorkshire, pulled on some gloves to try . and free the cat, only to discover that she was wedged in the engine. He added: 'I presume the cat got in there and the driver carried her up to Rufforth, where the car spent a week and came back.' 'I had to take half the car to bits to pull her out. 'She wasn’t angry, just very hungry. I phoned Cats Protection up and they said to take it to the vet.' Edward Button, principal of The Mount Veterinary Group, said: 'There are . a lot of cats that get into that situation and do get severely injured . by the engine, so she was very lucky to not get any injuries. 'We had to shampoo her, and that was all she needed apart from a little bit of TLC.' The cat is now in the care of Cats Protection while attempts are made to trace the owners. Scroll down for video .

"Locked up: Robert W. Thomas, 37, pleaded guilty to trying to buy a child earlier this year . A car mechanic has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for trying to buy a 10-year-old girl for $400 so he could keep her as a sex slave. Robert W. Thomas, 37, pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of offering to buy a child, enticement and receipt and distribution of visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and he was sentenced in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio on Monday. Thomas, who is not married, was arrested in Alliance on January 11 after he posted an advert on a social media website seeking a girl between the ages of five and eight for an 'arranged' marriage. In the advert, he wrote that he hoped to find 'a breeding slave' and 'a young wife that I can train to be a slut,' court records show, the Canton Rep reported. After seeing the ad, an Alliance Police Department officer who was assigned to the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force responded and pretended to be a parent willing to sell their 10-year-old child for $400, the Akron Beacon Journal reported. Alliance Police Lieutenant John Jenkins said at the time that Thomas wanted to buy the child to use as a sex slave and to 'train her to please him'. Thomas drove to meet the parent at a restaurant and once he discussed the transaction with the undercover officer, he was arrested. He had $400 in his hand at the time, police said. Authorities then carried out a search of his home and unearthed a stash of child pornography - 44 videos and 290 images - and a vast collection of sexual devices, including bondage ropes, according to court documents. They also found seven firearms, including an AR-15 rifle with a grenade launcher - although they did not recover any grenades. He legally owned the weapons, authorities said. A search of his computer also revealed that he was active on several websites where similar posts were made. Scene: After his arrest in January, authorities searched his home, pictured, and found numerous sex devices, weapons and a huge stash of child porn. They believe he wanted to buy a child to keep as a sex slave . Jenkins added that they believed Thomas was committed to finding a child to use as a sex slave and, that if agents had not intervened, they believe he could have succeeded. 'We believe he was very serious about wanting this to happen,' Jenkins told the Beacon Journal. Thomas, who lived alone with his three dogs, had no prior felony arrests or sex offenses. 'This sentence is well-deserved given the disturbing nature of the charges,' attorney Steve Dettelbach told WKYC. 'Our office remains committed to working with the FBI and all our law enforcement partners to defend our children and fight human trafficking.'","Robert Thomas, from Ohio, pleaded guilty to charges earlier this year .

"A teacher has been suspended after posting a series of bizarre 'comedy' videos on Facebook - including swearing and joking about throwing a dog through a window. Music tutor Stephanie Aird, 35, is being investigated after the 'inappropriate' films appeared online and were quickly viewed and shared by hundreds of her pupils. Secondary school teacher Ms Aird posted eleven bizarre and rambling 'selfie' videos on her Facebook in the space of two days. Stephanie Aird, pictured, could face disciplinary action after she posted a series of bizarre videos on Facebook . The music teacher told her followers that her b****** dog had eaten her friend's trainers after her cat had died . The head of music pulled different faces and wore costumes - and in one talks to the camera while bouncing on a small trampolene. At one point she says 'oh s***e' because a 'b****** dog' has eaten a trainer and says she 'feel like chucking the dog through the shed window'. She also rambles about her fiance going for a shower for two-and-a-half hours, finding some frozen cod sauce, and her arm getting stuck behind a radiator. The videos on an open profile were first viewed by her friends who thought they were a series of comedy sketches and congratulated her. Fans of Ms Aird have taken to Facebook in a bid to have her suspension lifted and all allow her to return to work . But they were then seen by pupils who shared them around Dyke House Sports and Technology College, in Hartlepool. The school then received complaints by parents who said they were 'inappropriate'. Head teacher Andrew Jordon was alerted to the videos by colleagues during the six-week break, and confirmed the teacher was immediately suspended from her duties. Ms Aird explained that her pet kitten had been run over and her boyfriend Ian was unwilling to bury him . He said: 'I cannot comment in detail about a disciplinary case which is on-going. 'But I can confirm that the individual has been suspended and an investigation is underway. 'The school has a very stringent acceptable user policy for ICT-related issues which all members of staff have signed up to.' The 11 videos, uploaded between the 8th and 10th of August, have since been shared by students. The comedy-sketch type videos, which were shot on a mobile phone, cover a variety of topics from ballet lessons, cleaning a caravan, and finding her finance, Ian Robinson. In one video, shared with the message 'unfortunate event- B****** Dog needs muzzling', the woman from Hartlepool, tries to turn a cat's death into a comedy sketch about a dog eating trainers. She said: 'I come to you with an unfortunate event. I feel absolutely awful. Me cat got run over, not Minstrel, nah, it's Minstrel's birthday today. This other cat we haven't had for very long got run over. 'Ian couldn't bury it. He couldn't look at it he was so upset. So I tweeted it on Twitter and me mate Jim answered. He said ""I'll come up and bury it if you like?"" I said, alright then, yes please. 'Anyway, he's been up and buried it. Before he went out he took his shoes off - Nike Airs, £122 a pair. Only got them three days ago. 'While he's out there burying the cat in Ian's wellies, dog ate his Nike Air trainers. I feel like chucking the dog through the shed window like our other dog. 'Absolutely gutted, I feel awful. I'll have to go, bye.' However, before stopping the video, she continues: 'Oh god. Nike Air. Couldn't they have been Primark? Why can't he wear Primark trainers like ever b****r else. Oh no, oh s***e.' In other videos, where she can be seen in erratic make-up of thick lip-stick and in one, a belt wrapped around her head, she rambles about Ian going upstairs for a shower two and a half hours ago, finding some frozen cod sauce, and her arm getting stuck behind a radiator. The teacher also congratulated one of her students, Micheal Rice, after he won over all four judges on the latest series of the X Factor with his rendition of Whitney Houston's 'I Look To You'. In one section of video, Ms Aird explains how she was after finding some 'frozen cod sauce' Ms Aird is suspended from Dyke House Sports and Technology College, in Hartlepool, pictured . It is understood the teacher will be investigated by a senior member of staff where the nature of the videos will be discussed, before the head teacher makes a decision on what action to take. Ms Aird today defended her videos - saying they were 'comedy'. Writing on her Facebook page, she said: 'A parent had complained to the school about the videos.....what I cannot get my head round is why or how a small number of people find my videos offensive. 'While in school I am a hard working, inspirational teacher and have been for 18 years. I have sweat blood and tears for my students and pushed them hard to be all they can be. 'Out of school I enjoy making comedy videos and music and other things like spending time with my family just like a normal person.' However, hours after news of Ms Aird's suspension broke, fans of the popular teacher took to Facebook in a bid to place pressure on the school to reinstate her immediately. One fan said: 'It's an absolute joke guys n gals this girl is original, funny, witty, all with a non offensive comedian act. ' She's not hurting any one,, let's support her shes a fantastic teacher and people all over Hartlepool will know she teaches pupils and inspires them.'","Stephanie Aird has been suspended from school over the Facebook videos .

"African Union soldiers in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls as young as 12 on their peacekeeping bases, a new report by an international human rights group has alleged. Human Rights Watch said the soldiers, relying on Somali intermediaries, have at times targeted women and girls who enter the bases through guarded gates seeking medical assistance or water. The New York-based group said it interviewed 21 women and girls since 2013 who described being sexually abused or sexually exploited by Burundian or Ugandan military personnel in two bases in Mogadishu. African Union soldiers in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls as young as 12, a new report by an international human rights group has alleged (file picture) Ten separate incidents of sexual abuse, including rape and sexual assault, and 14 cases of sexual exploitation were documented during the period, the rights group said. Four of the rape cases and one sexual assault involved girls under 18. The youngest victim was a 12-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a Ugandan soldier. Several women said the soldiers refused to wear condoms, causing the women to catch sexually transmitted infections as a result, according to the report. Several also described being slapped and beaten by the soldiers who forced them to have sex. According to the 71-page report, '""The Power These Men Have Over Us"": . Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by African Union Forces in . Somalia,' only two out of the 21 women and girls interviewed filed a complaint with Somali or other authorities. One 15-year-old girl went to the Burundian contingent's base to get medicine for her sick mother late 2013, the report says. The African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, was deployed in 2007. Its uniformed force, which numbers more than 22,000, comes from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Sierra Leone (file picture - there is no suggestion the soldiers pictured were involved in the abuse) A Somali interpreter told her to follow two Burundian soldiers to get medicine. They took her to a remote area and one of the soldiers raped her, Human Rights Watch said. 'First he ripped off my hijab and then he attacked me,' she is quoted saying. As she was leaving, the second Burundian soldier gave her $10, the report says. Human Rights Watch said all of the Somali women and girls interviewed were internal refugees from south-central Somalia. The human rights group urged troop-contributing countries, the African Union Mission in Somalia and donors to urgently address these abuses and strengthen procedures inside Somalia to seek justice. 'Some African Union soldiers have misused their positions of power to exploit Somalia's most vulnerable women and girls,' said Liesl Gerntholtz, women's rights director at Human Rights Watch. 'Somalia has many intractable problems, but the Somali and . AU leadership could end sexual exploitation and abuse by . pressing troop-sending countries to hold abusers responsible.'

"Olympic star Steve Backley is to split from his wife of 11 years after she brought divorce proceedings against him. The javelin thrower is said to have been separated from his wife Clare 'for some time' and is reportedly dating a woman in her 20s, who he met after the split. Clare, 38, started divorce proceedings at a London court last week and was granted a decree nisi - the first stage in a divorce - it emerged today. Scroll down for video . Steve Backley and his wife Clare - pictured together when the former athlete was awarded an OBE in 2003 - are to divorce, it was reported today . Backley, 45, is best known for winning silver medals in javelin at the Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000 Olympics, as well as bronze at Barcelona 1992. He married Clare - with whom he has two daughters, aged ten and eight - in October 2003 after reportedly meeting her in a pub. The couple moved to Chistlehurst, Kent, not far from where Clare runs a bridal shop. She was by this side when he was awarded an OBE in 2003 and he later told how she helped him battle the injuries picked up during his years as a top athlete. Speaking in 2009, he said: 'I was finding it hard to sleep because of the pain from my hip joint rubbing against the socket. I can honestly say I did not get a good night's rest for nearly five years. 'Not surprisingly I felt low at times. I was letting Clare down. After all, who wants to be married to someone who is old before their time? 'Our eldest daughter was born in 2004 and then, after her sister came along two years later, the pain in my hips and lower back was so bad I couldn't even bend down to pick her up off the floor, which was heartbreaking as a new father.' Backley rose to fame in the 1990s, winning a string of Olympic and Commonwealth Games medals in javelin . The Sun reported this morning that Clare's petition for divorce claimed Backley's behaviour had caused her 'anxiety and distress'. A friend told the paper his marriage had 'been over for some time' and that he is now 'moving on with his life'. Since retiring from sport, he has appeared on ITV's Dancing on Ice in 2008 alongside skater Susie Lipanova, and he admitted the show made him a 'sex symbol'. Speaking at the time, he told the Daily Mirror: 'I've been sent all sorts of knickers... tiny ones, big ones and some quite tasteful stuff. But none of it fits me . 'Some of the letters are quite fruity, saying 'Ooh, you're so sexy' and that kind of stuff. But then I get to the end and the women say, ""PS, I'm 81"".' He said Clare - who supported him throughout the show - 'loved his outfits, especially the tight T-shirts'.

"The wife of Australian cricket legend Michael Bevan has told of the moment Jane McGrath found her breast cancer lump. Tracy Bevan - who was Ms McGrath's best friend - said the late wife of former cricketer Glenn McGrath came to her hotel room one night, saying she had a found a lump in her breast. Ms Bevan and Ms McGrath were in England while their husbands were playing in the Ashes series. Jane McGrath (pictured left in 2008) - the late wife of Glenn McGrath (right) - died of cancer in 2008 . 'Jane knocked on my door and she had a towel wrapped around her and said Glenn asked to get your opinion on this lump. Does it look a funny shape to you?' Ms Bevan told 9 Stories. 'Then she took my hand and placed it over her breast and I felt it straight away."" The lump was a cause for alarm because at the age of 31, the mother-of-two underwent a mastectomy and an aggressive round of chemotherapy. But even with this treatment, the cancer made a return in 2003. Tracy Bevan (left) - the wife of cricketing legend Michael Bevan (right) - said Ms McGrath came to her hotel room in England looking for advice after finding a breast lump . The McGrath Foundation in 2002 after Ms McGrath found the support of breast nurses a real help to her during her illness . Ms McGrath had to go through treatment again but this time she had the help of her 'guardian angel' - a breast cancer care nurse. Ms Bevan said Ms McGrath did not want to burden her husband or her friend with her concerns about cancer. Instead she offloaded her fears, concerns and fears on the nurse. 'Jane said to me: ""I can't tell you the difference it has made to my life and I want this for every Australian family going through breast cancer"",' Ms Bevan said. To give other people who had breast cancer the same relief she had experienced, Ms McGrath established the McGrath Foundation in 2002 with her husband. It aimed to bring the comfort and support of a breast care nurse to those who battled the disease, regardless of where they were located or their socio-economic background. Ms Bevan said Ms McGrath sympathised with breast cancer patients in regional areas who had to leave their homes and families to get the treatment they needed away from their support networks. The mother-of-two's (pictured here with Glenn and their children Holly and James in 2007) cancer returned a second time in 2003 after her breast cancer spread . Despite the cancer making its way to her bones and then her brain, Ms McGrath pushed on with campaigning for more funds from supporters and levels of government. Leading up to her death, Ms Bevan and Ms McGrath said they looked back on their times as cricketers' wives and what they had achieved through the foundation. Ms Bevan is an ambassador and director of the McGrath Foundation. 'She was extremely proud. She never spoke about dying. She would just say: ""Promise me that we will always be at the McGrath Foundation together and keep making a difference"",' she said. Ms McGrath died in 2008 when funding could send out six breast care nurses. But now the foundation provides help and support to more than 25,000 families with 100 nurses. Ms Bevan said her friend would have been 'extremely proud' of their achievements. 'I miss her every single day. But I feel privileged to be able to continue what we started doing in the very beginning,' she said.","Tracy Bevan is the wife of Australian cricket legend Michael Bevan .

"Crime: Karnesia Lloyd was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of her ex-boyfriend Raynard Pete after she ran over him . A man was forced to have his leg amputated  after his ex-girlfriend allegedly ran him over with a car. Karnesia Lloyd, from St Petersburg, Florida, was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of her ex-boyfriend Raynard Pete whom she struck ‘because she was angry,’ according to police. She was also charged with child abuse because she had her five-year-old daughter in the car with her at the time of the attack. Eyewitnesses said that Pete had just left church on Sunday afternoon when Lloyd boxed his truck in at the corner of 37th Avenue South and 6th Street South. According to police, two men, Cauiau Smiley and Vinson Williams, got out of Lloyd's car and started beating Pete, who tried to run away. Another eyewitness, Ursula Bryant was walking her dog and watched as Pete fought off Smiley and Williams until Lloyd drove her car right at him. ‘The young lady drove directly into him. She put her car in reverse and hit him again. It was almost as if she was parallel parking her vehicle...She didn't stop until his legs gave out,’ Bryant told Fox 13. Pete's legs were pinned between the front of the car and some concrete steps along an abandoned house. Victim: Raynard Pete lies in a hospital bed after he was hit and struck by a car  his ex-girlfriend was driving . Romerus Sykora, a 10-year-old-boy who lives two doors away from Pete said he was jumping on the trampoline with his brother when he heard the commotion. ‘When we came out and saw the people running into the house, I looked over there and there was a man with blood all over the ground,’ Sykora said. The alleged attackers - Lloyd, Smiley and Williams - sped off as neighbors rushed out to check on Pete. ‘He didn't say anything. He just held his hand out to be held,’ Bryant said of the moment she tended to Pete. Sykora's mom called 911 and paramedics arrived and rushed Pete to the hospital. Doctors had to amputate his left leg, and pins, plates and rods are holding his right one together. Amputation: Doctors had to amputate Pete's left leg after the brutal attack which left him pinned between a car and concrete steps near an abandoned house he will still need several other operations . Mugshots: Cauiau Smiley, left, and Vinson Williams, right, got out of Lloyd's car and started beating Pete, who tried to run away from the two men who have since been arrested and charged . ‘I don't know how he's going to handle it,’ his sister, Diedre Seltzer told Fox 13. ‘My concern is him. He needs a lot of care. He's in critical condition. They left him for dead.’ St. Petersburg Police eventually found Lloyd and the two men at Jordan Park. Eyewitness:  Ursula Bryant was walking her dog and watched as Pete fought off Smiley and Williams until Lloyd drove her car right at him . They have all been arrested on attempted murder charges. Lloyd has since admitted to police that he intentionally ran over Pete and did so ‘because she was angry.’ Pete’s family say that they do not know how they will tell him about his shocking injuries. He is scheduled to have several more operations before he can be released from the hospital. His family have started a donation fund to help pay for Pete's recovery and a prosthetic leg.","Karnesia Lloyd  was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of her ex-boyfriend Raynard Pete after she ran him over with a car .

"A former greengrocer has amassed one of the world's largest fruit sticker collections. Christopher Crawcour, 56, keeps 30,000 fruit stickers in nine lever arch files at his Southend-on-Sea, Essex, home. And like many passionate stamp or coin collectors, he spends hours peering through his beloved collection with no intention to sell it. Although the unusual hobby isn't so highly regarded by his wife, who says she hates the stickers because Mr Crawcour spends more time with them than her, it could soon be at an end due to a change in EU laws. Retired greengrocer Christopher Crawcour studying his fruit sticker collection of 30,000 stickers . Pages from Mr Crawcour's collection of fruit stickers, showing avocado labels (left) and apple labels (right) Mr Crawcour, who has collected for more than 25 years,  told The Sun: 'To me, this is a hobby like a stamp collection and I do it for love so I would never even consider selling them.' He told the paper he has the second largest collection in the world, following closely behind a French collector. His rarest stickers include 1960s labels from the giant banana distributor Chiquita. But last year's EU ruling means sticky labels on fruit can be replaced by laser 'tattoos' inking identifying information onto their skin. The technology, if adopted by retailers and distributors, could put an end to the decades-long tradition of stickering fruit. Fruit featuring the new technology is likely to hit British shelves shortly, with retailer Marks & Spencer recently signing an agreement with a laser printing company to trial it on oranges. Marks & Spencer have said using the tattooing technology will be more environmentally sustainable. Although the technology has been around since 2009, the use of these chemicals - which enhance the contrast between the lasered and non-lasered parts of the fruit making the mark much clearer - had previously been banned. The amended EU regulations now allows the use of iron oxides, hydroxides, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polysorbates for marking certain fruits. Two of Mr Crawcour's rare fruit stickers. On the left is a Chiquita banana label celebrating the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. On the right is an unidentified Japanese fruit label . The role of fruit stickers is not just to brand the fruit to a particular distributor. They also feature what's known as a a Price Look-up (PLU) code. PLU codes tell the checkout computers not just what the item is and how much it costs, but also gives clues as to how its grown. Traditionally grown fruit, using pesticides, features a four digit code. But organically grown items, the number nine precedes the basic four digit PLU code, and on genetically modified fruit it is preceded by the number eight. Chiquita banana stickers from the 1960s are said to be the rarest. The company claims to have been the first to label its bananas with stickers around this time and consequently their oldest are the most difficult to find, while they also retain a special aura of nostalgia for sticker collectors.","Former greengrocer collects 30,000 stickers during a 25-year old hobby .

"When an elderly woman fell down an escalator at a bustling train station, you might have expected rail staff to rush to her aid. But astonishingly, they refused to help her. And their reason? They had not been trained in ‘people-handling’. The extraordinary excuse was given by Northern Rail workers, who stood just yards away and let other passengers tend to the shocked woman instead. A witness, who confronted the staff at Leeds train station, described their attitude as ‘shameful’. Going up: Rail staff refused to help an elderly woman after she fell down an escalator at bustling Leeds station . Tom Lees, 25, said he was waiting for a train at around 10.30am when he spotted an ‘old lady fall backwards’ while travelling up an escalator. He said one passenger ‘grabbed her’ and another stopped the escalator by pressing an emergency button. ‘A third called the Northern Rail staff to help but they just stood there like lemons,’ he said. Mr Lees, a scientist working in the road industry, added: ‘I dashed up the escalator – she was in a very precarious position. Afterwards I asked [the staff] why they didn’t help and they said they weren’t allowed to because they weren’t “people-handling trained”. ‘I said it was shameful behaviour.’ Northern Rail runs passenger trains across the north of England and is the largest train operator in the UK. This week it introduced peak evening fares – meaning some weekday tickets will cost 117 per cent more. Scene: The extraordinary excuse given by the Northern Rail workers, who let other passengers tend to the shocked woman at Leeds train station (pictured), was that they had not been trained in ‘people-handling’ Mr Lees, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said the two Northern Rail staff were standing at the ticket barrier, about 20 yards away, in full view of the escalator. ‘After speaking to them I thought they were just misinformed staff so I gave the customer service line a call and they repeated the same line to me – that they’re not allowed to help because they’re not people-handling trained. It seemed to be against common human compassion.’ He added: ‘I said to them “if your granny fell over would you not hope that someone would pick her up?” They didn’t answer.’ After the incident last week, Mr Lees and two female passengers helped the elderly woman to a bench before comforting her and getting her a drink. The woman, who was left shaken but is not believed to have been injured, has not been identified. Last night the train company put the incident down to policy concerning the use of staff trained in first aid. A Northern Rail spokesman said: ‘We’re sorry for any distress caused to the lady who fell or other customers who witnessed what happened. Our team report any accident directly to the station managers so a qualified first aider can be alerted immediately.’ But John Rowe, head of operations for the Health and Safety Executive in Yorkshire and the Humber, said it was a ‘ridiculous’ situation, adding: ‘There nothing in the Health and Safety at Work Act that prevents people offering assistance to others in distress. ‘I can only think that either the company’s own policies are being stretched and misinterpreted by their employees, or the individuals in question didn’t fancy getting involved and they just used health and safety as a convenient excuse.’","Elderly woman 'fell backwards' while travelling up escalator at Leeds station .

"Treasured by soldiers facing the horrors of the front line, and by their loved ones back home, these century-old postcards offer a fascinating glimpse into the personal side of one of the deadliest wars in history. As World War One raged across Europe, and long before the days of rolling news and email, families and soldiers kept in touch by sending postcards to and from the front line. Now a previously unseen collection of pristine postcards sent to and from British families and soldiers during the Great War has been unearthed in Edinburgh. These postcards were exchanged between soldiers (and nurses) and their loved ones during the Great War . The Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Donald Wilson, right, found the cards among his late aunt's belongings . The cards and photographs give a poignant glimpse into the heartbreak felt by families during the horrors of the war that left more than 16million soldiers and civilians dead. Some brought bad news, such as the card informing its recipient that their loved one had shell gas poisoning and was wounded and in hospital. Others brought messages of comfort. 'I have been thinking about you all today', says one.  'I thought I would send a thought for you.' All of them give an insight into the pain and worry endured by millions at home and away during what turned out to be one of history's bloodiest conflicts. The postcards were collected by Jessie MacIntyre, the late aunt of Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Donald Wilson. Mr Wilson, who discovered the collection neatly packed away amongst her belongings after her death, doesn't know how his aunt managed to compile such a wide-ranging collection, with cards signed by dozens of different soldiers and their families. Postcards were often sent to the front line by worried families at home, offering succour ahead of hard times . Glimpse of history: The collection of century-old postcards is on show in Edinburgh until Wednesday . All have been stored so carefully, their bright colours remain untarnished, although many of the handwritten messages on the reverse - particularly those written in pencil - have faded to near illegibility. The postcards have now gone on display at the Gorgie War Memorial Hall in Edinburgh, where they can be seen until this Thursday. Mr Wilson said: 'They were all very well stored in plastic bags and tied with bands. My aunt kept them all those years. 'They span the whole war and there are many different names and addresses. Auntie Jessie had five sisters. 'It's possible that they each knew lots of different families, and they were encouraged to write to people at the front.' One postcard contained worrying news. Mr Wilson said: 'It is addressed to my aunt as Miss Addie, as she was then, and says ""Got word this morning that Alex has shell gas poisoning and is wounded and is at present in hospital in Rouen. We will let you know later how he is. Hoping to hear from you, love, Louise"". Soldiers were discouraged from writing home because of censorship but plenty of them did, nevertheless . Edinburgh's Lord Provost, pictured with his wife, Elaine, said: 'Some would have been written in the trenches' 'It's quite a poignant message. Imagine how terrible it would be to have to write that message. 'Another one is addressed to one of her sisters, and mentions someone called Eddie who has not been very well and adds ""Poor chap, he is away back to the noise and the din"", which is one way of describing the front line. 'And there's a brilliant one with a nurse and ""On service"" written on the bottom. 'On the back it says: ""I have been thinking so much about you all today. I thought I would send a thought for you. This says 'On service', but we are all on service here, on a very noble calling, on service for our king, kindest regards, Kate"".' The front of the card is a drawing of a  nurse in uniform, gazing into the distance. Mr Wilson said some of the cards were obviously friends or relations of his aunt's family, while others bore no obvious link. Some of the cards came from soldiers keen to reassure worried families, left, while others were sent to them . He added: 'It is very difficult to pinpoint who these people were, but you get a real feeling from the postcards of how the war was affecting them. 'These were all they had to communicate with, no phones and no modern communication, just a postcard and a pencil. Some are quite difficult to read, some may well have been written in the trenches.' Millions of postcards were dispatched to and from various front lines during the First World War, but letters from enlisted men were discouraged by military authorities as they had to be censored. The postcards are currently on display at Edinburgh's Gorgie War Memorial Hall to mark the outbreak of WW1.","Postcards were exchanged between soldiers and loved ones during the war .

"The Queen issued a rare public statement last night to deny claims she had been asked to step in over the Scottish referendum. Following a report that a number of MPs were suggesting privately that the Monarch, who is thought to be strongly in favour of the Union, should intervene, Buckingham Palace insisted she would remain neutral. Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, risked controversy yesterday by declaring that he had met the Queen recently at Balmoral and insisting that she would be proud to reign over an independent Scotland. Scroll down for video . The Queen, pictured at the Braemar Highland Games in 2011, issued a rare public statement last night to deny claims she had been asked to step in over the Scottish referendum . But the Palace issued an unusually strongly-worded statement saying that the Queen was above politics and ‘those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case’. Royal sources made clear that there had been no suggestion from anyone in Government or opposition for the Queen to take a public stand. A spokesman said: ‘The Sovereign’s constitutional impartiality is an established principle of our democracy and one which the Queen has demonstrated throughout her reign. Royal sources made clear that there had been no suggestion from anyone in Government or opposition for the Queen to take a public stand . ‘As such the Monarch is above politics and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case. ‘Any suggestion that the Queen should wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong. This is a matter for the people of Scotland.’ Alistair Darling, the leader of the Better Together campaign, said: ‘The Queen has stayed out of party politics throughout her entire reign and that is one of the many reasons she commands such great respect in Scotland and the rest of the UK.’ Sources have confirmed that the Monarch will be at her private estate in the Highlands, on the day of the referendum on September 18. The Palace has repeatedly insisted that the Queen is politically neutral, but one well-placed source said at the weekend: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out the Queen is a Unionist. Is the Pope a Catholic?’ In a speech she gave to MPs on her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Queen said: ‘I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. ‘But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ‘Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’","Rare public statement insisted that she would remain neutral over the vote .

"With their sails billowing in the wind, a fleet of more than 50 vessels passed alongside the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf as they bid farewell to the capital on the final day of the Tall Ships Festival. The ships, some of which are more than a century old, set off from West India Docks, sailing by the O2 Arena and the Royal Docks, before reaching the Thames Barrier. The procession, the largest fleet of Tall Ships to have visited London in 25 years, arrived in the city following a race from Falmouth. The imposing ships have come from around the globe to take part the event, including from Spain, Holland, Portugal, Poland and Russia. The participating vessels include Tenacious, the largest wooden tall ship of her kind which has been sailed by a crew with physical disabilities from the Jubilee Sailing Trust. Other boats in the race included the Shtandart, a modern replica of a Russian navy flagship built for Peter the Great in 1703, and the Tecla, which is almost 100 years old. The Tall Ships Festival is set over four sites in Woolwich, Maritime Greenwich, Greenwich Peninsula and Canary Wharf and will line the river's banks until Tuesday, before the grand parade down the river. The event began in Falmouth and saw the ships race from the Cornish Port to the Isle of Wight, before cruising to the capital.  The parade sets off from Royal Greenwich, opposite Canary Wharf, on Tuesday.

"Federal safety investigators say an air ambulance got the wrong fuel at a New Mexico airport before it took off and crashed, killing all four people aboard. A National Transportation Safety Board preliminary report says the twin-engine aircraft was refueled with 40 gallons of jet fuel instead of aviation gasoline at the Las Cruces airport on August 27. The plane was headed for Phoenix. All three crew members and one patient were killed. Devasted: Relatives of victims of a plane crash react after reaching the crash site a half-mile southwest of the Southern New Mexico State Fairgrounds in Las Cruces . Four people died when the medical transport airplane that was transporting a cancer patient to Phoenix, Arizona, crashed and burst into flames shortly after takeoff from Las Cruces Airport . The NTSB preliminary report issued Monday does not say whether the wrong fuel caused the crash. The report says a crew member called the dispatcher on a satellite telephone and reported they were returning because smoke was coming from the right engine. Las Cruces spokesman Udell Vigil said city officials would have no comment on the NTSB preliminary report because the city doesn't operate the fueling service at the airport. That operator, Southwest Aviation Inc., also had no immediate comment. The NTSB will issue a final report later on the crash. The plane was registered to Elite Medical Air Transport, of El Paso, Texas, and was operated by Amigos Aviation Inc. of Harlingen, Texas, the NTSB said. National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tom Latson takes notes in front of the wreckage, N. Authorities say all four people aboard the medical flight that was headed to Phoenix were killed . The difference is similar to that of gasoline and diesel gas. Avgas is basically the same as automotive unleaded gas. Some airplanes can run on either automotive gasoline or avgas, although its always recommended that avgas be used. Jet fuel is highly purified kerosene. A few additives are mixed in to reduce the likelyhood the fuel gelling in cold temperatures or to keep ice crystals from forming. Other than that, you could pour it straight into a diesel engine & it would run just fine. Most smaller single-engine propeller driven aircraft run on avgas. Larger propeller driven aircraft, twins and the like, may or may not be powered by turbo-prop engines which operate more like a jet & use jet fuel. Jet aircraft, of course, always use jet fuel. The preliminary report said the plane had turned and was still at a low altitude before it crashed and burst into flames. After arriving at the Las Cruces airport, the pilot was in the cockpit when he told an airport technician he needed 40 gallons of fuel, the preliminary report said. It said the technician refueled the plane and that the pilot helped the technician replace both wings' fuel caps before they walked into the office, where the pilot signed the machine-printed fuel ticket. Investigators who arrived at the crash site a day later reported smelling jet fuel, the preliminary report said. Crew members killed have been identified as 29-year-old pilot Freddy Martinez, 27-year-old flight paramedic Tauren Summers and 35-year-old flight nurse Monica Chavez, all from El Paso. The patient was 59-year-old Fredrick Green, a Phoenix resident who was staying in Las Cruces while undergoing radiation treatment after surgery in Phoenix for a brain tumor. He was returning to Phoenix for further treatment.

"A 17-year-old girl has provoked a storm of controversy after she posted a video on Facebook showing her older brother slowing saw the head off a live turtle. Catrina Shears, from West Michigan, posted the 43 second video of the snapping turtle's death to the social media website this week. The clip, filmed on a mobile phone, shows the teenager using pliers to pull the turtle's head out from its shell while her elder brother steps on the turtle. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A 17-year-old girl has provoked a storm of controversy as she posted a video on Facebook showing her older brother slowing saw the head off a live turtle . As the turtles squirms he then pulls out a hacksaw and slowly saws through the animal's neck for about 20 seconds. Although the turtle moves it's legs it stops moving after as the hacksaw goes deeper. According to her Catrina's comments the pair were in rush and could not find an axe. Catrina seems unaffected, and said they have done this for years, and described how they let the animal's blood drain for several hours. Catrina Shears, from West Michigan, posted the 43 second video of the snapping turtle's death to the social media website this week. The clip, filmed on a mobile phone, shows the teenager using pliers to pull the turtle's head out from its shell while her elder brother steps on the turtle . Then she commented that she 'should have taken a video of the blood squirting' from the turtle's neck. The posting on the video drew heavy criticism on Facebook with many saying if the siblings want to hunt and kill animals for meat the method of death should have been quicker. Other people said that 'decapitation is the humane way to kill a snapping turtle.' After several complaints the Department of Natural Resources released a statement reported Fox8.com, saying: 'We are certainly disappointed anyone would post something like that to social media. Although the actions depicted in this video are technically legal under state statute - provided that the capture of the turtle was legal - we would advocate a more rapid means of taking the animal's life. We further hope this turtle was taken for the purpose of human consumption.' Last night Catrina wrote on her Facebook page:  'Everyone who messages me saying rude things will also be reported for harassment and cyber bullying if they threaten me etc.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A Utah author claims a schoolteacher plagiarized her Christian romance novel, added graphic sex scenes and passed it off as her own. In a case she says brings to light plagiarism in the burgeoning world of online self-publishing, Rachel Ann Nunes of Orem filed a federal lawsuit in August against a Layton teacher, Tiffanie Rushton, who she says cut and pasted large sections from an electronic copy of her book. Nunes wrote 'Love to the Highest Bidder' in 1998 about two art dealers, one from New York and the other from California, who meet while competing for an Indian Buddha statue and fall in love. A Utah author claims a schoolteacher plagiarized her Christian romance novel, added graphic sex scenes and passed it off as her own . It was first published by a Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-oriented publisher. After the book went out of print, Nunes got the copyright and put out a slightly revised e-book version on Amazon.com with the name 'A Bid for Love.' Rushton's manuscript, 'The Auction Deal,' is about an art dealer who goes to Beverly Hills to bid on a rare sculpture and meets a successful gallery owner from Chicago, according to an online description. The full e-book has been pulled from the site goodreads.com. Nunes claims the book, which was not published in print, was written by Rushton under the pen name Sam Taylor Mullens. 'All the characters are the same, lines throughout and the plot. It is really hard for me to read it,' Nunes said Tuesday. In a case she says brings to light plagiarism in the burgeoning world of online self-publishing, Rachel Ann Nunes of Orem filed a federal lawsuit in August against a Layton teacher, Tiffanie Rushton . 'I feel like my life has been stolen.' She named a character after one of her seven children, making the added sex scenes particularly disturbing. Rushton did not return phone and email messages seeking comment, and no attorney has yet been listed for her. Though the story had been altered, Nunes says the details were recognizable to bloggers who Rushton asked to review an advance copy of the manuscript. Nunes' book, for example, contained this line in chapter one: 'For six years, he had put up with her overt stares and innuendos because she was not only his boss and sole owner of the gallery but also his friend.' Rushton's first chapter included a similar line, according to a screen shot posted online by Nunes: 'For ten years, I'd tolerated her overt stares and innuendos because she was part owner of our gallery and always seemed to find opportunities with new clients that helped the gallery that I could not.' Rushton appeared to be recasting the niche Christian story Nunes wrote into a book that would appeal to a mainstream romance reader looking for a more erotic tale, she said. 'It really is the thing that sells the most,' said Nunes, who has written 47 books in the last 18 years. In email exchanges between Rushton and Nunes, Rushton said the idea came from a friend who died in a car wreck and that she didn't want to reveal her real name because she is Mormon and her extended family wouldn't approve of her writing, according to the suit. Nunes said she's confirmed Mullens and Rushton are the same woman, though she declined to provide details, citing the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Davis School District confirmed that Rushton has been a third-grade teacher since 1993. After their exchange, Nunes says negative reviews began popping up on Amazon.com, Facebook and other websites. She alleges that Rushton created seven different profiles in an attempt to discredit her. Nunes is seeking at least $150,000 in damages as well as attorney's fees in the suit, which was first reported by the Ogden Standard-Examiner. Since filing it, Nunes says she's heard from other authors whose work has also been copied from their e-books. The books are often pulled when the plagiarism is identified but later reposted under a different name. 'It's so much easier ... online, you can be so anonymous,' she said. 'How many authors can afford to take someone to court? That's your life savings, that's your whole future.'

"Homes and roads in inner Melbourne have been hit by flash flooding. The State Emergency Service has been inundated with calls for help, with 135 requests in one hour after heavy rainfall hit Melbourne about 3pm (AEST) on Tuesday. A SES spokeswoman said most of the calls were for flooding in the inner north and east which were hit by flash flooding as the rain moved east.

"The fate of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, two British ships lost at sea while searching for the Northwest Passage, has been a mystery that has baffled Naval historians for more than 160 years. The two ships, along with their captains and 129 men, were last seen sailing north of Canada in July 1845. It is believed the doomed boats became trapped in sea ice, and that the crew may even have resorted to cannibalism to stay alive, but their exact fate has remained unknown, until now. Yesterday the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that underwater drones using sonar had located one of the two boats at the bottom of the Victoria Strait, near King William Island, Nunavut. Scroll down for video . Found! This image released by Parks Canada on Tuesday shows a side-scan sonar image of ship on the sea floor in northern Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that one of two fabled British explorer ships, the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, that disappeared in the Arctic more 160 years ago has been found . Discovery: A second image shared by Parks Canada shows another side-scan. It is not clear which of the two ships it is, but officials said it is definitely one of the pair . Ill-fated voyage: Both ships sailed from London to Baffin Bay, when they were last seen by two whaling ships. A note found by a later rescue mission detailed the rest of their journey, though the exact location of the wrecks remained a mystery until now . Mr Harper said it was too early to tell which of the vessels it was, but images beamed back to the surface contain enough information to confirm that it is one of the two. In 2008, Canada announced it would search for the ships in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the passage, which was found during searches for the missing ships. He said: 'This is truly a historic moment for Canada. This has been a great Canadian story and mystery and the subject of scientists, historians, writers and singers so I think we really have an important day in mapping the history of our country.' He added: 'Finding the first vessel will no doubt provide the momentum – or wind in our sails – necessary to locate its sister ship and find out even more about what happened to the Franklin Expedition’s crew.' Archeologists have hailed the find as highly significant, saying it is likely that items on board are well preserved and may include the bodies of crew members or photographs of their voyage. HMS Erebus and HMS Terror were heavily-armoured bomb ships, and two years before the mission to the Northwest Passage, they had taken an expedition captained by James Clark Ross to the Antarctic. Despite his experience in exploring polar waters, Ross turned down the latest mission, viewing it as too dangerous, so instead the command of Erebus passed to Sir John Franklin with Terror captained by Francis Crozier. The pair departed on their ill-fated expedition from London in May 1845, and were last seen sailing towards the Lancaster Sound by two whaling ships in July that year. After that, they were never seen again. While no one knows for sure exactly what happened to the crew, experts believe the ships were lost in 1848 after they became locked in the ice near King William Island and that the crews abandoned them in a hopeless bid to reach safety. In 1854, an explorer by the name of John Rae came across an Inuit who claimed to have met the expedition, and produced a small silver plate with the engraving ‘Sir John Franklin K.C.B’. However, the man also told Rae that the explorers had resorted to cannibalism in order to stay alive. Mission: The HMS Terror and Erebus, depicted in New Zealand in 1841 in a painting, left, were being led by British Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin, right . What happened to them? Mystery still surrounds exactly what happened to the crew, who are depicted in 1847 depiction by W Turner Smith. It is widely believed the expedition was troubled by thick ice and that most of the men died of starvation - although Inuits reported at the time that some turned to cannibalism . Missing: Franklin is pictured in the left picture, second row down center, along with his crew. Right, some of the tools and equipment they took on their expedition . Hunt: Another illustration shows the noonday rest of a search party led by Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka as they search for Sir Franklin and his team, circa 1880 . Eventually an expedition to King William Island, near to where the wreck has now been found, discovered a note written by Franklin which revealed that the expedition camped at Beechy Island between 1845-6, the Erebus and Terror then sailed southwards to the entrance of Victoria Strait. Here on September 12, 1846 the two vessels became trapped in ice north of King William Island, and spent two winters here between September 1846 and April 1848. The note says Franklin died on 11 June 1847, without giving a cause of death, and the command passed onto Francis Crozier. Abandoning their ships on April 22, 1848, 105 survivors led by Crozier set out toward Back River. After that, historians rely on Inuit accounts for the fate of the men, and believe that some may have headed back to the stricken ships, which sank at different times. It is thought some survivors may have lived as late as 1850. The failure of the expedition was a huge event in England in the mid-19th century; The Globe and Mail likened it to a moon landing gone wrong today. Franklin's vessels are among the most sought-after prizes in marine archaeology, and Harper said the discovery would shed light on what happened to Franklin's crew. Tantalizing traces have been found over the years, including the bodies of three crewmen discovered in the 1980s. The bodies of two English seamen - John Hartnell, 25, and Royal Marine William Braine, 33 - were exhumed in 1986. An expedition uncovered the perfectly preserved remains of a petty officer, John Torrington, 20, in an ice-filled coffin in 1984. Franklin's disappearance prompted one of history's largest and longest rescue searches, from 1848 to 1859, which resulted in the passage's discovery. The original search for the ships helped open up parts of the Canadian Arctic for discovery back in the 1850s. The route runs from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic archipelago. European explorers sought the passage as a shorter route to Asia, but found it rendered inhospitable by ice and weather. Search: An image from August 24 shows a crew member of the HMCS Kingston loading an remote underwater vehicle as part of the Victoria Strait Expedition . Proud: Prime Minister Stephen Harper, right, talks about the find from the Victoria Strait Expedition as Parks Canada's Ryan Harris looks on. Canada started looking for the ships in 2008 in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, which Franklin's crews had been searching for . Recognizable: Parks Canada's Ryan Harris explains the find from the Victoria Strait Expedition during a a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday . Early clues: John Geiger, president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, holds an iron fitting from a Royal Navy ship, which is regarded as the key piece of evidence that led to the discovery of the ship . With the melting Arctic ice now unlocking the shipping route Franklin was after, Harper's government searched for the ship in order to stake a claim on the passage. Sunday's discovery came shortly after a team of archaeologists found a tiny fragment from the Franklin expedition. Searchers discovered an iron fitting that once helped support a boat from one of the doomed expedition's ships in the King William Island search area. The search for an Arctic passage to Asia frustrated explorers for centuries, beginning with John Cabot's voyage in 1497. Eventually it became clear that a passage did exist, but was too far north for practical use. Cabot, the Italian-British explorer, died in 1498 while trying to find it and the shortcut eluded other famous explorers including Henry Hudson and Francis Drake. No sea crossing was successful until Roald Amundsen of Norway completed his trip from 1903-1906. The HMS Erebus which sank in the Victoria Strait along with the HMS Terror after an ill-fated expedition to find the Northwest Passage . In May 1845 Captain Sir John Franklin set off from London to find the Northwest Passage, a rumoured trading route which European merchants hoped would cut shipping times to Asia. Sailing on board the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, along with 129 hand-picked crew and enough supplies to last seven years, Franklin sailed north to Baffin Bay, between Greenland and Canada, before turning into Lancaster Sound. In July 1845 two whaling vessels recorded spotting Franklin and his ships as they sailed past. That was to be the last sighting of either vessel for nearly 160 years. Back in London, in 1847, after months without contact from Franklin, another Arctic explorer by the name of James Clark Ross raised the alarm, saying a search party should be sent to look for them. However, believing the boats had enough supplies to last another year at least, the Navy delayed sending a search party until 1848. No trace of the boats or their crews could be found, despite a £20,000 reward being offered for any captain who brought back news of the ill-fate expedition. It wasn't until 1850 that a camp at Beechy Island was discovered, though there was no note explaining where the boats had gone. Later, in 1854, explorer John Rae came across an Inuit who claimed to have passed the vessels as they were dragged along by their crew, and produced a silver plate with Franlink's initials engraved on it as proof. However, the man also said that he had seen the crews resorting to cannibalism in order to survive, a claim that is still hotly debated. Finally in 1857 Captain F.L. Mc’Clintock, sailing on a mission funded by Franklin's wife, discovered the remains of a camp on William Island, along with a note detailing the last movements of Franklin and his crew. The note, which had originally be written saying everything was going well, was penned over with a message revealing how everything had gone wrong. After spending the winter from 1845-6 at a camp on Beechy Island, Franklin sailed his ships south towards Victoria Strait before becoming stuck in ice north of King William Island where the crew spent two winters between September 1846 and April 1848. According to the note, Franklin died on 11 June 1847, though no cause is given. The command passed to Francis Crozier, who waited until 22 April 1848 before taking 105 survivors and heading for the mainland. Nothing more is known about Crozier, or what became of the men, though it is thought that several may have returned to the ships and lived there until 1850, before the vessels sank to the bottom of the sea.","HMS Erebus and HMS Terror took British explorer Sir John Franklin and 129 crew to find Northwest Passage .

"An incredible 232.08-carat white diamond of 'exceptional size and clarity' has been unearthed at a mine in South Africa, with a possible value of £10million. The dazzling D colour Type II diamond was found by Petra Diamonds at its Cullinan mine in South Africa, with four analysts predicting a £10million price tag. Type II diamonds, which are formed over long periods of time, tend to be large and irregular in shape and have no measurable nitrogen impurities. This means they are often of top quality in terms of colour and clarity. Scroll down for video . Valuable: An incredible 232.08-carat white diamond has been unearthed at a mine in South Africa . Meanwhile, D colour stones are known for being the most colourless, and therefore the most sought after and costly. The Cullinan mine is famed for the largest rough gem diamond ever recovered, the 3,106 carat Cullinan Diamond found in 1905, which was cut into stones that are part of Britain's Crown Jewels. A spokesman described the newly-found stone as 'a magnificent example of the large, high quality diamonds for which the mine is known.' The recent find is Petra's largest white diamond since it unearthed the 507-carat Cullinan Heritage in 2009 from the same mine. That rough white diamond was given a 'flawless' clarity grade and fetched $35.3million (£21million), a record price for the company. 'We estimate a sales price in the order of $10million to $15million (£10million), given Gem Diamonds' recent sale of Type II white at about $70,000 per carat and assuming some losses for cutting/polishing,' Numis Securities analysts said in a note. Start saving: Petra said it expected the diamond to be sold between October and December . Formed over long periods of time, Type II diamonds tend to be large and irregular in shape. They have no measurable nitrogen impurities that cause a yellow or brown colour in other diamonds. This means they are often of top quality in terms of colour and clarity. They are also rarer than Type I stones, which are the most common class of diamond and contain atoms as their main impuritiy. D colour stones are known for being the most colourless, and are therefore the most sought after and costly. 'The extra revenue would go straight to the bottom line', Numis said. Petra, which reported revenue of about $473million (£290million) in the previous financial year, declined to specify how much the diamond could fetch. A company spokesman told Reuters the stone would most likely be snapped up by a buyer from traditional diamond hubs such as the United States, Europe, Israel or China, who could cut the stone into polished gems. 'It's more a case of the clients coming to us, rather than us needing to approach clients,' he said. Petra said it expected the diamond to be sold in October-December, the second quarter of its financial year. Investors are also awaiting the outcome Petra's sale of a rare 122.52-carat blue diamond recovered from Cullinan this year. Analysts have pegged the stone's value at more than $35million. The sale period closes on Friday. Rock on: The enormous sparkler was found by Petra Diamonds Ltd at its Cullinan mine in South Africa . The miner, with five producing mines in South Africa and one in Tanzania, sold a 29.6 carat blue diamond to U.S. luxury jeweller Cora International in February for $25.6million. Petra has in the past year retrieved some large blue diamonds from Cullinan, which was one of the five non-core mines it bought from Anglo American Plc's De Beers unit - the world's biggest diamond producer by value. Shares in the diamond miner, which operates primarily in South Africa, climbed as much as seven per cent to a high of 189.2 pence in early trading, the biggest rise on Britain's FTSE 250 Midcap Index on Tuesday.","The dazzling D colour 232-carat Type II diamond was found in South Africa .

"Margaret Hodge MP said customers will not make enough savings to foot the cost of new meters being rolled out in the next five years . Families could end up forking out more for smart energy meters than they will save, MPs have suggested. The Public Accounts Committee said the average cost of installing 53million of the devices over five years could amount to £215 per household, or £43 a year, with the expense added to bills. But over the same period, households can expect to shave only around £26 a year off their bills, the MPs said. The Government claims families will reduce how much they spend on gas and electricity they use because they will be able to monitor their usage. But MPs on the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee have questioned whether the high specification devices, which will include displays to demonstrate gas and electricity usage and costs, will be good value of money. The Government and energy industry have decided that all homes and small businesses should have meters installed by 2020. Ministers have backed the plan as part of a wider strategy to cut household energy use and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet EU targets. The devices will deliver massive savings to energy companies because the meters allow them to get accurate energy use readings automatically, which means they can rid of thousands of meter readers, billing and customer service staff. It will also allow the energy firms to introduce new variable tariffs that impose much higher charges during the peak evening period in order to encourage families to switch energy use to other times of the day. The Government claims that families who can better see how they use energy and how much it costs will reduce the amount of gas and electricity they use. But Margaret Hodge, chairman of the committee, warned: ‘It will cost around £215 per home or small business over the next five years to install the meters. 'Despite consumers footing the bill, they can on average make a saving of only 2 per cent on the average annual bill of £1,328 by the time the roll out is complete. Even this is conditional on consumers changing their behaviour and cutting their energy use. 'The Department of Energy and Climate Change is relying on the consumer becoming more “savvy” in making decisions about using energy.’ Even this claimed saving is questionable, for some research carried out by British academics suggests any reduction is likely to be short-lived before people return to their old habits. MPs also warned that some features of the new meters could be obsolete before they are installed, such as the home display monitor showing energy use. MPs on the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee have questioned whether the high specification devices, which will include displays to demonstrate gas and electricity usage and costs, will be good value of money (posed by model) The committee pointed out that it would be far cheaper to send this information to homes via a smartphone app. The Government’s Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is relying heavily on competition among the energy companies to keep the price of installing the meters down. However, Miss Hodge warned: ‘Relying on market forces to keep costs down may not be enough on its own to protect consumers. This is something energy companies don’t have a great track record on.’ She said the companies also need to provide clear information to customers on the costs of installing the meters, how much they will save by stopping meter readings and how much energy is being saved as a result of the new regime. Sharing her concerns about whether the meter technology being installed will be obsolete, Miss Hodge said: ‘Some aspects of the programme could be out-of-date by the time it is rolled out. ‘Evolving technology suggests that customers could receive the information on their smart phones, making the in-home display redundant. ‘Energy suppliers will be required to offer in-home displays, even though customers may not want or use them. Consumers will have to pay for them even though they might already be out of date. ‘The Department must monitor progress, costs and benefits during roll-out to identify whether changes are needed to secure the delivery of smart meters at minimum cost to consumers.’ Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal.

If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. Don't forget, prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

Bondi resident, Sara Armor, 26, can relate all too well with life being too manic to find the time to organise another trip to doctor. Three years ago when she was just 23 years-old, Ms Armor couldn’t refill her pill prescription because she had left it at work over the weekend and when her period didn’t arrive on time she began to panic. ‘I took a test which said it was negative but until I got my period I was really worried because those tests are not always 100 per cent accurate, so it was quite scary,’ she said. ‘I spent spent two or three weeks freaking out and was very relieved when my period finally came.' 'I now know to be more careful - if I don't have time to get my prescription filled then I use other forms of protection.' Ms Armor said she receives emergency calls from friends asking to borrow a week's worth of her pill . Of the 634 women surveyed last month by Pureprofile, one in five had risked unwanted pregnancy because they haven’t got their prescription filled in time and had sex without contraception . Ms Armor said it can a hassle to get to the clinic for a new prescription. 'I know in my working day - if you don't have a repeat prescription - you can't just go down the chemist - you have to sit in the doctor's waiting room in your lunch break and it can go over time,' she said. 'Or you have to go after work and you have things to do - you want to go out and see your friends - you don't want to be stuck waiting around all afternoon.' Adelaide GP Olivia Chen said many women don't realise that by not taking the pill consistently can risk efficacy, hormonal imbalance and troublesome symptoms such as spotting. 'But the number one thing is you will get pregnant if you don’t use the pill properly,' she said. 'There is a 99.7 per cent effective rate in preventing pregnancies if you take it every day at the same time but as soon as you start taking it ad hoc that effectiveness comes down to 91 per cent.' Ms Armor said most of her friends often used the pill when it suited them. 'I get emergency calls from girlfriends asking to borrow a week of my pill because they don't have time to get their own,' she said. 'A lot of girls tend to use it more for convenience such as going on holidays and don't want to get their period - or they've just started seeing someone new but then if they are single they go off it.' There is a 99.7 per cent effective rate in preventing pregnancies if you take it every day at the same time but the effectiveness drops to 91 per cent if you start taking it ad hoc . Dr Chen suggests women who are juggling too many balls to be able to find the time to get to the doctor to try accessing a script via the internet on Lloyds Online Doctor. Unless there are complications, the process only takes about 10 minutes which includes answering 30 questions - then the patient has the option of having the script posted to their home or the medication sent to their doorstep. However, Dr Chen about 10 per cent of patients are not suitable for an online consultation. 'It's not like buying a kettle from an online site,' she said. 'We can call or text the patient for more details and if we think it is the wrong pill for you or it is a complicated case, we refund your fee and recommend you to see your doctor.' 'But the patients with an uncomplicated history get processed that day.' Dr Chen insists the service was not replacing the face-to-face appointments with your GP which was still necessary for many other situations, but this was simply an accessible option for time-poor females.

"Boxing great Mike Tyson is coming to the defense of Toronto's scandal-plagued Mayor Rob Ford. The ear-biting boxer and crack-smoking politician spent 40 minutes together this afternoon at Toronto City Hall, and afterwards, Tyson seemed to be very impressed with Mayor Ford. In a rambling exchange with reporters following the meeting, Tyson called his new friend, 'The best mayor in Toronto's history.' Scroll down for video . New friends: Mike Tyson and Mayor Rob Ford spent 40 minutes together at Toronto City Hall this evening, with Tyson later calling Ford the 'best mayor in Toronto history' Ford returned to work in June after a stint in rehab for drug and alcohol abuse. The mayor became an international celebrity last year after he acknowledged using crack in a 'drunken stupor' following months of denials. The boxer went on to say, 'It's not his fault, it's just that he is living his life and we are human beings — we have no idea what you do behind closed doors.' Back to work: Mayor Ford returned to office in June of this year, after a stint in rehab for drug and alcohol abuse . Tyson, of course, has had his own problems with the law, having been convicted of rape in 1992. He also bit the ear of fellow boxer Evander Holyfield in a 1997 match. He was disqualified from the fight. For these reasons, many in the crowd were not thrilled to see the former undisputed heavyweight champion at City Hall. Troubled past: Tyson has also had his share of problems, having been convicted of rape in 1992, and biting the ear of fellow boxer Evander Holyfield during a 1997 fight . 'We’re welcoming a rapist and a wife-beater to city hall with open arms, and he’s banned in the U.K.for those charges,' said protester Carmen Celestini, according to the Toronto Star. 'It’s just not acceptable to me.' Tyson is in Toronto for his one-man show Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth. When Mayor Ford was asked about the controversy of hosting Tyson, he simply said, 'I’m not going to comment on his personal life.' He then added, 'We’re cut from the same cloth. There’s no nonsense. I respect him.'","Mike Tyson and Rob Ford spent 40 minutes together this afternoon at Toronto City Hall .

"Residents in a Seattle, Washington neighborhood have spent the last few months in fear of a group of squatters that took over a local home and trashed the property, covering the yard in knee-deep filth. Last week, a judge granted the Haller Lake community's request to have the squatters evicted, but they still haven't left the property and now the neighbors are sending a petition to the mayor in hopes of changing the laws around squat homes. Joaquin Gauna is one of the men that lives at the trashed property, and told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer he is no squatter, and that he and his four roommates pay bills at the home  on the corner of N 137th Street and Burke Ave North. Wrecked: Neighbors near this home in the Haller Lake community of Seattle say it has been taken over by squatters who have trashed the property . Claims: Joaquina Gauna is one of five people who live at the property, and he claims he is no squatter and that the neighbors are just harassing him . 'They've been doing everything they can to get us out of here,' Gauna said of his neighbors. He says they've actually been cleaning up the home, saying the mounds of dirty clothes and trash in the yard are a 'recycling' project. Steve Warren, a resident who lives up the street from the squat, has been leading the effort to get Gauna and his roommates kicked off the property. 'People are threatened,' Warren said. 'They're afraid to come out of their homes when this kind of thing happens.' And Warren says the trash is just one of the many problems the group has been causing. He says the home has been the subject of over 80 complaints to police this year, many of the calls involving drugs. While Warren and the community members  won a major battle last week with the eviction, they say the time it took is evidence of a larger problem. They are now putting forth a petition to Seattle Mayor Ed Murray to give authorities more power in evicting squatters from the homes and apartments they don't legally own. As of Tuesday, the petition had over 350 signatures on Change.org. Drug den: The home has been the subject of over 80 complaints to police in the last year, many for drug issues .

"A woman who attacked her husband with a hammer in rural Queensland after he questioned her about her debts has been sentenced to eight years prison. Kay Lyons, from Wattlecamp - about 200km north-west of Brisbane, pleaded guilty at Brisbane Supreme Court to the attempted murder of David Lyons who she bludgeoned over the head with a hammer on June 4, 2013. David was sitting at his computer desk when his wife of 36 years ambushed him from behind after he discovered an email to their accountant from the 54-year-old woman saying she needed more time to pay her debts because her daughter had died, which was untrue. Scroll down for video . Kay Lyons attacked her husband, David Lyons, with a hammer in their rural Queensland home . It was discovered Kay had a crippling gambling addiction and had wracked up $10,000 on their joint credit card. But when David decided to confront her about it, Kay snapped and almost beat him to death in their home. 'She hit me once, one heavy blow, and I fell off the chair and she sort of followed me down and kept hitting,' he told A Current Affair. 'She said: ""I’m going to kill you"", she said: ""Why won’t you die? I can’t live with you and can’t live without you"".' David said his wife attacked him from behind and kept hitting with the hammer . A former friend said Kay had been traumatised after her life was threatened during her time as a youth worker . Kay pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced for eight years jail . Still conscious but feeling faint and dizzy, David stumbled into the next room to grab a towel to wrap around his head before walking out onto the street and hailing down a passing car for help. David was airlifted to hospital and was treated for serious injuries. 'There was a possibility I would have died,' he said. The pensioner said he had forgiven her for the attack but saw it as the ultimate betrayal. He has made the decision to end their marriage. 'If you can’t trust your wife of over 30 years with your life, who would you trust?' David said. The Lyons' daughter, Amanda, said her father was 'devoted' to her mother and wished she had asked for assistance. 'All she needed to do was tell someone she was having trouble,' she said. Their daughter, Amanda, said they were the appearance of devotion and she wished her mother had told them of her troubles . Amanda teared up on the program as she spoke to A Current Affair . A former friend of Kay - who wished to remain anonymous, said the 54-year-old was left troubled after her job at a youth care services company. 'That’s what I think pushed her over the edge,' the former friend - who had known Kay for about seven years - told Daily Mail Australia. 'Her life was threatened on the job and she was a bit traumatised by that. 'She was also a trauma by her daughter’s birth. Her daughter was born with her intestines were on the outside.' The former friend said she felt sad that Kay was going to jail but 'the law is the law'. 'We got along really well and she called me her sister and I feel bad for not visiting her in jail,' she said. 'I know she liked to gamble. She’d lose herself for a while at a poker machine but I had no problem with that. 'I didn’t know she had running up debts.'

"Kris lived through a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic dad and absent mum . A woman who nearly died of anorexia and survived a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic father and absent mother has spoken out about her childhood to try and help other children. Kris Teece, 38, says she never really had a stable home until she moved to country town Armidale in regional NSW when she was four. ''Growing up in my household was fractious. My dear father was a chronic alcoholic who had severe seizures if he didn't drink,' she said. 'It was not your average nuclear family, the house had an atmosphere filled with lots of arguing and fighting and you never really knew what to expect. 'My mother was emotionally unavailable to me and often lived away from me after the age of 10. 'She moved away from us to go to work to try and support us. 'Mum was not coping with what was happening. 'My parents would fight and I obviously didn't want to see that or be around it. 'My situation was not unique, it's a lot more common than people realise. 'Unfortunately It's a reality that a lot of children and young people have to deal with and they have to create another family around them. 'I was always over at neighbour's homes and that was the good thing about living in a country town. 'And that is exactly what I had to do, I moved in with my grandparents pretty much full time from the age of 10 an . 'Even though I was away from my immediate family a lot I have always had people around me, I had a strong community, not everyone has that which is really sad.' Kris was diagnosed with 'severe' anorexia when she was 15, she was hospitalised for three months . Kris in one of the many hostels she stayed in as a teenager, she met Leesa in the refuge in Armidale . Kris says much of her teenage years are a 'blur' after using alcohol and drugs to get away from reality . When Kris was 14 she developed anorexia and she says 'if I hadn't have gone into the hospital when I did I could have died from it'. She said: 'The anorexia started  when I really wanted to be good at ballet and and I didn't have any self confidence. It became my way of trying to control the world around me.' Kris was an ballerina when she became anorexic . 'When I was 15 I was seen by a doctor who saw that I was very ill and I was sent away to recover at Westmead Hospital for three months to be treated for 'severe' anorexia. 'I didn't know why I wanted to starve myself but away from family and my life, I learnt that there were some things very wrong with my family. 'When I was at the hospital I began to talk. I was amazed how many people listened and cared.' Soon after leaving the hospital Kris turned to drink and drugs to try and escape from reality. At 16 she went into Armidale refuge and that was where she met youth worker Leesa Waters who was one of the people who 'absolutely transformed' her life. 'It was scary to have people care but I also knew I needed that so much.' 'I connected with three of the youth workers over the time I was there and the president of that refuge was a foster carer. 'The president  even took me in when I was kicked out. 'Leesa was one of many people that I met and I was really lucky that a number of people went above and beyond to help me. 'She did more than what was expected, those years are a bit hazy because I was using drug and alcohol to medicate what I couldn't deal. 'That started soon after I got out of hospital and lost one addiction and I found another one. 'I really felt that Leesa had respect for me and I could not work out why, she was very encouraging about me achieving life goals and finding a path through the chaos at that point. 'I was really disengaged from most things in society, when someone like that comes along it has a really positive impact.' After losing contact when they left the refuge Leesa and Kris bumped into each other crossing a road in Parramata four years ago. They both worked in child protection and decided to keep in contact and they have been working together on the NAPCAN project for National Child Protection Week. Kris (right) and Leesa (left) at a recent event promoting the campaign . Kris, now a mother of four and lives in Castle Hill, Sydney, decided to speak in depth about her childhood to try and help save other who are in the same situations. She wants to encourage kids to speak up about their problems as part of the 'Play Your Part' campaign being run by NAPCAN. Kris says the help she got from adults and the community throughout her life helped to make her a successful adult. Kris and Leesa with fellow charity representatives supporting National Child Protection Week . 'Kids needs day to day interactions with adults. If it wasn't for the adults I had in her life things might have turned out very different. 'I came into contact with a lot of other rough people who were really struggling who didn't have the networks that i did and the outcomes have been really different,' she explained. Leesa Waters, deputy CEO of NAPCAN, hopes by Kris sharing her story she can help other children . 'The focus of the campaign is to get across that everyone has a part to play. 'It takes a village to raise a child and sometimes parents can't give the child all the help they need. 'I believe children and young people need the help of more than just their parents, they need the community to show they are worthwhile. 'I have made sure that I am deeply involved in the lives of all my children. 'My son started playing rugby union and I had no idea about it until I started going to games and I ended up managing his team. 'My daughter does ballet and I got really involved in what she was doing so I am part of her life.' Leesa, Deputy CEO for NAPCAN added: 'This is a story demonstrating positive outcomes when people play their part to support children, especially children facing great challenges. 'Kris is such an inspiring person to so many; she is a mum, she has completed a degree in music and education from Sydney conservatorium where she became a member of the Golden Key Society for high academic achievement, she has a masters in criminology, she has been a foster carer, a kinship carer, a private ballet and singing instructor and a qualified fitness instructor. 'The Play Your Part initiative by NAPCAN has been designed to try and shift social norms and make the provision of a safe community for children and young people a concern shared by all Australians. 'We did a survey in 2009 and it came back that 92 per cent believed that child abuse and neglect was a really serious issue, and my view around that is that people don't know what to do or how to help and it is always a lot easier if you can give people a story that moves them.'

"Just one in four students leave university with the highest levels of reading and writing, according to a new international study. While increasing numbers of people are going on to higher education, the majority do not  reach the highest standards in literacy, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s, annual education report. Andreas Schleicher, the organisation’s director for education and skills, said the findings show that while more people in the UK are gaining qualifications, this is not being matched by improved skills in reading and writing. He suggested this was similar with numeracy. Graduates: Just one in four students leave university with the highest levels of reading and writing, according to a new international study (file picture) The latest Education At A Glance study reveals that a student in the UK is now more likely to go to university than they are to finish their education on leaving school. In 2012, around two in five 25 to 64-year-olds (41per cent) held a degree or equivalent qualification, while 37per cent stopped studying after gaining their GCSEs or A-levels. It also shows that in 2012, the last year for which data is available, 48per cent of UK young people aged 25 to 34 had been to university or college, compared to 33per cent of 55 to 64-year-olds. But while more people are continuing their education, the report suggests that this is not reflected in better basic skills. The data, which draws on international tests conducted by the OECD, shows that just 25per cent of graduates in England and Northern Ireland have the highest levels of ability in literacy. Study:  Literacy and numeracy skills can reflect what a student has learnt at school, before they go on to higher education, and universities may assume that students already have these abilities . In many high-performing countries, including Australia, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden, more than a third of graduates are performing at this level. 'On the one hand in the UK you can say qualification levels have risen enormously, lots more people are getting tertiary qualifications, university degrees, but actually not all of that is visible in better skills,' Mr Schleicher said. 'In the UK, it’s at best a middle position,' he suggested. 'I think that’s something, quality and degrees do not always align.' He added: 'There’s also a big distribution in outcomes. What’s interesting is when you look at people with tertiary qualifications, there’s a lot of variability in the skills those people have attained. 'Not all further education qualifications really deserve that name because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than people who have just come out of school.' The figures cover not just university degrees, but any type of higher level, or 'tertiary' qualification. Performance: In high-performing countries, including Australia, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden, more than a third of graduates are performing at the highest literacy level . Mr Schleicher said that he would have expected the UK to perform better at the highest levels of literacy. 'UK universities have a very strong reputation - you would have expected this stronger prevalence among the most highly skilled people.' In general, literacy and numeracy skills can reflect what a student has learnt at school, before they go on to higher education, Mr Schleicher said, adding that universities may assume that students already have these abilities, when they could be improved. The latest report shows that around a third of 25 to 34-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland have achieved a higher level of education than their mothers and fathers, but adds that parents’ level of education still has a strong influence on a child’s educational achievement. An individual in England and Northern Ireland whose parents hold a degree is more than six times more likely to go into higher education than someone whose parents did not gain their GCSEs. It adds that greater access to higher education does not necessarily lead to better social mobility - essentially more poorer students going on to study for a degree. Social background is still a key factor in going into higher education, it is suggested. The OECD also found that the UK is one of very few countries to have worked out a sustainable approach to funding higher education, through fees and loans. However, this is based on the old system, before fees were tripled to a maximum of £9,000 per year. Education and childcare minister Sam Gyimah said: 'We are committed to providing flexible, affordable and good quality childcare, giving parents more of a choice about where they send their children, so that they can get the best start in life. 'As a result of our plan for education more families than ever before are now eligible for free childcare, including 15 free hours a week for all three and four-year-olds and, from next year, tax free childcare of up to £2,000 per child. 'The benefits of good quality childcare can last a child a lifetime and are especially crucial for children who are from more disadvantaged backgrounds to stop them falling behind their peers. 'This is why we’ve also extended free childcare to the 40% most disadvantaged children and introduced the Early Years Pupil Premium.' Big classes 'mean better teachers': Bigger UK class sizes mean teachers are better paid . Class sizes in the UK are bigger than many other countries, but this may be because there is more focus on the quality of teachers. There are around 21 pupils per teacher in UK primary schools and 16 students for each teacher in secondaries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s annual education report. This is higher than the OECD averages of 15 children per teacher in primary education and 13 students for every teacher in secondary education. Numbers: There are around 21 pupils per teacher in UK primary schools and 16 students for each teacher in secondaries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . It means that the UK effectively has larger class sizes than many other countries including Australia, France, Germany and the United States. But Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, said that nations may have to make a 'trade-off' between smaller classes and paying teachers more, and many high-performing countries choose the latter. 'You can spend your money only once, so if you have a fixed amount of money that’s the kind of trade-off you have to make,' he said. He added: 'Basically smaller classes limit your capacity to pay teachers better, and that’s the trade-off you can see in the data.' Mr Schleicher said that as far as the UK was concerned, in upper secondary education, decisions over class sizes and teachers are consistent with what is seen in many high-performing countries. 'Finland will be doing the same, Japan will be doing the same, Singapore, Korea. All those countries prioritise teaching and teachers over infrastructure and class size.' The report also shows that in the early years, or nursery education, there are around 19 children per teacher, higher than the OECD average of 14 pupils per teacher. The figures cover teachers only, and do not include teaching assistants or other school and nursery staff. Mr Schleicher said that the UK uses a lot of non-teaching staff in nursery schools, adding that in many other countries there are more teachers in early years education.","Study finds majority of students do not reach the highest literacy standards .

"Investing in the stock market could soon be a whole lot easier with the help of a new smartphone application. Application Acorns takes the price tags of credit and debit card expenses and automatically rounds them to the next highest dollar. Whatever is left  is placed in a portfolio users can access right on their phones, according to Acorns' website. At least $5 is needed for one of Acorns' investment options, the website says.  In a 'conservative' portfolio,  40 percent is dedicated to government bonds.  30 percent goes toward real estate stocks and 25 percent goes toward small company stocks in 'aggressive' portfolios. Smartphone investing: Acorns takes users' debit card or credit card purchases and automatically rounds them up to the next dollar amount - and then invests whatever is left . Acorns also lets app users make both lump payments or set up automatic payments. Only $10,000 can be deposited per day, and Acorns also allows for full withdrawals. The app does, however, have its users pay small fees. 'After you begin investing, we charge $1 per month and .25 – .50% of your investment annually,' Acorns says on its website. Acorns also maintains that the app could help users put away significant change. 'Over time, incremental investing has the potential to transform seemingly trivial amounts of money into a sizeable investment account,' Acorns says on its website. 'By investing just $1 per day with a 10% return, your account could grow to more than $2,000 after five years. By increasing this to $5 per day, you could reach $10,000 after five years, or $30,000 after ten years.' Jeff Cruttenden, who founded Acorns with his father Walter Cruttenden, told Wired 'We had to consider people who are Ubering home and walking down the street. They don’t have a check with them or 15 minutes to pore over a complicated document. We wanted to simplify and streamline it.'

"A high street fashion chain has been forced to withdraw a popular range of home furnishings from sale as the artwork on the curtains, rugs and cushions resembles a penis. The watercolour range of goods was on sale on Next's website and in store with items on offer for as much as £125. One man noticed the design mistake after his mother had purchased the new curtains and hung them in his bedroom. The controversial range of curtains and cushions featured an original watercolour design, pictured . Unfortunately for Next, the flower image altered slightly in the manufacturing process with amusing results . Scott Godfrey said: 'How do you manage to make private parts when they're supposed to be flowers?' Scott Godfrey from Ipswich told the Daily Star: 'After taking a close look at the curtains my mum had bought, I couldn’t help noticing they seemed to include pictures of, well, men’s genitalia. I can’t believe no-one at Next is aware of this. How do you manage to make private parts when they’re supposed to be flowers?” A spokesperson for Next admitted the company had made a mistake and would withdraw the range from sale. 'Thank you for drawing attention to this. 'The design was based on an original watercolour painting and unfortunately the way the watercolour paint has dried has given the illusion of something that was not intended, we are not continuing with this design on any products.' In July, the company was forced to apologise to the parents of twin girls Evelyn and Amelia Gallivan after their father Shane, 23, spotted the image of a penis on his daughters' baby grow. Mr Gallivan saw the penis image on the clothes as they were hanging on the washing line. His wife Carla, 24, said: 'He was feeding my daughter when he suddenly said ""oh my god"",' said the insurance worker. 'He looked at the baby grow and noticed the trousers were covered in penises. Scott Godfey took a photograph of the 'offending image' which he claims does not look like a flower . 'At first I thought it must just be a mistake, but I looked and there are lots of different ones all over it. 'It just looks like the designer was having a laugh and no one spotted it. I was angry because it's not the kind of thing you should be dressing a baby in.' Next, which stocks hundreds of baby clothes, later admitted the drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint. Mr and Mrs Gallivan had been given a packet of the baby grows as a present four months ago, but had only recently noticed the design flaw. In July, Next was forced to apologise after this baby grow was spotted featuring a small penis in the design . They are now refusing to dress their twin daughters in them. 'We aren't going to keep it and keep dressing the girls in it,' said Mrs Gallivan. 'I think what makes it all worse is that I have dressed two girls in it, not just that I put it on a baby. 'The girls were wearing it for weeks before we noticed. We don't tend to look in depth at the clothes. 'We just thought it was a cute, nice baby grow with washing line with clothes and socks on it, but then we saw this. Once you notice it, it is unmistakeable.' A spokesman for Next said the offending design was pulled from shelves after they received another complaint about the item. In a statement, the store said: 'We were shocked by the image that ended up on one of our sleepsuits. 'The offending part of the design started life as an upside down jumper with a neck binding and placket with buttons (hanging on the washing line), but unfortunately has been over simplified by the printer and has unintentionally become something else. 'This is an innocent mistake that had not been picked up in the approval process. As it was inappropriate we made the decision to withdraw this item from sale as soon as it was bought to our attention earlier this year.'","Scott Godfrey spotted the 'penis' after his mother bought the curtains .

"The wife of a former Florida mayor is in court this week, accused of beating his new girlfriend - and her former friend - to death with a hammer. Sheila Graham-Trott, 48, was arrested in February 2010 for the first-degree murder of her friend Kelly Brennan, who betrayed her by dating her husband, former Indialantic Mayor Dan Trott, when the two separated. Graham-Trott's mother turned her into police four years ago when her daughter led family to Brennan's body. But the defense is hoping to win the case, by proving that Graham-Trott wasn't the only person who had an interest in killing Brennan. They argue that her Brennan's husband, Gino Rallo, was heartbroken at their own impending divorce, enough to kill. Graham-Trott also has an alibi - surveillance footage which shows her at a Walgreen's at the time of Brennan's brutal murder. Love triangle: Sheila Graham-Trott appeared in court on Tuesday as she stands trial for the February 2010 murder of Kelly Brennan, her ex-husband's girlfriend . New love: Brennan (left) went missing in February 2010 on her way to meet her boyfriend Dan Trott (right) at the gym. Trott is a former mayor of Indialantic, Florida . On Tuesday, Graham-Trott's sons Creighton and Graham took the stand to testify about the day their mother led them to Brennan's body in a wooded area. Brennan was reported missing when she didn't show up the gym, where she said she would meet her boyfriend Trott. Creighton talked about coming home one evening, with his brother Graham worried that their mother was experiencing a seizure. So they took her to the hospital, and she later woke up saying she had a dream Brennan had been hurt. Resting place: Graham-Trott allegedly led her two sons to Brennan's body after the murder. She was found beaten to death with a hammer, still wearing her spandex gym outfit . Ashamed: Creighton (left) and Graham Trott (right) testified against their mother in court on Tuesday. They spoke about the time she led them to Brennan's body after saying she had a dream the woman had been hurt . Eventually they drove with their mother to a wooded area called Mark's Landing where they found Brennan's butchered body. 'Graham called us over and he's like, ""I think I see something"". So we walked over and saw a body...just a shadow of a body that was in some sort of spandex work-out uniform.' The two sons did not turn their mother in, but told her 'you're going to have to deal with this yourself. We're out of this' when they returned home. Graham-Trott's mother eventually called police to report the murder. The Trott sons' testimonies followed that of Gino Rallo on Monday, as the defense attempted to prove he was enraged after hearing of his wife's affair, and would have killed her so she wouldn't be with another man. They also say a large life insurance pay out could have been motivation. Possible suspect? The defense is attempting to argue that Brennan's husband Gino Rallo had motivation to kill her as well. He took the stand on Monday . Rallo and Brennan were also going through a divorce when she started seeing Trott, and allegedly the two got into a physical fight when she told her husband she was leaving the house. Reported: Graham-Trott was arrested after her mother turned her in to police . 'You started slamming her against the wall and putting your hands around her neck. Isn't that true Mr. Rallo?' the defense asked. Rallo downplayed the fight, saying they 'wrestled in the garage' as they were having a discussion about her moving out. However, Rallo did admit to being torn up at the break up with his wife of seven years, and said he never reconciled himself with their separation. 'Mr. Rallo, you loved your wife?' a defense attorney asked Rallo. 'Very much,' he said. 'Even after you found out she’d been cheating on you behind your back for several months?' the attorney asked. 'Yes,' Rallo said. 'You still wanted to be with her?' the attorney asked. 'Yes,' he said. He said he did not kill his wife for $250,000 insurance money, when asked by the prosecution. Graham-Trott has pleaded not guilty of Brennan's murder. She was married to Trott for 20 years.","Sheila Graham-Trott is accused of killing Kelly Brennan, a former friend who started dating her husband Dan Trott when the two separated in 2010 .

"Wavering Scottish voters were told last night that work towards a ‘Home Rule Bill’ would begin the day after next week’s referendum if they back a No vote. In a desperate bid to halt the momentum of the campaign for independence, Gordon Brown announced a rapid timetable to give the Scottish parliament greater control over finance, welfare and taxation. Such a bill, which could give Scots the power to raise income tax to pay for more spending, will be outlined within six weeks of the vote. Gordon Brown announced a rapid timetable to give the Scottish parliament greater control over finance, welfare and taxation . At a miners’ welfare club in Loanhead, Midlothian, Mr Brown said: ‘The alternative to an irreversible separation is a more powerful Scottish parliament with a timetable for its delivery . With the backing of Labour supporters in Scotland vital, the former prime minister appeared to have elbowed aside his former chancellor Alistair Darling, head of the cross-party Better Together campaign, to seize effective command of the battle to save the Union. Incredibly, the move leaves the fate of David Cameron – likely to face calls to quit if he presides over the end of the 300-year-old Union – depending on the success or failure of Mr Brown, his opponent at the 2010 general election. Throughout the campaign, polls have shown that if given the choice more Scots would pick the option of a stronger Scottish parliament over independence or the current arrangement. But Mr Cameron favoured a straight Yes/No choice on independence, rather than putting a ‘devo-max’ option on the referendum ballot paper. Downing Street last night welcomed Mr Brown’s timetable and all three Westminster parties are expected to formally back the proposals this week. The Yes campaign said Mr Brown’s last-ditch intervention ‘smacked of utter panic and desperation’ But, despite his attempt to present the plans as something that has already been decided, there are deep splits in Labour over whether or not to enhance its existing offer to hand more powers to Scotland. At a miners’ welfare club in Loanhead, Midlothian, Mr Brown said: ‘The alternative to an irreversible separation is a more powerful Scottish parliament with a timetable for its delivery. ‘Scottish voters deserve to know to the fullest extent possible about how new powers as ambitious as possible will be delivered as soon as possible within the UK. So, we are demanding a tight timetable with tough deadlines and streamlined procedures. ‘A No vote on September 18 will not be an end point but the starting gun for action on September 19, when straight away we will kick off a plan to deliver the enhanced devolution that we want. On September 19 we will start bringing into law the new, stronger Scottish parliament, and to secure the change we want we will work with the other parties.’ Mr Brown said a document outlining the plans and issues that need to be resolved would be published by the end of October, with a White Paper drawn up by November 30, St Andrew’s Day. Mr Brown said a document outlining the plans and issues that need to be resolved would be published by the end of October, with a White Paper drawn up by November 30, St Andrew’s Day . Yesterday, Mr Brown hit the No campaign trail on the streets of his hometown in Kirkcaldy in Fife to talk to local residents . Draft legislation for a new Scotland Act would then be drawn up by Burns Night on January 25. Mr Brown said the proposed new powers including the ability to change income tax ‘would be the biggest transfer of fiscal power in the history of the UK’. He added: ‘My judgment is that these are the powers people want. A stronger Scottish parliament within the UK, without breaking the link on pensions, funding, health care, jobs, the currency and defence.’ The three Westminster parties have each put forward separate plans for devolving more powers, but a Downing Street source said they overlap to a substantial degree. The Scottish Conservatives want Holyrood to be given full income tax powers and responsibility on welfare issues related to devolved areas, such as housing benefits. In its proposals, Scottish Labour’s devolution commission said the Scottish parliament should be able to vary tax by up to 15p in the pound, giving it the option of restoring the 50p rate for top earners. The Liberal Democrats want Scotland to be able to raise and spend most of its own taxes and borrow on its own terms. The Yes campaign said Mr Brown’s last-ditch intervention ‘smacked of utter panic and desperation’. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who is a Labour Party stalwart, but has largely been absent from the Better Together campaign . He is a Labour Party stalwart and supporter of the campaign against independence, but Sir Alex Ferguson’s absence from the effort to keep Scotland in the UK over recent months has been noticeable. The former Manchester United manager came out in support of the Better Together campaign two years ago soon after its launch, but has not spoken out recently. Earlier this year, David Cameron suggested that Sir Alex should be used in advertisements to boost the anti-independence cause. The football manager’s roots in the shipbuilding community of Glasgow could help win over Scots from the most deprived areas, who polls suggest are open to voting ‘yes’. Sir Alex previously criticised Alex Salmond for trying to ‘silence’ Scots living outside Scotland over independence. ‘No one should question my Scottishness just because I live south of the border,’ he said.","Former PM has announced a rapid timetable to give Scotland more powers .

"A schoolboy left devastated by the death of his pet rat has had the animal stuffed and turned - into a flying rodent. Pepeijn Bruins, 13, was heartbroken when his pet Ratjetoe - Dutch for Rattatouille - was stricken with cancer and he had to have him put down. But inventors Arjen Beltman and Bart Jansen came to his aid and stuffed the rat and attach radio-controlled propellers to let it fly. Dutch schoolboy Pepeijn Bruins, pictured, was devastated when his pet rat Ratjetoe died of cancer . The 13-year-old schoolboy from Arnhem, Holland contacted inventors Arjen Beltman and Bart Jansen for help . Pepeijn said he was very upset when the vet put his rat to sleep and wanted to make him fly . The result is the world's first airborne rat, which follows the Dutchmen's previous work - a flying cat. Pepeijn said: 'I loved him very much. He always liked to be cuddled and he would run up my clothes and hide. 'When I learned he had cancer and the vet had to put him to sleep I was very upset. 'I had seen Bart and Arjen and their flying cat, and I asked my dad if it would be possible to have the rat fly.' The rat has three propellers and an on board computer, which receives directions from the remote control. The inventors have also made a flying ostrich and are working on a jet-propelled flying shark. Pricordia can be found on their YouTube channel here. Arjen Beltman, left, said he and his friend Bart Jansen, right, had to help Pepeijn, centre, fulfill his dream . Mr Beltman said: 'When I heard the boy's rat had died of cancer, and how upset he was, I just knew I had to help. 'Technically, it was very different to the cat, it has three rotors instead of four, and being a small rodent, it is extremely lightweight, so prone to being blown by the wind.' Mr Jansen added: 'Flight is man's greatest achievement, so why not give it to more animals? The world needs more flying animals.' Their weird work is showcased tomorrow in a documentary on bizarre the world of taxidermy. All Creatures Great and Stuffed, on Channel 4 at 10pm, follows the crazy lives of taxidermists around the world. Inventors Arjen Beltman and Bart Jansen previously made a flying cat before  working on the pet rat . Another protect involved fitting large propellers to a stuffed ostrich which was able to defy gravity . The inventors' latest project involves fitting a small jet engine to a stuffed shark and sending it airborne . Matt Rudge, who directed the film, said: 'Everything I caught on camera during this documentary was jaw dropping, from a man that freeze dries beloved dead pets for their grieving owners, to a shop selling creations made from roadkill. 'However, the inventions of Bart and Arjen were something else. I never thought I would see a cat fly, let alone it also flying after a rat with propellers. 'When they then told me their next plan was for a Jet powered Shark, i thought they were winding me up. But three months later it was ready to launch.'","Pepeijn Bruins was devastated when his pet rat Ratjetoe died of cancer .

"Two brand new iPhones and the Apple Watch have finally been unveiled but Australian customers can expect to fork out 25 percent more than the US for one of the new handsets when they hit the market next week. The larger iPhone handsets, which were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning, will first hit the market on September 19 and you can pre-order one from Friday. Prices for the iPhone 6 start from $869, compared with $649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from $999 in Australia and $749 abroad. The brand new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus range were unveiled in the US on Wednesday morning by Apple chief executive Tim Cook . Apple will sell the iPhone 6 in gold, silver and grey and prices will start at $869 for the 16GB model and $999 for the 64GB. For the first time, Apple will sell a 128GB model for $1,129. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen and curved edges, with 38 percent more pixels on the screen than the iPhone 5s. But that's not the biggest model Apple is planning on selling in the new range. The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 percent more pixels than the 5S. Like the iPhone 6, the Plus model is also sold in gold, silver and grey but it's naturally more expensive.

It will start from $999 for the 16GB model, $1,129 for the 64GB model and $1,249 for a 128GB handset. The latest iPhone, the 5s, currently retails for $749 for the 16GB model. But the anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company's first foray into the world of wearable items, won't be around until early 2015. Apple fans Salvatore Gerace (left) and Christian ibrahim get in line early for the new iPhone 6 at the Apple Store in Sydney, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2014. While an Australian price for the watch hasn't yet been announced, it will retail in the US from $349. The watch, which received a standing ovation when it was unveiled, has a rectangular bezel, rectangular sapphire crystal screen, curved edges and is made of metal. It will come in three finishes - Apple Watch, which comes in silver, the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch Edition, which will be available in 18-karat gold. Prices for the iPhone 6 start from $869, compared with $649 in the US. The iPhone 6 Plus will retail from $999 in Australia and $749 abroad . Apple haven't specified what the battery life was like on the Apple Watch, but did say it would need to be charged each night. The watch works 'seamlessly' with the iPhone 5C, 5S as well as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and it lets users dictate messages via a microphone on the device. Australian retailers are said to be gearing up to battle it out over the new iPhone range. Optus fired the first canon on Sunday when it revealed people who abandon their existing contracts with rival companies would be given credit to offset cancellation charges if they move to a 24-month Optus plan. The anticipated Apple Watch, which is the company's first foray into the world of wearable items, won't be around until early 2015 . While an Australian price for the watch hasn't yet been announced, it will retail in the US from $349 . The move is timed to take advantage of the pre-Christmas influx of new smartphone models, such as the newly unveiled iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Telsyte senior analyst Foad Fadaghi said Optus' rivals would likely launch aggressive counter strategies in the coming months. 'This is a win for consumers if we see increased competition around the launch of the new (Apple) handset (and) some of the barriers come down for switching,' Mr Fadaghi said.

"Improvements needed: Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said more must be done . Only in one in four graduates is good at maths and English, a study revealed yesterday. The dismal results come despite a surge in education spending and record numbers of university students. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that just 25 per cent of Britons with a degree scored highly in a literacy test. Yet their peers in Japan and Finland scored 37 per cent, the Dutch 36 per cent and Australians 32 per cent. Norway with 28 per cent and Belgium with 26 per cent also fared better. The UK’s position in numeracy was similar or slightly worse. The OECD said the rise in the number of graduates was not matched by a rise in skill levels. Andreas Schleicher, the policy group’s director for education and skills, said: ‘Not all further education qualifications really deserve that name because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than those people who have just come out of school. 'UK universities have a very strong reputation – you would have expected this stronger prevalence among the most highly skilled.’ Mr Schleicher suggested schools may partly be to blame: ‘One of the things which may of course be true is that literacy and numeracy reflect things that you learn well before university. ‘In Japan they build the foundations for literacy and numeracy at high school, and universities can build on this. ‘It’s not true for the UK. This may be a reflection of this – universities assume those skills are there, but they might not be.’ It also emerged that the growth in higher education has mainly benefited the middle classes. Poor scores: Only a quarter of British graduates did well in a literacy test, research found (file photo) A child’s chances of going to university are still strongly influenced by their family background, partly because many disadvantaged children are ‘doomed’ by poor schooling. ‘Many countries are doing better than the UK,’ said Mr Schleicher. ‘The UK has seen huge increases in access but that hasn’t translated into the degree of mobility we have seen in the Russian Federation, in Korea, in Finland, Flanders, France, Ireland and so on.’ Class sizes in British primary schools are among the biggest in the developed world, according to research. The average teaching group now has 25 pupils – the sixth largest out of 33 countries studied by the OECD. UK primary classes are bigger than the international average of 21 and significantly larger than countries such as Luxembourg, with 16 per group. The figures also show that the UK average class creeps up to 26 when private schools are taken out of consideration. In UK independent schools, the average class size is just 15. At secondary level, class sizes are also comparatively large among 14 to 18-year-olds. And in nursery education, there are around 19 children per teacher, higher than the OECD average of 14 pupils per teacher. The figures show there are 17 pupils per teacher in upper secondary classes – the fourth highest out of 29 countries included in the analysis. Only Mexico, Chile and the Netherlands have more pupils per teacher. The OECD report said there was some evidence smaller classes benefited specific groups of pupils, such as those from poorer backgrounds, but only a ‘weak’ link to pupil performance overall. The findings came in the OECD’s annual analysis of international league tables titled ‘Education at a Glance’. For the first time, the number of graduates outstrips the numbers who stopped studying after gaining their GCSEs or A-levels. Forty-one per cent of 25- to 64-year-olds have a degree while 37 per cent have no qualification higher than an A-level or equivalent. The tables also show that while the UK ranks eighth among 36 countries for the number of graduates it produces, the level of basic skills among those with a higher qualification is merely average. To gauge graduate skill levels, the OECD drew on research published last year which involved setting a sample of adults in nations across the developed world a test in literacy and numeracy. In the UK, only England and Northern Ireland took part in the tests. Employers have repeatedly complained that both graduates and school-leavers lack the skills in the three Rs needed to succeed in the workplace. Elsewhere, the OECD report noted that the UK had increased education spending as a percentage of GDP faster than all other OECD countries. But this has so far failed to translate into top scores for our education system. ‘The time that the massive increase in investment actually translates into better outcomes is still to come,’ said Mr Schleicher. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘I’m committed to going further faster towards creating an education system that enables all young people, regardless of background are able to reach their full potential.’","Just a quarter of Britons with a degree scored highly in a literacy test .

"The daughter of a Melbourne woman who has been missing for six days says she is trying to stay positive despite fearing that she may never see her mother again. Concern continues to grow for the welfare of the Angelika Peters, who has not been seen since kissing her husband goodbye in their Ascot Vale home before he went to work on Thursday morning. The 45-year-old left behind her wallet, phone and most importantly, her Epipen for her latex allergy which has developed so severely since the start of the year that she is under doctor's orders not to go out on her own for more than two hours at a time. The family is completely baffled by Ms Peters' whereabouts and her eldest daughter Arna Dionysopoulos is struggling to make sense of her mother's mysterious disappearance. 'I have absolutely no idea if she will return – I feel like I should say she will but I’m just not sure because it's been six days,' the 25-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.  'It’s absolutely terrifying not knowing if she’s alive or not – it’s hard to actually go there in my brain.' Melbourne mother-of-two, Angelika Peters, who has been forced to remain housebound for the past eight months after developing a severe latex allergy, has been missing for the past six days . Arna (left) and Jessica (right) Dionysopoulos with their mother Angelika Peters (centre) Arna as a little girl camping with her mother who has been missing for six days . Angelika Peters has a severe latex allergy and has been instructed not to leave the house for more than two hours on her own . After working as a nurse for the past 25 years, Ms Peters was forced to give up her career when her latex allergy created too many risks for both herself and the patients. Ms Peters had managed the allergy for at least 30 years until she became a relief nurse at the start of the year and began suffering anaphylactic reactions from too much exposure. A usually positive and upbeat woman, being housebound for the past eight months had started to take its toll on the former nurse. 'It really did affect her because she loved being a nurse,' Ms Dionysopoulos said. 'Initially she was being proactive but it was just hard because she is very smart and didn’t have any stimulation which was a lot of the trouble so she tried to keep busy.' 'She might have had a bit of cabin fever because to stay alive she had to start taking really stringent care of her surroundings which was when things got harder because she had to stay away from large numbers of people.’ However, Ms Dionysopoulos said her mother was holding out for further tests next month in the hope to find a way to be able to return to work. 'She's such a strong person where if something is wrong she would act on it - she's not the type to run away from her problems - she always addressed them - that's what makes this very confusing and out of character,' she said. 'She has always been good at turning things into a positive - she always made the most out of situations - it was never as dire as it seemed with her.' Ms Peters' husband Adam Gray (left) Arna (centre) and Angelika (right) Daughter Arna Dionysopoulos said her mother was always a very positive person . Husband Adam Gray expressed great concern for his wife as she rarely left the house - let alone on her own . The family has been frantically searching for Ms Peters including handing out fliers and visiting some of her favourite places. Her husband Adam Gray expressed great concern for his wife as she rarely left the house - let alone on her own. 'When I say she was at home – she was at home - she wouldn't leave the house without company,' he said. 'She would always have her Epipen with her - unfortunately due to her personal habits she was at home all of the time.' Mr Gray said the condition had significantly impacted on his wife's everyday life - recently she had to leave a restaurant because a balloon had set off her allergy. Ms Peters would usually keep in regular phone contact with her husband and youngest daughter, Jessica Dionysopoulos, 21, during the day, Arna said. Arna appealed to her mum that if she was feeling down to make contact and the family would help. 'I just want her to know that no matter what she is going through, and if she needs time, that we’ll understand – I just want to know that she’s OK.' Ms Peters was last seen wearing a blue top and dark pants and is believed to have left her Fisher Parade house on foot between 10am and midday on Thursday. She is described as Caucasian in appearance, with brown hair and a medium build. Her family are very concerned as she had displayed signs of depression due to the allergy .","Angelika Peters, 45, kissed her husband before he left for work at their Melbourne home at 8am on Thursday and hasn't been seen since .

"The name’s Bennett – Nick Bennett. And when it comes to collecting James Bond memorabilia, it seems, The World is Not Enough. The British film buff has just been recognised by Guinness World Records for having the largest known 007 collection on the planet – and he has no intention of stopping. At the last count he boasted a remarkable 12,463 Bond-related items, ranging from the tacky (a plastic volcano play-set based on a scene from You Only Live Twice); to the mildly voyeuristic (a poster of Halle Berry in her Die Another Day bikini). Scroll down for video . Licence to fill... a house! Nick Bennett with his world record collection of 12,463 pieces of Bond movie memorabilia. The 47-year-old is just one of the latest clutch of eccentrics to enter Guinness' book of records . Big shoes to fill:  Marawa Ibrahim set the record for a 100-metre spring in high-heeled skates (26.1 seconds) Huge: Turkish farmer Sultan Kösen is the tallest man alive at 8ft 3in (left) while JJ Bittner has a 3.4in mouth . There was even the somewhat bizarre wall-mountable front third of an Aston Martin DB5 bearing the spy’s 1963 registration plate. All of which begs one major question: why? ‘I started collecting James Bond memorabilia in the run-up to GoldenEye in 1995,’ Mr Bennett explains on his website. ‘I had bought a few bits over the years but the new Bond [Pierce Brosnan] really kicked off an interest. I don’t specialise in any area – I just buy items I like.’ Mr Bennett, 47, stores them in a shrine-like area of his home in Leigh, near Wigan. Of his inclusion in the Guinness World Record rankings he said: ‘It’s a dream come true. Cosy: Londoner Yannick Read, 43, built the world's smallest caravan measuring 5ft high and just 2ft 8in wide . Supermarket sweep: Matt McKeown notched up 70.4mph on a motorised shopping trolley in East Yorkshire . Unsettling: 24-year-old Nick Stoeberl from California has the longest tongue at 3.97in from its tip to the middle of the closed top lip. The 60th anniversary edition of the book, the home of eccentrics, is out tomorrow . 'As a child I read the book from cover to cover and I cannot believe that I will actually be in this year’s book as an official record holder – pinch me.’ The landmark 60th edition has been produced after processing more than 50,000 claims over the past 12 months. The largest collection of Doctor Who memorabilia belongs to Ian O’Brien, 42, from Manchester, with 1,573 items. Among others confirmed for the coveted record-holder accolade (albeit in categories for which there might not have been much competition) are a Californian who uses only her feet to shoot arrows 20ft into a 5in target while balancing on her hands. The fastest man on a motorised shopping trolley is Matt McKeown in Yorkshire, at 70.4mph. Big swing: 'Trick Golf' artist    Karsten Maas, from Denmark, enters the book this year for creating the world's longest usable golf club at 14ft 5in. He had to prove its worth - it was used to drive a ball a distance of 542ft . Odd category: Akiko Obata entered the  book for having the largest collection of prepared food related items . Feat: Simon Chalk held the record for rowing the most oceans (left). Right: In a past record, He Pingping from China was the shortest living man at 2ft 5.37in, while Russian Svetlana Pankratova had the world's longest legs . Favourites: Guinness World Records have relived several records from past years to mark the book's 60th anniversary. In this 2013 image, Antanas Kontrimas celebrated celebrating the heaviest weight with a beard . There is the smallest caravan (Londoner Yannick Read, 7ft 10in long), a brunette who completed the fastest 100m in high-heel roller skates (Australian Marawa Ibrahim, 26.1 seconds) and a Yank with the biggest gob. JJ Bittner officially has the ‘widest gape’ at 3.4in – ‘measured from the incisal edge of his maxillary central incisors to the incisal edge of his mandibular central incisors’, if you really must know. Or, as Mr Bennett might view it – The Man with the Golden Gum.","Nick Bennett has 12,463 007-related items in shrine-like home near Wigan .

"Sky watchers around the world enjoyed a treat last night in the form of an astonishing larger-than-average full moon. The third and final ‘supermoon’ of the summer lit up the sky, with stunning photographs showing the beauty of the rare occurrence. It happens when a full or new moon coincides with the Moon's closest approach to Earth, known as its perigee - the spot closest on its oval orbit. The event has occurred two other times this summer, on July 12 and August 10. Approximately every 14th full moon is a supermoon. Because last night’s moon was also the full moon that falls closest to the autumnal equinox, it was also a Harvest Moon. The exact supermoon moment happened at 2.38am UK time early this morning. It was the fourth supermoon of this year, with the first on January 1. But it will be a long time before another similar sight is seen, with the next supermoon not happening until September 28, 2015.

"Oreo is to release a limited-edition pumpkin spice take on the classic cookie, MailOnline can exclusively reveal. The new variety, which will hit U.S. shelves nationwide later this month, features a bright orange pumpkin cream filling sandwiched between two buttery vanilla wafers. ‘We knew there was a strong demand for all things pumpkin-flavored as fall approaches, so we wanted to create our own twist on this classic seasonal favorite,’ Danielle Brown, Brand Manager at Mondelēz International said. Buttery crunch: One reviewer compared the   Oreo cookie wafers to her favorite Girl Scout cookies . ‘Our new limited-edition flavor, Pumpkin Spice Oreo, embodies the perfect mix of the classic Golden Oreo cookie taste with a new pumpkin spice flavor crème. We believe we’ve achieved the ideal mix for the pumpkin spice fanatic!’ But the development of the limited-edition cookie was no overnight stab in the dark. ‘It generally takes about 12-18 months for a flavor to go from internal concept to public product available on store shelves,’ Brown added. ‘With the fast approach of fall, we knew fans were hungry for what’s next and we’re excited to help them celebrate the change of season.’ Trick or treat! Oreo's new pumpkin spice flavor will hit shelves across the U.S. in late September, just in time for Halloween . Grab them while you can: The limited-edition cookies will only be available while supplies last . The FEMAIL team was lucky enough to receive an early sample of the cookies and shared them out among the staff. The feedback was largely positive – even from those who aren't typically fans of pumpkin flavors. ‘Biting into this cookie was like eating a forkful of freshly baked pumpkin pie,’ said one taster. ‘It’s like a pumpkin pie exploded in my mouth!’ said another. The Pumpkin Spice Oreo even won favor over Starbucks’ popular seasonal latte. ‘I want to marry them. I’d much rather eat a handful of these than get a pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks,’ a FEMAIL reporter concluded. The reviews weren't all as glowing as the pumpkin crème filling though. ‘The color of the pumpkin spice filling is terrifying,’ offered another taster. ‘I guess if they’re going for a Halloween vibe it fits. I’m not the biggest fan of pumpkin anything, so the flavor was not my favorite.’ Pumpkin Spice OREO cookies will arrive on store shelves starting September 24, one day after the official start of fall.","Oreo pumpkin spice follows previous limited-edition flavors such as caramel apple .

"The  nephew of a of a cyclist murdered by a deranged homeless man while on 250-mile marathon ride to propose to his girlfriend has vowed to finish the journey his uncle started. Sebby Adorno, 10, plans to cycle the 140 miles of the East Coast bike ride that his uncle was never able to complete after he was fatally stabbed outside a McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida. Marathon cyclist Kevin Adorno, from Farmington in Connecticut, was on the last stretch of his trip from from Maryland to Miami when he was attacked without warning by 59-year-old Rene Herrera Cruz. Little Sebby Adorno, 10, plans to cycle the 140 miles of the East Coast bike ride that his uncle was never able to complete after he was fatally stabbed outside a McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida . Police officers found an engagement ring in Mr Adorno's pocket when they rushed to the fast-food restaurant. His girlfriend, Elyse Fuggetta, had planned to fly down and meet him 20 miles from his destination so that she could finish the journey with him. When they reached Miami, he had planned to propose to her. Now his nephew working to raise funds to ride those last miles for 'Uncle Kevin', NBC Washington has reported. Sebby is collecting donations on a GoFundMe page, with a goal of raising $50,000 to be used to rent bicycles and cover the costs associated with organizing the ride. After just two days his total stands at $1,565. As part of his fundraising efforts Sebby is selling T-shirts designed by his uncle which read 'Roll hArd or Go home'. Mr Adorno's family have said this was the philosophy the keen cyclist lived by - to always be passionate about what you're doing, to put positive rage in your heart. He is also inviting others to join him on the ride to honor his uncle and will use part of the money to fund anyone who cannot afford the trip on their own.

Last year, he and his sister had cycled from Maine to Maryland, and this year, he planned to finish the rest of the journey. The 28-year-old artist, who ran his own graphic design business in Unionville, Connecticut, had shared dozens of photographs along his route, including images of his bike propped up on sandy beaches and in city centers. Authorities said he had been on the phone to his girlfriend when he was attacked without warning by Rene Herrera Cruz, who told police that he thought Mr Adorno was plotting to kill him. According to police, he was repeatedly stabbed in the arm and chest and, as he began losing a lot of blood, he collapsed near a bathroom. Cruz, who was known to local police, has been charged with first-degree murder. Mr Adorno's sister Tanya, 29, told MailOnline how her romantic brother was secretly planning to propose to Elyse once he reached Miami. 'The engagement ring he had picked out was in his pocket,' she said. 'The only person who knew about it was our mother.

They met three years ago at our cousin's wedding and immediately afterwards he wooed her with a big bouquet of flowers. 'Their relationship was instantaneous. They both knew they'd met THE one. She completed him. 'Elyse is just distraught. She is too upset to even speak. They loved each other so much. 'Kevin was the baby of our family. The youngest of four and we called him Kevino Bambino.

On Valentine's Day as a teenager I would find a single flower on my windshield. It was always from Kevin. He wanted me to know I was loved. 'He embraced life and had a bucket list of things he wanted to do. 'Last year we were invited to a wedding in Maryland. He decided to cycle there and invited me to join him. 'We set off from my home in Maine and cycled slowly down the coast, stopping every two to three hours. It was an amazing experience. I've driven that route by car many times yet you see it differently from a cycle. 'The world looks very different from the bike saddle and Kevin wanted to carry on and do the entire East Coast trip. 'He set off in mid August and called us all every night from the road. 'Kevin was full of great stories about the people he met. He just loved to talk to people. 'We're getting texts and messages from all sorts of people he met on his road trip.' Tanya and Kevin, along with older brothers John, 33, and Robert, 31, grew up in the pretty New England town of Farmington embracing their dad Angelo's Italian heritage and mother Helena's Polish roots. 'He was crazy about soccer and taught his nephews a few tricks,' Tanya said. 'They know how to kick a ball about because of Kevin. 'His big love, aside from Elyse and us, was his boxer dog Juve – that's short for Juventus, the Italian soccer club he supported.' Their 60-year-old father was on vacation in Sicily when Kevin died.

'He wasn't competitive, he just enjoyed doing things. It wasn't about winning or doing things best, he just wanted everyone to enjoy themselves. 'Kevin definitely had a bucket list of things to do. He loved a challenge and cycling the East Coast was one of those challenges. 'The tragedy is that Kevin would have wanted to help the homeless man who attacked him. 'As far as I know, they didn't have a conversation. This man was mentally ill and thought Kevin was taking photos of him or something. He just attacked him. 'The police knew about him.

Federal prosecutors agreed not to seek more than 30 years in . prison for Padilla as long as his lawyers did not introduce . records related to alleged harsh conditions he endured during . the 3-1/2 years spent in a South Carolina military prison. A U.S. federal judge in Miami re-sentenced Jose Padilla on Tuesday to 21 years for a 2007 terrorism conviction after an appeals court deemed the original 17-year sentence too lenient . 'There are certain things we know and don't know about how . Mr. Padilla was held,' U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke said on . Tuesday before handing down the stiffer sentence. Padilla sat shackled in a khaki jumpsuit and did not speak . during the two-hour hearing. Under his new sentence, Cooke also . ordered Padilla remain held in a super-maximum security prison. Padilla's mother Estela Lebron, who in 2012 mounted a failed . effort to sue former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and . high-ranking military officials for violating the U.S. constitution, rebuked the government. 'Washington, D.C., George Bush, Barack Obama, all of the . judges ... they know that my son was tortured,' she said, . referring to the U.S. president and his predecessor. Cooke had delayed Padilla's re-sentencing many times as . lawyers wrangled over his long criminal history and classified . documents. 'His actual involvement in jihad, his actual training, sets . him apart,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Del Toro. Under his new sentence, Cooke also ordered Padilla remain held in a super-maximum security prison . But Padilla's lawyer Michael Caruso, a federal public . defender, said recruiters for extremist groups lied to Padilla, . presenting jihad as defending Muslims under attack. Padilla, a former Chicago gang member who attended a south . Florida mosque, converted to Islam in the mid-1990s after a . troubled childhood, his brother Tomas Texidor said in court. 'He's not the man you think he is,' Texidor said, fighting . back tears. Padilla was arrested in 2002 as he returned to Chicago from . abroad. Prosecutors said he had spent time at a military . training camp in Afghanistan. He was accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive 'dirty . bomb' in a U.S. city, but was never charged with that. Then-President George W. Bush ordered him held as an enemy . combatant and interrogated in a South Carolina military prison. Padilla, a former Chicago gang member who attended a south Florida mosque, converted to Islam in the mid-1990s after a troubled childhood, his brother Tomas Texidor said in court . Prosecutors later argued Padilla deserved a life sentence . for his 2007 conviction, but Cooke rejected that sentence . because Padilla did not commit acts of terrorism on U.S. soil, . or attacks on officials or a plot to overthrow the U.S. government. An appeals court ruled in 2011 that the 17-year sentence he . ultimately received was not severe enough. In a 2012 appeal which was rejected by the U.S. Supreme . Court, Padilla said he was held in isolation for more than three . years at the military prison, shackled for hours in painful 'stress' positions and subjected to lengthy bouts of blinding . light followed by total darkness.","Padilla was an al Qaeda recruit and first U.S. citizen labeled an enemy combatant .

'If Van Gaal is determined to persist with a back three, this is going to be a long and painful transition for United,' the former Liverpool, Rangers, Blackburn and Southampton boss wrote in his Sunday Times column. 'The team may take until November to settle down. You ain't going to win the league if you take that long and you might not make the Champions League places either. 'United have already dropped seven points from a possible nine. If you continue with three at the back and the results are not improving players will not be slow in turning round and pointing their fingers at the coach, saying, 'It's not that I am not playing well, it's the system'.' Souness went on to say that he does not think the system, which Van Gaal employed so successfully for Holland during the World Cup in Brazil, will bring out the best in British record signing Angel di Maria, a £59.7million recruit from Real Madrid last month. New boy: Angel di Maria could struggle to fit into a 3-5-2 system, according to ex-Liverpool boss Souness . Kicking out: Juan Mata reacts angrily during United's disappointing 1-1 draw with Sunderland last month . The Scot added: 'Angel di Maria is too much of a winger to play as a wing-back, so he could play one position inside the widest man in a 3-5-2. 'If you play with a back four you can play him wide, as Argentina did when he made three goals and scored the other in their 4-2 win over Germany in midweek. I don't read much into international friendlies but that performance showed his talent.' United have the chance to record their first Premier League victory of the season next Sunday when they face QPR at Old Trafford.","Former Liverpool boss Graeme Souness believes it will take time for Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation to work .

"Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen has admitted he wasn't at the races last night for Denmark last night as they edged past Armenia in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying group game. The 22-year-old, who impressed in his maiden season for Spurs, was uncharacteristically lacklustre throughout as he failed to stamp his authority on the game, although he was just relieved the Danes got the three points.

After being thumped at home by the same opponents during qualification for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, it was a particularly rewarding win for Eriksen and co as they got their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign off to the best possible start.

"Most pregnant women up their iron-intake in the run-up to giving birth, but few would think of pumping it in the gym. But Meghan Umphres Leatherman from Arizona, U.S., is not most women; In fact she continued her grueling CrossFit regime throughout her entire pregnancy. The 33-year-old was also lifting weights up until two days before her due date when she was 1cm dilated. Scroll down for video . Fighting fit: Meghan Umphres Leatherman, pictured here at nine months pregnant and dilated to 1cm . Mother-to-be Meghan, pictured here before giving birth, continued her CrossFit fitness regime - which combines weightlifting, gymnastics and cardio activities - throughout her pregnancy . She was so dedicated to her grueling CrossFit regime - which combines weightlifting, gymnastics and cardio activities - that she even lifted weights on the day she went into labour and broke records in the final days of pregnancy. As well as going to the gym four times a week, Meghan continued to walk her dog for three miles a day and go on a four-mile hike through the mountains every week. But far from doing herself or her first baby damage, Meghan, a marketing and communications consultant, insists they're both healthier for it and her pregnancy was actually easier. Now she is settling in to life as a mum after giving birth to 6 lb, 11 oz daughter, Florence Germaine. on 3rd May. But she expects to be back at the gym again in just three weeks. Power couple: Meghan, left, with husband Chad, right, who is also a CrossFit trainer, days before she gave birth to their daughter .

She now trains religiously at Back Alley CrossFit in Phoenix with husband Chad, 34, who owns a payroll services company. 'As soon as I started CrossFit I was addicted to the results,' said Meghan.

I like to try and work with others in a community and getting the motivation to be stronger and fitter and better. 'I didn't lose that motivation just because I was pregnant.' Muscly Meghan, who has ran a marathon and eight half marathons in the last four years, says that lifting weights has staved off morning sickness. 'I was never sick at all,' she said. 'There were times I just need to go in and lift when hormones are running a little stronger than I'm used to. 'To go in and be extra physical kept me focused and thankful and gave me a feeling of empowerment. 'I never considered giving up. My family gave me a hard time early on, but I reassured them that my doctor's said it was OK. Baby bump! Two days before giving birth, CrossFit coach and enthusiast Meghan Umphres Leatherman was breaking records .

She was also doing 110lb push presses and 165lb squats and saw her energy levels and strength soar as her due date grew nearer.

They were thrilled that I was setting personal records with weight lifting and they told me to keep active and hydrated.' Meghan and, Chad are both qualified CrossFit coaches, and although Chad supports his wife, he did initially find it difficult to watch. Meghan has also been supported by her coach, who she says she, 'shocked every week,' with her growing strength, and has been called an inspiration by other women at the gym. 'If I'd had heart problems or my blood pressure was up or anything that would indicate a problem for the baby I'd obviously have done something different,' said Meghan. 'But I think it only made me healthier and better prepared.' Florence, nicknamed 'Florie' was born after four hours of contractions. 'I had an easy birth thanks to CrossFit,' says Meghan.

"The migrants rescued from a shipping container in a British dockyard were ‘20 minutes from death’, it emerged yesterday. The 35 Afghan Sikhs had been locked inside the ‘metal coffin’ for 18 hours during their desperate attempt to reach the UK and were beginning to run out of air. During their terrifying journey on a cargo ferry, one man in his 40s – named last night as Meet Singh Kapoor – died as his wife and their two sons, aged just nine and 12, slept nearby. Scroll down for video . The surviving Afghans told rescuers they . were slowly suffocating before they were freed at the port of Tilbury, . in Essex, when staff heard screaming and banging coming from inside the . container. Kamaljit Singh . Matharu, who acted as a translator for police, said last night: ‘They . were 20 minutes from death. One woman told me they were drifting in and . out of consciousness because they had no air. ‘They . were banging on the container every hour in the hope that someone would . hear them during the ferry crossing. But no one heard them. It was . pitch black, without any air. It soon became extremely uncomfortable. It . was only by good fortune that they were found in time.’ People-traffickers . are understood to have taken the 35 migrants – all from Afghanistan’s . Sikh community – by road in a lorry from Kabul to Europe. Once inside the EU, they put them in a ‘custom-made’ shipping container before locking them inside. The . metal box was modified by the smugglers so that the Afghan families, . who included 13 children, had separate compartments to sleep in. Boxes . of cleaning chemicals were piled up round them so they would not be . found if port officials opened the container for a random search. This footage shows the dramatic moment that 35 immigrants - including 12 children and a baby - were released . from a shipping container, after being discovered . In the footage, the immigrants - now confirmed as Afghan . Sikhs - can be seen crawling helplessly around the floor, while . harrowing screams echo around the dock . Police and border officials are seen trying to help the immigrants, as . several collapse onto the floor, letting out desperate cries for help . Essex police have confirmed the group included nine men and eight women aged between 18 and 72, as well as 13 children, aged between one and 12 years old . Thirteen children, aged as young as one, were among the Afghan Sikhs rescued from a shipping container on Saturday . Some of the survivors, who are aged from one to 72, were so dehydrated that they had to be lifted out by police. Mr . Matharu, 46, whose family cut short his daughter’s 21st birthday party . to help, said: ‘When I went down to see them they were really distressed . and exhausted. They had been in a container for 18 hours. ‘They . were in a bad way when I saw them.’ He said all the migrants told him . they risked their lives because they ‘would rather die than live in . Kabul any longer’. Dock . workers made the shocking discovery at 6.37am on Saturday morning after . they heard 'screaming and banging' coming from inside one of the ship's . containers . A Belgian police spokesman said it would be 'impossible' for the illegal immigrants to have boarded the vessel (pictured at Tilbury Docks yesterday) at Zeebrugge . ‘In Kabul . they were persecuted,’ he said. ‘Their hair would be pulled and their . clothes tugged if they left the house because they were Sikhs.’ The . translator was asked by police to gently question the dead man’s sons. ‘I was asked to find out if their father had paid anyone to get to . Britain, but they didn’t know,’ he said. ‘I think the police found some . euros in their father’s pocket.’ The dead man is understood to have a brother who lives in Feltham, West London. The . Afghans, who were rescued from the container on Saturday morning, have . been questioned by police about the smugglers who put them in the . container. British detectives have launched a murder inquiry and are working with Interpol in a bid to track down the traffickers.

"Needing help: Dallas mom, Saiqa Akhter, killed her two children because they were autistic. She confessed to the killings in a  911 recording . A woman from North Texas who was accused of strangling her two special-needs children because she wanted 'normal kids' has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. Saiqa Akhter must remain at a state mental hospital for treatment unless a judge approves her discharge. Medical experts testified Monday that Akhter was diagnosed as schizophrenic and insane when her children were attacked and died in July 2010. She believed she was saving them, psychologist Kristi Compton testified. Relatives say the Irving woman's 5-year-old son, Zain, had severe speech problems. Her 2-year-old daughter, Faryaal, was developmentally delayed. Akhter told a 911 operator that she strangled the children because they were a burden, saying, 'I want normal kids.' Akhter, 34, is 'a woman battling a mental illness that she grew up not understanding,' Compton said. Saying 'there is no good solution' in such a case, state District Judge Mike Snipes declared Akhter not guilty by reason of insanity. She will be treated at North Texas State Hospital in Vernon and won't be eligible for release without a judge's approval. Defense attorneys Robbie McClung and Richard Franklin said their client should be in a mental hospital instead of serving prison time. 'What happened to those children is tragic. We can't change it. We can't take it back,' McClung said. 'This is a situation where this person needs to be in a hospital.' Attorneys for Akhter, who was originally charged with capital murder, said she belonged in a mental hospital and not prison. History: Medical experts testified in court Monday that Akhter has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. They said she started suffering from delusions as a young adult . Akhter was insane at the time she killed her two children, and she believed that she was saving them, . It will probably take several years of treatment and medication before Akhter is no longer dangerous, according to witness testimony. McClung said her client and her familiy will be safer if she remains hospitalized. Akhter had planned to kill her children for weeks before she strangled them. She did Internet searches on how to kill children and what amount of bathroom cleaner would be fatal. After their mother's call to 911, Zain and his little sister Faryaal were found unconscious in their family's apartment on Esters Road, an audio cord still wrapped around the boy's neck, according to police records. Akhter said that before strangling them she tried to poison them with bathroom cleaner. 'They don't drink it, so there's a wire there so I just grabbed their neck and then I tried and then they're no more,' Akhter told the 911 operator. Zain died that day, and Faryaal was removed from life support the following night. Asked how she felt about killing her children, Akhter replied: 'Nothing.'","Saiqa Akhter, 30, of Irving, Texas, was charged with capital murder .

"When 13-year-old Greg Hofmann opened his presents on Christmas Day, he was stunned to find his parents had finally taken his many hints and bought him an iPhone. Yet he was also surprised to see that it came with an 18-point set of terms and conditions - not from the phone company, but from his mother. 'Merry Christmas!' The agreement began. 'You are now the proud owner of an iPhone. Hot Damn! You are a good & responsible 13 year old boy and you deserve this gift. But with the acceptance of this present comes rules and regulations.' Precautions: Janelle Hofmann, right, attached an 18-point list of rules to an iPhone she gave her 13-year-old son Greg, left, for Christmas. They included where and when he could use the device . What followed were 18 rules the teenager, who lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts with his parents and four younger siblings, had to promise to keep if he didn't want to lose the device. They instructed him never to use the phone to view porn, to leave it at home when he went to school, - and never to ignore a call when the screen read 'Mom' or 'Dad'. Others were more lighthearted - telling him to use the phone to play brain teaser games, to download music none of his friends were listening to and to 'wonder without Googling'. The teenager laughed as he recounted his shock at the rules attached to his gift. Surprise: Greg, the oldest of Janelle's five children, said he was shocked when he saw the list . Staying in control: The rules also included 'no porn' and no texting pictures of his 'private parts' 'Oh my God. My first reaction was, ""Why? Why did she really have to do this?""' Hoffman told Good Morning America. Must-have: Experts agreed parents should create a list of rules for their children and their iPhones . His mother, writer Janell Hofmann, added: 'What I wanted to do and show him [is] . how you could be a responsible user of technology without abusing it, . without becoming addicted.' She added that she wanted her son to avoid the pitfalls that many smart phone users fall prey to. 'I hope that you understand it is my job to raise you into a well rounded, healthy young man that can function in the world and coexist with technology, not be ruled by it,' she wrote at the start of the list. Rule number seven instructed: 'Do not use this technology to lie, . fool, or deceive another human being. Be a good . friend first or stay the hell out of the crossfire.' Other rules said that he was not allowed to send or receive 'pictures of your private parts or anyone else's private parts' - a rule he may laugh at now, but which he may be tempted to break in the future, she said, adding: 'It is risky and could ruin your . teenage/college/adult life.' The list also emphasised Greg should not rely on his phone as his only way as communication. 'It does not go to school with you,' rule 5 read. 'Have a conversation with the . people you text in person. It's a life skill.' 'Turn it off, silence it, put it away in public,' Rule 11 added. Especially in a . restaurant, at the movies, or while speaking with another human being. You are not a rude person; do not allow the iPhone to change that.' Brood: Janelle and her husband's five children, (L-R) Greg, 13, Brendan 10, Ella 8, Lily 6, and Cassidy, 5 . Close: Janelle, a writer and child advocate, is pictured with her five children and husband Adam . And it also told him that, if he lost or broke the phone, he would be paying the costs of repairing or replacing it. 'Mow a . lawn, babysit, stash some birthday money', it said. Teenage behavior expert Josh Shipp added to GMA that the set of rules for the iPhone made sense. 'You wouldn't give your kid a car . without making sure they had insurance,' he said. 'And so giving them a . cell phone or a computer without teaching them how to use it responsibly . is irresponsible on the part of the parent.' Speaking to GMA, Janelle said the list was meant to be light-hearted while also pointing out that serious issues could emerge from misusing the phone. 'I love you madly & look forward to sharing several million text messages with you in the days to come,' the agreement concluded. 1. It is my phone. I bought it. I pay for it. I am loaning it to you. Aren't I the greatest? 2. I will always know the password. 3. If it rings, answer it. It is a . phone. Say hello, use your manners. Do not ever ignore a phone call if . the screen reads ""Mom"" or ""Dad"". Not ever. 4. Hand the phone to one of your parents promptly at 7:30pm every school . night & every weekend night at 9:00pm. It will be shut off for the . night and turned on again at 7:30am. If you would not make a call to . someone's land line, wherein their parents may answer first, then do not . call or text. Listen to those instincts and respect other families like . we would like to be respected. 5. It does not go to school with you. Have a conversation with the . people you text in person. It's a life skill. *Half days, field trips . and after school activities will require special consideration. 6. If it falls into the toilet, smashes on the ground, or vanishes into . thin air, you are responsible for the replacement costs or repairs. Mow a . lawn, babysit, stash some birthday money. It will happen, you should be . prepared. 7. Do not use this technology to lie, fool, or deceive another human . being. Do not involve yourself in conversations that are hurtful to . others. Be a good friend first or stay the hell out of the crossfire. 8. Do not text, email, or say anything through this device you would not say in person. 9. Do not text, email, or say anything to someone that you would not say . out loud with their parents in the room. Censor yourself. 10. No porn. Search the web for information you would openly share with . me. If you have a question about anything, ask a person - preferably me . or your father. 11. Turn it off, silence it, put it away in public. Especially in a . restaurant, at the movies, or while speaking with another human being. You are not a rude person; do not allow the iPhone to change that. 12. Do not send or receive pictures of your private parts or anyone . else's private parts. Don't laugh. Someday you will be tempted to do . this despite your high intelligence. It is risky and could ruin your . teenage/college/adult life. It is always a bad idea. Cyberspace is vast . and more powerful than you. And it is hard to make anything of this . magnitude disappear -- including a bad reputation. 13. Don't take a zillion pictures and videos. There is no need to . document everything. Live your experiences. They will be stored in your . memory for eternity. 14. Leave your phone home sometimes and feel safe and secure in that . decision. It is not alive or an extension of you. Learn to live without . it. Be bigger and more powerful than FOMO -- fear of missing out. 15. Download music that is new or classic or different than the millions . of your peers that listen to the same exact stuff. Your generation has . access to music like never before in history. Take advantage of that . gift. Expand your horizons. 16. Play a game with words or puzzles or brain teasers every now and then. 17. Keep your eyes up. See the world happening around you. Stare out a . window. Listen to the birds. Take a walk. Talk to a stranger. Wonder . without googling. 18. You will mess up. I will take away your phone. We will sit down and . talk about it.

"Pressure mounted on Nick Clegg to hold an independent inquiry into the Cyril Smith paedophilia scandal last night as Paddy Ashdown became the fourth Liberal Democrat leader to deny knowledge of the abuse. Opposition MPs accused the Deputy Prime Minister of putting up a smokescreen by claiming he knew nothing of Smith’s vile activities because they occurred before his party existed in its current form. Lord Ashdown, who led the Lib Dems from 1988 to 1999, yesterday insisted he did not know of the 29-stone late Liberal MP’s serial abuse of boys while he was at Westminster. Scroll down for video . Disgraced: Liberal MP Cyril Smith (centre) with former Liberal party leaders Jeremy Thorpe, left, and David Steel. The Lib Dems have been under attack for failing to recognise the Smith's serial sexual abuse of boys . Ashdown was elected to Parliament in 1983 and retired in 2001. Smith served as Liberal and later Lib Dem member for Rochdale from 1972 to 1992. This meant they would have been part of a small group of Liberal or Lib Dem MPs for nine years. Lord Ashdown told the Daily Mail: ‘You ask whether I was aware of allegations about Cyril Smith during the time you refer to. The answer is no.’ Mr Clegg, former party leader Charles Kennedy and Vince Cable, who was acting leader for three months in 2007, have already said they had no idea Smith was a predatory paedophile over four decades. But Simon Danczuk, the current Labour MP for Rochdale whose explosive book serialised in the Mail last week revealed the scale of Smith’s abuse, said the Lib Dems still had questions to answer. ‘Nick Clegg needs to initiate an investigation into why the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrat Party – call it what you want – had a paedophile at the heart of the party for at least 20 years,’ he said. ‘It is just not good enough to say that nobody knew about this. ‘How can he say nobody knew when the reality is that former Liberal MPs, candidates, councillors and even the former leader of the party on Rochdale Council say they were all aware?’ Mr Danczuk attacked Mr Clegg for attempting to shake off the scandal by saying the Liberal Democrat Party, which came into being in 1988, was separate from the old Liberal Party. He said: ‘They are one and the same thing. There is complete continuity. Using this argument gives the impression of a smokescreen, that Clegg is distancing himself from what went on before.’ Labour MP Simon Danczuk, left, attacked Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for attempting to shake off the scandal by saying the Liberal Democrat Party, born in 1988, was separate from the old Liberal Party . Tim Loughton, former Tory children’s minister, said the number of unanswered questions was growing daily and added his voice to calls for a ‘proper inquiry’. ‘The more that comes out about this story, the more it’s clear that a number of people knew something was wrong at the time,’ he said. ‘Suspicions about a cover-up grow. ‘The only way to assure the public that justice is being done to those victims is for everyone who knows anything to come forward before a formal inquiry, so that all possible lines can be followed to see who knew what when, and who needs to be held responsible for allowing Cyril Smith to get away with this for so long.’ Monstrous cover-up: From the Mail, April 11 . The man who knew nothing: April 14 . Lib Dem alibis fall apart: April 15 . The Times used its leader column this week to criticise Mr Clegg’s claim that nobody in his party was aware of the abuse as ‘not good enough’ and ‘demonstrably not true’. The paper said: ‘What the Liberal Democrats knew and when they knew it about Smith’s assaults is a matter of urgent public interest and a gathering scandal. Mr Clegg’s answers have so far been legalistic and unconvincing.’ The Deputy Prime Minister paid tribute to Smith at his 80th birthday in 2008, calling him a ‘beacon’ and an ‘inspiration’. Last week he said Lib Dem whips had contacted every current MP and peer and trawled through the party’s archives after Mr Danczuk exposed Smith’s abuse in Parliament in 2012. No one admitted hearing about the allegations – even though former Liberal leader David Steel was told in 1979 about complaints Smith had abused boys. Lord Steel, who nominated Smith for a knighthood in 1988, has not responded to the latest revelations about the scandal. He has previously said he received no complaints about Smith’s activities as a Liberal MP and that the obese politician denied any wrongdoing when he questioned him in 1979 about the allegations of ‘unusual behaviour with boys’. Zac Goldsmith, Tory MP for Richmond Park, said the Lib Dems should have pursued the allegations ‘far more vigorously’, adding that a ‘full-scale and properly resourced investigation is long overdue’. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined. His actions were not known to or condoned by the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats. ‘These are extremely serious allegations and include suggestions that there was a cover-up by the police and security services … Such serious allegations … must be a matter for the police.’ For ten days the Mail has led the way in reporting how the Lib Dems have gone into a state of denial about the appalling acts of sex abuse committed by MP Cyril Smith over four decades, exposed in our serialisation of Simon Danczuk’s book. Initially, other media were reluctant to pursue the story, but on Monday The Times ran a leader comment on the affair headlined ‘Silent Witness’. The following is an abridged version: . When Sir Cyril Smith died in 2010, Nick Clegg described him as ‘one of the most likeable politicians of his day’. That depended on where you sat. Vulnerable children whom Smith sexually abused over 40 years are unlikely to have shared Mr Clegg’s judgment. What the Liberal Democrats knew and when they knew it about Smith’s assaults is a matter of urgent public interest and a gathering scandal. Mr Clegg’s answers have so far been legalistic and unconvincing. Smith’s covert life as a paedophile has emerged into the public spotlight in the past week owing to a new book co-authored by Simon Danczuk. It expands upon allegations Mr Danczuk made in the House of Commons in 2012. Yet it is literally incredible that the party in which Smith was a huge figure should have been uniformly unaware of them. Mr Clegg said last week that his party had been unaware of this appalling history, and added: ‘Many of the actions, the repugnant actions, which we now learn about took place well before the party I now lead even existed — in fact, took place before I even existed.’ That is a casuistical distinction between the Liberal Democrats and the . old Liberal party. Nor is the claim of ignorance plausible. Smith had . been chief whip of the Liberals’ very small parliamentary presence in . the 1970s. Despite a mass of corroborating evidence … he was knighted in . 1988 and retired as an MP in 1992. He continued to abuse children as . late as the 1990s. Since Smith’s death, the Crown Prosecution Service . has admitted culpability in failing to prosecute him. Mr Clegg correctly . says the police will need to investigate what happened. He and his . colleagues also need to exercise historical accountability, however, and . explain how Smith got away with a catalogue of depravity. There is a . terrible parallel with the activities of Jimmy Savile, the entertainer . now known to have been a prolific child abuser. Savile and Smith . operated in, respectively, the BBC and the Liberal Democrats, which . celebrated their fame till their deaths and afterwards. Mr Clegg must . account for how this happened. It is not good enough, for it is . demonstrably not true, to maintain that nobody knew.","Opposition MPs accuse Clegg of putting up smokescreen over the scandal .

"UKIP’s most senior female representative has been photographed giving a rude hand gesture in response to a group of local activists who questioned her party’s policies in a Kent town centre this weekend. Janice Atkinson, second on UKIP’s Europe list after party leader Nigel Farage, gave a one-fingered answer to members of Ashford People’s Assembly who were staging a peaceful protest next to the party stand. The former ‘Cameron cutie’, who left the Conservatives in 2011, also made a ‘personal comment’ about a female activist’s body size, and told her she did not care where the incriminating photograph was posted, but for the group to ‘f*** off’. Scroll down for video . UKIP debate? Janice Atkinson, UKIP's press advisor and 'Farage's number two' who is standing as MEP candidate for South East, responded this way to a peaceful protest in Ashford on Saturday . Ashford People’s Assembly member Maria Pizzey posted the photograph of Mrs Atkinson’s ‘response’ on Facebook, which has been shared more than 55,000 times. ‘She told us to f*** off because we stood peacefully holding placards accusing UKIP of racist policies,’ Ms Pizzey said in her post. ‘She made personal comments about my body size and when I told her I would quote her widely she said ""I don't care where you f***ing post this, just f*** off!"" ‘This is the most rude and aggressive individual I have had the misfortune to come across and she wants to represent this country in Europe. ‘ . In her post Ms Pizzey, who is also an active member of the Green Party, added that Mrs Atkinson offered ‘no debate or arguments’ to defend UKIP, and that she instead swore and gave them the finger. Attacking: Janice Atkinson, UKIP's press advisor who also claims '90 per cent of cash machine crime is committed by Romanian gangs and drug and gun crime is mainly run by Eastern Europeans', also made a comment about the body size of one of the activists . In another post, Ms Pizzey . points out that the man Mrs Ashford was there to support, UKIP’s Ashford . chair Norman Taylor, appeared uncomfortable about the situation. Mrs . Atkinson also posted on social media about the incident. She tweeted a picture showing the . activists, and, as well as mislabelling . them as Green Party representatives, made a snide comment about their . appearance claiming they harassed passersby. She . tweeted the the caption: ‘The attractive face of the . Greens, apparently. Harassing public in Ashford today. Many complained, . one to police’. Activist . Thom Pizzey refuted these claims, replying to Mrs Atkinson: '@JaniceUKIP . Harassing? You mean exercising free speech and freedom to protest. The . only person who swore or was aggressive was yourself.' Mrs Atkinson is the UKIP MEP South East Candidate as well as the party’s press advisor, and has previously called for protesters who 'harass UKIP supporters’ to be arrested. Mrs Atkinson later released a statement to MailOnline, where she says that the protest was a result of the Ashford People's Assembly activists being 'so far left they daren't knock on doors'. 'This Green rabble are the Socialist . Workers anarchy wing of the Greens. Their views are so far left that . they daren't knock on doors asking for votes. 'They were intimidating my party . workers, women and elderly distinguished gentlemen, calling them racist . bigots, that is unacceptable. 'They . were intimidating members of the public who approached me, including . one young woman who said she was in her 30s and had never voted before, . but that she was voting for me. 'The . fat Green woman approached her, telling her that I was a racist bigot. She was very upset, she later told me she had complained to the police. ' 'Car-crash': Earlier this week, UKIP leader Nigel Farage was left reeling after an LBC radio interview in which he was challenged over racism, hypocrisy and secret EU expenses . Just last week, Janice Atkinson claimed police raids in Kent were a result of immigration and Eastern European criminal gangs. ‘Ninety per cent of ATM [cash machine] crime is committed by Romanian gangs and drug and gun crime is mainly run by Eastern Europeans,’ Mrs Atkinson wrote in a press release. 'Gang masters are operating illegal workers in the agriculture and food processing businesses.' Sunday afternoon, the UKIP chairwoman told KentOnline that she was 'not proud' of the hand gesture, and that the protesters had upset her. The Green Party’s MEP for South East England, the constituency Janice Atkinson is aiming to be elected to represent has today responded to the UKIP chairwoman’s comments about the party. ‘It’s becoming increasingly clear that UKIP fear the Greens. In this election campaign we’ve see the police called on one of our members who tweeted the truth about UKIP and our campaigners abused by their candidates,’ Keith Taylor, MEP said. ‘In the run up to these elections UKIP seem to be hell bent on proving to people why they shouldn't be trusted to represent people.’ Earlier this week, UKIP party leader Nigel Farage barely made it out alive from a car-crash interview on LBC radio in which he was challenged over racism, hypocrisy and secret EU expenses. Farage's media spin chief even tried to intervene to end the live interview as he struggled to fend off the barrage of questions after appearing to suggest it was okay for his wife to speak German - but not in public. The UKIP leader also claimed there was a big difference between Romanian immigrants and other foreigners.","Janice Atkinson swore at local activists who questioned UKIP policies .

Cheeky: Designed by Chicago-based feminists Robyn Graves and Michelle Lytle, the TaTa Top is a skin colored bikini adorned with nipples, giving the illusion of toplessness . Robyn and Michelle write on their website that they launched the bikini top with the aim of desexualizing the nipple. 'The only excitement that comes from seeing breasts is that you are conditioned to think they are something special, something to be protected and kept hidden,' reads the website. 'In reality they are excess breast tissue growing into varying sized balls that you have to buy expensive support for and that throw you off balance when you run.' Michelle added in an interview with Salon that by making the wearer look like she is baring her nipples, the TaTa Top exposes people to the idea of toplessness, thereby lessening the shock factor. Good cause: The swimwear, which comes in its original nude hue as well as medium and darker skin tones, costs $28 each, with $5 of each sale put towards a breast cancer research foundation . Get over it: Robyn and Michelle write on their website that they launched the bikini top with the aim of desexualizing the nipple . Exposure: 'If people look around and see this everywhere, then who cares if you can legitimately be topless? Because you're already seeing it,' said Michelle . 'I think that the important thing about this product is that, if people look around and see this everywhere, then who cares if you can legitimately be topless?

She later explained the logic behind her topless posts in an article on XOJane, writing: 'Women are regularly kicked off Instagram for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed, while photos sans nipple - degrading as they might be - remain unchallenged. 'So I walked around New York topless and documented it on Twitter, pointing out that what is legal by New York state law is not allowed on Instagram.' She added: 'What I am arguing for is a woman's right to choose how she represents her body - and to make that choice based on personal desire and not a fear of how people will react to her or how society will judge her. No woman should be made to feel ashamed of her body.'","Though they are not directly affiliated, the TaTa Top was in part inspired by the Free The Nipple movement made popular by Bruce Willis' daughter Scout ."
"As the new mayor of his local town, Terry Buckle was no doubt keen to make an instant impression. And as these pictures show, the 73-year-old has certainly made a big impact - just not the kind he perhaps wanted. Councillor Buckle smashed straight through the front door of his local Tesco store - just five days after becoming the new mayor of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Accident: Councillor Buckle smashed straight through the front door of his local Tesco store - just five days after becoming the new mayor of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk . Embarrassing: As the new mayor of his local town, Terry Buckle was no doubt keen to make an instant impression. But this is perhaps not the impact which he was looking to make . The veteran councillor is thought to have hit his accelerator rather than his brake as he drove into a disabled bay in the store’s car park. Councillor Buckle, who lives nearby, was taken to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds for a check-up before being released unhurt. Mr Buckle's wife Pam, who was not with him at the time of the accident, said:  'I had a phone call from the police, who were the first ones at the accident. 'I went there and went with him to hospital in the ambulance.' She added: 'He's home now. He's fine and he had an X-ray on his neck and he's just a bit sore. Mistake: The veteran councillor is thought to have hit his accelerator rather than his brake as he drove into a disabled bay in the store's car park . Shocked: Councillor Buckle, left,  was taken to West Suffolk Hospital for a check-up before being released with no injuries . 'He's gone to bed with some tablets.' The freak crash happened just after 4.30pm yesterday. Mr Buckle's silver Vauxhall Vectra ploughed clean through the front door. He managed to miss a brick wall on the left-hand side and a plate-glass window on the right. Amazingly both the shop and his car escaped almost totally intact from the accident. Dramatic: No shoppers were hurt but the mayor was quickly secured in a neck brace before being rushed to hospital . Bizarre: The car completely blocked the entrance to the store . Shocked eye-witnesses said it looked as if Cllr Buckle had pressed the accelerator instead of the brake as he pulled into a disabled bay. One woman, who asked not to be named, said she had come down after a neighbour told her about the dramatic incident. She said: 'It's just so lucky no one was seriously hurt because the car has gone right inside.'I think they've probably hit the wrong pedal.' Another bystander said it was the second time a car had ended up inside the store. He said: 'Someone has done it before, but that time it was in the middle of the night so there wasn't any risk to anyone.' Role: Councillor Buckle is pictured during the ceremony which made him town mayor last Thursday . Crowds turned out to watch police and recovery services inch the silver Vauxhall out - many posting footage to Facebook and Twitter. Store staff also took pictures but refused to comment on the bizarre crash. Mr Buckle's fellow Moreton Hall ward member, Frank Warby, said he had spoken to the mayor's daughter and been told he had only gone to hospital 'as a precaution'. Cllr Warby said: 'He was taken to hospital just for a check over. 'Luckily enough he went through the doors and not the wall and only damaged the windows.' Mr Buckle was made the 39th mayor of St Edmundsbury in a glittering ceremony of high pomp last Thursday. Speaking at his mayor-making, he said: 'I am very much looking forward to my year in office. 'One of the joys of being mayor is the opportunity to support the work of charities.' A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: 'An elderly man was driving, there are no reports of any serious injuries. 'It appears he has driven into the door - there doesn't seem to be any reports of serious damage'. A Suffolk Police spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Buckle would not be prosecuted over the crash. She said: 'Officers have spoken to him and words of advice have been given. No further action is being taken.'","Terry Buckle is thought to have hit accelerator rather than brake pedal .

"A British schoolgirl had four abortions before her 16th birthday, new figures today revealed. The unnamed teenager, who underwent her fourth termination in 2012, is among more than 200 under-16s to have had repeat abortions in the past three years. Shockingly, a further five of these girls had three abortions before reaching the age of consent. Treatment: A schoolgirl had four abortions before her 16th birthday, new figures today revealed (file picture) It comes amid concern that terminations are being used by teenagers as an alternative form of contraception. In 2011, a total of 84 under-16s had abortions for a second time or more, according to the Department of Health figures obtained by The Sun. The total rose to 89 out of 2,925 under-16s to have abortions in 2012, but fell to 68 of 2,538 girls last year. Last night, Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said too many teenagers were having sex without thinking about the consequences. 'Too many are being taught that they have a right to sex without consequences and are free to dispose of any unborn child that threatens their lifestyle,' he said. Last year, 185,331 British women of all age groups had terminations. Of these, 50 were treated for a staggering nine abortions of more. Earlier this year, a 13-year-old schoolgirl was given the right to choose whether to have an abortion by a High Court judge. Mr Justice Mostyn ruled that the youngster was capable of making up her own mind as to whether or not to keep the child. The teenager, who lives with her parents, only realised she was pregnant when her grandmother spotted her growing bump and took her for medical tests. She is believed to have thought she had been gaining a little weight for other reasons. A scan at a local hospital confirmed she was pregnant, but the devastated girl said she was not ready to start a family at such a young age and wanted to have a termination. She was 21 weeks pregnant when the case went before the High Court as an emergency hearing in mid-March.","British schoolgirl had her fourth abortion in 2012, figures today revealed .

"A trainee solicitor was jailed yesterday for locking her dog in the kitchen and starving it to death. Roxy, a five-year-old Boxer, died in agony after she was trapped without food or water for more than a week. Her owner, Katy Gammon, 27, who had moved in with her mother at the time, continued going to work while her pet slowly perished. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Jailed: Katy Gammon arrives at Bristol Magistrates Court, where she was jailed for 18 weeks for neglecting her boxer Roxy, who died after 'prolonged and painful' abuse . Horrific: Roxy the five-year-old boxer died a long, painful death after being locked in the kitchen by trainee medical negligence solicitor Katy Gammon, 27. She was only found when a neighbour saw swarms of flies . Roxy’s body lay undiscovered for . another eight weeks, by which time it was so decomposed an RSPCA . inspector had to use a snow shovel to pick it up. Bristol . Magistrates’ Court had previously heard that Gammon had confined the . dog by tying a rope to the kitchen door handle and fixing it to a hook . in the hall. Roxy had . frantically clawed at the door, leaving fragments on the floor, as she . tried to escape before her death, which would have taken around six . days. Gammon is thought to have confined Roxy to one room because she was not house trained. Her body was found after Gammon started staying with her mother nearby. She . returned to feed Roxy until she dislocated her knee and was unable to . get to the house, then falsely claimed her ex-boyfriend was feeding her . pet. Gammon told RSPCA . inspector Miranda Albinson she had left Roxy without food for a week in . August, and returned to find an awful smell, adding: ‘I assumed she was . dead. I never went back.’ Asked if she had deliberately locked her in the kitchen and left her to die, Gammon replied: ‘Yes, basically.’ Cute: Five-year-old boxer Roxy because her solicitor owner 'couldn't cope' with the responsibility of looking after her . Break-up: Adam Taylor, ex boyfriend of Katy Gammon also stood outside court and said he was happy she was jailed, but said it should have been for longer . Roxy’s . body was discovered in November when neighbours called police to . complain about flies swarming in the kitchen of Gammon’s house in . Bristol. Officers were greeted by a strong smell of decomposition and the kitchen still closed with the rope.They called the RSPCA and Roxy’s remains were removed. A . vet said the pet would have taken up to six days to die gradually and . painfully, becoming blind and falling into a coma before passing away. Gammon, . who worked for Bristol legal firm Lyons Davidson specialising in . medical negligence, had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of . cruelty. Yesterday, she sobbed as she was jailed for 18 weeks and banned . from owning animals for life. RSPCA prosecutor Lindi Meyer told the court about the appalling state Roxy was found in. She . said: ‘Officers felt physically sick. The conditions Roxy was living in . were pitiful. In the kitchen she had a small plastic bed with just one . soiled sheet. She would have died on the cold, hard, wood floor. Anger: A anti-animal cruelty protester confronted Gammon as she arrived for sentencing today . Outrage: Several more congregated outside the court calling for stiffer sentences for those convicted of cruelty . Message: The owner of this dog took their pet to court to call for stiffer sentences in cases like these . ‘A . number of items had desperately been pulled out of cupboards. We . believe this was a desperate attempt at searching for food or water. ‘Roxy suffered a slow, painful death which could have been prevented.’ Farah . Rashid, defending, said Gammon ‘hated herself’ for the suffering she . had caused, adding: ‘There is no excuse. This conviction has ended the . career she has been working for for ten years.’ An . online petition had collected 100,000 signatures for ‘justice for Roxy . the boxer dog’, and protesters campaigning for tougher sentencing for . animal cruelty gathered outside the court and chanted.

This is the most serious . case of animal cruelty encountered in these courts.’ Affectionate: Roxy (pictured with Adam Taylor) originally belonged to a friend but developed anxiety problems after being left alone all day . Adorable: Adam Taylor worked evening shifts and Gammon worked in the daytime, so they thought that between them someone would always be around to look after Roxy . Punishment: Gammon, is now in prison after . admitting two cruelty charges relating to her treatment of Roxy.  She . has lost her job with leading Bristol law firm Lyons Davidson .

"Simon Danczuk MP says the Rochdale Council inquiry into wrongdoing at Knowl View school is a 'whitewash' An MP who helped expose the late Cyril Smith as a paedophile has criticised council bosses, calling their inquiry into a school where boys were abused a ‘whitewash’. Rochdale Council is looking into its dealings with residential school Knowl View, where boys as young as seven were abused by the Liberal MP Smith and his cohorts. But MP Simon Danczuk – whose revelations in his book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith were serialised in the Mail last week – has called the inquiry a ‘bogus’ exercise designed to exonerate the local authority of any wrongdoing. He went on to say: ‘I don’t know why they’re calling it an independent review because the council commissioned it, they’ve set the terms of reference. ‘It is a whitewash.

And Greater Manchester Police revealed that two more alleged victims of abuse at the school came forward following the serialisation of Mr Danczuk’s book in the Mail.

We are being completely open and transparent.’ Mr Danczuk says he is considering using parliamentary privilege to name a former senior politician who allegedly had sex with boys at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London.

"The skies in downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul have become a conspiracy theorist's delight as the skies swarm with black helicopters on a mysterious training exercise. The low-flying black helicopters - also known as Night Stalkers - are flying on the training exercise for the Department of Defense but no one at that agency will comment on the exercise's purpose.

"Two men have been charged with child rape offences after a huge police raid by police investigating sex abuse in a Buckinghamshire town. Harmohan Nangpal, 40, and Faisal Iqbal, 31, will both appear before magistrates today charged in connection with alleged child exploitation around Aylesbury. Nangpal, of Hayes, Middlesex, is accused of raping a girl under 13, while Iqbal, of Aylesbury, faces one count of conspiracy to rape a girl under 16. Accused: Two men have been charged with child rape after a huge police raid by police investigating sex abuse in a Buckinghamshire town . Police said the pair were arrested over alleged offences committed in the Aylesbury area between 2005 and 2008. Last Tuesday police carried out a series of synchronised dawn raids, in which up to 120 officers stormed 11 properties across Buckinghamshire and Middlesex. Following the raids, eight other men, aged between 28 and 45, were charged in connection with alleged child sex exploitation following the raids as part of Operation Articulate. Allegations: Police said the pair were arrested over alleged offences committed around the town of Aylesbury between 2005 and 2008 (file picture) Police said the raids had been prompted by information received 'earlier this year', and related to two female victims with the alleged abuse carried out between 2005 and 2012. Speaking after last week's raids, Acting Superintendent Olly Wright said: 'The police action taken today comes as a result of information given to the police earlier this year. We have been working closely with other agencies to investigate these matters, and to provide support and care for the victims. 'The aim of this operation is to protect victims, bring offenders to justice, and to offer help to any others who we are encouraging to come forward. We will continue to work alongside our partner agencies to offer any support victims need as we carry on with the investigation.' Officers said they were not linked to recent high profile sex cases in Rotherham and Oxford. Nangpal and Iqbal have been remanded to appear at Milton Keynes Magistrates’ Court later today. The other eight men, who face accusations of  rape against teenage girls, forcing them into prostitution, ABH and drugging them, were arrested following the execution of police warrants last Tuesday, and charged the following day.

Some analysts saw the announcement as an effort to revive the fortunes of Al Qaeda, which has been largely eclipsed, at least publicly, by Isis, also known as the Islamic State. Isis was kicked out of Al Qaeda in February for ignoring al-Zawahiri’s insistence that it restrict its activities to Iraq’s borders. The separation, however, far from diminishing the group, marked the start of its terrifying expansion. Over the past few months it has rampaged across Iraq and Syria, capturing dozens of towns and strategic positions, killing hundreds of civilians and waging a well-organised online propaganda war. Its ranks have been bolstered by hundreds of fighters from Yemen, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Western nations such as Britain, America and Australia. Al Qaeda has been side-lined as a result, jihadists seemingly far more impressed by Isis’ leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his brutal confrontations with those people deemed to be ‘Un-Islamic’ than al-Zawahiri, who hasn’t been able to dictate events in recent years. However, the West ignores Al Qaeda at its peril. The terrorist organisation still has strongholds in eastern Libya, Syria and the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and has significant alliances with the likes of the Taliban in Afghanistan.","At least 28 commanders from Ahrar al-Sham have been wiped out .

"It is far less grand than Balmoral and has no souvenir shops or visitor car park. But the Queen Mother’s secret ‘picnic cottage’, a two-and-a-half-mile hike away in the hills above the estate, has become a stop on the royal tourist trail. The cottage hideaway, 1,400 feet above Balmoral, is where the Queen Mother hosted her legendary picnics. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: The Queen Mum deep in conversation with her grandson Prince Charles over lunch in the sunshine outside the cottage. He was so captivated by the cottage, he often painted the view looking out to Lochnagar . Retreat: The Queen Mother hosted her legendary picnics at the remote cottage, where she could often be seen outside the cottage, enjoying rose champagne, a glass of gin or the sweet wine-based aperitif Dubonnet . She always served a lobster-prawn cocktail cum egg mayonnaise dish called Oeufs Drumkilbo and jam puffs. Lunch often came with a Bloody Bull – a substantial Bloody Mary cocktail with a kick like a mule. Prince Charles was so captivated by the cottage in the former ‘fermtoun’ of Auchtavan, he often painted the view looking out to Lochnagar and over Ballochbuie forest. Princess Anne has named her latest 40ft, £500,000 yacht after Ballochbuie. It was a special place for their grandmother, who could often be seen outside the cottage, enjoying rose champagne, a glass of gin or the sweet wine-based aperitif Dubonnet. Now the cottage, which is free to the public and hosts regular open days, is an added attraction for those visiting the Balmoral estate. That is if they can muster the energy to make the five-mile round trip through the hills above the River Dee. Braemar Community, the group that has restored Auchtavan’s buildings, advises: . All welcome: Members of the public can visit the cottage at Auchtavan for free on its open days - if they can muster the energy to make the five-mile round trip through the hills above the River Dee . ‘Good walking shoes and outdoor clothing are essential. An accurate map is also recommended.’ Auchtavan was once a thriving farm town of 16 cottages in Glen Feardar, with a population of 200. It is now a rare surviving example of a traditional Highland clachan – a  small settlement that lacks a church, post office or other formal building. The Queen Mother’s two-up, two-down cottage was home to the last family ever to live in the glen, who are believed to have left in the 1950s.

It was home to the last family ever to live in the glen, who are believed to have left in the 1950s . Auchtavan still has a cottage with a rare ‘hinging lum’ – a hanging chimney above an open fire allowing smoke to exit through a hole in the roof. It also has a threshing mill that was powered by horses in the 19th and 20th centuries. The buildings have been returned to their original state by Braemar Community Ltd, with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland and the Cairngorms Leader Fund.

They walked a long way because they took a wrong turn. ‘We also had a young woman with a child in a pushchair and a lady from Aberdeen whose great-great-grandmother came from Auchtavan. We are delighted to see people showing so much interest.’ He added: ‘It’s a window into the past and it is difficult to imagine just how hard life was at this altitude.

For reasons that are unclear their father, also named Robert Murphy, asked for and received Social Security cards for both boys in 1973, according to court papers, reported the New York Post. Posing as his dead twin, Thomas allegedly claimed he suffered from depression and then qualified for Social Security disability benefits in his brother's name. He also received government housing subsidies and food stamps, again as Robert - using some of the allegedly illegally gained money to rent a separate apartment, where he introduced himself to neighbours as 'Robert Murphy,' said officials and local residents.

He went by 'Robert,' ' said his former landlord. 'Not once did he ever mention having a brother. He paid the rent on time, but you never saw the guy. Owen McShane, the DMV's director of investigations, said his office has uncovered thousands of illegal licenses with the facial recognition technology, but none involving a twin using his sibling's image for alleged welfare fraud. 'This is the first case,' he told the New York Post. He said that after DMV investigators noticed the similarities in photos, they checked with Social Security and learned that Robert was dead. Thomas was arrested on charges including grand larceny, fraud and identity theft.","Thomas Murphy's twin Robert died a day after they were born .

"This is the dramatic moment a motorcycle drag racer escaped serious injury by clinging onto the back of a competitor's bike after he was catapulted off his own. Thousands of horrified spectators watched the astonishing escape in disbelief after Greek racer Filippos Papafilippou was thrown off his bike while crossing the centre line at a Bedfordshire racetrack at nearly 200mph. He flew through the air for a split-second, before landing on the wheelie bar of opponent Steve Woollatt, 50, and clinging on until the British racer realised what had happened and pulled over. Scroll down for video . This photograph shows the astonishing moment a Greek drag racer landed on the back of his rival's bike after a high-speed accident he was lucky to escape alive . How it began: Greek drag racer Filippos Papafilippou is on the left and his British opponent, Steve Woollatt, 50, is on the right at Bedfordshire's Santa Pod racetrack . Crossing the centre line: Papafilippou, left, accelerated over the yellow line, which he later blamed on his bike 'responding violently' when he turned up the throttle . Neck and neck: Just after he crosses the line, Papafilippou's bike is parallel to Woollatt's, but the Greek racer will soon be catapulted off his bike and into the air . As these dramatic pictures show, the incident which happened on Monday at the Santa Pod Raceway outside Wellingborough could have had a far more serious outcome. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Papafilippou, 42, who has raced for 14 years, spoke of the incredible event. He said: 'This is the only dangerous crash I've ever had. I'm lucky, it could have been a lot worse. 'I felt (the wheel) spinning and when it found traction it reacted violently. I crossed the middle lane and went into his lane. 'In this sport you don't have time, you have one-thousandths of a second - it's instinct and reaction. I grabbed into him and he's very experienced and didn't panic. 'It was so lucky I grabbed the wheels, I couldn't go anywhere else. We were laughing nervously afterwards. 'I spoke to people from all over the world and it's never happened before. It's unique. 'No one has ever started on one bike and finished on the other.' Ouch: Mr Papafilippou, 42, posted a picture of his injury, which he admits could have been far worse . The riders chewed-up boot. It got caught between the wheel and the wheel arch of his opponent's bike . By yesterday, the Greek racer had recovered sufficiently to post footage of his lucky escape on his Facebook page. When asked by one British fan: 'Any idea what caused  you to make that hard left?', Papafilippou replied in English: 'We stepped up and put more power to run quicker and the bike responded violently. 'The bike was pulling a lot harder than in our previous runs and tried to roll over me and I didn't want to go off the throttle.....When I did, it was too late.' As the footage of the near miss shows, he clung on until the British racer came to a stop further down the track. After the episode, fans of the Greek racer took to Facebook to wish him luck for the future, with one saying 'Bravo and good luck'.

"A mother accused of leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can today appeared in court as her lawyers asked a judge for more time to understand what happened. Alicia Marie Englert, 23, made her first appearance in court in Salt Lake City, Utah, where her attorneys said they need time to investigate the 23-year-old's mental condition. Her family has said she has a learning disability and didn't understand what she did. Englert, whose baby daughter miraculously survived the ordeal after she was found and flown to hospital in critical condition, will next appear in court again next month. She is being held on $500,000 bail and faces up to life in prison if convicted of attempted murder. In court: Alicia Englert, who is accused of leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can, makes her initial appearance in court on Wednesday, where her lawyers asked for more time to investigate her condition . Prosecutors previously explained that she gave birth in a bathroom inside her family's home around midnight on August 24, before wrapping the baby in a towel and left it on the floor of the bathroom. The next morning, she left for work, leaving the baby alone without feeding her or seeking medical care for her, prosecutors said. When she returned home, she again left her on the bathroom floor. The following day, Englert allegedly put the baby in her neighbor's trash can just before 6am, hiding her beneath bags. Prosecutors say her lack of care shows she deliberately tried to kill the child. A neighbor heard sounds of what she thought was a purring cat in her trash can and when she moved some of the bags, she spotted the baby. When the baby was found, she was suffering from hypothermia and respiratory distress. She has since improved and is now in fair condition, Unified Police said. Stony-faced: Her parents have said she has a learning disability and doesn't understand what she has done . Locked up: Englert, flanked by her attorneys in court on Wednesday, is due back in court next month . 'It's certainly a testament to how resilient these babies can be,' Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said. 'It's quite remarkable that the baby is doing well and is improving steadily.' Fox13 previously published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said. Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. But her father, Robert Englert, said his daughter has only just recently started to realize what she had done. 'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune last week. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.' He told the newspaper he didn't know who the baby's father was. Partier: Fox13 published photographs of  Englert, suggesting she may have been partying while pregnant . Social: Englert and her apparent friends were seen 'partying' in this image released by Fox 13 . Awaiting trial: Englert, pictured left in her mug shot, faces life in jail if convicted of attempted murder . The woman's mother, Tammy Englert, told The Deseret News last week that her daughter didn't understand what had happened.

"A couple's dream wedding in Jamaica was left in ruins after a series of catastrophic errors with their booking. Katie Carrick, 28, was overjoyed when her fiancée Stephen Bell, 45, popped the question on Christmas Eve and suggested that they tie the knot in the Caribbean. But their hopes for a beautiful wedding were dashed after a number of errors were made after booking with their provider, Thomas Cook, which forced them to abandon their big day. Scroll down for video . Katie Carrick was all set to marry her fiancée Stephen Bell this October in Jamaica but her hopes for a Carribean wedding were dashed after a series of catastrophic errors by travel agents . The couple, from Sunderland, spent almost £5,000 on their upcoming nuptials and were set to marry at the Sunset Jamaica Grande Resort & Spa in Ocho Rios, Jamaica on 27 October. But their holiday was cancelled when Thomas Cook announced that the hotel had been closed. Bride-to-be Katie, who works as a carer, eventually found another location in Jamaica, The Bahia Principe hotel. She thought that it would be perfect, even though it would cost the couple more. But luck wasn't on their side as those plans were also ruined. The travel agent's promises of a date for the wedding failed to materialise and the wedding department at the hotel knew nothing of their booking. Second option: The wedding department at the The Bahia Principe hotel knew nothing of their booking . Katie and Stephen were then kept in limbo for six months but with one month to go until the original date and four failed options later, the couple were forced to forget their big day. Disappointed: Ms Carrick's experience left her so stressed that she is now battling depression . Katie, who is mum to eight-year-old Connor, said: 'I am completely devastated that our big day has been completely ruined. 'I cried and cried in the travel agents. I felt as though we had no other choice than to cancel the entire wedding. 'I was heartbroken. I spent £250 on my wedding dress and was absolutely thrilled with it. I couldn't wait for Stephen to see me walk down the aisle in the dress of my dreams, but now I have had to put it away in the closet at my mum's house. 'I was over the moon when Stephen proposed, it was so romantic, it was a perfect Christmas present and we were desperate to get married abroad and in 2014. 'Now the thought of getting married doesn't feel exciting any more. It's not the occasion I had always dreamed of.' The fourth and most expensive option was ruled out when the unhappy couple's bridesmaid and best man could not afford to attend and were then hit by a bereavement. Katie complained to the tour operator who have refunded her the £3,800 that the family paid for the holiday and the wedding ceremony. But she claims that she was not given a reasonable excuse for the wedding date not being confirmed or a realistic alternative option by Thomas Cook when the plans fell through. 'What was meant to be a happy occasion, planning the best day of our lives has turned into the worst,' Katie said. Ruined plans: The couple would have been married on 27 October in the Carribbean . 'The fact that this has gone on since we booked the wedding in January has left me stressed, fighting depression and has affected my work as I need time off. 'We managed to receive all of the money that we paid for the holiday back but it does not compensate for the fact that Stephen and I were supposed to be married at the end of October and now we are not. 'We had bought the rings, the suits, a bridesmaid dress and paid for decorations, it is such a huge shame. I went through hell and the amount of time we spent in the travel agents was a joke. 'It's safe to say that we will not be using Thomas Cook again.' A spokesperson for Thomas Cook said,' Thomas Cook would like to apologise to Ms Carrick with regards to the service she received when recently making her wedding arrangements with us. Thomas Cook has apologised for the disappointment that they faced, saying 'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are sorry that we fell short of Ms Carrick's expectations' 'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers, and we are sorry that we fell short of Ms Carrick’s expectations in this instance. Due to an operational change at the original hotel, Thomas Cook were no longer in a position to be able to offer Ms Carrick her first choice of venue. Thomas Cook sought to make alternative arrangements for the Carrick party. However, none of the proposed venues were either available during the selected dates of travel or deemed by the customers to be suitable for their wedding requirements, despite these being of the same, like-for-like level as Ms Carrick’s original choice of hotel. Thomas Cook can confirm that Ms Carrick has cancelled her booking with us, and we have fully reimbursed her the deposit paid. 'We understand that Ms Carrick and her fiancée are now no longer seeking to marry abroad and are in the process of making arrangements for a UK wedding. 'We will be providing the couple with a gesture of goodwill by way of apology, and we would like to wish Ms Carrick and her future husband the very best in their married life together.'","Katie Carrick and Stephen Bell were meant to be married this October .

"The efforts by the current Chancellor, George Osborne, and the Coalition to regain control of the public finances looks to be working . Britain is on track to deliver the biggest turnaround in public finances by any advanced economy since the Second World War, according to a report. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility says that if current policy remains in place the public finances will return to balance by 2018-19 – producing the first surplus for 18 years. ‘It would represent one of the largest budget reductions among advanced countries in the post-war period,’ says its report. The OBR seeks to shed light on the causes and consequences of the build-up of deficit and debt in Britain since the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It heaped blame for hefty budget deficits on reckless spending by Labour in the period that Gordon Brown was Prime Minister and Alistair Darling was Chancellor. It says the lavish spending plans announced by Labour in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review were adhered to despite the onset of the banking crisis, which was heralded by the collapse of Northern Rock in 2007 and the subsequent failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Indeed, Labour actually advanced some capital spending plans – not due to take place until 2010-2011 – to the year before. It also spent heavily on employment support at a time when tax receipts were plummeting because of the depth of the recession. The efforts by the current Chancellor, George Osborne, and the Coalition to regain control of the public finances looks to be working even though returning to the black has been delayed. Most significantly perhaps, the Tory-led government has taken an axe to the public sector, reducing spending to 38 per cent of the nation’s output. That is a figure not seen since the early 2000s, when Labour abandoned the spending ceilings inherited from the Tories and embarked on a spending free-for- all. The improvement in finances has largely been achieved by cutting the spending of Whitehall departments, which ballooned in the latter years of the Labour government. The report heaped blame for hefty budget deficits on reckless spending by Labour in the period that Gordon Brown was Prime Minister . There have also been sharp cutbacks in capital spending and the welfare budget also has been brought back under control. Contrary to public perceptions spending on the National Health Service has continued to expand against the background of deep reductions in the annual spending of departments. Budgetary woes were increased as a result of the financial crisis. As the economy plunged into recession and output plummeted so did the income the government received from taxes. Cash receipts and nominal GDP (the output of the economy without adjustment for inflation) both fell in real terms in the years 2007-08 and 2009-10 – ‘a rare event’ says the OBR. Robert Chote, the OBR’s director, described the surge in spending by Labour, at a time of worsening public finances, as ‘unusual’. He noted that other countries ‘were trying to pre-fund the rising costs of ageing by getting the debt down in good times’. As a result of Labour’s reckless spending patterns UK national debt climbed by 2.5 per cent of national output a year between 2004 and 2007, a faster rate than Greece, Portugal and Italy – the currently very sick eurozone countries. The OBR warns that the biggest risk to a return to health in the public finances is that the current government or a future one adopts different policies and abandons commitments to keep spending on a tight rein.","Britain is on track to deliver the biggest turnaround  since WW2 .

"Two students arrested for breaking into a home in Florida tried to get themselves off the hook by saying they were only there to have sex. Allison Riddle and Evan Jones, both 18, allegedly sneaked into a house in Bradenton, Florida, on Saturday night and were found in the owner's bedroom by a deputy sheriff. But after they were led out at gunpoint and sat down, the two tried to explain themselves, saying they 'were not there to steal anything'. Compromising situation: Allison Riddle, left, and Evan Jones, right, were arrested in a bedroom in Bradenton, Florida . In a police report cited by The Smoking Gun, the officer describes how he announced himself when he came into house but at first received no response. When he reached the bedroom door he repeated himself, and Jones responded by saying: 'Alright, we are coming out'. The officer explained that he had entered by an unlocked door, but Jones later said he had been given a code to get in through the garage by a friend who mowed the owner's lawn. It is thought that the authorities were tipped off to the alleged break-in by a neighbour who saw the pair entering. The owner, who lives in Michigan, was not there at the time and had to be told by phone. Jones was bailed on Sunday for $7,500, while Riddle has been left in custody.","Allison Riddle and Evan Jones, both 18, allegedly broke into house .

"A former firefighter from Iowa convicted of shooting dead his pregnant wife of only seven months was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday after the victim's relatives called him a coward who betrayed and devastated their family. Relatives of Lisa Techel took turns tearfully confronting Seth Techel during an emotional hearing at the Monroe County Courthouse in Albia, calling the 23-year-old convicted murderer a cold-blooded killer who has put them through hell. They said Seth Techel, once a member of their tight-knit family, selfishly killed their beloved daughter and sister while she slept in May 2012. They said that they have suffered nightmares, taken stress medicine and struggled to trust anyone in the years since. All smiles: Seth Techel, left, confers with his attorney Wednesday at the Monroe County Courthouse in Albia, Iowa, after he was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder in the killing of his pregnant wife . Tragic newlywed: Lisa Techel, 23, was four months pregnant when her husband of seven months, Seth Techel, killed her with a shotgun as she slept . Waiting for closure: Tracy Caldwell, Lisa's mother, sits in the Monroe County Courthouse with her partner before Seth Techel's sentencing . Father's grief: Todd Caldwell, Lisa's father, accused of taking away from his his precious daughter, who once called her dad her 'soul mate' Lisa Techel's father, Todd Caldwell, described the close relationship he had with his daughter, noting she had called him her soul mate in a letter to him before she was killed. 'You know what you took from me,' Caldwell said, pointing his finger across the courtroom at Seth Techel. Caldwell later added: 'Seth is a cold-hearted killer. I would call him an animal, but an animal only kills out of necessity. Seth killed out of convenience.' The heartbroken parent also called out the defendant for being a 'coward' who took 'the selfish way out' instead of facing responsibility. Tracey Caldwell, Lisa's mother, directly addressed Seth Techel, telling him that had her daughter been awake that day in May 2012, she would have fought back . Betrayed: Lisa' sisters Mariah Hoium (left) and Presley Caldwell (right) spoke of their heartbreaking loss at the hands of a man they once loved like a brother . 'I used to think that Seth would eventually admit to what he did,' said Mr Caldwell. 'But he is a coward.' In July, a jury found Techel guilty of killing his 23-year-old wife while she slept in their trailer in Agency, a small town in southeastern Iowa. She was four months pregnant with the couple's first child, a girl they had agreed to name Zoey. Prosecutors said Seth Techel used a friend's shotgun to kill his wife of seven months so that he could start a relationship with a co-worker. They say he took a shower to wash off evidence and then made 911 calls claiming an unknown intruder killed her while he was in the bathroom. No sympathy: Techel, pictured here during his murder trial in July, was described by his wife's family as a cold-blooded killer who put them through hell . Seth Techel showed no emotion as his former in-laws described their heartbreak and anger. Techel, who has maintained his innocence and will appeal his conviction, declined to make a statement in court. The guilty verdict came after the third trial in the case, which was preceded by two previous trials that ended in hung juries. Lisa Techel's relatives said the length of the court battles added to their anguish. Judge Daniel Wilson sentenced Techel to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the mandatory sentence for first-degree murder in Iowa. More prison time: The 23-year-old also received 25 years behind bars on top of his life sentence in the death of his unborn baby daughter, Zoey . He also sentenced Techel to 25 years in prison for nonconsensual termination of a human pregnancy. Wilson said the impact of the crimes was horrific. He noted the closeness and trust that had existed between Seth's and Lisa's families, who are both well known in the Ottumwa area. 'Your wife, Lisa, is dead. Your unborn child never had the opportunity to live. You are likely to spend the rest of your life in prison,' he said. 'It's unbelievable and none of it was necessary.' Lisa's sister Presley Caldwell recalled rushing to the couple's trailer on the morning her sibling was killed and believing Seth's claim that someone else was responsible. She recalled how Seth told her days later at the visitation that he would always be her brother and love her. 'I'm no longer your sister, and I no longer love you,' she told him. Her other sister, Mariah Hoium, described for the court how her brother-in-law's actions left a void in their family, reported WHO-TV. 'Seth Techel: You took a part of our hearts that day,' she said, addressing the killer. Lisa's mother, Tracy Caldwell, said her daughter's goal was to become an investigator with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, where she had interned. 'She wanted to help people, to protect people, and little did any of us know that she was the one who needed protection,' she said. She told Seth that she had no doubts that he made sure Lisa was sleeping before he fired the shot. 'You and I both know that Lisa would have fought back,' she said, drawing a round of applause from relatives in the courtroom.","Seth Techel, 23, was found guilty in July of first-degree murder in shooting death of Lisa Techel in May 2012 .
