"(CNN) -- Europe regained the Solheim Cup with a 15-13 victory over the United States at Killeen Castle in Ireland Sunday. With the scores tied 8-8 going into the concluding 12 singles matches, a close finish always looked likely and the outcome boiled down to the last three matches on course. Norway's Suzann Pettersen led the European fight back as she came down from one down with three to play to beat Michelle Wie by one hole. At the culmination of a superb match, Pettersen holed an eight-foot birdie putt on the final green to tip the match in Europe's favor. In the second last singles, Caroline Hedwall, two down with two to play against Ryann O'Toole, won the last two holes for a vital half point, which effectively sealed the European triumph, their players running onto the 18th green to celebrate. With Azahara Munoz one up with one to play against Angela Stanford, it meant Europe had an unassailable one-point lead. After the green cleared, Stanford played a superb approach to within a few feet, but both putts were conceded to hand Munoz a 1up victory. The United States, who had won the last three editions of the biennial team competition, suffered an early blow when Cristie Kerr was forced to withdraw from her final singles match against Karen Stupples with an injured wrist. Kerr was left in tears at the concession of a point which was to prove crucial. Catriona Matthew gave Europe early impetus with a 6 and 5 victory over Paula Creamer in the top singles and Sophie Gustafson added a second point for the home side with a final green win over Stacy Lewis. Brittany Lang and Morgan Pressel, with her fourth win in four, put the United States back on to the front foot and the match between veterans Juli Inkster and Laura Davies ended all square. Christina Kim of the United States beat fellow rookie Maria Hjorth, while American Vicky Hurst beat Melissa Reid by two holes and Europe's Christel Boeljon overcame Brittany Lincicome by the same margin to set up the exciting finale with the scores then tied 12 1/2 - 12 1/2. Europe captain Alison Nicholas was leading her team to the fourth victory in 12 contests and they will defend the trophy at Colorado Golf Club in 2013. ""My team played with such heart and passion. The rookies were fantastic and the experienced players have done so well. They are all champions,"" Nicholas told Sky Sports.","Europe win back Solheim Cup with 15-13 win over United States at Killeen Castle in Ireland .

"(CNN) -- Diego Forlan grabbed two goals as Uruguay thrashed Paraguay 3-0 in Buenos Aires to secure a record 15th Copa America title. The striker, who plays for Spanish club Atletico Madrid, struck in each half to become Uruguay's joint highest scorer in history after Liverpool forward Luis Suarez had broken the deadlock after only 11 minutes. It marked Uruguay's first Copa America triumph since 1995 and they can now boast one more title than hosts Argentina, who they beat in the quarterfinal. In a one-sided final at the Estadio Monumental, Uruguay almost took the lead in the third minute when Diego Lugano's header was blocked on the line by Paraguay keeper Justo Villar. But just eight minutes later Suarez found the net and notched his fourth goal of the tournament. Collecting a ball inside the area Suarez brought it down and cut inside on his left to fire a shot into the bottom corner, via a slight deflection off defender Dario Veron. Suarez put Forlan through on goal just after the half hour mark but Villar made a crucial save to keep the deficit at just one goal. But he could do nothing four minutes before halftime as Egidio Arevalo Rios robbed Nestor Ortigoza of possession and teed up Forlan who made no mistake with a powerful drive. Paraguay tried to force the pace in the second half and hit the crossbar after Nelson Valdez's shot was tipped onto the woodwork by Uruguay goalkeeper Nestor Muslera. But Paraguay's threat faded after that and they were thankful to another fine save from Villar to prevent Sebastian Eguren putting the game beyond doubt. That feat was left to Forlan who finished a fine breakaway move in the dying seconds as he finished smartly following Suarez's precise header and pulled level with Hector Scarone as Uruguay's all time leading goalscorer on 31.","Uruguay seal the Copa America title after crushing Paraguay 3-0 .

"(CNN Student News) -- July 14, 2011 . Download a PDF map related to today's show: . • Atlanta, Georgia . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: That airplane means it's time for a new summer edition of CNN Student News! Hi, everyone. I'm Tomeka Jones. And this week, we're focusing on connections; specifically, Career Connections! Career Connections: Recruiter . JONES: That's the name of a segment we debuted this past school year. The goal of Career Connections is to give you guys a look at some of the different jobs around CNN. But first, we want to look at jobs in general. You definitely want to take notes for this! Candice McLemore is here to give us some career advice from a recruiter's perspective. Hi, Candice, thank you so much for joining us! CANDICE MCLEMORE, PROFESSIONAL RECRUITER, TURNER BROADCASTING, INC.: Thanks for having me. JONES: First question: What exactly does a recruiter do? MCLEMORE: A recruiter basically has the role of finding qualified and talented employees for a company. JONES: Can you share with our audience, which is a middle and high school audience, a few dos and some don'ts on how to put together a resume? MCLEMORE: Sure. I would say in terms of dos, first of all, pick a very simple format. You don't have to get elaborate; you don't want to use a lot of different fonts or colors or fancy items on your resume. You want somebody to be able to view it very quickly and to understand what your skills and your qualifications are. And secondly, in terms of the content, I would say really think about what are the qualities and qualifications that you have. Certainly you can list job duties that you've had at previous companies, but you also want to think outside the box in terms of accomplishments as well. Did you solve a particular problem? Did you win an award? Were you on a particular dean's list or things like that? Try to think about other accomplishments that you can encompass, and then also other involvement that you've had outside of the work world as well. So, think about volunteer organizations that you've been a part of. And then also, certainly, any technical systems or software, things like that, that you may know how to use, even if you've used it in your personal space and not professionally. If it's a skill that you have, you should include that on your resume. JONES: OK, my last question: speaking to that middle or high school student, what tips and tricks maybe you can provide for them to get ahead of the competition? MCLEMORE: I would say for them to get ahead of the competition, to really get involved either in their school, in organizations or on their campuses when they go off to college. One of the things that our company looks for for our interns is people who are really passionate about what we do, but have also put that in to practice in any way that they can. So, if they want to be a publicist, they're on the PR committee for their student organization, or their sorority or whatever it may be. They're not just going to classes. They're doing more and taking more time to get exposure in any way that they can, even in their extracurricular activities. Career Connections Advice . JONES: Don't put away that pen and paper yet! A few CNN professionals also have some great advice to share. They talked about their jobs in Career Connections segments last school year. If you missed those reports, go to CNNStudentNews.com to check them out. In the meantime, here's what those employees had to say about how to get a jump start on your career. (BEGIN VIDEO) SUMMER SULEIMAN, CNN VIDEO JOURNALIST: It's definitely OK not knowing exactly what you want to do and saying ""this is what I want to be in ten years."" The best part is the journey there allows you to experience and try different things until you find what really works for you. MONIQUE SMITH, CNN PRODUCTION ASSISTANT: The advice that I would give is if your school has a broadcasting program, make sure you are in that program. Find out what your passion is, because whenever you find out something that you really feel strongly about and you have a good background in it, whatever you decide to do it won't feel like work. It will just feel like something that you're doing for fun because you're interested in it. JAMES CURRY, CNN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCER: One of the best pieces of advice I was given is treat every job like you're running for political office. That doesn't mean go shake hands and kiss babies and all that kind of stuff. It just means get your name out there, let people know you're interested and pursue it, and don't stop. STEPHANIE TODD, CNN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Being proactive, I think, in any field is the way to go, and having ideas and not being afraid to speak out and being confident in yourself. You shouldn't get discouraged by if someone gives you some sort of criticism or critique or feedback. You just have to know that you believe in yourself and you've done your best. JOE CARTER, HLN ANCHOR/REPORTER: You have to have passion in everything you do. Doesn't matter if it's at work or at home or at school, you have to have passion. You have to come with energy and excitement. Persistence, because there is another person willing to take it from you if you don't keep pushing forward. Patience, which is it doesn't all come at the beginning. It takes time, actually, to get where you want to be. It doesn't happen overnight. And positioning, so every day you wake up you've got to think about how you can better yourself for tomorrow. AMBER LYON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A lesson to everybody, whether you're a journalist or any other type of career, is be willing to take risks. Because if you're truly passionate about it, follow your passion and success will follow. It will pay off in the end. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . JONES: So, are you connecting with any specific career yet? We asked you guys that question on our blog last year. Some of you may have changed your minds, and that's okay. But here's what a few of you had to say then. Caitlin said she wants to be a second grade teacher. She says it's easy for her to learn about this career. All she has to do is observe her current teachers. Coleton dreams of becoming an archeologist so he can make important discoveries. On the other hand, Tyler said he wants to be a kid a little longer and do the stuff as a kid he won't do as an adult. He said sometimes you have to slow down. Kassandra and Olivia have something in common: they both want to be veterinarians when they get older. And Gavin believes that no matter how young you are, it is never a bad idea to give some thought to your possible profession. He says in these economic times, good jobs are hard to find. Blog Promo . JONES: Some of you might be spending your summer working. Well, whether you're interning with a company or just plain old having fun, we want you to tell us about it! There are two ways you can do it: write on our blog or send in a video. You have to at least be 13 to do that. You can do both at CNNStudentNews.com. Goodbye . JONES: We've finished the job for now, but we're already working on our next summer show. Be sure to recruit your friends to tune in next week.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United Nations has established more than a thousand health clinics across Pakistan in the wake of widespread flooding, a U.N. official said. ""Almost 1,200 mobile health clinics are operating across Pakistan,"" said Maurizio Giuliano with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ""For many people, this is the only way to receive health care."" Water-borne illnesses from contaminated flood waters have erupted nationwide. At least 1 million Pakistanis have crippling diarrhea or respiratory infections. About 65,000 cases of malaria have been reported. ""More than 2 million people have received health care through this system, especially for diarrhea diseases, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye disease,"" he said. ""These clinics reach even the remotest areas with teams sometimes walking for six hours and carrying 20 kilograms [44 pounds] of medical supplies on their backs."" The death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said over the weekend. Officials said last week that 17 million have been affected nationwide. The death toll is expected to rise significantly as flood waters continue to recede and more bodies surface. Pakistani flood victims face perilous journey home . On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a presidential order authorizing emergency funds to Pakistan's flood victims, the White House said. The president said the use of the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund was in the United States' interest. Up to $33 million can go toward the country's crisis. The United Nations warned that a crisis is building in the eastern province of Balochistan, where nearly 2 million people are affected. There is a ""humanitarian tragedy"" with immediate threats of water-borne diseases and food shortages, said Mengeshe Kebede, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' representative to Pakistan. ""We need to scale up our activities in the province, or else I think we are heading for a major humanitarian disaster there,"" Kebede said. ""I have worked in humanitarian situations globally, and worked in refugee camps in Africa during emergencies, but to be honest I had never seen a situation as devastating as I saw in Balochistan,"" he said. CNN's Samson Desta contributed to this story.","The flooding death toll tops 1,700 .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan are through to the semifinals of the Cricket World Cup after crushing West Indies by 10 wickets in a one-sided last eight clash in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Captain and leg-spinner Shahid Afridi inspired his Pakistan side to a superb fielding display, after the West Indies won the toss and elected to bat. Afridi recorded figures of four wickets for 30 runs as the Windies crashed to just 112 all out in 44 overs -- their third-lowest score in World Cup history. Off-spinners Mohammad Hafeez and Saeed Ajmal also took two wickets apiece with only veteran batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul managing to hold firm against the Pakistan spin demons, making 44 not out from 106 deliveries. In reply, Hameez (61) and Kamran Akmal (47) cruised to the target with more than 29 overs to spare -- guiding Pakistan to their first World Cup semifinal since 1999. At one stage, West Indies were in danger of making their lowest-ever World Cup total, when struggling on 71-8. However, a 40-run partnership between Kemar Roach and Chanderpaul helped them better their worse score of 93 against Kenya in 1996. Meanwhile, Australian captain Ricky Ponting has denied media reports that he is set to quit international cricket. The International Cricket Council (ICC) official website reported Ponting as saying: ""I have never ever thought about retirement or where the finish line might be. ""I've been trying to prepare myself as best I can as a player and lead the team as well as possible. For some reason, these retirement things keep popping up all the time. ""We've got a big game coming up against India that I'm looking forward to, and more importantly I'm looking forward to getting out there and performing well as a player."" Australia will face India in an explosive-looking quarterfinal showdown in  Ahmedabad on Thursday.","Pakistan cruise through to the semfinals of the Cricket World Cup in Dhaka .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Pakistan's prime minister, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, arrived in India Wednesday to watch a Cricket World Cup match between the two archrival teams as the nuclear neighbors try to repair ties wounded by the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai. ""We all must enjoy cricket,"" Gilani told reporters after landing at Chandigarh, near Punjab's Mohali city, which is hosting the semifinal between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani leader was watching the high-pitched match with his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, who had invited him last week to Wednesday's game. The South Asian rivals, which have fought three wars since the blood-soaked partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947, have in the past too used cricket as a platform to ease relations. When cricket means more than just a match . In 2005, Singh and then-Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf saw a cricket match at a New Delhi stadium. In 1987, Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and Pakistan Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq attended a similar game in Jaipur. Gilani's visit came a day after his country agreed in principle to allow a tour by an Indian commission in connection with the investigations into the Mumbai assault blamed on Pakistani militant groups. In their talks Tuesday in New Delhi, Indian and Pakistani home secretaries also pledged to set up a ""hotline"" on terror threats. ""Both sides agreed to set up a hotline between (the) home secretary of India and (the) interior secretary of Pakistan to facilitate real-time information-sharing with respect to terrorist threats,"" said a joint statement issued at the end of their talks. More than 160 people were killed in the November 2008 siege of Mumbai that derailed a fragile peace process between the two nations. According to the joint statement, India also promised to host a Pakistani judicial panel to study the trial proceedings related to the case. ""Dates for the visit of the judicial commission from Pakistan in connection with (the) Mumbai attack trial will be conveyed by India within four (to) six weeks,"" the statement read. A Mumbai court has imposed a death sentence on Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving Pakistani gunman from the three-day terror siege of the city. Kasab's lawyers say their client plans to challenge the sentence in India's supreme court in New Delhi. In their discussions, Indian home secretary Pillai briefed the Pakistani side on his country's investigations into a deadly bombing of a Pakistan-bound train, about 80 kilometers from New Delhi, four years ago. Some Hindu nationalists are now the key suspects in the 2007 firebombing on the Samjhauta (Friendship) Express train that left 68 passengers dead. The attack was initially believed to be the work of Islamist militants. ""Both sides reiterated their commitment to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirmed the need to bring those responsible for such crimes to justice,"" the statement said.","Several times in the past cricket has been used to ease tensions between the two nations .

"(CNN) -- Two big piles of cash, one at a grave site and another at a home, have been recovered by Pittsburgh police and are believed to be part of the $2 million an armored truck driver allegedly stole after killing his partner. Kenneth Konias Jr. remains on the run after he allegedly shot Michael Haines in the head last month, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation who declined to be named. About $24,000 was found at Konias' grandmother's grave site on Wednesday, the source said. More than $200,000 was found at his home Tuesday. Konias is believed to be in possession of at least three handguns and is thought to be within the United States, said Pittsburgh Police Commander Thomas Stangrecki. An FBI task force is participating in the hunt, employing social media to tap into a wider audience and gather information. According to the criminal complaint, a witness heard a gunshot coming from an armored truck carrying deposits around 1 p.m. ET on February 28. Surveillance video shows the vehicle in the parking lot where the shot was overheard. The truck was later discovered under a Pittsburgh bridge by the company's employees and two police detectives. Haines was found dead inside, authorities said. Authorities say Konias called a friend and his mother in the minutes after the shooting. ""I f***ed up,"" Konias told his friend, according to the criminal complaint. ""My life is over."" Pressed to explain, Konias admitted he had killed someone, according to the complaint. CNN can not independently verify the account. His mother, Renee Konias, told police that she had received a ""strange call"" from her son, less than an hour after the shooting, asking to speak to his father, but she informed him that he would have to call the house to reach him. Police said that when his mother attempted to call him back, Konias answered once and hung up abruptly and then did not answer at all. His cell phone was later recovered by police. According to the complaint, Konias' father said he saw his son drop off a blood-spattered work jacket at his home. Konias is accused of criminal homicide, theft of the victim's gun and robbery of the cash inside the armored vehicle. The armored truck company, Garda Cash Logistics, is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of Konias. He was last seen driving a champagne-colored 2006 Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plate GZW-4572. Police say the man should be considered armed and dangerous and are asking anyone with information to call the Pittsburgh Homicide Office at 412-323-7161 or to call 911.

"(CNN)  -- The turboprop plane that crashed in New York state, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground, was one of the safest and most sophisticated aircraft of its type, according to an aviation industry expert. Scandinavian Airlines grounded its fleet of Dash 8 Q400 planes after three crash landings in 2007. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was less than one year old and had flown for only about 1,500 hours, said Kieran Daly, of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence. The Continental Connection Flight 3407 was operated by Colgan Air between Newark Liberty International Airport and Buffalo. Daly said propeller-driven aircraft such as the Canadian-built Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 and its European rival, the ATR series, had sold well to airlines in the last three years because they were almost as fast as jets, cruising at about 480 kilometers/hour (300 mph), but used much less fuel.  Listen to audio of plane's last moments » . However, despite an excellent safety record, some passengers were still wary of traveling on propeller planes, he said. Daly said that for most of the time turboprops were as safe as similar-sized, 50-seater jets, but in icy conditions turboprops were at a disadvantage. Stressing that the cause of Thursday's crash in near Buffalo was still unclear and could be caused by mechanical failure for example, he said the potential for ice was there because it was short and the plane would have been flying at a relatively low level. Watch what iReporter captured on film . Daly said the pilot appeared not to have reported problems with icing, but this was not unusual because planes were designed to cope with these conditions. ""All aircraft have de-icing system: a big jet like a 747 can cope with ice almost indefinitely, but smaller planes, especially propeller planes can experience problems,"" he said. ""Pilots cope by increasing altitude -- icing mainly occurs at lower levels -- but because propeller-driven planes are slower, they take longer to reach high altitude and spend longer in the icy conditions."" According to the National Weather Service weather observation for Buffalo, there was light snow, fog and mist shortly before 10 p.m.  Watch more on the plane crash » . CNN has listened to a tape of communications between air traffic control and the flight crew. The first officer had no sign of stress in her voice initially. The plane was cleared for approach. About two minutes later, the air traffic controller came back, with stress in his voice. Radar contact was lost.  Watch report from witness: ""All I saw was flames"" » . The question went out: Can other planes see anything? No one responds. The controller says they might have a plane down. The pilot's last comment was ""Colgan Flight 3407."" There were no sounds of distress.  Watch video from CNN affiliate WGRZ » . Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) permanently grounded its fleet of Dash 8s after three crash landings during a two-month period in 2007 that were blamed on the aircraft's landing gear. ""Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying in this type of aircraft,"" Mats Jansson, president and CEO of SAS, said at the time. ""I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service."" Air expert Daly said though that in Thursday's crash the landing gear of the Continental plane was unlikely to be down because it was far from the airport. The National Transportation Safety Board said early Friday it was preparing to send a team to Buffalo to investigate the crash. Thursday's plane crash is the deadliest on U.S. soil since August 2006 when Comair Flight 5191 crashed when it attempted to take off from the wrong runway.","Air expert: Turboprop plane that crashed in New York one of safest of its type  Officials say all 49 aboard the plane died; one confirmed death on ground .

"(CNN) -- It's an oval-shaped, bitter tasting leaf that makes you chatty after chewing it, while inducing a feeling of euphoria and alertness. The East African plant khat, a mild narcotic, has been chewed for centuries by people in the Horn of Africa and parts of the Middle East for its stimulating effects. The green leaf is central to cultural and social activities for many communities across the area and key to the economic survival of thousands of khat farmers who grow it legally. In recent years, high demand for the herbal stimulant by the Somali diaspora -- despite it being illegal in several western countries, including the U.S. -- has helped open up a booming industry in fertile parts of Kenya, such as the Meru county. But now the livelihood of these farmers is under threat after the Netherlands, which has a vibrant Somali community and is a key khat hub to other European countries, announced a ban on all imports of the plant in January. Until now, the Netherlands and Britain were the only major European countries allowing the trade and consumption of the flowering shrub. ""If the ban is accepted or if it is enforced, the whole Meru county, the economy of the Meru county will be crippled,"" says Kenyan khat farmer Edward Mutuura, who exports the majority of his crops to the Nertherlands. ""The economy of the population here where khat is grown will be totally crippled and people will have no source of income,"" he adds. Read also: Agriculture's 'critical role' in Africa's future . The Dutch government cited health concerns as well as social and economic reasons for the prohibition of khat. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, khat can induce manic behaviors, hyperactivity and hallucinations while chronic abuse can result in symptoms such as physical exhaustion, violence and suicidal depression. However, some observers believe that the ban, which is expected to start later this year, has been imposed after suggestions of purported links between the international khat trade and the funding of terrorist groups like Al Shabaab -- a claim Dutch officials deny. ""There are legitimate businesses whose end product may end up in the hands of Al Shabaab, yet if governments resort to banning these businesses then it hurts the ultimate owners of these businesses,"" says analyst Emmanuel Kisiangani of the Institute of Security Studies. ""I think it is a tricky situation, it is a precarious balancing act -- governments need to think of mechanisms that ensure that these legitimate businesses don't end up benefiting these terrorist organizations."" Al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist group that controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital Mogadishu, has been battling the country's weak transitional government for years. Read also: Somali women defy danger to write basketball history . A recent U.N. report said the terrorist group, which has connections to al Qaeda, gets funds by taxing the khat exported to Somalia. Analysts believe that the khat trade in Europe may be following a similar pattern. They say some of the businessmen in Europe who act as middlemen to khat exporters and farmers could be sending the money back to Al Shabaab. ""So, ultimately, the contributors are doing this in good faith but the end result is that you have people with wrong motives along and in between who take these resources, this money, and channel it to terror organizations,"" says Kisiangani. Somalia analysts Jessica Lincoln and Frans Barnard say the use of international khat trade to fund militant activities has long been suspected by intelligence agencies but evidence is difficult to prove and remains circumstantial. They note that the Dutch ban has been driven by health, socio-economic and local political factors, along with a tougher stance on ""softer"" drugs, but add that this needs to be balanced against the security context of Somalia and the increasing prominence of Al Shabaab in recent years. ""This is of course a huge concern for the international community in their anti-terrorist operations so any suggested links to the funding of terrorist activities will demand movement for cessation of such activities or pressure to regulate,"" says Lincoln of Rubicon Resolution. Olle Schmidt, a Swedish member of the European parliament who's been raising the issue of the drug's detrimental social and health effects for many years, says that several security services have admitted that there might be a link between Al Shabaab and illegal khat trade but it is very difficult to track the cash generated by the trade and ultimately know who the end receivers are. ""They can follow the money to Dubai and then further into Somalia but then they really don't know,"" he says. In the UK, anti-khat campaigner Abukar Awale says that Al Shabaab targets vulnerable young addicts in the British-Somali community for recruitment. He says that parts of the multimillion dollar khat trade is being controlled by people ""who are very sympathetic to Al Shabaab"" and calls on the UK government to follow the Netherlands' example and ban the drug. ""In my opinion, by allowing khat to be legal, Britain is providing tools, manpower and resources to Al Shabaab,"" he says. Read also: Somali militants target addicts in UK's 'khat cafes' But back in Meru county, the khat farmers who are separated from the end user and any regulation further down the chain say that banning khat could kill off the region's economic future. ""Khat farming is the heart of the economy of this place,"" says Mutuura. ""We cannot educate our children without khat -- if we don't have khat to sell, this means our economy is grounded."" With the Kenyan government having entered talks with the Dutch government to reverse the ban on khat, the farmers hope the talks will bear fruit or their livelihood will be plucked away. ""This is only what we know in our life, nothing more,"" says Mutuura.","Khat is plant that once chewed gives a mellow high to its consumer .

"(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter has been re-elected as president of soccer's world governing body and immediately vowed to put ""FIFA's ship back on the right course in clear, transparent waters."" At FIFA's Congress in Zurich, Switzerland on Wednesday, Blatter received 186 votes from football's 208 member football associations, to serve his fourth term as president despite the race becoming engulfed by corruption allegations within the organization. Blatter's only rival for the presidency, Mohamed Bin Hammam, pulled out of the race after he was suspended by FIFA's Ethics Committee on Sunday in relation to bribery charges surrounding Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. PR guru Max Clifford: How to rescue FIFA . After Blatter's re-election was confirmed he told Congress: ""I thank you for your trust and confidence. Our pyramid is intact, the base, the foundation is strong and together we have four years to continue on our path and do our job. ""We will put FIFA's ship back on the right course in clear, transparent waters. We need some time to do it, but we shall do it. ""Today something marvelous happened and I'd simply like to tell you I'm deeply moved and honored. It's a challenge, a new one for me, and I accept it. Together we shall do it."" Was Blatter right to be defiant? Earlier in the day, 172 of the 208 delegates voted not to delay the presidential ballot despite Blatter being the only candidate. Both the football associations of England and Scotland urged FIFA not to proceed following the suspension of Bin Hammam. After the result was confirmed, FIFA voted through changes proposed by Blatter to alter the process they use to decide the host nations for future World Cups. ""I want to give more power to the national associations,"" he said. ""In the future the World Cup will be decided by the FIFA Congress. The executive committee will create a shortlist -- but will make no recommendations only a list -- and the congress will decide on the venue."" Russia and Qatar were chosen for the 2018 and 2022 events -- ahead of Spain and Portugal and the United States respectively -- in a controversial vote held in December last year which saw two executive committee members suspended for breaching ""ethical codes."" England missed out on the 2018 World Cup and had called for the ballot to be delayed. ""This has been a very damaging time for the reputation of FIFA and therefore the whole of football,"" said David Bernstein, chairman of the English Football Association. The Scottish Football Association echoed the call. ""The events of the last two days, in particular, have made any election unworkable,"" SFA head Stewart Reagan said in a statement. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame . Despite Blatter's re-election, the fallout from the corruption scandal persists. He admitted that the suspension of Bin Hammam, as well as FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, had hurt his organization. ""I am the captain weathering the storm, this is a difficult period for FIFA and I admit that readily. Not only is the pyramid shaking but our ship has drawn some water. ""We must do something because I do not want ever again that we face this undignified situation."" On Wednesday, the head of the German Football Federation said FIFA's awarding of the World Cup to Qatar should be re-examined in the wake of the ethics scandal. ""Especially regarding the awarding of the World Cup 2022 to Qatar, there has been repeated speculation and corruption allegations,"" Theo Zwanziger said in an interview posted on the league's web site Wednesday. ""From what I am reading, I have to believe that there are substantial allegations that we cannot ignore or shove aside. And therefore I must believe that the awarding of this world cup must be re examined. ""How this is to happen is something I would only like to talk about when I know more about the facts. I am coming from the outside and was not a member of the executive back then,"" he added. Zwanziger joins a growing chorus of voices critical of FIFA as the election loomed. But Zwanziger said the soccer body should not postpone Wednesday's election, a view that was shared by other powerful football organizations. Podcast: Is FIFA relevant to U.S. soccer fans? Sponsors of international soccer including Visa, Coca-Cola and Adidas have warned that the ethics scandal is hurting the sport. ""The current situation is clearly not good for the game,"" a Visa spokesman told CNN Tuesday, echoing comments from other companies that pay to have their logos at the World Cup and other major soccer events. The Visa spokesman declined to be named. ""The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA,"" Adidas chief communications officer Jan Runau said. Sponsor Emirates airlines said it was ""disappointed"" by the ""issues around the administration"" of FIFA, and Coca-Cola said Monday that the ethics allegations were ""distressing and bad for the sport."" The concerns came as Blatter shrugged off corruption allegations within FIFA and said he would press ahead with his bid to be re-elected. Blatter said Monday night that the organization was not in crisis after the FIFA ethics committee suspended top officials Jack Warner and Mohamed Bin Hammam. The latter was the only contender against Blatter for the presidency. Bin Hammam was a major influence in Qatar's surprising victory in winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup finals. He and Warner have been accused of offering cash gifts to national associations in return for pro-Bin Hammam votes in the presidential election. Warner and Bin Hammam both deny wrongdoing. FIFA is the body that decides where soccer's quadrennial World Cup will be held, among other responsibilities. CNN's David Wilkinson, Ben Wyatt, James Montague, Frederik Pleitgen and Aaron Akin contributed to this report.","NEW: Sepp Blatter re-elected as president of FIFA for a fourth term .

"(CNN)  -- Keegan Bradley beat fellow American Jason Dufner in a three-hole playoff to win the U.S. PGA Championship in Atlanta Sunday. The 25-year-old from Vermont finished one-under-par over the 16th, 17th and 18th holes at the Atlanta Athletic Club to hold off Dufner by a shot and claim his first major title. He is the seventh first-time major winner in a row, a record, and the first player from the United States since Phil Mickelson at the Masters in 2010 to lay claim to one of golf's majors. Bradley, a rookie in his first season on the PGA Tour, found his victory hard to take in, particularly as he was playing in a major for the first time, his place sealed by claiming the Byron Nelson Championship back in May. ""I can't believe it,"" he said. ""I feel so proud."" When Bradley, who is the nephew of LPGA legend Pat Bradley, triple-bogeyed the 15th in regular play, his chances looked over. He trailed Dufner, who was 11-under, by five shots with just four holes to play. But as Dufner proceeded to card three careless bogeys in a row, Bradley birdied the 16th and 17th and parred the treacherous 18th to set the clubhouse target on eight-under 272 after a 68. Dufner bravely holed out for a par on the 18th for a 69 to force the playoff but was immediately behind, as Bradley birdied the 16th. When Dufner bogeyed the 17th to fall two shots behind his challenge looked over, but he rattled home a birdie putt on the last to force Bradley to two-putt for par and a remarkable victory. Dane Anders Hansen powered through the field on the last day for a 66 to finish third on seven-under-par. Fellow Scandinavian Robert Karlsson of Sweden looked a possible winner as he got to eight-under, but a run of three bogeys dropped him into a tie for fourth with 2001 PGA winner David Toms and another American, Scott Verplank, on five under. English pair Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, respectively No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, both threatened on the final day, but mistakes cost them dear on the back nine, as they shared eighth on three-under, a shot behind last week's WGC Bridgestone winner Adam Scott of Australia. Brendan Steele, who started the day as joint overnight leader with Dufner, fell away with a 77 and ended in a large group on level par, which included Mickelson.","Keegan Bradley beats Jason Dufner in playoff to win U.S. PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer finally clinched his first Paris Masters crown Sunday after a straight-sets victory over Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. The world number four took just one hour and 26 minutes to record a 6-1 7-6 win and collect his 18th Masters Series trophy. Federer has 16 grand slam titles to his name, including the French Open in 2009, but had never previously made the final of the hard-court tournament in Paris. And the 30-year-old made light work of the opening set, saving two early break points before racing into a 5-0 lead, eventually wrapping it up in just half an hour. But the second set was a far closer affair as Tsonga forced his way back into the match and took it to a tie break. But Federer snuffed out any hope of a deciding set with an emphatic 7-3 win to move into second place on the all-time Masters Series titles list with 18, one behind Rafael Nadal. ""I'm just really ecstatic to have played so well this week from start to finish,"" Federer told the ATP Tour's official website. ""Basically from first ball struck against (Adrian) Mannarino all the way until the very end here. I couldn't be more happy. ""I have had many attempts trying to win Paris Bercy, and for some reason, I wasn't able to win it earlier. But this one obviously feels great and it's a special victory."" It was Federer's 69th career title from 99 finals and he will now take a 12-match winning streak into the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London later this month following his victory in his home event in Basel. ""I have played well for a few months now. Maybe I didn't win the U.S. Open, but we all know I was one point away from making the finals and then who knows?"" he said after becoming the first man to compete in the finals of all nine Masters Series events. ""But Novak was able to come back in that great match against me at the Open. And before that I think I had some really good moments, where I actually did play very well, such as Wimbledon and the French Open where I think more was possible, too. ""I have had some really tough losses this year, but I kept believing that still the year wasn't over, I can still finish this year on a high, which that proves to be the case. Now I still have a massive highlight coming up in a week's time."" Tsonga will move to a career-high sixth in the world rankings on Monday but he rued not being able to take advantage of the two break points he had during the opening game of the final. ""If I had played better at the start it would have changed things. The key of the match was there,"" said the 26-year-old, who beat Federer in the Wimbledon quarterfinals this year and then at the Montreal Masters before losing to the Swiss at Flushing Meadows. ""Every time we play each other it's similar. If I am able to fight back at the start, then I play well. But if I lose the first set like I did today, then it becomes more difficult for me.""","Roger Federer defeats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to clinch his first Paris Masters title .

"(CNN) -- Spanish football giants Barcelona have confirmed they have signed a huge new shirt sponsorship deal with the non-profit Qatar Foundation -- the first time they have received money to display a logo on their jerseys in the club's history. Revealing the news on their official website, the Primera Liga champions could be in line to receive up to 170 million euros ($225m) for the five-and-a-half year deal, which incorporates commercial and image rights as well as various bonuses relating to success on the field. Children's charity UNICEF has appeared on the club's shirts in recent seasons and their logo will continue to feature prominently. However, kit manufacturer Nike will now redesign the jerseys to accomodate the name of the Qatar Foundation -- an organization set up in 1995 to improve education and community development in Qatar and the surrounding region. Following the news, UNICEF released a statement, saying: ""The groundbreaking partnership between UNICEF and FC Barcelona advanced the global message on the importance of children's issues in a unique way. ""UNICEF is looking forward to the next stage of the collaboration and is exploring various options."" Barcelona also released a breakdown of how the funds will be received, with the club getting 15m euros ($20m) for the second half of the season and 30m euros ($40m) for each of the following five seasons -- with up to 5m euros ($7m) in bonuses for any titles won. The funds will provide a welcome boost for Barcelona, who have struggled financially, despite all their successes on the pitch. The Catalan club made a loss of 80m euros ($105m) last season and are reported to have debts in the region of  440m euros. The announcement also continues Qatar's increasing influence in world football following their recent winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals.","Barcelona sign a huge new shirt sponsorship deal with the non-profit Qatar Foundation .

"(CNN)  -- John Isner says his 11-hour match at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut was ""absolutely crazy"" and at one point he thought it might never end. The world number 23 from the United States has gone down in the record books as the winner of the longest match in tennis history. His epic battle with Frenchman Mahut on Court 18 at the All England Club stretched over three days and 183 games before he claimed the first round clash, 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. Isner told CNN that the first day of action on Tuesday June 22 was a ""pretty standard four-set match suspended by darkness which happens at Wimbledon."" But nothing could have prepared the man from North Carolina for the incredible events that were to unfurl in the fifth set the following day. The pair battled for over seven hours and by the time it was called off all the record books had already been re-written. ""That one set just didn't want to end, we played 118 games with no decider and we had to come back next day to finish it off,"" Isner explained to CNN. ""I think once we got to 30 (games) all I really didn't think it was going to end. ""Both of us were serving fantastic and it got to the point when we didn't want to make a mistake on our service game. ""We were still able to hit an inordinate amount of aces and every time someone got in a jam we were able to claw our way out of it. The marathon eventually ended on the Thursday afternoon as Isner finally made a breakthrough on Mahut's service at match point, but not before another 20 games had been completed. An exhausted Isner lost his second round match the next day in straight sets, but his incredible feat of endurance against Mahut will always be remembered. The 25-year-old said he had prepared for Wimbledon by training near his home in Tampa, Florida, hitting ball after ball in the blazing heat and humidity. So fit was Isner that his coach Craig Boynton had made a prophetic prediction ahead of the third grand slam of the year. ""My coach jokingly said I would be able to play for 10 hours because of the extreme conditions I was practicing in and sure enough he was right."" But the reality was both had played to the point of exhaustion and the giant Isner was suffering from agonizing blood blisters on both feet. ""It was pretty brutal, it was ugly,"" he said. After taking a well-earned break, Isner will resume play on the ATP Tour later this month as he builds up to the third grand slam of the season at the U.S. Open.","John Isner tells CNN his match against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon was 'absolutely crazy'

"(CNN) -- England clinched rugby's Six Nations title for the first time since 2003 on Saturday despite crashing to a 24-8 defeat to Ireland in the final round in Dublin. Martin Johnson's team could have been denied the crown along with the Grand Slam achievement of winning all five games, but closest rivals Wales lost 28-9 to France in the tournament's concluding match. Johnson was captain of the England team that won the European competition for the 25th time eight years ago and then went on to lift the World Cup in Australia, and he will be hoping history repeats ahead of this year's premier event in New Zealand. ""This is a scar and we'll have to wear that scar. I told the players we'll take this on the chin. We were beaten by a good team, an experienced team,"" the coach said in quotes reported by the UK Press Association. ""The boys are very disappointed because they wanted to win a Test match, and we know what was at the end of it. We had a horrible first half. We were always chasing the game. ""It summed up our day up when two of our players ended up passing straight back to them. When you're in a fight you want to feel like you've landed a few blows, but we didn't. They kept on taking shots at us."" Recalled fly-half Jonathan Sexton kicked 14 points in a man-of-the-match performance, with his four penalties and a try from winger Tommy Bowe giving Ireland a 17-3 halftime lead. Seven minutes after the restart, captain Brian O'Driscoll became the record tryscorer in Six Nations history with his 25th crossing -- and Sexton converted to make it 24-3. England's only try was a runaway intercept effort from hooker Steve Thompson, which fellow replacement Jonny Wilkinson could not convert. Wales went into the match in Paris needing to win by 27 points to finish ahead of England on countback, but the team's preparation was marred by the absence of assistant coach Shaun Edwards due to a reported incident with a fellow member of the backroom staff last weekend. Coach Warren Gatland refused to comment on the incident in his pre-game interview, saying that it was ""an internal matter."" Defending champions France finished second following two tries to forward Lionel Nallet and another to winger Vincent Clerc, while Morgan Parra kicked 13 points. Wales' only reply was three penalties to flyhalf James Hook, who was sinbinned for a dangerous tackle, as Gatland's team finished fourth behind Ireland after three teams ended with six points each. In the day's opening game, Scotland avoided the wooden spoon by beating Italy 21-8 in Edinburgh to condemn the visitors to bottom place. The tournament has been known as the Six Nations since the addition of Italy in 2000, and started out in 1883 with four teams. France joined the competition for the first time in 1910, rejoining 37 years later.","England crowned Six Nations champions despite closing defeat by Ireland .

"(~CNN)  -- World Cup winners India appointed Duncan Fletcher as their new national coach Wednesday on a two-year deal. Fletcher succeeds South African Gary Kirsten, who stepped down from the role after guiding the co-hosts to their global triumph earlier this month, beating Sri Lanka in the final. He will take the reins after India's tour of the West Indies where bowling coach Eric Simmons has been managing team affairs. The 62-year-old Fletcher coached England from 1999 to 2007, reviving their fortunes in Test cricket. It culminated in their historic 2-1 Ashes series win over Australia in 2005, but they were thrashed 5-0 by the Aussies on their home soil just 18 months later. An early exit followed in the 2007 World Cup and Fletcher resigned shortly afterwards. Former England captain Michael Vaughan, who was in charge for the Ashes  triumph in 2005, has no doubts Fletcher will be a success with India. ""Great coach who will work well with India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all the talent,"" he told his Twitter blog. But Vaughan sounded a warning about the taciturn Fletcher's relationship with journalists. ""His biggest challenge will come from the media. He has never really understood how it works!,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer fended off an audacious comeback by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to win the ATP World Tour Finals for a record sixth time in London Sunday. A pumped up Federer wrapped up a 6-3 7-6 6-3 victory over Tsonga in his 100th career final to end 2011 on a conspicuous high note. Consecutive titles in Basel, Paris, where he also beat Tsonga in the final, and at the season-ending championships have seen the Swiss maestro reclaim the No.3 spot in the world from Britain's Andy Murray. But he had to withstand a mid-match onslaught from his French opponent, who broke Federer as he served for the match at a set and 5-4 to the good. Tsonga also saved a match point in the second set tiebreaker before leveling at one set all. But as in the first set, Federer broke Tsonga again in the eighth game of the decider and made no mistake when he served for the championship for the second time. ""I couldn't be more happy my season ends this way. I'm exhausted, Jo sapped every last energy out of me today,"" Federer said. His triumph lifted the Swiss maestro out of a tie with Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras for titles at the ATP's end-of-season finale. It was his 70th career crown. It will also compensate for failing to add to his 16 grand slam crowns this season as Novak Djokovic, who failed to make it out of the round robin group stages in London, dominated with three. Rafael Nadal, who beat Federer in the final to win the French Open title, was also eliminated at that stage as he lost to Tsonga in a deciding match. Earlier, third seeds Max Mirnyi and Daniel Nestor beat the Polish pair Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski 7-5 6-3 to win the ATP World Tour Finals doubles title.","Roger Federer wins ATP World Tour Finals at O2 Arena in London .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Several thousand demonstrators took to the streets of the Spanish capital Sunday, protesting unemployment a week before voters elect a new government. The march past the world-famous Prado museum and Madrid's city hall ended at the Puerta del Sol plaza, where economic protests began last May. As riot police passed the demonstrators, protesters shouted ""Less police, more education,"" a criticism of cutbacks in education during Spain's deep economic crisis. The demonstration was smaller than one held October 15, when at least 10,000 people marched in Madrid on a day when Occupy Wall Street-style protests spread to Europe, Asia and Australia. The Spanish newspaper El Pais said tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona that day. Similar protests over the economy turned violent in Italy, with at least 70 people injured and a government building set on fire, but the Spanish demonstrations remained peaceful. Protester Esteban Guerrero, 25, who's been to a dozen protests since last May, said he was not discouraged by the smaller crowd on Sunday. ""Each demonstration is not just one more,"" Guerrero said. ""Many young people and workers take part. Some are bigger than others but what's important is that thousands turn out each time."" A journalism student in his final year of university, he said his job prospects after graduation are bleak, with the country's youth unemployment rate about 45%, twice the national average. ""It's a very precarious situation for young people in Spain, and getting worse, like it is for youth in Greece and Portugal. There's a big deterioration,"" Guerrero said. Next Sunday's election, which the opposition conservatives are expected to win, will not be enough to change things, he added. ""I think it's necessary to vote, but that's not enough. People feel the elections won't change the situation. They won't stop the cutbacks,"" he said. That's why people keep coming out onto the streets, he said.","Protesters are angry about Spain's high unemployment .

"(CNN) -- Second seed Roger Federer stayed on course for a first French Open title after coming from two sets to one down to defeat Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in another five-set epic, securing a place in Sunday's final at Roland Garros. Roger Federer screams in joy after beating Juan Martin del Potro to reach the French Open final. The Swiss world number two, bidding to complete his haul of grand slam titles, recovered from a slow start to claim a 3-6 7-6 2-6 6-1 6-4 victory in three hours and 28 minutes -- and will now meet Robin Soderling in Sunday's final. Swede Soderling, who earlier this week caused a sensation by knocking out defending champion and world number one Rafael Nadal, defeated Fernando Gonzalez 6-3 7-5 5-7 4-6 6-4 in another thrilling five-setter to continue his remarkable run in Paris. It was Federer's second five-set win this tournament -- he was also taken the distance by Tommy Haas in the fourth round -- and he has squeezed through to his fourth straight Paris final without hitting top form. Federer, installed as title favorite after Nadal's defeat, had won all his previous five meetings with Del Potro, not even dropping a set. But he was broken in the fifth and ninth games to lose the first set as Del Potro dictated the rallies, feasting off Federer's weak and short backhands. Fifth seed Del Potro played a poor second-set tie-break, sending four shots into the net to gift the Swiss the leveller, but he still held the whip hand and sped through a 36-minute third set during which he broke Federer's serve twice more. However, as the South American tired, Federer found an extra gear -- as he has done so often this past fortnight -- and suddenly began to dominate Del Potro's serve. Two breaks were sufficient to win the fourth set convincingly and he broke early in the fifth too. Del Potro grabbed one himself as the light started to fade on Philippe Chatrier court, but he double-faulted in game seven to put Federer back in front. This time, the Swiss did not falter and served out to win. Federer is now just one win away from becoming the sixth player to complete a sweep of the Majors. The title here would also move him level with Pete Sampras on a record 14 grand-slam crowns. ""That's one more step and I am so happy to have comeback like that,"" a delighted Federer told reporters. ""For a moment there Juan Martin was playing so well, but I had some luck on my side and I fought hard. ""Soderling played a great match against Gonzalez to be in the final. He deserves to be there because he also beat Nadal and he was the man to beat in this tournament.""","Roger Federer through to Sunday's final of the French Open at Roland Garros .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich clinched the Bundesliga title for a record 22nd time thanks to a 3-1 away win over relegated Hertha Berlin on the final day of the German season. Victory for the Bavarian giants -- who led the top division by three points from rivals Schalke going into the game -- came thanks to a 20th-minute opener from Ivica Olic and a second-half brace from star performer Arjen Robben. The Dutchman's double, scored at 74 and 87 minutes, took the 26-year-old to a tally of 16 goals for the season and put Louis Van Gaal's men into an unassailable lead, after Gustavo Ramos had leveled for the home side with thirty minutes left of the game. The defeat of bottom-placed Hertha also continues Bayern's pursuit of an unprecedented treble for a German side. Can Van Gaal triumph over Mourinho? The newly crowned Bundesliga champions will face Werder Bremen in the final of the domestic cup on May 15 before a showdown with Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan, in the final of the European Champions League, on May 22. ""It is important that we won here,"" Bayern coach Louis van Gaal told reporters after being drenched in beer by his celebrating players. ""We have the best defence, the best attack and deserved to be crowned Bundesliga champions. It is good that we were victorious to keep the winning rhythm. Tonight, we will celebrate in style,"" the 58-year-old added. Bayern finished the campaign on 70 points, five ahead of rivals Schalke, whose title ambitions were cut short with a 0-0 away draw to Mainz thanks to a missed penalty from Miroslav Karhan. Werder Bremen claimed a Champions League spot and a third-place finish with a 1-1 home draw against Hamburg, Ruud van Nistlerooy's 82nd-minute equalizer canceling-out the opener from Claudio Pizarro. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen -- who drew with Borussia Mochengladbach 1-1, Borussia Dortmund -- who lost 3-1 to SC Freiburg -- and Stuttgart -- who drew 1-1 with Hoffenheim -- claimed Europa League places finishing fourth, fifth and sixth respectively. Former champions Wolfsburg ended a miserable season by finishing in eighth place, but did manage to end on a win, thanks to a 3-1 victory over Frankfurt. Bochum's 3-0 home defeat to Hannover left the Rhineland-side consigned to relegation, and sealed a dramatic last-day escape for a Hannover side reeling from the loss of captain Robert Enke, Germany's number one goalkeeper who committed suicide earlier in the season. Meanwhile, Nuremberg now face a play-off with the third-placed team in the second division to try and avoid the drop after beating Cologne 1-0.","Bayern Munich clinch the Bundesliga title for a record 22nd time .

"London (CNN) -- Woody Allen famously said in ""Annie Hall"" that the only cultural advantage to Los Angeles was that you can turn right on a red light, but in truth the ""City of Angels"" is bursting with culture. World-class museums including the Getty Center, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art are must-see destinations for art-lovers, whose touring exhibitions easily rival those in London and New York. The LA Opera, directed by world-renowned tenor Placido Domingo, art fair Art Los Angeles Contemporary and LA Fashion Week are all helping cement the city's identity as one of the US's major cultural hubs -- and that's before mentioning its number one industry, Hollywood. Though difficult to navigate on foot, the city is a wonder of small communities, intriguing local landmarks and remnants of Hollywood's golden age. CNN World's Treasures selects some of the best spots to experience the cultural side of Los Angeles, from galleries to historic landmarks. SEE: Commercial galleries have sprung up all over the city in the last decade, boasting impressive exhibitions of local and international contemporary art. Artists such as Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Chris Burden and the late Dennis Hopper have put the city firmly on the map but it was established as an important hub in the 1960s, when the Ferus Gallery famously showed Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans. Today, galleries are concentrated on La Cienega, Wilshire and Washington Boulevards and spaces to visit include Blum and Poe, credited with bringing the work of Japanese artist Takashi Murakami to the US, and David Kordansky. Also on any art-lover's itinerary is Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills -- in January the gallery is showing work by UK artist Damien Hirst. Meanwhile, take a tour of the city's major museums; head to the Museum of Contemporary Art and enjoy its current exhibition of work by photographer and fashion designer Hedi Slimane. Or take your time and wander through Chris Burden's installation ""Urban Light"" at the Los Angeles County Museum, and peruse the permanent collections at the Getty Center and the Hammer Museum at UCLA. Currently the Getty and Hammer are staging exhibitions celebrating the city's artistic innovations since World War II, among a number of other institutions. VISIT: If you are feeling foot-sore from your travels around the city's art institutions, rent a car and drive to the Watts Towers, a weird and wonderful labor of love built by Italian immigrant Simon Rodia between the 1920s the 1950s. These strange spiral towers, made of scrap, steel and cement and decorated with bits of bottle and seashells, have been an inspiration to artists ever since they were built. The site is now managed by the Watts Towers Art Center, which also stages an annual jazz festival. Los Angeles's other architectural highlights include Pierre Koenig's Case Study House No. 22, which overlooks the city; LA-based starchitect Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown LA; Anderton Court Shops, a small shopping mall near Rodeo Drive designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; and the Eames House in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. TOUR: No trip to LA would be complete without a tour of Hollywood's key hot-spots: Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Beverly Hills. Alternatively, take a spin around famous movie locations such as Mulholland Drive, Sunset Boulevard and Chinatown on your own tour. Los Angeles also has a rich literary history, and the city features as a sometimes glittering, often shady, backdrop to classic noir fictions by Raymond Chandler and John Fante. Even F. Scott Fitzgerald penned his own eulogy to the city in the unfinished ""The Last Tycoon,"" which he wrote while working as a script-writer there in the 1930s. For those looking for something a little more highbrow than the usual Hollywood tour, look no further than Esotouric's literary tours of the city, which cover the neighborhoods and landmarks featured in the novels of Chandler, Fante and Charles Bukowski, allowing you to walk in the footsteps of Philip Marlowe or Arturo Bandini. STAY: A perennial favorite among celebrities and visitors to the city is the Chateau Marmont, which featured as the real set for Sofia Coppola's recent film ""Somewhere."" Modeled on a castle in France's Loire Valley, the Chateau Marmont has for years been a hideaway for celebrities behaving badly and a haven for Europhiles, and its popularity continues to grow. Even if you're not staying, you can sip a languid cocktail in the beautifully-designed Bar Marmont.","Though often disparaged, LA is bursting with culture, from galleries to museums to historic landmarks .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich produced a spirited fight back to knock 10-man Manchester United out of Europe's Champions League and set up a semifinal against Lyon. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, United raced into a 3-0 lead, but goals from Ivica Olic and Arjen Robben saw Bayern progress on the away goals rule as the tie finished 4-4 on aggregate. English Premier League champions United were in control until the sending-off of Rafael Da Silva early in the second half handed Bayern the initiative and Robben's stunning volley was worthy of winning any match. United manager Alex Ferguson sprung a surprise before kick-off by naming Wayne Rooney in his starting line-up just eight days after the England striker twisted his ankle during the first leg. Rooney landed awkwardly on the same ankle after 20 minutes and seemed to struggle for mobility before he was replaced after 55 minutes. It was one of Ferguson's other surprise inclusions who opened the scoring. Darron Gibson, selected ahead of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, picked up Rooney's pass and fired a shot past the unsighted Bayern goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt. Four minutes later, United were 2-0 ahead as Antonio Valencia crossed for Nani to score with a sublime backheel. The German Bundesliga leaders almost leveled the aggregate score when Olic's shot was smothered by United goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar. Moments later, United went 3-0 up as Valencia's low cross was smashed into the roof of the net by Nani. Bayern were given a lifeline before half-time when Croatian striker Olic shrugged off Michael Carrick and fired past Van der Sar from a narrow angle. United were reduced to 10 men early in the second half when Rafael received a second yellow card for a foul on Franck Ribery. Nani and Darren Fletcher both went close for United before Van der Sar produced a fine reflex save to keep out Ribery's effort. United seemed content to soak up Bayern pressure but their resistance was broken by a moment of individual brilliance from Robben. Ribery's corner picked out the former Chelsea winger on the edge of the area and his volley arrowed past Van Der Sar and into the bottom corner. Ferguson threw on Dimitar Berbatov and Ryan Giggs in pursuit of a winner but Bayern kept possession with ease to see out a victory that went some way to avenging their defeat to United in the 1999 final. The defeat capped a miserable few days for United, who lost 2-1 to Chelsea on Saturday to fall two points behind the Londoners in the race for the Premier League title. ""The key thing was losing a goal just before half time and the young boy getting sent off,"" Ferguson told ITV1. ""It took an exceptional goal to win the tie - it was a fine strike by Robben."" Lyon went into their all-French quarterfinal with Bordeaux carrying a 3-1 lead from the first leg. But striker Marouane Chamakh gave Laurent Blanc's side hope when he bundled home on the stroke of half-time. Bordeaux pressed for a goal that would have taken them through, and Lyon were grateful to goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who produced a one-handed save to keep out Wendel's header. The home side held on for a 1-0 defeat that saw them progress 3-2 on aggregate.","Bayern Munich knock Manchester United out of the Champions League.

"(CNN) -- Argentina's unseeded Gisela Dulko caused an upset on Centre Court with a battling win over former champion Maria Sharapova. Gisela Dulko of Argentina celebrates beating Maria Sharapova of Russia at Wimbledon. The 24-year-old fought through the nerves to complete a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory to seal her place in the third round and dump one of the biggest names in women's tennis out of the championships. Though the Russian Sharapova, who won the grass-based grand slam in 2004, was seeded 24 for Wimbledon due to her season blighted by a shoulder injury, the result was still an upset. The 24-year-old South American, who has reached the third round on three previous occasions at Wimbledon, now faces another Russian in her next match in the form of tenth seed Nadia Petrova who beat Dulko's doubles partner Shahar Peer of Israel 6-3, 6-2 to go through. ""It is the most important tournament in the world for me,"" she said in a court side interview after the match. ""It's been a great day and I feel really happy - I didn't play very good in one game and with players like Maria, you know she will take her chances. ""But in the third set I just kept on fighting - I was really nervous at the end and just wanted to finish the match as the winner - and now I'm so happy."" The crowd at the British venue warmed to the plucky Argentinean as the game wore on, a factor that Dulko said helped her to victory: ""The crowd were fantastic with me and I'm really grateful."" Elsewhere, Serena Williams powered to victory brushing aside Australia's Jarmila Groth in a 6-2, 6-1 win. The second seed American will meet either Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia or Italy's Roberta Vinci in the third round. Progression was also ensured for Japan's Ai Sugiyama with a 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 victory over Spanish qualifier Arantxa Parra Santonja. The 33-year-old Sugiyama, who is ranked 38 in the world, recorded her previous best at the event in a quarter final appearance in 2004 and will now face Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova who beat China's Zheng Jie. Zheng failed to match her previous Wimbledon high of reaching the semifinals in 2008 falling to a 6-3, 7-5 defeat. Meanwhile, in the other results from Day Three, eight seed Victoria Azarenka of Bulgaria thrashed Romania's Ioana Raluca Olaru 6-0, 6-0.

"(CNN) -- Christine Lagarde is set to take over as the head of the International Monetary Fund Tuesday, the first woman to to run the influential financial institution. Lagarde, who was the finance minister of France, takes over at a crucial time for the IMF as the organization is working closely with the European Union and the European Central Bank to provide financial support for troubled European economies. Lagarde will serve a five-year term as the global financial institution's managing director and chairman, the IMF said. ""I am deeply honored by the trust placed in me by the Executive Board,"" Lagarde said in a statement last week. She succeeds Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was arrested earlier this year in New York on sexual assault charges. The only other contender for the job was Mexican Central Bank chief Agustin Carstens, who was supported by Australia, Canada and Mexico. The IMF said it selected Lagarde, last week, by a consensus vote. Lagarde was also backed by the United Kingdom, Germany and most European powers, as well as some Asian and African nations. The IMF, which is made up of 187 member countries, has traditionally been led by a Western European official. Some developing nations had pushed to break that tradition, arguing that the IMF should consider candidates from rising economic powers in Asia and South America. Lagarde, 55, had been French President Nicolas Sarkozy's finance minister since June 2007. She also served as the country's to foreign trade official. A lawyer by training, Lagarde was a partner at the international law firm of Baker & McKenzie before going into politics. According to her official biography, Lagarde was born in Paris to school teachers and has two children of her own. She was a member of the French national synchronized swimming team and was inducted into the nation's Legion of Honor in 2000.","The top job was left open by Dominique Strauss-Kahn's resignation .

"(CNN) -- World number one Dinara Safina's wait for her first grand slam title continues, after she was beaten in straight sets by compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final of the French Open at Roland Garros. Kuznetsova kisses the French Open trophy after her comprehensive victory over Dinara Safina. Safina, who has reached the top of the world rankings despite not having a major title to her name, looked completely out-of-sorts against her fellow-Russian, who secured a comfortable 6-4 6-2 victory in just over an hour. The defeat was a crushing blow to Safina, who has long had to contend with the accusations that she is not a worthy world number one, and this third grand slam final defeat will do nothing to silence the doubters. It was the second straight year she has lost in the final here, after going down in straight sets to Ana Ivanovic of Serbia last year. It was also her second successive grand slam final defeat having lost to Serena Williams in the Australian Open in Melbourne earlier this year. Seventh seed Kuznetsova, 23, was collecting her second grand slam title following her victory over another Russian, Elena Dementieva, in the final of the 2004 U.S Open. The victory also atoned for Kuznetsova's 2006 final defeat to Justine Henin. ""It was so many years since I won a grand slam and I thought it would never happen again,"" Kuznetsova said in a court-side interview after her victory. ""Today when I was coming onto the court I knew everything was going to be fine. It was the same as when I won the U.S. Open,"" she added. In cold, damp and overcast conditons, Safina started strongly, breaking her opponent to win the opening game. However, she quickly relinquished that advantage by dropping her first service game, that included a double fault and two unforced errors. Both players had trouble holding their serves in an edgy opening set and at 4-5 down, Safina dropped the set when hitting a forehand into the net. Kuznetsova held serve to open the second set and games went with serve until the sixth game when a sixth double fault gave Kuznetsova the edge. She broke for the fourth time in the match shortly after when Safina blasted a forehand wide and long. Kuznetsova held serve to make it 5-2 and then her pressure on the Safina serve paid dividends again with a seventh double fault on match point. Despite the result, Kuznetsova said she believed Safina was a worthy world number one. ""She's done so well, and she's number one so she's a better player than me at the moment,"" Kuznetsova said on Eurosport. ""Today she was tired and had so much pressure on her but I want to wish her the best of luck for the future.""","Svetlana Kuznetsova beats Dinara Safina in final of the French Open in Paris .

"Monterrey, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have arrested a former soccer star whom they accuse of using his social status to help a kidnapping gang track down information about potential victims, officials said. Omar Ortiz, known as ""The Cat,"" played for the Rayados de Monterrey before the Mexican Football League suspended him in April 2010 after he allegedly tested positive for steroid use. A security spokesman in Nuevo Leon state said Saturday that the former goalkeeper had been working with a kidnapping gang for more than a year. The gang was responsible for at least 20 kidnappings, spokesman Jorge Domene told reporters, including the abduction and release of pop singer Gloria Trevi's husband. Trevi has not spoken publicly about the alleged kidnapping, which was widely reported in Mexican media. In addition to Ortiz, authorities presented three other alleged members of the gang to the media Saturday, but said seven other suspects remained at large.

Pep Guardiola's team went into the match needing a just a point after second-placed arch-rivals Real Madrid kept the race alive with a 4-0 win against Getafe on Tuesday. With head-to-head records taken into account, Barca cannot be caught after beating Real 5-0 in November and drawing the second Clasico clash 1-1 last month.

But Felipe Caicedo pounced on a defensive error to equalize four minutes before halftime, slotting into the empty net after Gerard Pique missed his attempted clearance to leave goalkeeper Victor Valdes stranded. Lionel Messi almost netted his 32nd league goal this season in the 58th minute after a trademark solo run saw him squeeze past four players, but the two-time world player of the year's low shot rebounded to safety off the inside of the post.

Barca went 31 games undefeated, one short of Real Sociedad's record, with 16 successive victories from round seven. While Messi has grabbed the headlines with 52 goals in all competitions, Barca's all-attacking style has seen 22 players hit the net in a total of 92 scored -- with only 20 conceded.

"Rome (CNN) -- A crooked Somali cop may have been the one who made the kidnapping of two foreign aid workers in October possible, the safety adviser for their employer told CNN. U.S. military forces rescued Jessica Buchanan, 32, and Poul Thisted, 60, on Wednesday after they spent three months in captivity. Now in Sicily, the aid workers are to be reunited with their spouses. Buchanan and Thisted were traveling in Somalia as workers for the Danish Refugee Council at the time of their kidnapping. Fredrik Palsson, the group's global safety adviser, revealed new details about how the pair were captured. Nongovernmental organizations such as Danish Refugee Council are required to have security while traveling in certain parts of Somalia. The Somali government provides protection, not private security companies, Palsson said. Known as special protection units, these guards operate only in specific areas, and so aid workers must change vehicles and switch guards when they cross from one region to the next, he said. ""What happened was that one of the guards, he was sold out, and he had as a mission: to capture expatriates,"" Palsson said. The kidnappers paid off one officer, who replaced the regular guards with others who were in on the corruption, he said. ""And as they came close to the changeover position, then they were stopped, and then they were moved into other vehicles and they were driven away,"" he said. Meanwhile, the U.S. military said that the two rescued aid workers need time out of the media spotlight to recover. The workers' health and welfare are the top priority, the military statement said, appealing to journalists to respect the privacy of the freed hostages and their families. ""It is extremely important that they have the chance to decompress from this event without the pressure of instant overwhelming public notoriety,"" it said. In a joint statement issued through the Danish Refugee Council, Buchanan's and Thisted's families expressed relief the two were rescued unharmed. ""We are grateful for all the efforts that have been put into getting them safely back to us and for the fact that a very difficult chapter in our lives is over,"" it said. ""We need to look ahead now, and it is going to take time for us all to adjust and to return to normal life. We would like to thank all media for having respected our needs for privacy, and we request for everyone to continue to show us this respect and to give us time and privacy, which is all we need now."" The reintegration process allows the Defense Department to gather critical information while taking care of the freed captives, the military said. ""The process ensures returnees have the best chance to return to their previous lives following this significant event,"" it said. The two hostages were freed in a dramatic overnight rescue operation. U.S. special operations forces parachuted into Somalia from airplanes early Wednesday, advanced on foot to a compound where the two kidnapped workers were being held and then freed them, U.S. officials said. The nine gunmen holding the hostages were killed, officials said. The kidnappers seized Buchanan and Thisted on October 25 in the central Somali town of Galkayo after they visited humanitarian projects there, the Danish Refugee Council said. Neither was harmed, the aid group said. Buchanan's father, John, was to go to Sicily to see her, CNN learned. She will be returned to the United States when she wants, probably in a U.S. military aircraft. Somalia's transitional government welcomed the U.S. military operation. The rescue ""is a great joy to the Somali government and to all Somalis as well as to all right thinking people everywhere,"" the government said in a statement. ""Hitting them hard is the only language kidnappers of innocent people, pirates and terrorists understand, and every opportunity should be taken to wipe out this scourge from our country."" The new U.N. envoy to Somalia -- the first permanent U.N. representative there in 17 years -- also expressed understanding about the military operation. ""If negotiations fail, all means must be applied, including rescue operations,"" Augustine Mahiga said Thursday, even as he urged that lives be protected ""on both sides."" Thisted's sister and brother-in-law wept for joy when they heard he had been rescued, the brother-in-law, Svend Rask, told Denmark's TV2. ""She was overjoyed when she told us what happened,"" Rask said, speaking of the daughter who gave them the news. The Navy SEAL unit that killed Osama bin Laden last year in Pakistan participated in the rescue mission, a U.S. official said, without specifying whether any of the same individuals were on both assaults. The SEALs are part of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, formerly known as SEAL Team Six. The area where the hostages were seized is known as a hub for pirates, rather than an area of Islamic militant activity. Somalia Report, a website that tracks piracy statistics, said more than $150 million was paid out in ransoms in 2011. Successful pirate attacks on merchant vessels began to drop off in 2011 in face of improved shipping security -- including on board armed security detachments -- and stronger action from the foreign navies patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. The International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy, said the number of attacks had risen but the success rate had plummeted to 12% in the first nine months of 2011. The aid workers were part of the Danish Refugee Council's de-mining unit, which aims to make civilians safe from land mines and unexploded ordnance. Buchanan has been employed as a regional education adviser with the mine clearance unit since May; Thisted, a community safety manager with the de-mining unit, has been working in Somaliland and Somalia since June 2009. CNN's Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell and Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","NEW: Danish Refugee Council official says bribed guard made kidnapping possible .

The Syrian Observatory's Rami Abdul Rahman said another 40 civilians were killed the same day ""across Syria during house-to-house raids, arrests, and clashes between army defectors and the Syrian army."" ""Monday may have been a day with the highest death toll in Syria, between 100 and 110 killed in total,"" he said. The Syrian government maintains that it is cracking down on armed terrorists who attack security forces and civilians. The activists say the government's brutal crackdown against peaceful protests has led to the deaths. CNN could not independently verify the allegations because Syria restricts the activity of journalists in the country, and the Syrian government did not immediately respond to the claim. Tuesday, the LCC said 59 people were killed in Idlib, with another 14 in Homs, three in Hama and two in Daraa. All had been shot to death by government forces, the group said. The uprising against the Bashar al-Assad regime has claimed an estimated 5,000 lives since March, the United Nations says. As violence raged on Tuesday, state television announced that the government will execute anyone who participates in terrorist acts or distributes weapons. A new law published Tuesday specifies that anyone who distributes weapons for the purpose of committing terrorist acts will get the death penalty, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. It also mandates a life sentence of hard labor for weapons smugglers who intend to traffic them for terrorist acts. Monday's deaths came the same day that Syria signed an Arab League proposal aimed at ending the violence. The Arab League expelled Syria over its crackdown. The signing came just days after the Cairo-based group of Arab nations warned it could ask the U.N. Security Council to intervene in the restive country. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem announced Monday that Damascus had signed the deal, insisting: ""We want a political solution. I do not want the killings to go on."" On Tuesday, permanent members of the Arab League met in Cairo, saying they welcomed the signing of the proposal. Members also stressed ""the emphasis and the paramount importance of the commitment of the Syrian government to fully implement"" the accord. Syrian opposition leader Burhan Ghalioun was not impressed by the signing of the agreement. ""The Syrian regime is playing games and wants to buy time. We are quite surprised that the Arab League is allowing this to take place,"" the head of the Syrian National Council said Monday in comments on Orient TV from Tunisia. Separately, Ghalioun urged the international community to enforce a buffer zone to protect civilians. Council members meeting in Tunisia declined to say whether they would support the use of foreign military force to enforce such a zone, but stressed their belief that international intervention is necessary. ""This regime has proven time and time again that it is a regime built on lies and force,"" Ghalioun told CNN. ""We need a safety zone to protect and prevent efforts by the regime to transform the crisis into a civil conflict."" Five Arab League ministers drafted a resolution Saturday calling for the end of violence and approving an observer mission in Syria. World powers have denounced the Syrian government's activity, saying they are looking for ways to rein in violence and urgently contain the threat of civil war that is reflected in the emergence of the armed defector force. CNN's Rima Maktabi and Journalists Taylor Luck and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: The opposition reports 78 killed, most in Idlib .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon said he is set to meet with Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday in an attempt to persuade Libya's embattled ruler to step down. Weldon will also meet with Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim, the Republican from Pennsylvania said in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV. Weldon said that in addition to Gadhafi's resignation, he is proposing a cease-fire on both sides; a withdrawal of government forces from key cities; no further advances by rebel forces; a joint interim government run by Libya's current prime minister and the an opposition leader; unfettered humanitarian access; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include American, Middle Eastern, European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya. As far as the Gadhafi family, Weldon's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son, Saif, to stand in elections. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was once thought of as a leading reformer in the Libyan government, but the 38-year-old has become one of his father's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest. In an opinion piece written for The New York Times, Weldon said, ""I've met (Moammar Gadhafi) enough times to know that it will be very hard to simply bomb him into submission."" He said he was in Libya at the invitation of Gadhafi and that U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is aware of the trip. CNN did not immediately get a response late Tuesday night from the U.S. State Department or the White House about Weldon's trip. In 2004, Weldon led a congressional delegation to Tripoli and met privately with Gadhafi after the Libyan leader renounced terrorism in an effort to establish warmer ties with the West. Weldon said in his opinion piece Wednesday that he traveled in 2004 to support Gadhafi's decision to give up Libya's nuclear weapons program, though neither he nor the White House wanted to support Gadhafi himself. Weldon told CNN in 2004 that he had 14 meetings with ""everyone in the administration"" and toured a nuclear complex. Libya remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle rebel fighters demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year-rule. Weldon's proposal also suggests free elections within 12 months overseen by the United Nations, according to reporter Larry Mendte of WPIX-TV who traveled with Weldon to Libya. CNN's Nic Robertson in Tripoli contributed to this report .","Curt Weldon's proposals include a cease-fire on both sides, a joint interim government .

"BASLE, Switzerland (CNN)  -- Russia joined Germany and Turkey in the semifinals of Euro 2008 with a 3-1 upset win over the Netherlands after extra time in Basle on Saturday night. Roman Pavlyuchenko scored the Russian opener in Basle. Goals in the second half of added time from substitute Dmitri Torbinski and the magical Andrei Arshavin capped a triumphant night for the Russians. Roman Pavlyuchenko put Guus Hiddink's men ahead in the the 56th minute and they looked to be going through in normal time until Ruud van Nistelrooy stole an 86th minute equalizer for the Dutch. Hiddink's men will face either Italy or Spain in the last four after confounding the form book to put out the Dutch. Marco van Basten's team had gone into the quarterfinal match off the back of three convincing victories, but failed to reproduce their captivating football of the group stages and could have no complaints about the outcome. Dutchman Hiddink had said he would be considered a trator if he masterminded their downfall but paid compliments to his team who have been transformed since a 4-1 defeat to Spain in their opening match. ""I don't know how far we have come since our preparation for the first match but usually the Dutch are a team who one cannot outdo tactically, technically or physically, but we did on all three counts,"" Hiddink told ITV Sport. ""Of course we realised we couldn't give away too many freekicks to them but as you get tired you tend to commit more fouls. ""However, my players responded really well and instead of relying on the counterattack they pressed for the winning goal."" Russia were the more enterprising side from the start at the St. Jakob Park Stadium and striker Pavlyuchenko headed over when unmarked from an Igor Semshov cross. The Dutch may not have been producing the free flowing football of their qualifying group but offered a threat at set pieces with Rafael van der Vaart producing a curling effort from the right which van Nistelrooy should have converted. Both sides were relying on the counter attack in a cagey tactical affair and just after the half hour mark a classic Russian break saw Arshavin bear down on the Dutch goal to send in a low curler which Edwin van der Sar tipped around the post. Manchester United keeper van der Sar had to use all his near two meter height to tip over a thunderous effort from defender Denis Kolodin from the ensuing corner. Moments later Kolodin sent in another long range effort from fully 40 meters which nearly dipped under the crossbar. Van Nistelrooy was generally kept quiet in the first half but his sharp turn and shot from the right had to be neatly saved by Igor Akinfeev while Kolodin nearly handed the Dutch the opener near half-time as his sloppy pass found van der Vaart who shot straight at the Russian keeper. The second half was 11 minutes old when Arshavin found Sergei Semak whose cross from the right was neatly turned in by Pavlyuchenko. The Dutch keeper then had to be alert to keep out Pavlyuchenko for a second goal and Russia looked to be holding on for victory until van Nistelrooy struck in typical style with five minutes remaining. His tireless Real Madrid teammate Wesley Sneijder swung in a free kick from the left which the striker converted from close range at the far post. Extra time again saw the Russians pressing with the most menace and in the first period Pavlyuchenko hit the crossbar with a snap shot. The Russians kept pouring forward against a tiring Dutch side and Arshavin escaped down the left to send over a teasing cross which Torbinski turned in at the far post. Arshavin fittingly sealed victory as he received the ball from a throw-in and somehow beat van der Sar at the near post. ""We didn't play football, and never got into the game,"" van Basten admitted after the final whistle. ""Normally we should have been in better shape than the Russians. We didn't see that,"" he told the Associated Press.","Russia beat Netherlands 3-1 after extra time in Euro 2008 quarterfinal .

"New York (CNN) -- The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, prompted the U.S. to take sensible security measures and launch a justified counterattack against al Qaeda, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. But he says they also led to an overreaction that continues today. Zakaria argues the organization behind the attacks, al Qaeda, has been greatly diminished by the U.S. response to 9/11 and by growing opposition to the group in the Muslim world: . ""All these trends have worked to further diminish the threat al Qaeda poses to us. We're in a strange situation where the right doesn't want to acknowledge it because it would suggest we don't need to be in quite this much of a war footing and ... the left seems reluctant to accept some of this because it suggests that, God forbid, George W. Bush might have done something right. ""As a result of our political dysfunction, we have lost the ability to have a rational conversation about 9/11,"" Zakaria said. The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: Is the U.S. safer today than before 9/11? Fareed Zakaria: There's no question we're safer. Look, 9/11 changed the way in which we viewed the problem of terrorism and Islamic radicalism, and we've gotten attentive to both. First of all, there have been huge measures taken -- a series of very simple, sensible measures that decrease the likelihood of anything like 9/11 happening. Sealing the cockpit door, by itself, means that a plane can never be used as a missile and things like that ... the security measures have made it much more difficult for high-value targets to be vulnerable in quite the way they were. The second part is that we have gone after these al Qaeda and associated groups quite vigorously, chasing them around the mountains of Afghanistan of course but also tracking their money. And those things collectively have made a big difference, and there's no question in my mind, we're safer. Now we can begin to ask ourselves whether we have overdone the countermeasures, whether the tens of billions of dollars that have been added year after year to the intelligence budget, to the Homeland Security budget have been all necessary or are we on a kind of autopilot where no request for homeland security can ever be denied, and it has become part of the gargantuan pork barrel projects in Washington. CNN: You've written that we've overreacted to 9/11 and al Qaeda. In what way do you think that's the case? Zakaria: I mean it in two senses. We didn't spend a lot of time in the year after 9/11 -- once we had taken it on, once we had started chasing these people around the world, measures which I strongly supported then and still strongly support -- whether that had been effective and whether we had broken up the organization and made it far more difficult for them to operate. And therefore, what was the real nature of the threat going forward? I think it's clear that al Qaeda is a much-diminished force. It has the power to inspire a series of local organizations around the world, but it has very little power to direct these high-profile terrorist attacks itself. The reaction to my point that al Qaeda is weaker than we think has surprised me only because I've made this point since 2004, and I've made it repeatedly. CNN: Why do you think many people have not agreed with that point? Zakaria: I do think we have a tendency in the United States to underestimate the evil intentions of our enemies, but overestimate their capacity, their capabilities. What we now know, based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and '80s, the U.S. was massively overestimating the military capacity of the Soviet Union. CNN: In what way? Zakaria: If you look at every measure, from bombers to missiles, on almost every count, we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize, their capacity to build up, and as a result we had created a much, much larger military-industrial complex than would have been necessary to combat the actual Soviet threat rather than the one we perceived. Similarly with Saddam Hussein, the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, which proved to be largely untrue. When we look at al Qaeda, we have to ask ourselves: What is their actual capacity to inflict harm? The second sense in which I mean it is I do think there is a tendency within the American appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security. Nobody wants to deny the request for more security, more measures, more procedures, all of which come with more budgets, more bureaucrats ... CNN: So what should be done now? Zakaria: This would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves, in order to combat the actual threat that al Qaeda poses, which is real but which is limited in some senses -- what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need, what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating, reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer. We now have 15 different intelligence agencies, we have 15 different organizations tracking the money that terrorists are moving around. It's almost as though we took the entire Cold War bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats, we just layered on top of the mountains of Cold War bureaucracy another set of mountains of terrorism bureaucracy, never mind that the Cold War is over ... This is not a way to run a serious national security policy. And the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the Cold War, unlike World War II, this is not a war that has a clean ending, so you cannot set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus. This is a kind of existential reality that the United States has to deal with, the possibility of terrorism, the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society, so we've got to ask ourselves is this the normal national security state we want to live with. CNN: Was the concept of a ""war on terror"" mistaken? Zakaria: I don't know if I would quibble with it that much. ... The problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic, you can't declare war against a tactic. But in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world, we needed to track their money. I have no problem with any of that ... the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent, and if you think he's 25 feet tall vs. five feet tall, that's important. That's a huge misdiagnosis of the problem ... CNN: Why do you think people have missed the change in al Qaeda's capabilities? Zakaria: We're not looking at trends within the Islamic world where al Qaeda has been politically discredited, trends that are taking place within the jihadi community, where prominent jihadis have broken with al Qaeda. The reality is that al Qaeda has been unable to organize a single attack [against a major target in recent years], the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals, further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing al Qaeda and its associated groups. CNN: Nine years after 9/11, why is the debate about Islam and terrorism fiercer than it's ever been? Zakaria: What's more strange is that it feels as though it's a debate that's taking place without the intervening nine years. Sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002, without noticing all these trends that I've been describing. 9/11 was a wake-up call for America, but it also was a wake-up call for a lot of people in the Muslim world. In the early months after 9/11, and I wrote about this at the time, there was a sense in the Muslim world that while they might not have approved of the attacks, they understood the anti-Americanism that lay behind it. That kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for Islamic radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years. CNN: Why has radicalism lost support? Zakaria: People who felt that way in Indonesia, in Jordan, even in Palestine have realized that these guys [al Qaeda] are as opposed to the secular regimes of Indonesia, Jordan and in the Palestinian Authority as they are to the United States and when they attack Indonesia and Jordan, they kill innocent Indonesians and Jordanians, innocent Muslims by the way. That reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about Islamic extremism that has been very important. I should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there's no question, and the polling data make this clear, the number of fatwas issued against al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden make this clear -- there has been a huge shift in the Muslim world over the last nine years. CNN: Finally, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is reaffirming his plans to proceed with Cordoba House, the controversial Islamic center near ground zero. What do you think of that? Zakaria: This is to be a community center that will have a swimming pool, meeting rooms, athletic facilities, modeled after the 92nd Street Y. It will have Jews and Christians and Muslims on its board, it will have prayer rooms for Jews and Christians as well as Muslims. It will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage interfaith dialogue. Now to me that sounds like precisely the American answer to Muslim radicalism, to affirm a Muslim-led process of interfaith dialogue, of tolerance for other religions ... the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together, this is such an American response to intolerance, extremism and violence. It is about inclusion, dialogue and respect for other faiths.","9/11 led U.S. to strike back at al Qaeda and take smart measures, says Fareed Zakaria .

"(CNN) -- World Cup holders Italy came back from a goal behind to secure an unconvincing 1-1 draw with Paraguay in their opening Group F match. The South Americans took a deserved lead after 39 minutes through Antolin Alcaraz's header but an error from goalkeeper Justo Villar gifted Daniele De Rossi the equalizer in the second half. Italy improved as the game wore on but failed to force a winning goal amid driving rain at the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town. They will have to raise their performance level if they are to match Brazil's tally of five World Cups in South Africa. ""I just regret that we did not get the points we deserved, but sometimes that's what happens, you get less than you deserve,"" Italy coach Marcelo Lippi told AFP. ""The important thing is this was not a decisive game. What is important is that people now realise we are here and have got our act together."" As has become characteristic in this tournament, the opening exchanges were extremely cautious with both sides limited to shots from distance. Paraguay opened Italy up with a sharp counter-attack after 21 minutes, the ball breaking to Aureliano Torres on the edge of the area, but he dragged his shot wastefully wide. Perhaps unsurprisingly the opening goal came from a set piece, with Alcaraz jumping above Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro and De Rossi to meet Torres's free-kick with a firm header into the corner. Italy appeared relieved when the half-time whistle arrived having struggled to cope with Paraguay's pressing game and spent much of the time bickering with each other or the referee. The defending champions were forced into a change at the break with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon replaced by Federico Marchetti. Italy raised the tempo of the game in the second half and Simone Pepe almost converted a fine cross from Gianluca Zambrotta. But the South Americans remained a danger on the break and Enrique Vera should have done better with a shot which found the side netting. With the game seemingly drifting away, Italy coach Marcelo Lippi made a crucial change, bringing on Mauro Camoranesi and reverting from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 system. The rethink energized Italy and their equalizer arrived just after the hour mark. A corner kick from the left flew over the outstretched fist of Villar, leaving de Rossi with a simple tap-in on the volley. Villar was a busy man for the rest of the game, pulling off saves from Pepe and Riccardo Montolivo as Italy pressed for a winner but Paraguay held on for a creditable draw. ""We played this game equally against the current world champions,"" Paraguay coach Gerardo Martini told AFP. ""To play against such a rival with such skills is a very good sign for us. It gives is a lot of confidence going ahead in this tournament.""

"(CNN) -- Congolese side TP Mazembe Englebert became the first African team to clinch a place in FIFA's Club World Cup final after a stunning victory over Brazilian giants Internacional. Goals from Mulota Kubangu and Dioko Kaluyituka secured a 2-0 win for Mazembe in Abu Dhabi  and handed them a shot at being crowned world champions in Saturday's final. They become the first team from outside Europe or South America to reach the showpiece final and will face the winners of Wednesday's clash between Italian and European champions Inter Milan and Asian Champions League holders Seongnam Ilhwa FC, from Korea. Mazembe's coach, Lamine N'Diaye, told FIFA's website: ""It's something special for us. We are here to represent Africa, and all of Africa will be proud of our work. ""We believed in ourselves, we were confident and you could see that when we started attacking, especially at the start of the second half. We were lucky too, and don't forget that our goalkeeper was excellent -- he was like a magician! ""We have succeeded and shown that our players are of a high standard. We have achieved a great victory. It's very good for this team and for the Congolese people, and every African should be proud of this team."" There was no hint of the shock to come in the opening stages of the game at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium as Internacional passed their way round their opponents and created a host of chances. But the Brazilian side, who were crowned world champions after beating Spanish giants Barcelona back in 2006, couldn't find a way past Mazembe goalkeeper Muteba Kidiaba. Kidiaba made superb saves from Rafael Sobis and Indio before Tinga wasted the best chance for Internacional, heading over from seven yards. But the Congolese outfit were a different proposition in the second half and took just eight minutes to find the net. Collecting Amia Ekanga's pass, Kubangu smashed a perfect volley into the far corner, sparking wild scenes of celebration. Kidiaba was again called upon to deny Sobis just before the hour mark, following it with another brilliant stop as Giuliano bore down on goal. But as Internacional pressed for an equalizer late in the game, Mazembe caught them on the break as Kaluyituka's 20-yard effort crept inside the post. Internacional's coach, Celso Roth, said: ""It was time for Africa to reach the final and unfortunately it has been at our expense. There's no dishonor in that -- African football is improving all the time and I don't see anything shameful in losing to an African team. We never underestimated them -- they really deserved to be at this stage, they defended very well and took their chances.

"(CNN) -- AC Milan clinched their first Serie A title since 2004 on Saturday night as they drew 0-0 with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. The draw means that Milan now have an unassailable nine-point lead at the top of the table. Even if Inter managed to finish level on points, Milan's superior head-to-head record against them this season means they cannot be beaten. The league title -- the club's 18th in total -- brings to an end a period of dominance by their city rivals who have won the last five league titles in Italy. ""We gave a lot all year long to get here and we deserve to win. I'm lucky because the president (Silvio Berlusconi) gave us the opportunity (with new signings) to get important results,"" Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri said, AFP reported. Winning the title has also proved the doubters wrong who said his team was too old, Allegri said. ""We won 23 out of 36 games and proved that we deserved it,"" Allegri said, AFP reported. Milan's vice-captain Gennaro Gattuso was full of praise for his coach. ""Allegri deserves a 10 out of 10, he was the architect of this success, he managed to keep the group compact,"" Gatusso said, AFP reported. Only needing a draw to ensure the title, Milan, understandably, played conservatively throughout the 90 minutes, doing what was necessary to see them over the finishing line. Few clear-cut chances fell to either team in the first half, but Roma's Yugoslav striker Mirko Vucinic went close with a volley in the 14th minute which forced Christian Abbiati into a smothering save. Robinho went close for Milan early in the second half with a curling shot which hit the post and Kevin Prince Boateng shot narrowly wide on the hour mark. Roma became more adventurous as the game wore on but offered little to really trouble the new champions and at the final whistle, Milan were comfortably in control -- much like they have been all season.","AC Milan are Italian league champions for the 18th time in their history .

"New York (CNN) -- Justin DiPietro, the father of missing Maine toddler Ayla Reynolds, has taken a polygraph, the spokesman for the Maine State Police said. ""He was told the results,"" Stephen McCausland added. McCausland would not say when the test was given, nor did he say whether Ayla's father passed, failed, or if the results were inconclusive. He also would not elaborate on what questions DiPietro was asked. However, DiPietro told the Morning Sentinel newspaper in Waterville, Maine, that he took the test early on in the investigation. ""I know I went in there and smoked it,"" he said. ""I told the truth, and that's it."" The newspaper reported Ayla's father would not reveal the results, and would say only, ""They can tell me whatever they want. Again, I didn't physically see the results."" Polygraph results cannot be used as evidence in court. It's been four weeks since Ayla disappeared. Alya, now 21 months old, was reported missing by her father the morning of December 17. Police said DiPietro told them he put Ayla to bed at 8 p.m. the night before. Police said Friday that three children -- not two, as they previously said -- were at home the night Ayla went missing. Ayla's grandmother, Phoebe DiPietro, has told CNN that Ayla was in her bedroom she shared with her cousin, who is three months younger. DiPietro now confirms to the Morning Sentinel that his sister Elisha -- the mother of Ayla's cousin -- was there along with DiPietro's girlfriend, Courtney Roberts, and her young son. The family's one-story home is owned by DiPietro's mother. She told police she was not there that night. It appears DiPietro has a room in the basement. DiPietro has not spoken publicly about what happened the night his daughter vanished other than to say, through his mother, that he put her to bed. Investigators said they have told DiPietro family members they're free to discuss what transpired that night despite any previous possible misunderstanding. When Ayla first disappeared, police told them not to disclose details because of sensitivities of the case. DiPietro told the newspaper he's deferring to police on that subject. ""I would rather let them be the ones to come out and talk about that night, if they feel it's necessary,"" DiPietro told the Morning Sentinel. ""I don't really feel that's up to us. If there are certain details they want to share, they should be the ones to come out and share those details,"" he told the paper. A missing children's center in Houston, Laura's Recovery Center, said it has advised DiPietro to talk about Ayla as much as possible to keep the case in the public eye.","A police spokesman would not say what the results of the polygraph were .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United clinched a record 19th English league title on Saturday, while local rivals City ended a 35-year wait to win a football trophy. United came from behind to draw 1-1 at Blackburn, as Wayne Rooney equalized with a controversial penalty, to move past arch-rivals Liverpool in the all-time standings. And just two hours later, City capped a big day for the northern metropolis by beating Stoke City 1-0 in the FA Cup final at London's Wembley Stadium. Alex Ferguson's United team went into the penultimate match of the Premier League campaign needing just a point to end second-placed Chelsea's title reign. Blackburn, battling to avoid relegation, took the lead in the 20th minute through Australia international Brett Emerton and should have gone further ahead in the 65th minute when Martin Olsson headed against the post. Five minutes later United striker Javier Hernandez went down as he tried to round Paul Robinson, with the goalkeeper making enough contact to send the Mexican tumbling. Referee Phil Dowd went to consult his linesman, sparking ugly scenes as the United players surrounded the officials demanding a penalty. Once order was restored, Dowd pointed to the spot -- to the anger of the Blackburn contingent -- and Rooney smashed his shot into the net for his 11th league goal this season. The draw put United seven points clear of Chelsea, who host Newcastle on Sunday. It was particularly satisfying for the England striker, who began his career at Liverpool's city rivals Everton. ""I was terrified, the ref took a long time to give it. I had to compose myself, I'd been practicing all week,"" Rooney told reporters. ""After the year I've had, with the ups and downs, this is for the fans and the team. For me personally, being an Everton fan, to win a 19th title is special."" Ferguson has now won 12 championships since taking charge in 1986, when Liverpool reigned supreme with 16, and will seek to win his third European crown against Barcelona at Wembley on May 28. ""It wasn't an easy game. We went 1-0 down having given them a bad goal, but we kept on and we don't give in,"" the 69-year-old Scot said. ""It looked like it was not going to be our day, we've always had it difficult here. It is a local derby and they are fighting for their lives, looking for that point, but we kept going and that's a good quality."" Manchester City capped a memorable week by winning England's prestigious knockout competition for the first time since 1969 and fourth in the club's 131-year history. City's last silverware came in the 1976 League Cup final, but the massive investment of owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed since the Abu Dhabi billionaire's 2008 takeover is now paying off. Manager Roberto Mancini guided City into Europe's premier club competition, the Champions League, for the first time with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham on Tuesday. Due to that achievement, Stoke will also be playing in Europe next season in the second-tier Europa League. ""I can say only that I'm very happy for all the supporters,"" Mancini said. ""After many years they deserve to win this trophy. I didn't feel we dominated this game. ""We need to improve but we are very happy. We made a small piece of history for Manchester City. We start now."" City's last appearance in the FA Cup final ended in a replay defeat by Tottenham, widely considered one of the best matches in the tournament's 140-year history, but a goal from semifinal hero Yaya Toure was enough to deny Stoke a fairytale finish in the club's first such outing. The Ivory Coast midfielder, who ended United's treble hopes with the only goal of the semi, lashed home a shot in the 74th minute as Stoke scrambled to clear a slew of City attempts. ""The dream is now. It's fantastic to win. It's fantastic for the history of the club,"" Toure said. ""We wanted to win something and get through to the Champions League. It's amazing."" One of the key figures in the build-up to the goal was Italy striker Mario Balotelli, who had earlier produced a superb save from Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. In Saturday's other Premier League matches, Blackpool remained in the relegation zone despite a thrilling 4-3 victory at home to ninth-placed Bolton. Bolton led in the sixth minute through striker Kevin Davies but the home side took a 3-2 halftime lead through a double by D.J. Campbell either side of Jason Puncheon's 19th-minute goal. In-form loan striker Daniel Sturridge leveled the score eight minutes after the break, but captain Charlie Adam earned a vital win 10 minutes later to leave Blackpool behind Birmingham on goal difference, with both clubs on 39 points. Wolverhampton joined Blackburn on 40 points with a 3-1 win at 13th-placed Sunderland, who guaranteed another season in the top flight last weekend. Second-half goals from striker Steven Fletcher and George Elokobi clinched a memorable win for Wolves manager Mick McCarthy at his old club -- where he failed to win a home Premier League game in 19 attempts. West Brom moved up to 10th place with a 1-0 win at home to Everton, who will seek to retain seventh in the final round. Youssouf Mulumbu scored the only goal in the 10th minute, while Everton had Russian substitute Diniyar Bilyaletdinov sent off for a late tackle in the 77th. On Sunday, third-placed Arsenal host Aston Villa, while Tottenham visit Liverpool in a match that should determine fifth and a place in the Europa League next year. Birmingham travel to mid-table Fulham, and Wigan host West Ham in a battle of the bottom two teams.","Wayne Rooney scores the goal that gives Manchester United a record 19th English title .

"(CNN) -- Wolfsburg sparked wild celebrations when they clinched their first German Bundesliga crown after thrashing beaten UEFA Cup finalists Werder Bremen 5-1 on Saturday. Wolfsburg spark the club's first championship celebrations with a final-day thrashing of Werder Bremen. The game was effectively settled after 26 minutes when Sebastian Proedl's own goal put the hosts 3-0 up after strikes from Zvejezdan Misimovic after six minutes and Grafite on 15. Diego pulled one back after 31 minutes for Bremen who looked weary from their extra-time defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday night. Grafite's second of the game 11 minutes into the second half and a fifth from highly-rated Edin Dzeko after 74 capped a memorable occasion for Wolfsburg. Winning the 'salad bowl' is a fitting send-off for coach Felix Magath, who was overseeing his final game in charge before joining Schalke next season. ""I think that VfL will be in the running for the title in the future too,"" said an emotional Magath. ""We have put together a young and hungry team with fantastic prospects. ""It's a dream, I never believed we had the chance to win the title, but the boys deserve it. And leaving now will be very difficult."" Bosnia's Dzeko and Brazil's Grafite have scored 54 goals between them this season to break the previous record set by Bayern Munich's Gerd Muller and Uli Hoeness in the 1970s. ""It's completely mad to have won the championship and got the record,"" said Dzeko.""It's a great feeling - we will celebrate all night long."" Bayern Munich made certain of the runners-up spot -- and a place in the Champions League group stage next season -- with a 2-1 home win over Stuttgart who could have overtaken the deposed champions. An own goal from Khalid Boulahrouz on 16 gave Bayern the lead and Mark van Bommel made it 2-0 on the hour. Mario Gomez pulled one back three minutes later, but Bayern held on. Arminia Bielefeld and Karlsruhe were relegated while Energie Cottbus' 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen means they face a two-legged play-off against the team which finishes third in the second tier for a top flight slot next season.","Wolfsburg spark celebrations when they clinch first German Bundesliga crown .

"Tomioka, Japan (CNN) -- As we travel down the road toward the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, the entryway is blocked by half a dozen police officers and a large sign flashing red lights. The sign reads: ""Keep out. Don't enter."" This is Japan's exclusion zone. No one lives here, a place where 78,000 people once lived. Nearly a year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster, the exclusion zone remains off-limits due to high levels of radioactive contamination. My goal today is to see the town of Tomioka, a farming and factory community which sits in the southern section of the exclusion zone. It's a town that was once home to 52,000 people. It's hard to imagine that many people once lived here, as we drive into the center of town. That's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you can't see, the people. Even though I know the residents have been evacuated, it is still eerie to be in a town where it seems the people have simply evaporated. Bicycles near a bus stop lie tipped over, as if owners forgot to retrieve them. Cars sit in a shopping center, seemingly waiting to have groceries loaded into them. A 7-Eleven convenient store sits in disarray, the items shaken from the shelves from the March 11 earthquake. These communities are complete ghost towns, frozen in time. The signs of life can oddly be found among livestock roaming the region. We come up to cows grazing on the hill right off the main road. They stare at us, the visitors, and then return to grazing, as we drive off. We're surrounded by what appears to be farmland, overrun by brown weeds. I'm carrying two radiation meters with me, one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates. The surface reader begins to climb, as soon as we drive past the entryway, even though I haven't placed it next to a contaminated surface, which residents hope will be decontaminated within a few years. The release of radiation from the plant primarily covered the communities to the north of the plant. Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant. But a lower level doesn't mean it's safe to be here long. We stop in a neighborhood to check the radiation. On the pavement, the surface reads a radiation level of 0.042 millisieverts per hour, which is 10 times what you're exposed to in a dental x-ray. Not a significant problem since we're in the exclusion zone for a short visit and wearing protective suits. But living on this street carries possible long-term health risks, especially for children. At a nearby park, contaminated soil sits under blue tarps. It's the first hopeful sign of progress we've seen, contained in this small park. But the rest of Tomioka sits empty, of people, of progress and an apparent future.","Tomioka was once home to 52,000 people .

"(CNN) -- After a long lockout, the National Basketball Association will open its doors Thursday for teams to hold voluntary workouts. The move comes after last week's announcement that the players and owners had reached a tentative deal to end the league's months-long lockout. The season, that was scheduled to have begun November 1, will now start Christmas Day. Team owners locked out players in early July as the two sides tried to hammer out a new agreement. The sometimes bitter battle lasted 149 days. One of the main sticking points was a split in revenues that owners said was unfair. They sought to change the old revenue-sharing arrangement that gave players 57% of the revenue. The new deal offers a virtual 50-50 split. Training camps will open December 9, and the season will be 66 games instead of the usual 82. A previous lockout in the NBA lasted 204 days -- from July 1998 to January 1999 -- before a new collective bargaining agreement was reached by both sides. CNN's Dan Moriarty contributed to this report.","This move comes after players and owners said they reached a deal .

"(CNN) -- This November, the Obama administration is expected to move forward with long overdue safeguards that would finally protect our families from mercury pollution. As the mother of four children, I can only say it's about time. The EPA was first charged with limiting toxic air pollutants such as mercury during the Bush administration -- the first Bush administration. I don't know how many children have been exposed to dangerous levels of this neurotoxin during the subsequent 20-plus years of foot-dragging, but I do know that my eldest daughter was one of them. When Sophie was 4 years old, we discovered that her mercury levels were elevated. We were already concerned because her learning had leveled off and in some notable ways even backslid. But it was only by chance that we realized she was being poisoned. Because we lived in an old house with lead paint, we had been following our pediatrician's advice to have our children tested regularly for lead and other heavy metals. Only because of this were we lucky enough to learn about our daughter's elevated mercury levels before it was too late. How does a healthy, well-nourished child get mercury poisoning in her own home? By far the most common exposure to mercury comes from eating contaminated fish. Sophie adored tuna fish sandwiches and ate one or two a week. That was a small amount but enough to cause her harm. When, on a doctor's advice, we took fish out of her diet, her mercury levels declined. We're thankful that our daughter suffered no permanent damage, but thousands of other parents are not so fortunate. Exposure to mercury in utero can contribute to birth defects, including neurological and developmental disorders, learning disabilities, delayed onset of walking and talking, and cerebral palsy. The EPA estimates that as many as one in 12 American women of child-bearing age have enough mercury in their bodies to put a baby at risk. That means that every year more than 300,000 babies could be born at risk of serious disabilities caused by mercury poisoning. Mercury is one of the most potent of the many toxic heavy metals that come from the emissions of coal-fired power plants. If just one-seventieth of a teaspoon enters a lake every year, it is enough to raise mercury levels in the fish. And yet the EPA reported in 2005 that coal-fired power plants, the largest domestic source of unregulated mercury emissions in the United States, pumped 48 tons of this toxin into the atmosphere each year. The technology to filter mercury and other toxic heavy metals from power-plant smokestacks is widely available and, in fact, some plants already have it in place. Under the EPA's proposed new protections, all plants would have to upgrade, and mercury emissions would be reduced by more than 90% (along with cancer-causing metals such as arsenic, chromium and nickel). It would prevent hundreds of thousands of illnesses and up to 17,000 premature deaths each year. Why has it taken more than 20 years to do something? Because corporate polluters don't want to pay up to clean up, even though thousands of Americans pay dearly every year as a consequence. Worse, their economic arguments are baseless. By cleaning up the coal plants, the new EPA protections will actually result in a net gain for the U.S. economy. Heart disease, learning disabilities and premature deaths are expensive, too. No parent should have to discover, as I did, that she is feeding her child poison in the sandwiches she packs in her lunchbox. After more than two decades, it's time to stop dumping poison into the atmosphere and pretending there are no consequences. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ayelet Waldman.","Ayelet Waldman: EPA was supposed to limit toxic pollutants like mercury 20 years ago .

"(CNN) -- An error from Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes saw Real Madrid win 1-0 at Tottenham on Wednesday to reach the semifinals of the Champions League 5-0 on aggregate. Gomes allowed a second-half shot from Cristiano Ronaldo to slip through his fingers and crawl over the goalline to ensure the Spanish side secured a mouth- watering last four showdown with bitter rivals Barcelona. Jose Mourinho's side held a comfortable lead from the first leg at the Bernabeu but, despite that advantage, the Real Madrid coach still decided to play his strongest side at White Hart Lane. Messi sets record as Barca reach semifinals . And the visitors had to hold on in the first 45 minutes as Tottenham had two good penalty appeals turned down, while Gareth Bale had the ball in the Madrid net, but his goal was ruled out for offside. However, just five minutes into the second half, the tie ended when Ronaldo attempted a strike from 25 yards out that Gomes should have dealt with comfortably, only for the keeper to fumble the shot into the net. Ramon Pavlyuchenko nearly levelled for Spurs from Rafael Van der Vaart's cross and defender William Gallas hit the post from close range, but Real were never in danger of losing their advantage. The result means that Barcelona and Real Madrid will now clash four times in just 18 days in what will be a monumental series of 'El Clasico' encounters. First the teams meet this weekend at the Bernabeu in La Liga, before they face each other four days later in the Spanish Cup final in Valencia prior to their two Champions League showdowns. Mourinho -- who is the first coach to ever lead four different teams to the Champions League semifinals -- told ITV Sport: ""Anything can happen in a semifinal, but we have two other matches to come against Barcelona before then and must concentrate on those games first.""","Real Madrid win 1-0 at Tottenham to reach semifinals of the Champions League .

"(CNN) -- German champions Bayern Munich have confirmed the appointment of Dutchman Louis van Gaal as their new head coach. Van Gaal will take over from Jurgen Klinsmann at Bayern Munich after leading AZ Alkmaar to the Dutch title. Van Gaal, who led AZ Alkmaar to the Dutch title this season, has been released from his contract with the Eredivisie club and will officially take up the reins as Jurgen Klinsmann's successor on July 1. The 57-year-old has agreed a two-year deal with the Bundesliga outfit. Bayern Munich are currently being managed by caretaker coach Jupp Heynckes, who has steered the club to within goal difference of Bundesliga leaders Wolfsburg, with just two matches remaining this season. ""We are happy to have signed an experienced and successful coach such as Louis van Gaal,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in a club statement. Van Gaal has a wealth of European experience, leading Ajax to three consecutive Dutch titles in the mid-1990's, before guiding Barcelona to the Primera Liga title in 1998 and 1999. Following a disappointing spell as Dutch national coach, Van Gaal has restored his reputation at Alkmaar, guiding the club to only the second Dutch title in their history, going on an unbeaten 28-match league run in the process.","Bayern Munich appoint Louis van Gaal as their new coach on a two-year deal .

"London, England (CNN) -- Liverpool Football Club, one of England's most prestigious teams, announced Wednesday that its board has agreed to sell the team to New England Sports Ventures, the company that owns baseball's Boston Red Sox. The sale is conditional on approval from the Premier League, to which Liverpool belongs; resolution of a dispute about board membership; and other matters, Liverpool said. The offer from NESV was one of two the club said Tuesday it had received to repay its long-term debt. It had called a board meeting Tuesday to review the bids and approve a sale. The amount of the sale wasn't immediately disclosed, but the size of the debt is reported to be between 250 million and 280 million pounds ($397 million and $445 million). What does the sale mean for Liverpool? Liverpool, which has a huge fan base around the world, is currently owned by two Americans, Tom Hicks and George Gillett. They took out loans in the club's name to buy it in February 2007. But as Liverpool's position in the English Premier League has slipped, the owners have become targets for angry fans. Liverpool failed to qualify for this season's lucrative European Champions' League and the team is currently 18th out of 20 in the English league after seven matches -- the worst start to a season for decades. Liverpool Chairman Martin Broughton said the board had met with NESV representatives over the past several weeks in Boston, London and Liverpool. He praised the company's vision for the English team. What do you think of the sale? Sound off with CNN iReport . ""NESV's philosophy is all about winning and they have fully demonstrated that at Red Sox,"" Broughton said. He revealed problems the board has had with Hicks and Gillett, saying the pair tried ""everything"" to prevent the sale. Blog: Jumping from frying pan to fire? ""By removing the burden of acquisition debt, this offer allows us to focus on investment in the team. I am only disappointed that the owners have tried everything to prevent the deal from happening and that we need to go through legal proceedings in order to complete the sale,"" Broughton said. History of Liverpool in images . Before Tuesday's meeting, the two owners sought to remove two board members and replace them with Mack Hicks -- reported by the Liverpool Echo to be Tom Hicks' son -- and Lori Kay McCutcheon, whom the newspaper said is vice president and financial controller of Hicks Holdings. The second bidder was from Asia but is not linked to Kenny Huang, who led a Chinese consortium interested in investing in Liverpool this summer, the Echo reported. CNN's Nicky Robertson in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","The sale is conditional on approval by the Premier League .

"(CNN) -- The Wimbledon tennis championships provide two weeks of pure sporting theatre permeated with tears, tantrums, comebacks, upsets, joy, despair, strawberries and cream. So, perhaps the only surprise attached to the appointment of an ace poet to cover the tournament is that it wasn't served up sooner in its rich 133-year history. Matt Harvey has been chosen as top seed -- a baseline bard who will pen a poem for every day of the two-week grand slam, chronicling the sights and sounds of south west London into a series of soulful sonnets. A regular contributor to BBC radio and a self-confessed Wimbledon obsessive, Harvey is already salivating at the prospect of trawling the sprawling site in SW19. He told CNN: ""It's just fantastic to be given such access to the place and the people. I've already spent time there before the lines have been painted and in the museum, and it has been fascinating. I even got to sit in the umpire's chair on Centre Court and had to pinch myself. ""When it starts I imagine I'll be wandering about in the background. I'll have to respond to the things people will be talking about, like if a pigeon is shredded by Roger Federer's racket -- not that I wish ill of any pigeons, or Federer's racket for that matter. ""I will also have to touch upon the traditions like strawberries and cream and Cliff Richard, and also the new addition of the roof -- welcoming people to the Wimbledome. ""The attention I've had since it was announced just makes me realize how much everybody loves it. I'm not the icing on the cake for Wimbledon, but hopefully I can be one of the many hundreds of thousands on the icing that's on the cake."" Poetry has a permanent presence at Wimbledon, the immortal lines ""If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same,"" from Rudyard Kipling's poem 'If' adorning the players' entrance to Centre Court. Harvey's task is to follow in those feted footsteps and compose an original work for each one of the 14 days of Wimbledon. So where will he draw his inspiration from? He explained: ""I'll be getting there early and experiencing Wimbledon before people get in and the change when they do arrive -- and I'll probably go and recite some poems to people in the queue too. ""Wimbledon has such a rich history to draw on too. I can write about the fact that in the olden days women had to wear corsets and the like, which meant their clothes weighed three times more than the men. ""Or about the 1905 champion, May Sutton, who caused a stir by rolling her sleeves up above the elbow and wearing a dress that showed her ankles. ""There are also a bunch of racket stringers who sit in a little hut at Wimbledon where the players take their rackets to be tuned to their specifications. ""Plus, the Queen is going to be there for the first time since the silver jubilee in 1977, when Virginia Wade won the women's title, so there is enough to write about without even mentioning the on-court action."" Harvey's poems will be available on the official Wimbledon and Poetry Trust Web sites, and he'll be blogging throughout the tournament. He'll also have his very own Twitter page, meaning punters can embrace their poetic side by Tweeting suggestions during the tournament. He explained: ""I do a bit in my live show where members of the audience write a line of poetry on a scrap of paper and they always fit together better than people think, so I'll be inviting people to Tweet me some pithy lines and hopefully we can do the same thing. ""Twitter is limited to 140 characters but you may just be able to fit a couplet in there."" • To follow Matt Harvey's poems during the tournament visit the Wimbledon or Poetry Trust Web sites.","Matt Harvey has been appointed Wimbledon's first official poet .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this week it was reported that former NBA slam-dunk champion, Anthony ""Spud"" Webb was planning to become head coach of Rick Cabaret's New York Stripper team. From the moment I read it I cracked up laughing, knowing full well that my longtime friend and golf buddy, who also happens to be president of basketball operations for the Texas Legends (an NBA D-League team) would never do such a thing, and the press release was a joke. I even left him a voicemail Wednesday saying it was funny and ridiculous at the same time, and the next day his publicist released a statement calling it an ""ill-fated attempt at humor."" No harm, no foul Spud, and anyone taking it seriously needs to really learn to laugh. So when I began to see tweets Friday about the maniacal real estate mogul Donald Trump moderating a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on December 27, I had the same reaction as the Spud-strip team press release: this is a bad joke. But according to the conservative website Newsmax.com, they really have asked Trump to be the moderator of a real GOP presidential debate, hoping the men and women who desire to be commander-in-chief will show up to be quizzed by a reality TV show star. If this ""debate"" is real, it will represent one of the stupidest ideas in the history of presidential politics, and if the Republican National Committee has any decency, they would quickly denounce this madness and say none of its candidates will bother even responding to this stunt. As I've written before, Donald Trump is a political chump who should not be taken seriously. To watch all of these GOP candidates make a pilgrimage to meet with him is ridiculous. It's not like he's disgraced former President Richard Nixon, who often hosted candidates wanting to discuss foreign policy, especially as it related to China. The only thing the late Nixon and Trump have in common is both are disgraceful. It's time that real Republicans and conservatives put an end to this silly infatuation with Donald Trump. A question has been raised about whether he's actually a billionaire, and he's gone to court over the issue. His ideas about politics are about as useful as Flavor Flav's marital advice. And discussing the issue of character and the presidency would make Trump a laughingstock to the world. But let's just call this what it is: a publicity stunt by Newsmax.com to gain more subscribers to its growing media empire and a chance for Trump to bask in the glow of being taken seriously by the candidates who want to occupy the White House. If we have reduced the presidency of the United States to a reality show, we deserve to get our butts kicked economically by China, and we might as well let Russia become the world's biggest superpower. Any candidate that would even consider showing up to take questions from Trump should have his or her head examined and summarily booted out of the race. In fact, let's go ahead and let Trump moderate a debate. This will allow us to quickly narrow the field of candidates, ""Survivor""-style. For every candidate that shows up to get quizzed by Trump, we would immediately vote them off the GOP presidential island. There is no way anyone could take them seriously. Sorry, folks. Let's not even start with the idea of Trump moderating a Newsmax.com debate. I'd rather tune into strippers playing basketball than seeing the GOP presidential candidates stripped of their dignity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Conservative website Newsmax.com wants Trump to moderate a GOP debate .

"(CNN) -- Controversial Italian striker Mario Balotelli was sent off as English club Manchester City crashed out of the Europa League at the hands of Dynamo Kiev. The Premier League side trailed 2-0 from last week's first leg in Ukraine and though they won the game 1-0 with a goal from Aleksandar Kolarov, they couldn't overturn the deficit to make the quarterfinals. Their task was made much harder by the dismissal of Balotelli, who caught Kiev defender Goran Popov with his studs after a high challenge. It is the second time the 20-year-old striker has been sent off since he joined City from reigning European champions Inter Milan for a reported fee of $36 million in August last year. Kolarov's shot from 20 yards gave City's ten men a lifeline but though they went close through Argentina striker Carlos Tevez and Spain international David Silva, they couldn't force the tie into extra time. After the match City manager Roberto Mancini told reporters he thought his side would have won if Balotelli had stayed on the pitch. He said: ""The problem for Mario is that he thinks he could be a fantastic player. But when he does something stupid like that, it is difficult for me, difficult for him and difficult for the team.'' Liverpool made it a dismal night for English clubs when they crashed out to Portuguese side Braga. Despite missing a clutch of opportunities a 0-0 draw at Anfield meant Kenny Dalglish's side lost 1-0 on aggregate. Braga's fellow countrymen Porto beat CSKA Moscow 2-1 thanks to goals from Hulk and Fredy Guarin, to progress 3-1 on aggregate. Santi Cazorla and Giuseppe Rossi were on target for Spanish side Villarreal as they disposed of Bayer Leverkusen 5-3 on aggregate. Portuguese side Benfica advanced to the last eight after they held Paris St Germain to a 1-1 draw in France to go through 3-2 on aggregate. Nicolas Gaitan's away goal was canceled out by Mathieu Bodmer's strike eight minutes later but PSG couldn't break down a determined defence. Spartak Moscow thrashed Dutch side Ajax 3-0 to progress 4-0 on aggregate. The Russians ran out comfortable winners thanks to goals from Dmitri Kombarov, Welliton and Alex. Dutch champions FC Twente fared better as they restricted Zenit St Petersburg to a 2-0 victory in Russia, to ensure a 3-2 aggregate victory. Goals from Roman Shirokov and Alexander Kerzhakov weren't enough to see the 2008 UEFA Cup champions through.

"London, England (CNN) -- One of England's most famous soccer clubs has been sold to the American owners of baseball's Boston Red Sox following a protracted Trans-Atlantic legal battle. John W. Henry, the head of New England Sports Ventures (NESV), confirmed in London Friday that the company's $480 million deal to buy Liverpool Football Club had finally been completed. Liverpool's previous owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, who are also American, earlier withdrew their temporary restraining order blocking the sale, having twice gone to a court in Texas to prevent the transaction. ""I can't tell you how happy I am that we finally got to this stage,"" Henry told a throng of reporters. ""We're going to do a lot of listening. We have a lot to learn, but our actions will hopefully speak louder than words."" Liverpool takeover saga explained . The deal eliminates the English Premier League club's debt obligation -- believed to be around $377 million -- to the club's main creditor, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Crucially, this will prevent the club's holding company, Kop Football Holdings, from going into administration, the British equivalent of bankruptcy. This carries a nine-point penalty for Premier League clubs, and could have led to relegation from the top flight given the club's poor start to the season. Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton, whom Hicks and Gillett hired to find a buyer, said in a statement: ""I am delighted that we have been able to successfully conclude the sale process which has been thorough and extensive. ""The Board decided to accept NESV's offer on the basis that it best met the criteria we set out originally for a new owner. NESV is buying Liverpool in order to put it on an excellent financial footing and continue to develop it internationally. ""This is a good deal which comprehensively resolves the pressing issue of the Club's debt and should give staff, players and fans great confidence regarding the future of Liverpool F.C."" From the frying pan into the fire for Liverpool? Meanwhile, Hicks and Gillett are now planning a $1.6 billion damages action, claiming the sale is ""illegal."" A statement on behalf of the pair read: ""It's an extraordinary swindle and it will result in exactly the wrong thing for the club and the fans."" RBS, which had set a Friday deadline for Hicks and Gillett to repay the loan used to finance their 2007 purchase of Liverpool, said any legal action by the pair ""will be vigorously opposed."" ""RBS is pleased the sale to NESV has been completed and is confident this will provide the foundation for the club and its fans to enjoy renewed success on and off the pitch,"" the bank said in a statement. ""RBS is aware of reports that Mr. Hicks and Mr. Gillett may intend to pursue further litigation in relation to the sale of Liverpool F.C.. The English courts have described claims made to date as ""not realistic and abusive."" Any further claims against RBS will be vigorously opposed."" History of Liverpool in images . Earlier Friday, Hicks was believed to be trying to offload his shares in the club to a U.S. hedge fund which already controls Gillett's 50 percent ownership, Britain's Press Association said. However, the Premier League, which oversees the game in England, rejected Mill's requests to undergo a fit and proper person test, saying it could only negotiate with the Liverpool board, the BBC reported. The board, headed by Broughton, approved the deal with NESV last week without the consent of Hicks and Gillett as a way to rescue the club from its financial problems. But the pair said through their lawyers that superior offers had been ""on the table and were not chosen."" A subsequent bid to veto the sale was rejected by a London court, before Hicks and Gillett obtained the restraining order in a Texas court on Wednesday in an effort to delay the deal. On Thursday the case was taken to a London court for a second time, but English judge Mr. Justice Floyd said the move by Hicks and Gillett amounted to ""unconscionable conduct,"" and granted anti-suit injunctions to nullify decisions taken in Texas. The American duo were given until 1500 GMT (1100 EST) on Friday to comply with the ruling. Henry, meanwhile, had pledged to fight Hicks' ""last desperate attempt"" to hang on to Liverpool. ""We have a binding contract,"" he wrote on his Twitter account late Thursday. ""Will fight Mill Hicks Gillett attempt to keep club today. Their last desperate attempt to entrench their regime."" NESV promised that if its offer was successful, it would keep all acquisition debts away from Liverpool's football operations and stabilize the club in order to return it to its glory days. One win in seven games has left the team 18th in the 20-team Premier League table in the early stages of the season, and at risk of possible relegation in May unless results improve. The club faces one of its biggest matches of the season this Sunday against city rivals Everton. The club has earned a joint record of 18 English titles -- but none since 1990. It is also England's most successful club in European football, winning five European Cups, most recently in 2005.","New England Sports Ventures completes $480 million deal to buy Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United ended 10-man Chelsea's hopes of winning a trophy this season with a 2-1 home victory that put Alex Ferguson's side into the semifinals of the Champions League for the fourth time in five seasons. A goal in each half from Javier Hernandez and Park Ji-Sung ensured a 3-1 aggregate win for the English Premier League leaders, who beat Chelsea in the 2008 final on penalties in Moscow. United will next face either defending European champions Inter Milan or Schalke, who hold a 5-2 lead ahead of Wednesday's second leg in Germany. The future of Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti is now in considerable doubt after a disappointing season which has seen the London side's domestic title reign realistically over with seven games to play. Ancelotti in troubled waters at the Bridge . The Italian raised eyebrows when he chose to start misfiring $80 million signing Fernando Torres up front with Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda flanking him, leaving former spearhead Didier Drogba on the bench. The Ivory Coast striker made an immediate impact after replacing Torres at halftime, and got Chelsea back into the match soon after Ramires' 70th-minute sending-off -- only for poor defending to allow United to regain a two-goal overall lead straight away. ""A lot of people thought Drogba would play,"" Ferguson told reporters. ""I thought having signed Torres for the money they did they had to play him. I wasn't 100% sure but I couldn't see how they could leave Torres out."" Ancelotti admitted he might have made a mistake in starting the Spain striker, who has not scored since leaving Liverpool at the end of January. ""Maybe. Could be. I told you a lot of times this season I wanted to start with Fernando for this kind of game, these type of tactics,"" the former AC Milan coach said. ""Didier played well in the second half. I wanted to put more pressure up front because we needed to score. Didier was fresh and he could use his power up front. This was the reason I took out Fernando."" The home side, having survived some early scares, thought they had scored in the 27th minute when Hernandez stole in at the near post to head home Wayne Rooney's cross, but the Mexico international strayed marginally offside. The breakthrough came two minutes before halftime as veteran Ryan Giggs combined well with John O'Shea to burst into the right side of the penalty area and slide a pinpoint low cross with his favored left foot to an unmarked Hernandez at the far post. Messi record as Barcelona go through . Ancelotti replaced Anelka, the club's top scorer in Europe this season, with Salomon Kalou after an hour but United could have gone further ahead as goalkeeper Petr Cech did well to keep out a low shot from Nani and then Giggs aimed a weak header after more good work by Rooney. Ramires, who was denied a penalty in injury-time in the first leg at Stamford Bridge last week, received his second yellow card after a tackle from behind on Nani. The first, also for a foul on the Portugal midfielder in the opening half, had already meant the Brazil midfielder would have been suspended for the first leg of the semifinal if Chelsea had progressed. With Nani replaced by Antonio Valencia in the 75th minute, Chelsea took advantage to level on the night as Michael Essien picked out Drogba with a lofted through pass and the 33-year-old chested the ball down and fired a low shot past Edwin van der Sar. Rooney gives Manchester United the edge . But Chelsea's excitement lasted less than 30 seconds as United surged forward, with Rooney and Giggs combining to set up hard-working South Korean midfielder Park -- who slotted in a low left-foot shot. It was the 37-year-old Giggs' third assist of the quarterfinal, having also set up Rooney's first-leg winner. The win kept United, the European runners-up in 2009, on course for a treble this season ahead of Saturday's FA Cup semifinal against local rivals Manchester City.","Manchester United win all-English semifinal 3-1 on aggregate after home victory .

"(CNN) -- Cesc Fabregas scored his first goal for Barcelona as the European champions defeated Europa League winners Porto 2-0 in Monaco to win the Super Cup on Friday. Spanish international midfielder Fabregas rejoined Barcelona from Arsenal for a fee in the region of $55 million earlier this month. And although he was not named in the starting side by Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, Fabregas showed his class after coming on as a substitute, bursting into the penalty area two minutes from the end to superbly chest down Lionel Messi's inch-perfect lobbed pass, before volleying home. What now for Arsenal and Fabregas? Messi, who on Thursday was handed UEFA's inaugural Best Player in Europe Award, celebrated that honor by opening the scoring in the 39th minute. A defensive mix-up left Messi through on goal, and the Argentine maestro dummied Porto goalkeeper Helton before expertly sliding the ball home. The Portuguese side, who won their domestic league without losing a game last season, had two free-kick opportunities in the opening 45 minutes, but Brazilian striker Hulk missed on both occasions. There was nothing to choose between the sides after the break, but Barca showed their squad depth by bringing on new signings Fabregas and Chilean winger Alexis Sanchex, and they started to take control of the match. With four minutes to go, Porto had Rolando sent off for hacking down Messi, and the 10 men then fell behind to Fabregas' effort. And Porto's misery was complete in the final minute when Fredy Gurain was also shown a straight red card for a late challenge on Javier Mascherano. The result gave Barcelona the trophy for the fourth time in their history and second in three years.","Barcelona defeat Porto 2-0 to claim victory in the Super Cup in Monaco .

"(CNN) -- Centuries from Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli helped India defeat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one-day international in Kolkata to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Upul Tharanga had hit a superb 118 and Kumar Sangakkara made a fine 60 as the visitors reached an imposing 315 for six after choosing to bat first. However, Gambhir struck an undefeated 150 and Kohli made 107 -- his maiden century -- the two adding 224 for the third wicket as India easily overhauled the target, the highest one-day run chase at the famous Eden Gardens ground. After the tourists opted to bat, India began well with the ball, conceding a measly nine from five immaculate overs sent down by new-ball bowlers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. But Tillakaratne Dilshan broke the shackles by driving Nehra through the covers in the sixth over for the first boundary and from then on India gradually lost control. Nehra, who had dropped Tharanga on seven when he failed to hold on to a fairly straightforward return catch, went some way to atoning for that error by snaring Dilshan early and Sanath Jayasuriya, batting at three, also departed cheaply. But then Sangakkara, who was handed a reprieve before he was even off the mark when Harbhajan Singh squandered a simple chance at third man, and Tharanga built a solid base. Tharanga, who increased the tempo by hitting Ishant Sharma for five boundaries in the paceman's first over, continued to bat steadily alongside his captain. The pair scored easily off the spinners and struck timely boundaries as they added 126 for the third wicket, Tharanga reaching his seventh one-day century in the process. The partnership was ended when the Sri Lanka captain was smartly stumped by Dinesh Karthik as he was too far out and across while attempting to help a Harbhajan delivery down to fine leg. Tharanga followed Sangakkara back to the pavilion quickly after, but Sri Lanka's middle-order kicked on. Perera chipped in with a 14-ball 31, while cameos from Mahela Jayawardene (33) and Thilina Kandamby (23 not out from 15) helped Sri Lanka to a strong total. India's response to Sri Lanka's total began badly, the home side losing both openers with a mere 23 runs on the board. Suranga Lakmal, who shared the new ball with debutant Thissara Perera, claimed stand-in-captain Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar in successive overs. Those early blows brought Gambhir and Kohli together, the two steadying the ship with a calm and sensible approach. Kohli injected momentum by hammering Lasith Malinga for four consecutive blows in the paceman's first over and in a period when boundaries were easily available. The duo then easily negotiated the spinners, rotating the strike nicely and although the run rate dropped considerably, India were well in control. Kohli was first to his century and Gambhir followed a delivery later, reaching his seventh one-day century in 101 deliveries. Kohli then attempted to step up the pace and succeeded by hitting the first six of the innings -- in the 39th over -- but perished soon after while attempting another off Suraj Randiv. Their 224-run stand was only 13 short of a record highest third-wicket partnership. India still needed a further 69 from little more than 10 overs at that stage, but Gambhir narrowed the gap by hitting Perera and then Lakmal for successive boundaries. Gambhir, with Karthik for company, got India across the line, finishing off the chase with boundary off the first ball of the penultimate over.","India defeat Sri Lanka by seven wickets to win the fourth one-day international in Kolkata .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned FIFA's world player of the year in Zurich on Monday as Manchester United's star winger completed a stunning trophy collection. Portuguese winger Ronaldo completed a stunning trophy collection when named World Player of the Year. Portugal international Ronaldo helped United win the Premier League, Champions League and world club championship titles in 2008. Ronaldo also collected the European Player of the Year accolade and was voted number one by FIFPro, the worldwide players' union. Now Ronaldo has seen off 2007 winner Kaka, of AC Milan, Spain Euro 2008 top scorer Fernando Torres of Liverpool and Barcelona stars Xavi and Lionel Messi. ""It's another overwhelming moment in my career,"" said 23-year-old Ronaldo who received the award from Brazilian legend Pele. ""It's a tremendously emotional moment and a dream come true. I'd like to dedicate this to my family."" Ronaldo also paid tribute to club manager Alex Ferguson who fought a very public battle with Real Madrid last summer when the Primera Liga giants attempted to lure the player to Spain. ""It's also true that the manager always has an important role to play. It was a great season for me and for my club, and the coach was important for me because I learned a lot for him,"" he said. ""His experience over so many years is of paramount importance -- it's a privilege to have such a great club manager. ""This is the climax of a fantastic era for me. I'm happy and proud about what has been done by my team and what we have won. ""I am lucky to to be part of the history of a club like Manchester United."" Messi led Argentina to the Olympic gold medal in August and Nou Camp teammate Xavi was named UEFA's player of the tournament when Spain won Euro 2008 in June. Ronaldo's 31 league goals in the 2007-08 season, and 42 in total, won him the European Golden Shoe as the continent's top scorer. He is the first Premier League-based start to win FIFA's top individual award while David Beckham and Thierry Henry, both twice, and Frank Lampard finished runners-up. The awards are voted for by the head coaches and captains of all countries.

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, look out. Your traditional video game console business model may be in danger. Popular video games like the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series may soon be available on a new system. It's too early to tell how much danger, of course, but a start-up called OnLive announced a brand-new game distribution system Monday night that, if it works as planned, could change the games game forever. OnLive, which was started by WebTV founder Steve Perlman and former Eidos CEO Mike McGarvey, is aiming to launch a system -- seven years in the works -- that will digitally distribute first-run, AAA games from publishers like Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Ubisoft, Atari, and others, all at the same time as those titles are released into retail channels. The system is designed to allow players to stream on-demand games at the highest quality onto any Intel-based Mac or PC running XP or Vista, regardless of how powerful the computer. The system will also stream games directly to a TV via a small plug-in device, and players can use a custom wireless controller as well as VoIP headsets in conjunction with it. Based here in San Francisco, OnLive timed its formal unveiling to this week's Game Developers Conference, where it will be showcasing the technology and 16 initial games it will launch with. The service is currently in a closed beta, but is expected to go into a public beta this summer, and to launch this winter. According to Perlman, OnLive's technology will make it possible to stream the games in such a manner--high quality, no matter what kind of system the user has--by virtue of a series of patented and patent-pending compression technologies. And instead of requiring users to download the games, OnLive will host them all and stream them from a series of the highest-end servers. Users will have only to download a 1MB plug-in to get the service up and running. OnLive is hoping to capture a significant portion of the video game market share. In February, the industry posted one of its strongest months ever, with total sales of $1.47 billion, up 10 percent from a year ago. And in February, the Xbox, PS3 and Wii accounted for total sales of 1.42 million units. An intended benefit of this infrastructure, Perlman and McGarvey explained, is that users will be able to play streamed games via OnLive with no lag, so long as their Internet connections meet minimum thresholds. For standard-definition play, that would mean a minimum 1.5 Mbps connection, and for high-def, 5 Mbps. That's obviously an essential feature, as it's hard to imagine anyone paying for a service like OnLive, no matter what games are on offer, if the user experience is inadequate. But the company promises that as long as users have the requisite minimum hardware, operating systems, and Internet connections, they should be able to have seamless play. The upshot of this infrastructure model, Perlman said, is that OnLive is somewhat future-proof, meaning that players won't have to upgrade anything to keep on playing games on the system years into the future. Instead, the upgrades will happen on the back-end, with the company regularly boosting the power of the servers it uses to host and stream the games. And while demos always have to be taken with a grain of salt, CNET News did see a real-time presentation of OnLive on at least two different computers and on a HD TV. Game play was as smooth and lag-free as advertised . So far, OnLive has yet to make its business model public, but what seems likely is some form of subscription service, where players will pay a monthly access fee and then pay additional costs, depending on whether they want to play games once, or buy them for permanent play. The company also said that it will probably offer free trials of some or all of the games it offers, allowing consumers to decide whether they want to buy. OnLive recognizes that some players may use those trials as a way of deciding whether to buy such games from traditional retail stores, but Perlman and McGarvey suggested that as long as people are interacting with the OnLive system, they'll be happy. It's clear that OnLive is modeling its system at least somewhat after Microsoft's hit Xbox Live service. So fans of multiplayer games won't be on their own. Rather, they'll have full access to multiplayer features of games built for them. And another interesting social feature is one that will allow users to digitally watch others play games in real time. The company thinks that users will find it exciting to watch the best players in action, even if they themselves are only kibitzing. Perlman said that the concept of spectating in online game systems is, in and of itself, not new, but that OnLive presents the first time players will be able to look in on what others are playing without owning the games themselves. Another social feature in the Xbox Live mold is what are called ""brag clips."" These are essentially 15-second replays of game action that players can share with friends if they want to show off their prowess. This is possible, Perlman said, because OnLive is continually recording the last 15 seconds of action. All told, McGarvey said, OnLive offers a full suite of standard social features including friends, clans, rankings, leader boards, tournaments and more. From the outset, OnLive isn't partnering with any of the first-party publishers--Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, meaning that franchises like ""Halo"" or ""Zelda"" won't be available. And that makes sense, since those companies are hardly likely to want to sign up with a company whose very technology may obviate their longstanding business models. That means, Perlman and McGarvey acknowledged, that many players who sign up for OnLive's service will still maintain their consoles, and continue to buy games for them. At least for the rest of the current generation of machines, they said. But come the next generation, all bets are off, they said. And for the nine--to date--third-party publishers who have committed to being involved, McGarvey said, OnLive presents a much more efficient and profitable distribution model than the standard retail structure. That's because the system is all digital, cutting down on physical distribution costs, and because it is designed to eradicate piracy and second-hand sales, both of which are banes of the publishers' existence. Indeed, McGarvey said that OnLive has gotten strong commitments of titles from the nine publishers. That means, added Perlman, that the planned launch this winter could be accompanied by the most titles of any new gaming system launch in history. In addition, McGarvey said publishers are eager for the kind of raw data that OnLive can provide about players' usage of the games, including whether they like or dislike games, how much they play, how they play and so on. That data is hard for publishers to collect with traditional consoles, he argued. Clearly, OnLive has set an ambitious goal: dethroning the console makers as the game industry's kings. And as is always the case with brand-new and publicly unavailable technology, it is far too early to know whether the company or the service can live up to that goal. But if its demo is any indication, OnLive is definitely onto something, and given that the company has been in stealth mode for so many years, it's possible that the console makers will be caught off guard. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona star Lionel Messi was named FIFA World Player of the Year in Zurich on Monday, capping a remarkable 2009 for the Argentina star. Messi helped his club side Barcelona win a historic treble of Champions League, Spanish League and Spanish Cup and at the weekend scored the winner as the Catalan giants claimed the Club World Cup trophy. Messi, who claimed the top European honor, the Ballon d'Or, earlier this month, beat off the challenge of last year's winner Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka of Real Madrid and fellow Barca stars Andres Iniesta and Xavi in the annual poll. The 22-year-old paid compliment to his teammates as he collected the award from FIFA president Sepp Blatter and his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini and said it was a ""great honor."" Messi added: ""A magnificent year for Barcelona has ended in the best possible way for the club and for myself."" The goalscoring winger struck in extra time as Barcelona beat Estudiantes of Argentina 2-1 on Saturday to win the Club World Cup final, the European champions' sixth trophy of the year. He also scored the clinching second in Barca's 2-0 win over title holders Manchester United to win the Champions League in May. Messi will be heading to next year's World Cup with Argentina after Diego Maradona's men scraped into the finals after struggling to qualify from South America. He had helped his country win the Olympic football gold in Beijing in 2008 and will be hoping for a revival in their fortunes in South Africa where he will look to showcase his formidable talents. Messi joined Barcelona from Newell's Old Boys which is based in Rosario, Argentina in 2000. In September he signed a two-year contract extension which will keep him at the club until 2016. Brazil's Marta was named women's World Player of the Year, at the glittering awards night in Switzerland, which was co-hosted by CNN World Sport's Pedro Pinto. Consolation for Ronaldo, who is now at Real Madrid, came as he picked up the FIFA Puskas award for the best goal of the 2008/09 season - his long-range effort for Manchester United against Porto in the Champions League in April.","Barcelona's Lionel Messi named FIFA World Player of Year .

"ZURICH, Switzerland -- Martina Hingis has stunned the world of sport by revealing that she tested positive for cocaine at Wimbledon. Hingis won five grand slam titles and spent 209 weeks as world number one. Hingis, 27, announced her retirement from tennis for the second time but  denied that she had ever taken performance-enhancing drugs. ""I've never taken drugs and I am 100 percent innocent,"" said the former world number one who added that she was ""shocked and appalled"" by the results of test taken after she crashed out in the third round at the All England Club to Laura Granville 6-4 6-2. In a statement an emotional Hingis said: ""I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous, that I have decided to confront it head-on by talking to the press. ""My weapon on the tennis court is and always was one single thing: the game, the ingenuity on court. And for this style of tennis, there is only one performance enhancer -- the love of the game."" Hingis said that she had hired an attorney to help her clear her name, but had decided to retire because she did not want to become entangled in a lengthy legal process. ""A case like this one can sometimes take years to resolve, especially if both sides repeatedly appeal the case and take it to the next level. ""And this is the reason for my announcement. I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials."" Hingis ended her season last month because of hip problems and said she would take as long as necessary to become fully fit again.

WTA Tour chief executive Larry Scott said the tour had not received any official information about a positive test and ""as a result we are not in a position to comment on the matter."" ""However, it is important to remember that in the area of anti-doping, all players are presumed innocent until proven otherwise,"" Scott said.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal became the second man to win four successive French Open titles on Sunday after crushing world No. 1 Roger Federer in straight sets in the final in Paris. The Spaniard triumphed 6-1 6-3 6-0 to hand Federer a third straight defeat in the final at Roland Garros, with the Swiss top seed still seeking to win the only Grand Slam crown missing from his collection. And the manner of his comprehensive victory left little doubt that Federer, who has won 12 other Grand Slam titles, may struggle for many years to come in his bid to defeat his nemesis. Second seed Nadal, who did not drop a set all tournament and has never lost at the clay-court event, matched the feat of Bjorn Borg's four successive wins from 1978-81. He moved to a 28-0 winning record at the tournament, having won 84 of 92 sets played. Nadal broke Federer in the opening game of the match, and needed only 32 minutes to wrap up the first set. Federer fought back in the second, but still succumbed within 50 minutes, and then saw Nadal race through the third set in less than half an hour to clinch a historic victory. Federer paid for his errors, having made 13 unforced mistakes to two by Nadal by the end of the second set. By that stage Federer -- who has struggled to reach his usual imperious high standards this year following a debilitating illness -- was kicking the dirt in frustration. He conceded the match with another long shot, which encapsulated his day, and must now turn his attentions to his beloved Wimbledon next month as he seeks to put behind him the disappointments of the year's two opening Grand Slams. It was the first time Federer had been whitewashed in a set since 1999 on grass at Queen's in England. Nadal has now won 11 of their 17 encounters, and 10 of 11 on clay, and will be seeking to continue his rivalry with Federer on his less-favored grass surface at the British event. He was presented the French Open trophy by six-time winner Borg. ""Sorry for Roger, but to win here is incredible and especially to win this tournament four times,"" Nadal said. The 26-year-old Federer had been seeking to become the sixth man to win all four major events. ""I would like to have won more than four games but Rafa has played an incredible tournament and he fully deserves to win,"" Federer said. ""But I'll be back to try again next year and I am looking forward to the rest of this year.""","Rafael Nadal becomes second man to win four successive French Open titles .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has denied a request to reduce the bail of a woman accused of running a multimillion-dollar escort service for high-powered clientele, according to court documents. The bail for Anna Gristina, a New York mother of four, is currently set at $2 million bond or $1 million cash. The reduction request was denied Tuesday. Gristina, 44, was arrested on February 22 and has been charged with promoting prostitution in the third degree. She is suspected of running a brothel out of an apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Prosecutor Charles Linehan said his office had requested the large bail because Gristina is considered ""an extremely high flight risk."" On Tuesday, a Morgan Stanley broker was placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation into Gristina, according to company spokesman Mark Lake. Prosecutors say Gristina was with the broker in his Manhattan office shortly before her arrest, saying the pair were there to discuss the creation of a website that arranges illicit encounters. The broker, who CNN is not naming because he has not been charged with a crime, said they were in talks to create a website for a legitimate dating service. Gristina's next court date is scheduled for May 3. Her attorney was not immediately available for comment.","Bail for Anna Gristina is set at $2 million bond or $1 million cash .

"(CNN) -- Argentina booked their place in the second round of the World Cup after a 2-0 win over Greece and were joined by South Korea, who secured their berth with a thrilling 2-2 draw against Nigeria. Late goals from Martin Demichelis and Martin Palermo maintained Argentina's 100% record as they booked a last 16 knockout match with fellow Latin American side Mexico. Nigeria and South Korea battled it out for second spot in the group in a game that swung one way and then the other in Durban. Nigeria took an early lead through Kalu Uche but Lee Jung-Soo equalized. Park Chu-Young then put South Korea ahead before Yakubu leveled from the penalty spot. Nigeria poured forward in search of the goal that would have put them through at the expense of their opponents but they couldn't find a winner. South Korea will now play Uruguay in the second round. Argentina 2-0 Greece . Argentina coach Diego Maradona rested strikers Gonzalo Higuain and Carlos Tevez as Diego Milito and Sergio Aguero came into the starting line-up. Greece adopted their familiar defensive approach but they struggled to contain a potent Argentina side in the opening half. Maradona's side came close to opening the scoring when Sergio Aguero powered into the area, but the Atletico Madrid striker's effort was parried by Greece 'keeper Alexandros Tzorvas. Seconds later Juan Sebastian Veron stang the goalkeeper's palms with a fierce drive from distance. Tzorvas was grateful to defender Vasilis Torosidis in the 32nd minute as he blocked a goal bound Aguero shot after the 'keeper had spilled Diego Milito's cross. The goalkeeper was busy again soon after with a double save -- first from Maxi Rodriguez's shot, then from Lionel Messi's curling effort. Greece's first chance of the game came just after the break when Georgios Samaras worked his way into the area before firing wide of the target. But despite needing more than a point to go through due to the score in the Nigeria versus South Korea game, Greece continued to sit back. They paid the price in the 77th minute when defender Martín Demichelis smashed home a loose ball in the penalty area.

Veteran striker Martin Palermo, on as a substitute, then made the game safe when he slotted home a rebound after Messi's shot had been saved. Nigeria 1-0 South Korea . Nigeria and South Korea met in Durban knowing that a win for either side would more than likely secure their passage into the next round. In the 17th minute Nigeria took the lead as Chidi Odiah's right wing cross was turned home by Kalu Uche. Midfielder Chinedu Ogbuke very nearly doubled Nigeria's advantage with a powerful shot from distance but the ball flew the wrong side of the upright. Kalu Uche went close soon after when his thunderous 30-yard drive cannoned back off the post with the 'keeper beaten. But in the 38th minute South Korea equalized when Lee Jung-Soo met Ki Sung-Yuen's free-kick at the back post, to volley into the net. The whole complexion of the group changed in the 49th minute when Park Chu-Young's curling free-kick wrong footed 'keeper Vincent Enyeama and nestled just inside the post. Yakubu then spurned a glorious chance to draw Nigeria level, missing the target from just six yards out. But moments later he redeemed himself, scoring from the penalty spot after Kim Nam-Il fouled Ogbuke. Argentina's late strikes meant Nigeria just needed a goal to qualify at South Korea's expense and they went in desperate search of it. Substitute Obafemi Martins nearly grabbed it when he went clean through but his chip past the 'keeper dropped agonizingly wide of the post.","Argentina beat Greece 2-0 to finish top of World Cup Group B .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Cholera is caused by becoming infected with a bacterium called vibrio cholera. It's a disease that affects the bowels and in its most severe form is characterized by acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to immediate death through severe dehydration and kidney failure. A man from Zimbabwe wheels his sick relative to a cholera clinic. Almost 12,000 people have contracted cholera since August in Zimbabwe, and the outbreak threatens to kill even greater numbers as the water situation becomes more desperate. Unicef says it plans on providing a month's supply of water treatment chemicals for the capital Harare where water supply has been cut off because the government of Robert Mugabe is unable to buy chemicals needed to clean tap water. With the world's eyes on Zimbabwe where it is estimated that more than 500 people have already died , many myths and misconceptions abound about cholera. CNN compiles some crucial cholera facts: . --Unlike other diarrhoeal diseases, cholera can kill a healthy adult within hours. --Cholera's short incubation period of two hours to five days enhances the potential for increased outbreaks . --Seventy-five percent of people infected with cholera do not exhibit any symptoms. --A total of 236 896 cases were reported in 2006, an overall increase of 79% compared with the number of cases reported in 2005 . --People who have HIV or are malnourished have a greater risk of dying from cholera than others. --The disease is mostly spread through contaminated water and food supplies. --The belief that cholera epidemics are caused by dead bodies after a disaster is false. --Cholera remains a problem in almost every developing country . --If untreated, as many as one in two people may die. --The true burden of the disease is grossly underestimated as not all cases are reported.

"(Mashable)  -- If event registration site Eventbrite's experience is any indication, social media marketers looking for monetary returns on their efforts might get more value from Facebook than Twitter. The company announced Wednesday that an average tweet about an event drove 80 cents in ticket sales during the past six months, whereas an average Facebook Like drove $1.34. The study, which used in-house social analytics tools to track ticket sales on the site, was a continuation of a similar analysis the company released in October after analyzing data from a 12-week period. That study also indicated Facebook drove more sales for Eventbrite than Twitter, although the difference between the two networks' sales per post was greater at that point than throughout the entire six-month period (the ""value"" of tweets increased). In addition to each individual Facebook Like driving more sales than an individual tweet, the study also revealed cumulative activity on Facebook was greater than activity on Twitter for Eventbrite. People shared Eventbrite events on Facebook almost four times as often as they did on Twitter. The company attributes this disparity to Facebook's wider reach and greater emphasis on real-world ties. It's important to note that only a very small percentage of site visitors shared event pages on either network. Just 1% of people who landed on an event page shared it with their friends; 10% of people who had purchased a ticket did the same. Obviously people are more likely to share events if they are attending. Their friends, according to Eventbrite's data, are also more likely to buy tickets to an event shared on Facebook by a ticket holder than one shared by an uncommitted friend. But whether these trends, or any of Eventbrite's findings, are relevant to other types of purchases is still a matter of speculation. But Eventbrite is betting they are. ""We carefully track sharing behavior in an effort to help event organizers tap into a new world of distribution for their event promotion,"" wrote Tamara Mendelsohn, Eventbrite's director of marketing and former senior analyst at Forrester Research, in a blog post about the study. ""But the findings apply broadly to all e-commerce businesses, because the foundations of e-commerce are shifting as the social graph becomes a meaningful influence in driving transactions."" © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan survived an early sending-off and a Barcelona onslaught to reach the final of Europe's Champions League, where they will meet Bayern Munich. The Italian champions were reduced to 10 men when Thiago Motta was dismissed after 28 minutes, but defended resolutely and clung on for a 1-0 defeat in the Nou Camp which gave them a 3-2 victory on aggregate. Defending champions Barca dominated possession throughout the match but did not break through until the 84th minute when Gerard Pique's goal gave them a lifeline. But Inter, who have not won Europe's premier club competition since 1965, held on to set up a meeting with German side Bayern at Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on May 22. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? The victory was a personal triumph for Inter coach Jose Mourinho, who once worked as a translator at Barca and taunted the Spanish side in the build-up to the game over their ""obsession"" with winning the Champions League at the home of their arch-rivals. Mourinho greeted the final whistle by sprinting across the pitch with one arm raised. He shrugged off an attempt by Barca keeper Victor Valdes to restrain him and celebrated in front of the Inter fans. Mourinho made a late change to his line-up shortly before kick-off with defender Christian Chivu replacing injured striker Goran Pandev. Barca were on the attack from the start but did not create a clear opening until midway through the half, when Dani Alves crossed for Pedro, whose low shot fizzed narrowly wide. Five minutes later, Inter were reduced to 10 men when Motta was shown a red card for pushing his hand into Sergio Busquets's face. Barca went close again when Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar pulled off a spectacular one-handed diving save to keep out a curling shot from Lionel Messi. The second half began with Barca camped in the Inter half and the Italians getting all 10 players behind the ball. Roared on by their 91,000 crowd, Barca were almost permanently in possession of the ball but did not create a clear opportunity until the 82nd minute when Messi lifted a cross into the path of Bojan Krkic, who glanced his header wide from just six yards. Two minutes later, Xavi slipped a pass through to center-half Pique, who - pushed up front as an emergency striker - turned and slotted the ball home. Barca pressed hard for the second goal that would have won them the game and thought they had it in stoppage-time when Bojan slammed into the net, but the effort was ruled out for a handball by Yaya Toure earlier in the move. That proved to be the last chance of the game as Inter were left to celebrate their first appearance in the European Cup final since 1972. ""We defended very well with 10 men for so long,"" Inter midfielder Wesley Sneijder told ITV television. ""We fought for every meter and we gave everything. We made it and we will go to Madrid."" Meanwhile, Bayern will appeal against a three-match ban imposed on Franck Ribery, which rules him out of the final. The French winger was shown a red card in the first leg of the semifinal victory over Lyon and was suspended for the second leg on Tuesday.","Inter Milan reach Champions League final with 3-2 aggregate victory over Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button snatched a sensational victory at a rain-affected Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday as world champion Sebastian Vettel made a mistake on the final lap in Montreal. The German had been poised to claim his sixth victory in seven Formula One races this season after avoiding the earlier chaos behind him, but locked his wheels at a corner to let 2009 world champion Button to complete remarkable fightback. The English driver had an early collision with Lewis Hamilton that ended his McLaren teammate's race, and received a drive-through penalty for speeding while the safety car was out. Then, following a delay of more than two hours due to a downpour, Button suffered a punctured tire after a collision with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso that resulted in Spain's two-time world champion crashing into a wall -- and the incident will be investigated by race stewards. F1 championship standings . ""Even if I hadn't won I would have enjoyed this race immensely, but it's a win, definitely my best,"" Button told reporters. ""I'm definitely going to be celebrating. I'll have a good night and enjoy what I achieved. A big thank you to the team for what they've done."" Vettel, who has not finished outside the top two this season, admitted he was disappointed not to win in the circumstances after starting the race in pole position. ""I was probably too conservative at the last safety car and I did not open up enough of a gap. Then when it came down to the fight at the end the mistake was down to me, I locked up the rear,"" he said. ""It is still a good day as many mistakes were made and cars did not finish, yet we've picked up good points."" Vettel claims pole ahead of Ferrari pair in Montreal . Button moved up to second place in the drivers' standings, 60 points behind Vettel, whose Red Bull teammate Mark Webber denied seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher his first podium finish since returning from retirement last year. Hamilton, who dropped to fourth overall, was also involved in an early incident with Webber in the fifth lap soon after the safety car departed. The race started behind the guide vehicle due to the poor visibility, and it made lengthy returns due to the wet weather and subsequent accidents. The stewards will also be investigating a clash between Mercedes' Nico Rosberg and Force India's Adrian Sutil. With the drivers behind him switching tires as the conditions changed, Vettel was able to wait until the 54th lap before changing to slicks and managed to come out still in front. A frantic battle was going on for podium placings as Schumacher took advantage of a tussle between Ferrari's Felipe Massa and Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi to claim second. The German survived one attack from Webber, who had to give back the advantage after illegally cutting across a corner to go through, but Button managed to get past both of them to earn a crack at Vettel. The 31-year-old reduced Vettel's lead to just 0.9 seconds going into the final lap as he continued to set the fastest times in a race in which he made six pit-stops. His 23-year-old rival buckled under the pressure, giving Button the chance to surge past and claim the 10th win of his career and his first since China in April 2010. Vitaly Petrov finished fifth for Lotus Renault while Massa edged Kobayashi for sixth place, Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari were eighth and 10th, while Williams' veteran Brazilian Rubens Barrichello was ninth.","Former world champion Jenson Button claims victory on final lap in Montreal .

"Paris (CNN) -- Search teams retrieved a body from the wreckage of the Air France airbus that crashed into the Atlantic in 2009, the French Interior Ministry said. The body was still attached to a seat and ""appeared degraded,"" the ministry added in a written statement. ""The attempts to bring up the bodies were made in particularly complex conditions. Considerable uncertainties still remain regarding the technical feasibility of recovering the bodies,"" the French Ministry statement said. DNA samples from the remains -- recovered from a depth of 3900 meters (12,700 feet) - will be sent to a laboratory for analysis, the statement added. Thursday's announcement came days after the flight recorders were located. All 228 people aboard the Airbus A330 Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris were killed on June 1, 2009. Until now, 50 bodies had been recovered on the surface after the crash. However, some relatives of those who died have expressed reservations about remains being brought to the surface. Last month Robert Soulas, head of a support group for families of flight victims, said: ""For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed."" Other relatives have called for the bodies to be recovered. The Airbus A330's pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. But exactly what caused the plane to plunge into the sea has remains a mystery. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said on Thursday that the external casings of both the flight recorders -- which record data and cockpit voices -- were in good condition and that they had started a ""drying"" process. It would take a couple of days for the units to dry and then approximately a week or two before they could determine if both were still working, the BEA said. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based BEA said that even if there was some internal damage to the recorders, some data might still be recoverable. ""We must be very very careful... we are confident but it will take time for us to know whether we can retrieve all the data."" Phil Seymour, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, a British aviation consultancy, said: ""I remain skeptical about how useful this device (memory unit) will be. If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split up. You also have the corrosive effects of seawater and the immense depths involved.""","Search teams retrieved a body from the wreckage of the Air France airbus .

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama's top adviser insisted Sunday that Obama's economic plan would be big enough to handle the country's financial challenges, but he declined to speculate about how large the plan would need to be. Senior adviser David Axelrod says it will take the ""best people we can find"" to carry out Obama's economic plan. During the presidential campaign, Obama proposed a $175 billion stimulus package over a two-year period, but some of his economic advisers have said recently that the package would need to be much larger. Asked if Obama would scale up the package, given the economic conditions, Obama's incoming senior adviser, David Axelrod, said he thinks Obama is ""going to do what's necessary."" ""I'm not going to throw a figure out here. What he said is, he wants a plan big enough to deal with the large challenges we face. And I think there's a growing consensus across the spectrum among economists that we're going to have to do something big,"" Axelrod said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" Obama on Saturday offered an outline of his economic recovery plan to create 2.5 million jobs by 2011, saying American workers will rebuild the nation's roads and bridges, modernize its schools and create more sources of alternative energy. Details of the plan are still being worked out by his economic team, Obama said, but he hopes to sign the two-year, nationwide plan shortly after taking office January 20. Obama noted he will need support from both Democrats and Republicans to pass such a plan, and said he welcomes suggestions from both sides of the aisle. ""But what is not negotiable is the need for immediate action,"" he said Saturday. Axelrod said it will take ""the best people we can find, the best minds in our country"" to carry out Obama's economic plan. In an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" he said New York Federal Reserve President Tim Geithner and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers are among the those people. Summers, who lost out to Geithner for the Treasury post, is expected to be the top economic adviser in the Obama White House, two sources close to the transition said Saturday. Summers, who was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, will be named chief of the National Economic Council by Obama at an event in Chicago, Illinois, on Monday, the sources said. Geithner's nomination to be Treasury secretary, the top economic post in the Cabinet, will also be officially announced at Monday's event, the sources said. Axelrod, on ABC, referred to Geithner's ""pending appointment."" Watch panelists weigh in on possible Cabinet choices » . In another Cabinet decision, two Democrats close to the transition told CNN that New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is expected to be nominated as secretary of commerce, pending the final vetting process. Richardson, one of the leading Hispanics in the Democratic Party, had been seeking the secretary of state post but lost out to Sen. Hillary Clinton. Obama aides have told CNN that Obama is ""on track"" to nominate Clinton as his secretary of state after Thanksgiving. The precise timing of the announcement of Richardson's appointment is unclear. Two Richardson advisers said privately that Richardson had been hoping the State Department leadership post would be his prize after facing political heat for picking Obama over Clinton, but the governor is willing to accept another post in hopes that he will move up in the Cabinet later in the administration. Richardson was energy secretary and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Bill Clinton's administration. Obama's pick will now mean that at least three former rivals from the Democratic presidential primaries will be in senior posts in the Obama administration: Richardson, Clinton and Vice President-elect Joe Biden. The Obama transition team on Saturday also announced several key appointments to his communications team. Ellen Moran, the executive director of EMILY's List, will be Obama's communications director. Moran worked for the AFL-CIO, coordinating ""Wal-Mart corporate accountability activities,"" before returning to EMILY's, an organization dedicated to helping Democratic women get elected to office. Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign spokesman who also has been spokesman for the transition, will become Obama's press secretary -- one of the most highly visible roles in the administration. Gibbs -- an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign -- was communications director, then a senior strategist, for the Obama campaign. Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director. He began work with the Obama campaign in January 2007 as traveling press secretary before returning to Chicago to work as communications director. ""These individuals will fill essential roles, and bring a breadth and depth of experience that can help our administration advance prosperity and security for the American people,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""This dedicated and impressive group of public servants includes longtime advisors and a talented new addition to our team, and together we will work to serve our country and meet the challenges of this defining moment in history.""

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Last week, the Obama administration announced that the deep waters of the Gulf are again open for drilling. That the BP oil disaster is continuing and will have lasting effects is unacknowledged. The BP disaster was the largest oil catastrophe the country has ever seen, and the Gulf of Mexico and our communities have a long road to recovery. Our friends in the fishing industry are still out of work, the effects of the spill on wildlife have not been fully assessed, the safety of our seafood is still in question and entire cultures are barely hanging on. The administration says new rules and regulations will make deepwater oil drilling safer. Although we welcome the new rules, we believe that they do not go far enough. There is little assurance that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, charged with enforcement, has the resources to hold the industry accountable. Gulf Restoration Network believes further steps must be taken immediately to ensure the safety of oil drilling in deep off-shore waters. The government and the public need to stay focused on the disaster and environmental impacts that are just beginning to play out, continue to hold BP accountable and act to make sure this never happens again. We hope the Obama administration approaches continued cleanup, regulatory reform and damage mitigation, none of which is even close to being accomplished, with the same urgency it has shown in efforts to reopen the Gulf to deepwater drilling. BP's spill is only the latest and most visible evidence of the oil and gas industry's ongoing environmental destruction in the Gulf. Louisiana loses the equivalent of a football field worth of wetlands every hour, and 40 to 60 percent of that loss is attributed to oil and gas activity, including exploration and dredging of pipeline canals. The oil and gas industry must pay its fair share for coastal restoration, and a large portion of the fines levied against BP should be dedicated to ongoing restoration efforts. Despite what the rest of the oil industry claims, BP is not a rogue player when it comes to taking big risks at the expense of the Gulf. Other oil and gas companies have violated safety and environmental regulations. Regulatory reforms and policy changes are urgently needed to prevent drilling disasters, ensure oil-rig safety in the Gulf and elsewhere and guarantee rapid response and cleanup when accidents happen. Industry in the Gulf still lacks the necessary assets to effectively respond to a catastrophic blowout. In light of the abysmal response, containment and cleanup we have observed and continue to observe in the aftermath of the BP disaster, it's clear that we need new rules that require real, credible blowout response plans before any new deepwater drilling is permitted. There is only one way to make sure the federal agencies and the oil and gas industry remain vigilant and operate as safely as possible -- local communities must have a voice in decisions regarding oil and gas development. Because we are the ones who pay the price for the industry's bad decisions, we deserve a seat at the table. An opposing view on reopening the Gulf to deepwater drilling . A Gulf of Mexico Regional Citizens' Advisory Council is essential to formalizing the public's role in overseeing what the industry does in our Gulf. It worked in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez spill, and it will work in the Gulf. Congress should pass legislation to create and require the oil industry to fund a Gulf of Mexico Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. Congress must also do its part to aid restoration of the Gulf. The White House's ""America's Gulf Coast: A Plan for Long-Term Recovery in the Aftermath of the BP Oil Spill,"" assembled by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, lays out a vision for community recovery, improving public health, coastal restoration and marine resiliency that can begin to restore the Gulf. We strongly urge Congress to support the plan and ensure BP fines go toward restoring the Gulf. Early this month, 46 community, local, regional, national and international environmental, social justice and fishermen's groups met in Weeks Bay, Alabama. We drafted a set of goals and principles that we believe must guide the recovery and restoration of the Gulf of Mexico, our coast and our communities in the wake of the BP drilling disaster. It's called The Weeks Bay Principles for Gulf Recovery. Together, we want the nation to know that the oil is still here, and so are we. The Gulf's people and places need lasting and continued support to get back on their feet. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Sarthou.","Cynthia Sarthou: Gulf waters open for drilling before BP spill even assessed or cleaned .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United took a big step towards reaching the Champions League final for the third time in four years as the English team ended Schalke's 100% home record this season in Europe's top club competition on Tuesday. Second-half goals from Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney gave United a 2-0 victory in Germany ahead of next Wednesday's second leg of the semifinal at Old Trafford. It could have been a much greater margin as goalkeeper Manuel Neuer performed heroics to keep the match scoreless for more than an hour, while United's defense has yet to concede away from home in the tournament this season. But Rooney set Giggs clear with a clever pass and the 37-year-old slipped the ball past Neuer with his favored left foot in the 67th minute to make up for several earlier misses by the Welshman. Neville: Arsenal trip is United's toughest test . Giggs became the oldest player to score in the tournament, surpassing Javier Zanetti's October effort against Tottenham by nearly three months. England striker Rooney doubled the lead three minutes later after Javier Hernandez nipped in front of the static Schalke defense and slid the ball into his path. ""We're delighted but a bit disappointed in terms of not scoring more,"" Rooney told reporters. ""We have done very well. We have to be professional for the second leg as Schalke can't be taken lightly. They went to Inter and won 5-2 (in the quarterfinals)."" Neuer, who has announced that he will not extend his contract at Schalke and will reportedly make a post-season move to Bayern Munich, had earlier shown why so many clubs -- including United -- have been linked with the 25-year-old. The Germany international denied Giggs twice in the first half and also saved from Hernandez, and then kept out Michael Carrick's header straight after the break. Giggs shot embarrassingly wide with his weaker right foot after a clever turn outwitted two defenders, then Hernandez was ruled offside before putting the ball past Neuer in the 51st minute. 'Envious' Ferguson wants to match Real Madrid . After United finally went comfortably ahead, manager Alex Ferguson was able to rest Hernandez, Park Ji-Sung and Rooney ahead of Sunday's trip to English Premier League rivals Arsenal. It was the 69-year-old Scot's 100th away game in Europe as a manager, as he seeks to add to Champions League titles in 1999 and 2008 to give United a fourth European crown overall. United have every incentive to reach the final, which will be played on home soil at London's Wembley Stadium on May 28. However, the 18-time English champions have never beaten a German team in four two-legged ties so far in the competition, losing to Bayern in last season's quarterfinals. ""We have to recognize that we were dominated by a team playing in a different dimension,"" Schalke defender Christoph Metzelder said. ""We still have hope, anything is possible. We'll try to do everything to win at Old Trafford."" The winning team will progress for a title match against Spanish giants Barcelona or Real Madrid, who clash in the first leg of their semifinal at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. United lost 2-0 to Barcelona in the 2009 final in Rome. Meanwhile, Stoke City moved up to ninth place with a 3-0 win over relegation-threatened Wolverhampton in Tuesday's only Premier League fixture. Striker Kenwyne Jones opened the scoring with a header after 16 minutes, while defender Ryan Shawcross made it 2-0 from close range on halftime before winger Jermaine Pennant made it safe with a deflected effort soon after the interval. However, Stoke winger Matthew Etherington could miss the FA Cup final against Manchester City on May 14 after being stretchered off in the first half with a hamstring injury. The defeat left Wolves second from bottom with four matches to play.","Second-half goals from Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney give United semifinal edge .

"(CNN) -- Oil company BP shouldered some responsibility for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster Wednesday after an internal investigation of the spill, but assigned much of the blame to contractors Halliburton and Transocean. Faulty cementing, a misread pressure test and an improperly maintained blowout preventer all contributed to the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig and led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, BP's nearly 200-page report on the disaster concluded. ""The team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident,"" BP's report states. ""Rather, a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident. Multiple companies, work teams and circumstances were involved over time."" Both Halliburton and Transocean sharply disputed the findings, with Transocean calling them ""self-serving"" and Halliburton insisting that the problem lay with BP's well design. In a corporate statement, Halliburton said the report contained ""a number of substantial omissions and inaccuracies."" ""Halliburton remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions, and that it is fully indemnified under its contract for any of the allegations contained in the report,"" the company said. A Halliburton engineer also criticized BP's well design during an August hearing by the Coast Guard-Interior Department board investigating the disaster. But in a statement accompanying the report, outgoing BP chief Tony Hayward said the well design was not the issue. ""Based on the report, it would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident, as the investigation found that the hydrocarbons flowed up the production casing through the bottom of the well,"" he said. In July, Hayward said the disaster ""was the result of multiple equipment errors and human error involving many companies."" Bob Dudley, who is replacing Hayward, said Wednesday's report ""makes that conclusion even clearer."" BP's report also found ""potential weaknesses"" in Transocean's maintenance of the rig's blowout preventer, the massive fail-safe device that failed to shut down the well after the explosion. BP said its team aboard the doomed platform ""incorrectly accepted"" results of a negative pressure test on the rig before the blast and mistakenly rejected equipment that cement contractor Halliburton requested to complete the well's casing. Rep. Ed Markey, the head of a congressional subcommittee also investigating the spill, said the report was no ""mea culpa"" on BP's part. ""Of their own eight key findings, they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one,"" said Markey, D-Massachusetts. ""BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece."" Several other investigations are still going on, including probes by Congress and the Justice Department. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point man for the disaster, said the BP report was ""not the be-all and end-all"" on the matter. ""I would just say the more we know about this event in general, the better off we are,"" Allen told reporters Wednesday. ""It'll add to a larger body of evidence that, or body of work, that might be, won't be completed until we finish the joint investigation by the Department of Interior and Homeland Security, and the other various investigations that are going on."" And Aaron Viles, a spokesman for the Louisiana-based Gulf Restoration Network, largely dismissed the report. ""While any investigation headed up by BP has as much credibility as my 3-year-old daughter's nightly assertions that it's not bedtime yet, BP cops to much, but not all here,"" Viles said in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. ""Ultimately, the report is going to be used to bolster BP's case against the other potentially responsible parties, such as Transocean and Halliburton."" Viles said that while tracking the cause of the explosion is important, ""fighting the last war won't necessarily prepare us for the next, inevitable mess."" As the well owner, BP is responsible for the cleanup and has set aside a $20 billion escrow fund to pay for damages. But BP, Halliburton and Transocean have repeatedly pointed fingers at one another over the cause of the explosion, which resulted in an estimated 4.9 million barrels (205 million gallons) of oil spilling into the Gulf over 87 days. In Wednesday's report, BP said its team aboard the rig misread a critical pressure test in the hours before the explosion. ""In retrospect, pressure readings and volume bled at the time of the negative-pressure test were indications of flow-path communication with the reservoir, signifying that the integrity of these barriers had not been achieved,"" the report states. ""The Transocean rig crew and BP well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test was successful and that well integrity had been established."" Neither of BP's well site leaders, Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, has appeared before the investigative board. Kaluza has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, while Vidrine was excused for medical reasons. BP's investigation found that Halliburton used a ""likely unstable"" cement mix that was not fully tested before it was used. Mark Bly, BP's head of safety and operations, said in a video accompanying the report that Halliburton ""did not conduct comprehensive lab tests that could've identified potential problems with the cement."" But he added, ""We believe that BP and Halliburton working together should have better identified and addressed the issues underlying the cement job."" But Halliburton engineer Jesse Gagliano testified in August that he warned BP that its well design was inadequate. Appearing before the investigative board, Gagliano said he told BP that the well design did not have enough centralizers -- devices used to position the cement casing around the well bore. The design called for six centralizers, but Gagliano recommended 21 because of the ""severe gas flow problem"" in the well. BP engineer Brian Morel replied by e-mail that ""It was too late and we had to deal with what we had on the rig,"" Gagliano testified. In addition, e-mails from BP engineers, released by a congressional committee in June, suggest that the oil company had its own concerns about the well. Drilling engineer Brian Morel called it a ""nightmare well which has everyone all over the place,"" while Mark Hafle called it ""a crazy well."" Both Hafle and Morel invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination during the most recent round of hearings by the investigative board. Eventually, 15 more centralizers were shipped to the rig. BP's well team ""erroneously believed that they had received the wrong centralizers"" and decided not to use them, according to Wednesday's report -- but the decision not to use them ""likely did not contribute to the cement's failure to isolate the main hydrocarbon zones or to the failure of the shoe track cement."" BP's report also faults Transocean's crew for failing ""to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well until the hydrocarbons were in the riser and rapidly flowing to the surface."" ""Indications of influx with an increase in drill pipe pressure are discernible in real-time data from approximately 40 minutes before the rig crew took action to control the well,"" the report states. ""The rig crew's first apparent well control actions occurred after hydrocarbons were rapidly flowing to the surface."" In its response, Transocean said BP made decisions that increased the chances that flammable gas would come flowing out of the well. It also failed to run a common test on the integrity of the cement or to employ a ""lockdown sleeve"" that would have helped contain the eventual blowout, it said.","NEW: Halliburton says BP's report has ""substantial omissions and inaccuracies""

"(CNN) -- European champions Spain beat Honduras 2-0 in Group H to get their World Cup campaign back on track. Striker David Villa scored twice and missed a penalty in Johannesburg as the Spanish bounced back from their shock defeat to Switzerland in their opening game. Earlier, Chile beat the 10-man Swiss 1-0 in Port Elizabeth, a victory which puts the South Americans top of the group. Mark Gonzalez headed the only goal of the game shortly after the Swiss had set a new World Cup record for time without conceding a goal, surpassing Italy's mark of 549 minutes midway through the second half. Spain 2-0 Honduras . Spain came into their Group H clash with Honduras knowing that only a win would suffice after their surprise 1-0 loss to the Swiss. Villa had already rattled the crossbar from long range when he gave the Europeans the lead with one of the goals of the tournament so far. Picking the ball up on the left flank, the Barcelona-bound front man cut between two Hondurans, went round another and smashed a shot into the top corner. Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, recalled to the starting line-up following knee surgery, missed a string of straightforward chances and looked frustrated when he was taken off in the second half. Villa's second goal arrived six minutes after half-time when his left-footed shot from outside the area deflected off a Honduran defender and looped over goalkeeper Noel Valladares. Villa was handed a golden opportunity to score his hat-trick when Emilio Izaguirre brought down Jesus Navas in the box. But the former Valencia frontman rolled his penalty wide of the post. Spain continued to dominate, with substitute Cesc Fabregas and Villa coming close in the final stages. But Vicente Del Bosque's side may live to regret their failure to add to the score-line should the final placings in Group H come down to goal difference. Chile 1-0 Switzerland . Chile had to work hard for their victory over 10-man Switzerland in Port Elizabeth which means the five South American teams are still to be beaten at this World Cup. The Chileans made the brighter start and Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio had to be at his best to keep out powerful efforts from Arturo Vidal and Carlos Carmona. In a fiery first half, Switzerland were reduced to 10 men after half an hour when West Ham's Valon Behrami was shown a red card for an elbow on Vidal. Chile had welcomed Humberto Suazo, the top scorer in South American qualifying, back to their starting line-up following a hamstring injury, but he looked short of full fitness, and was replaced at half-time after heading his best chance over the bar. The second half was a Chilean onslaught and the South Americans looked to have taken the lead from a set-piece early in the second half when Alexis Sanchez's deflected shot flew into the net, but the goal was ruled out because two Chilean players were offside. Switzerland, who pulled off one of the biggest shocks of the tournament by beating Spain 1-0, looked on course for another impressive result before their defense was finally breached with just over 15 minutes to go. A precise pass sent substitute Esteban Paredes clear down the right flank and his center found the unmarked Gonzalez, whose header bounced and struck the underside of the bar before going into the net. Paredes wasted two clear chances to extend the Chilean lead and Marcelo Bielsa's side were almost made to pay the ultimate price in the last minute. A brisk Swiss counter-attack found its way to Eren Derdiyok, whose side-footed shot went narrowly wide. Chile meet Spain and Switzerland face Honduras in the final round of group games on June 25.","Spain defeat Honduras 2-0 to get their World Cup campaign back on track .

"(MNN.com) -- I've watched my brother-in-law lavish ribs, potato salad and even nachos on his beloved pooch with reckless abandon. Give my dog Lulu a banana, and she returns it in a far less pleasant form. That's why I spend the holidays policing relatives as they walk their near-empty Thanksgiving plates to the kitchen. They mean well, they really do. But depositing scraps of ham, uneaten bits of mac and cheese and other yummies into my dog's bowl can do more holiday harm than good. While I appreciate the generosity, I don't relish the tummy troubles or the gassy nights that typically follow. ""Pets get used to absorbing a certain amount of fat, carbohydrates and protein; [their diet] can be thrown out of balance during the holidays,"" says pet nutritionist Dr. Martin Glinsky, who began manufacturing holistic pet food in the 1980s. ""The most common symptom is some form of loose stool or diarrhea and -- with my dog -- bouts of nausea. She's just not used to the rich food we feed ourselves."" Unfortunately, overly generous relatives aren't the only threat to a pet's digestive system. Dogs and cats have a knack for finding and consuming things they should avoid, particularly when their people are preoccupied. The ASPCA's poison control hotline (1-888-426-4435) handled 167,000 cases last year, says medical director Dr. Tina Wismer. Chocolate, a holiday staple, remains the No. 1 culprit. Pet insurance company VPI also notes a spike in claims related to chocolate poisoning during the holidays. The company's infamous ""Hambone Award"" even pays tribute to pets and the quirky things they consume, such as the Labrador that ate a Thanksgiving turkey carcass or a golden retriever that consumed an artificial Christmas wreath. Perhaps my brother-in-law's table scraps aren't so bad in comparison. MNN: How to protect your pet from poisonous plants . But there are ways to help pets participate in holiday festivities without the risk of accidental injury or illness. Start by brushing up on basic obedience skills so that your pet will have tools to avoid temptation, says ASPCA trainer Kristen Collins. ""Training your dog to 'leave it' on cue can be really useful when you have lots of people and tempting foods around,"" she says. ""With lots of visitors, it's also a great opportunity to teach your dog to greet people politely."" Here are some tips to help dogs behave on a leash around houseguests. Collins suggests pet-friendly zones, complete with soft bedding, toys and chews. MNN: Downing Street defends ""mouser-in-chief"" ""Pets become overwhelmed by people and sounds and smells during holidays,"" Collins says. ""It's best to fix up a comfy confinement space for your pet."" Of course, you also can be firm with guests who try to be a little too generous with the table scraps. ""Most guests are conscious of your relationship with your dog and will say, 'Want me to save this?'"" Glinsky says. ""I have no problem saying, 'Please don't feed the dog. She's on her own diet, and we don't feed her table scraps.' Your dog needs you for her well-being and she looks to you for that. You've got to do what's necessary to provide her with that safety.""

"(CNN) -- As usual, Professor Paul Krugman's piece in the Monday morning New York Times is causing a great deal of chatter among the political types. Krugman points out just how inept the Republican field is. In some cases he takes a scalpel (and in others a machete) to surely the weakest field of presidential aspirants any party has offered in modern American history (see my earlier CNN column comparing this field to 1980). I believe I can explain why this field is so inept. In order to proffer this explanation I am going to utilize Professor Krugman's field of economics. Hold on: I confess I've never taken an economics course and if you ask me the relationship between interest rates and bond prices I would have a Herman Cain Libya moment. I could probably get the right answer but it would take me a while. There are some laws of economics that I believe all economists (be they salt, fresh, or brackish water) would agree on. One of these is: The more valuable a thing, the more people will be interested in purchasing that thing. And as Professor Krugman points out in his piece, the 2012 Republican nomination was clearly considered by most observers to be a thing of value. Even the most partisan Democrat -- me for example -- would concede that three months ago the Republicans had an excellent chance to win the presidency. So ask yourself: Why does this thing that appears to have so much value have so many low bidders? Why did people like Govs. Chris Christie, Mitch Daniels, Haley Barbour, Jeb Bush and Sen. John Thune, all look at this and decide not to raise their paddles? So here we wind up with the political equivalent of the Hope Diamond going for $99.99. I think that these guys were smart enough to see a big flaw in the process and it is this: The majority of the people in the Republican Party who were going to pick their nominee had been so overwhelmed by misinformation, unworkable simplistic solutions -- e.g., electrifying border fences -- and anti-science, right-wing pandering, that the potential candidates decided they just could not go through with it. We have watched GOP debates where audience members booed gay soldiers and cheered the prospect of someone dying without health insurance. We've seen a candidate who wasn't penalized in the least for not knowing that China has had nuclear weapons since 1964 but had to drop out because of a consensual sexual relationship. We have seen a member of the House Intelligence Committee who apparently didn't realize that we haven't had an embassy in Iran for the last 30 years, candidates who don't believe in evolution, and a candidate that didn't even know the voting age in the United States. Maybe Bush, Daniels, Christie, Barbour and Thune figured out ahead of time what Fairleigh Dickinson University uncovered just recently: that people who watch Fox News are actually more ignorant than people who watch no news at all. Could you imagine what they would have found had they studied people listening to talk radio? Perhaps the Republicans are getting exactly the kind of candidates that best match the intellectual composition of the majority of the people in their party -- just a thought, but it's my only explanation of our low bidders. Looks like their chance at the presidency is going, going, gone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville says the GOP field for president is very weak and he thinks he knows why .

"(CNN) -- Former Argentine dictator Gen. Reynaldo Bignone was sentenced Thursday to 15 years in prison for crimes against humanity at a clandestine detention center during his rule. He was already serving a 25-year sentence from a previous trial. He ruled Argentina from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983. Argentina's 2nd Oral Federal Court handed down the ruling. The punishment stems from an investigation into a clandestine detention facility hidden inside a hospital during the country's military dictatorship. Under his command, at least 22 people were kidnapped and taken to the center, known as the ""Chalet at the Posadas Hospital,"" according to evidence in the case. Five of those were tortured during their detention, according to Argentina's judicial information center. Bignone, was previously sentenced in April 2010 to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the nation's eight-year ""dirty war.""","Gen.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday in an effort to advance his unpopular plan to raise the country's sales tax and solidify his political power in parliament. Noda appointed Katsuya Okada, a former secretary general of the governing Democratic Party of Japan, as deputy prime minister. Okada is expected to take the lead in the politically challenging task of pushing the legislation to double the sales tax through parliament. Noda named Naoki Tanaka as defense minister and Jin Matsubara as consumer affairs minister. The new appointments are in response to pressure from the opposition party, which controls the parliament's upper house. The upper house last month censured both of the previous ministers. The prime minister also named Toshio Ogawa as the justice minister and Hirofumi Hirano as education minister. The new Cabinet was set to be formally inaugurated at the Imperial Palace on Friday afternoon. The cabinet reshuffle takes place only four months into Noda's premiership. The prime minister is already facing sagging approval numbers. The latest poll by the local agency Kyodo News shows that more than 50% of those surveyed disapproved of Noda's performance. Only 35.7 approved of Noda as prime minister, according to the same poll.","Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda appoints Katsuya Okada, a former party leader, as his deputy .

"(CNN) -- Wildlife researchers using hidden cameras have captured rare images of snow leopards in a remote mountainous region of Tajikistan -- including shots of a cub stealing one of the cameras. A research team sponsored by the conservation groups Fauna and Flora International (FFI) and Panthera set up 11 camera stations in the rugged Wakhan valley near the Afghan border and left them for three months to record what passed by. The cameras are placed in pairs so that they can photograph both sides of the animals, which can be identified by their unique spot patterns, said Sarah Rakowski, communications officer for FFI. When researchers went to the sites in the Zorkul nature reserve to retrieve their cameras, which have motion detectors on them to trigger the shutter, they found images showing at least five of the rare cats, including a family with two cubs, FFI said in a statement last week. But one of the cameras was missing. The remaining camera of the pair solved the mystery when its photos showed one of the cubs sniffing, gnawing on and finally ripping the other device from its mounting and running away with it. Rakowski speculated that the cub might have been drawn to the slight sounds made by the cameras. ""The leopards are a bit shy, so whatever drew them, we are really happy with it in the end,"" she said. The snow leopard is an endangered cat with spotted smoky gray fur that keeps it warm and camouflages it in the remote mountainous regions of central Asia where it lives. They can jump as far as 50 feet and take down prey three times their size, according to the National Geographic website. Hunting and habitat loss have sharply reduced the numbers of the large feline in recent decades, experts say, with an estimated 4,500 and 7,500 snow leopards left in the wild, scattered across Central Asia. Their populations have declined by as much as 20% over the past 16 years, the Wildlife Conservation Society says. The animal also faces threats from poachers and others who capture the cats for illegal trade. Their warm pelts bring high prices and their organs are used in traditional Chinese medicine, the National Geographic website said. Researchers say even though the Zorkul project revealed new populations of snow leopard, more must be done to ensure their survival. ""Snow leopards have low population densities, which means that large areas need to be protected in order to conserve this species effectively,"" said Dr. Alex Diment of the FFI. ""This survey has revealed an unusually high number of snow leopards in the Wakhan Mountains, which indicates that this could be a key region for snow leopard conservation.""","There are an estimated 4,500 to 7,500 snow leopards remaining in the wild .

"(CNN) -- Joint host nation Gabon opened their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a comfortable 2-0 Group C victory over Niger at the newly-built L'Amitie stadium in Libreville. Gabon were always in control against a Niger side making their finals debut -- and they deservedly took the lead after half an hour. Stephane Nguema produced a superb cross from the right and Saint-Etienne striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home from a tight angle. And they doubled that advantage on the stroke of half-time when Nguema nodded in from close range after Aubameyang's own header was only parried by the goalkeeper. Gabon's German coach Gernot Rohr told reporters: ""We won and we played well, but more difficult teams than Niger lie ahead for us. ""I hope we can continue on this path. I'm pleased as we didn't concede a goal, didn't pick up any injuries, and only got one booking,"" he added. The 40,000 capacity stadium also hosted the second group C encounter, with Tunisia beating north African neighbors Morocco 2-1. Tunisia defeated their rivals in the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations final -- and they once again had bragging rights thanks to goals in either half from Khaled Korbi and Youssef Msakni. Tunisia nearly took the lead on the half hour mark when Zouhaier Dhaouadi's long-range effort smacked the post. However, just four minutes later, Morocco were finally undone when Korbi's dipping free-kick evaded the defensive wall and went in off the upright. And Tunisia doubled their lead 15 minutes from time when substitute Msakni evaded two challenges to score his first goal for his country. Houssine Kharja pulled a late goal back when he converted Ahmed Kantari's cross -- although Kantari appeared off-side when receiving the ball. And Morocco nearly snatched an unlikely equalizer when Fiorentina midfielder Kharja's effort shaved the crossbar.","Joint hosts nation Gabon defeat Niger 2-0 in Africa Cup of Nations Group C .

"(CNN) -- Syrian officials and opposition activists blamed each other for an attack on a gas pipeline near the restive city of Homs on Tuesday, while opposition groups said more than 30 people had died in new clashes. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three civilians were killed by government troops in Homs, while deserting government troops killed 18 members of the security forces in the city of Jasem. Syrian officials did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the incident, and state media did not mention it. And the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group, said police and troops still loyal to President Bashar al-Assad's government killed 11 people in and around Damascus, Hama and Homs, where the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency blamed the pipeline explosion on a ""terrorist group."" CNN cannot independently confirm events inside Syria because the government restricts the activity of journalists. But activists in Homs said the government blew up the pipeline itself to distract Arab League monitors, who are in the country to try to protect civilians from violence at the hands of government security forces. ""The regime did that intentionally. They don't care about Homs; what difference does it make to them to have no power? We don't have any of the necessities: medication, heating fuel, food. And garbage is everywhere,"" said one activist. Another activist in the city of Hama said the Arab League monitors there were surrounded by Syrian officials and security forces, making it difficult for locals to speak to the observers freely. The activist said the city still has many checkpoints and security forces with heavy machine guns, and that tanks have not been withdrawn from the city -- just hidden where monitors cannot see them. The activists spoke to CNN by Skype from Syria. CNN is not naming them to protect their safety. Top U.S. and French officials also expressed doubts about whether Syria was abiding by its November agreement with the Arab League, which calls for the release of protesters jailed by the months-long crackdown on anti-government demonstrations and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from cities. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Damascus was clearly breaking its deal with its fellow Arab states. ""Across the country, the Syrian people continue to suffer at the hand of the Assad regime, as indiscriminate killing of scores of civilians continues,"" Carney said. He said it was ""past time"" for the U.N. Security Council to take action, and said Washington was working with its allies ""to increase the pressure on the Assad regime."" And U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that while some prisoners have been freed, the releases are ""nothing like what the Syrian government promised to the Arab League."" ""Our concern is that the Arab League monitors, although they are providing some ability for some demonstrators to express their views in some places, they have not led to the full implementation of the commitments that the Assad regime took on,"" Nuland told reporters in Washington. Meanwhile, she urged Syrian opposition forces to avoid attacks that would play into the government's hands. ""That's exactly what the regime wants, is to make Syria more violent and have an excuse to retaliate itself,"" Nuland said. In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told France's I-Tele on Tuesday that he was ""a little skeptical"" about whether the monitors are getting free access to the facts. ""We await their report that will be carried out in the coming days,"" Juppe said. But he added, ""I do not consider the battle already lost."" ""The secretary-general of the Arab League has expressed the will to get to the bottom of this investigation,"" he said. ""The truth must be established, and the regime cannot poison the observers who are on the ground."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday that President Bashar al-Assad must relinquish power, saying the ""massacres"" by his forces ""evoke disgust and revolt in the Arab world, in France, in Europe and everywhere in the world."" Sarkozy said nations must continue ""unrelentingly denouncing a barbaric repression and ensuring that the observers from the Arab league have the means and the freedom to carry out their work correctly."" Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby is scheduled to discuss the monitoring team's preliminary report on Saturday, an official with the organization told CNN on condition of anonymity. El-Araby is scheduled to meet with the head of the Arab Human Rights Council on Wednesday, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the press and asked not to be named. El-Araby said Monday that the killing was still going on despite the presence of his observers. ""There is still gunfire, there are still snipers, and we hope that all that will disappear,"" he said in Cairo, adding: ""There is gunfire from various directions, which makes it hard to tell who is shooting. There is no doubt that killing is ongoing, but I can't pinpoint the numbers."" Arab League observers entered Syria last week after the United Nations estimated that 5,000 people had been killed since March in an uprising against the government. Al-Assad's government says it is cracking down on armed terrorists. The Arab League aims ""to provide protection to Syrian civilians,"" el-Araby said Monday, adding that it was asking for a cease-fire and for the names of detainees in Syrian prisons. Nearly 3,500 prisoners have been freed, he said. The Arab League has placed more than 70 monitors in six cities, and the number of observers soon will exceed 100, el-Araby said. CNN's Amir Ahmed, Hamdi Alkhshali, Arwa Damon, Saskya Vandoorne and Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 30 killed Tuesday, including 18 government troops, opposition says .

"(EW.com) -- A dolphin named Winter loses its tail to a crab trap in ""Dolphin Tale"" -- a (sometimes sickly) sweet family film based on a true story. It's no spoiler to say that there is a happy ending, partly because this is the kind of constantly uplifting heart-warmer in which even the villains are congenial, but also because the injured animal is played by its real-life counterpart. Morgan Freeman also plays a version of himself as a kindly wise man whose expertise in prosthetics helps save Winter.

"(EW.com) -- ""Margaret,"" the long-awaited second film written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (You Can Count on Me), has an offscreen history so fraught with drama it trumps anything in the movie. The tale of a ferociously precocious and high-strung Upper West Side Jewish girl, Lisa Cohen (Anna Paquin), who witnesses a tragic bus accident, the film was shot at the end of 2005. But Lonergan, contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie, fell in love with his three-hour version (so did Martin Scorsese, who is said to have called it a ''masterpiece''), and he refused to cut it. 'The Chew' series premiere: It made me hungry, but will it make you watch? Six years and several lawsuits later, Fox Searchlight is releasing a two-and-a-half-hour version of Lonergan's film, which has been on the shelf so long that Paquin still looks like a teenager, Matt Damon (as her geometry teacher) is still skinny, and at one point someone imitates Bobcat Goldthwait. 'Pan Am' premiere review: Lighter than air, but not bubble-headed? So was ""Margaret"" worth the wait? Lonergan's dialogue can sweep you up in a whoosh of personality and ideas, but it's hard to see what, apart from ego, convinced him that this story was so epic. Lisa fixates on the accident because she was flirting with the driver (Mark Ruffalo) when he ran a red light and killed a pedestrian. First she lies about what happened, then she changes her story in a fit of guilt and rage. She makes the accident about her, which is why she must learn that it wasn't. The trouble is, it's a lesson we grasp all too early on. ""Margaret"" may be the longest film ever made about the moral education of a selfish, annoying princess. B- . See full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The Environmental Protection Agency will set a limit on the amount of the chemical perchlorate, as well as other ""toxic contaminants,"" in drinking water, it announced Wednesday. The national regulation on perchlorate will reverse a 2008 decision made by President George W. Bush's administration, the agency said in a statement. It comes after EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson ordered agency scientists to review ""the emerging science of perchlorate."" ""There's going to be a lot of scrutiny of the standard because, again, we are looking at but one of several precursors that can affect iodine uptake in the thyroid,"" Jackson told CNN's Chief Medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""It's the first time we've ever regulated a chemical not because of what it does directly to you, but because it has an impact on iodine uptake that might affect your child down the road."" Toxic America: Chemicals in our environment . Perchlorate is both a naturally occurring and man-made chemical, according to the EPA. It is used in fireworks, road flares, rocket fuel and may be present in bleach and some fertilizers, the agency said. Research has indicated that it can impact the thyroid and disrupt the proper development of fetuses and infants. Some states have already established limits on perchlorate in drinking water, but there has been no national standard. However, monitoring data shows more than 4% of public water systems have detected perchlorate and between 5 and 17 million people may be served drinking water containing it, the EPA said. The decision was made after considering input from nearly 39,000 public comments, the agency said. Once the EPA proposes a formal rule, it will be subject to the public comment process. In addition, the EPA is also establishing a drinking water standard on ""a group of up to 16 other toxic chemicals that may cause cancer and pose serious risks to human health,"" the statement said. The chemicals are a group of volatile organic compounds, such as industrial solvents, and include trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, along with other regulated and some unregulated substances ""discharged from industrial operations."" The move is part of a Drinking Water Strategy laid out by Jackson last year, the agency said. The strategy included addressing contaminants as a group so that their presence in drinking water could be addressed ""cost-effectively."" ""Today's action delivers on the promise to strengthen public health protection from contaminants in drinking water,"" according to the EPA. ""The aim is to find solutions that meet the health and economic needs of communities across the country more effectively than the current approach."" Jackson said in the statement she believes the decision will spark new innovations. ""As improved standards are developed and put in place, America's world-leading clean water technology innovators have an opportunity to create cutting edge solutions that will strengthen health protections and spark economic growth.""","The agency will set a national standard for perchlorate in water .

"(CNN) -- This latest film from master filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar will be both familiar to his fans and viewed as a departure. While it boasts a couple of his regular cast of performers (including Antonio Banderas for the first time in 21 years) it is not an original story (as most of his work is) and is instead adapted by the director and his frequent collaborator, brother Augustin, and based on a novel ""Mygale"" (""Tarantula"" in the UK) by Thierry Jonquet. It's also significantly darker in tone, more subtle, wholly unsentimental and rather more brutal than we're used to getting from Almodóvar. World famous plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard (Banderas) lives in an isolated compound called El Cigarral, a magnificent mansion shut off from the world by trees, a wall and gates. In the compound's laboratory Robert is experimenting on a new kind of skin, one developed through the gene therapy called transgenesis, an ethically-challenged procedure that has been banned by Robert's superiors. Using pig cells, Robert has developed a new kind of human skin that can resist disease, fire and puncture but still transmits other sensations, like human touch. He's achieved this by experimenting on humans, in strict violation of every ethical standard and contrary to the instructions of his medical superiors. One of these human subjects, a young and beautiful woman named Vera (Elena Anaya, ""Talk To Her""), is his captive in the mansion and is Robert's latest guinea pig. Vera lives in a sealed room. Her meals and other materials are delivered via dumbwaiter and her only contact with another person is when Robert is transplanting skin on to her or when he enters her room at night to give her some opium to smoke. Robert lives with a caretaker, Marilia (Marisa Paredes, ""All About My Mother,"" ""Talk To Her""), who is his willing accomplice in this macabre medical experiment and acts as a mother figure to him. She makes meals for Vera and is the only other person with whom she has any contact. Marilia also dotes on Robert, whose tireless albeit creepy work was triggered by the death of his wife some years before, the victim of a horrible car crash and subsequent burning, hence the flam-resistant pigskin. She didn't die from her burns, however. In the process of being nursed back to health, she caught sight of her horribly disfigured form in a window reflection and immediately leapt from a window. As a result, Robert is intent on perfecting a method for healing burn victims. It all seems altruistic, but there's something definitely....off about Robert and not just the beautiful young woman he keeps captive in his house. Almodóvar is one of the most skillful and consistently magnificent directors of the last 30+ years and while ""The Skin I Live In"" may be a bit of a departure from what his fans are used to, it is no less of a skillful and intriguing film. It is rife with the maestro's deft touches of the bizarre rubbing up against the commonplace and the erotic is present where perhaps it is not expected. At the Toronto International Film Festival, I took to referring to ""Skin"" as more ""Almodó-nenberg"" or ""Cronen-dóvar,"" referring to David Cronenberg, whose own offering at this year's Toronto fest is also somewhat atypical of the most famous of his works. It is significantly darker than much of Almodóvar's recent work and contains more than a couple of eye opening ""Wait. He did what?"" moments. Alas, many of these moments come so deep into the film, that to allude to them could constitute spoilers. While it's possible that some of you may see what's coming, I did not and I will not deprive you of the singular joy that is a movie-provided ""Holy crap!"" Banderas is nothing short of spectacular in what should prove to be a career resurgence for him. His Robert is all simmering emotion, everything below the surface. His is the quiet and determined countenance of the researcher, plying his trade tirelessly for the betterment of humanity....or not. Part of the irony given the subject matter of the film may be that he doesn't look any older than he did 20 years ago. At the Toronto Film Festival where I screened the film, the common reaction of my fellow film goers when asked their thoughts on the film was something along the line of ""I'm not sure, yet."" It takes some time to digest, and I think it may perhaps be a film that with time does reveal its secrets and becomes that masterpiece. ""The Skin I Live In"" is rated R and contains graphic violence, sexual situations, rape and some rather unsettling ideas surrounding revenge and psychopathy. It is distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and opens on October 14th.","""The Skin I Live In"" is significantly darker in tone .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Hundreds of workers from one of Hong Kong's largest telecommunications companies stormed out of work Tuesday, chanting protests about possible job cuts. A worker cleans a PCCW telephone booth in January in Hong Kong, China. An estimated 350 contract workers at PCCW walked off the job for a half-day and staged a protest outside the company headquarters, chanting slogans such as: ""We are against pay cuts. We are against layoffs."" Organizers told CNN that PCCW hired about 2,000 to 3,000 workers from other companies and those workers have now been told they face at least a 10 percent salary cut and might lose their jobs. The company said in a written statement, ""No decision has been taken to date about cutting contract rates with subcontractors. The company reviews its commercial arrangements with contractors annually and looks to achieve productivity gains and reduced rates where possible. ... We commenced discussions with subcontractors last week and questioned whether a 10 percent reduction in contract rates might be possible."" Unions are trying to negotiate a settlement, strike organizers said. It was inappropriate to make any assumptions about staff pay cuts or layoffs, because discussions are ongoing, the company said.","An estimated 350 contract workers at PCCW walk off the job for a half-day .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. (CareerBuilder.com)  -- Work can't get much worse than when it stinks -- literally. For Stephen Viscusi, work stinks everyday. ""I work near an executive (woman) that does work out at lunchtime,"" Viscusi says. ""She returns smelling like body odor and Chanel No.5. It doesn't cut it."" Rather than let his co-worker continue smelling up the office, Viscusi, author of ""On the Job: How to Make It in the Real World of Work,"" took the high road and told his colleague she had a small problem. He says the sheer embarrassment motivated her to not only shower, but not to take it personally or hold a grudge. ""Never be afraid to confront annoying co-workers head on,"" Viscusi says. ""Remember they are peers, not the boss."" There's (at least) one annoying co-worker in every office. Whether it's the chatty-Cathy, smelly-Steven, tag-along-Tammy, or just ""that guy,"" difficult co-workers (unfortunately) are the standard in the workplace -- not the exception. Most difficult co-workers are oblivious to their nightmare behavior. Avoiding them is out of the question. If you do make a comment, they stare at you like you're from the moon. Your feelings have been building up for months -- maybe even years -- and it's time to do something about it. You can either pull your hair out over their obnoxious behaviors -- or, you can deal with them accordingly. Define the Problem (aka ""Co-worker"") In ""The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook: Work"" (Chronicle Books), Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht describe four possible types of co-workers. The Talker...  just won't shut up; engages in long-winded, one-sided conversations on relatively trivial subjects; and always has something to say about something (or someone). The Kiss-Up... craves approval mostly from the boss, but will also seek approval from you. The TMI (Too Much Information)... has no boundaries and no shame. He/she will share every piece of unpleasant and personal information with you, without sparing a detail. The Gossip... much like the TMI, will share any and every story -- as long as it's not theirs. Carly Drum, a workplace etiquette expert with New York-based executive search firm Drum Associates, offers these tips if a co-worker is annoying you: . Tip No. 1: Take a break. When you are spending more than 40 hours per week indoors with the same people, something is bound to bother you, Drum says. ""Everyone is going to have some sort of mannerism that bothers you, whether they crack their gum too loud or just hold their pen wrong."" Drum says. Step outside for a breath of fresh air or run out to get a cup of coffee, she suggests. ""It's human nature to get bothered by the little things, so just accept it and take a break!"" Tip No. 2: Be mentally tough. Don't let another colleague's bad habits hurt your concentration and productivity at work. Drum suggests ignoring him or her as best you can and limiting your daily interactions with them. ""If career advancement is important to you, then always try to act professionally in the workplace regardless of what an annoying co-worker might do,"" Drum offers. Tip No. 3: Discuss the problem with your co-worker. (... In a non-judgmental, non-confrontational way of course...) Drum agrees with Viscusi that you shouldn't be afraid to say something to your co-worker. Depending on what the behavior is that's bothering you, it never hurts to approach your co-worker for a friendly little chat, Drum says. ""Co-workers sometimes don't notice they are doing something really annoying because it's just by habit,"" Drum contends. ""By saying, 'I don't know if you noticed but... (insert issue here)' -- a reasonable co-worker will usually be receptive to your feelings."" Tip No. 4: Talk with your supervisor. If the friendly and polite one-on-one doesn't work (or turn out to be so friendly), another option is to bring up the issue with your supervisor. ""From a managerial perspective, a difficult employee who is insensitive to other co-workers can poison a workplace environment and severely impact inner-office morale,"" Drum says. ""Effective supervisors know how imperative it is to nip problems like this in the bud as soon as they arise."" E-mail to a friend . Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- It's football season: From Pop Warner, Young American Football League and other children's football leagues; from high school to college and the pros, football is the name of the game. Unfortunately, it's also a time when we see sports-related concussions, particularly among children. This year, there will be millions of sports-related concussions and many of them will go undiagnosed. Around 300,000 will result in a player losing consciousness. Research indicates that multiple concussions may lead to dementia and lasting brain damage, and more concussions happen in football than in other sport. The result is a brain injury epidemic that affects 4.5 million players who are still too young to play in the NFL. Football is a tough sport, but the concussion epidemic is a problem we can work to fix. Part of the issue is the culture of the game. Retired NFL great Nick ""the Kick"" Lowery, the all-time leading scorer for the Kansas City Chiefs and one of the greatest kickers to play the game, wrote to me about his experiences. ""When I played football, suffering a concussion was often shrugged off as merely having your 'bell rung,'"" Lowery wrote. ""My teammates had no shortage of toughness and wanted to build the mentality to out-tough our opponents. We now know that multiple concussions can lead to lasting brain damage and should be treated as a serious matter."" The good news is that concussions are being treated as a serious matter, more and more. New Mexico is one of several states with a sports concussion law. It requires that coaches be trained about concussions and brain injuries, and that students who suffer concussions must stay on the sidelines for at least a week, and until a medical professional approves his or her return to play. But coaching is not the only way to approach the problem. When kids step onto the field, they need to be confident that their safety equipment will provide adequate protection. Far too often it doesn't keep the young athlete as safe as it should. Although football helmet safety has improved since the days of leather helmets, today's voluntary football helmet safety standards don't take our modern understanding of concussion risks into account. For example, the industry standard primarily protects against serious injury from a severe, direct blow â€” but it does not address the risk of a concussion caused by less severe impacts, or by hits that spin the head and brain. The standard for reconditioning used football helmets also does not specify how often these old helmets must be recertified. One young student-athlete, Max Conradt, returned to play too soon after suffering a concussion. Max was wearing a 20-year-old helmet when he suffered another concussion that led to brain damage. His parents wrote me asking, ""How is it possible that our son was issued a helmet three years older than he was?"" Unfortunately, about 100,000 helmets out there are more than a decade old. These helmets are on the heads of high school and younger football players across the country this season. As knowledge of head injuries improves, some companies advertise newer helmets with sweeping safety claims. Young athletes could put themselves at greater risk if they think a new ""anti-concussion"" helmet, headband, or mouth guard makes them invulnerable to brain injury. We can do better than this. Parents should be able to let their kids play football confident that the equipment they're using has been created with the best science and technology for protection of injury. That's why I introduced the Children's Sports Athletic Equipment Safety Act. This bipartisan legislation, which has been endorsed by the National Football League Players Association, would help ensure that new and reconditioned football helmets for high school and younger players meet safety standards that specifically address concussion risk and the needs of young athletes. The bill also increases potential penalties for using false injury prevention claims to sell helmets or any other children's sports equipment. There will always be some risk of injury in football â€” it's inevitably part of the game. But, we must make sure that athletes, coaches and parents know about the dangers and signs of concussion; we must make sure that they are using safe equipment; and we must take any false advertising out of the game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Tom Udall.","Tom Udall: Millions of sports-related concussions a year; most happen in football .
Concussions are a serious matter, Uall writes; 4.5 milion young players are affected .
Udall: Younger players need football helmets with up-to-date safety standards .

"Editor's note: . (Global Mail) -- The night Bob Hawke lost the Labor leadership 20-odd years ago, I was a tender recruit to the Canberra press gallery who found myself, fortuitously, marooned at the Prime Minister's office door whilst the Labor caucus was dispatching the occupant. Mistaken by security guards -- then hastily clearing nearby corridors -- as a Prime Ministerial staffer, I was left to witness Hawke's return to his office and his waiting family as an ex-Prime Minister, at that time the only one to be rejected by his own party. Hawke came striding out of the caucus room, chin forward, moist eyes straight ahead, a clutch of dejected staff trailing behind. At the same moment his office door opened and out burst his then-wife, Hazel, sobbing. Either she'd been expecting the worst or, more probably, there had been a phone call telegraphing it. She flung herself at her husband. Hawke gathered her up, telling her ""Don't cry, don't cry."" And as he disappeared into his office, he barked: ""I need a bloody cup of tea."" If the humiliation of that evening's historic rejection winded him, Hawke didn't show it. Soon afterwards trolleys of liquor were rolling along the corridors of Parliament House and Hawke hosted a wake that went for hours, open to all comers. He angered, in my sight, only once that night; he rounded on a particular reporter who had showered him with sympathy but who, in Hawke's view, had been long doing the bidding of the victor, Paul Keating. Australian FM Kevin Rudd resigns . Never before had the Labor Party dumped a serving Prime Minister, yet Hawke's equanimity -- outwardly at least -- was striking. You might have said he seemed both resigned and liberated about the loss of the job he'd held for nearly nine years. Of course, the long contest with Keating had been aggravating to Hawke and sapping for his Government; Keating had effectively launched his challenge late the year before, in 1990, when he contended, in his PlÃ¡cido Domingo speech, that Australia had never had a great Prime Minister. Then he challenged Hawke in mid-1991, lost and went to the back bench until his second -- and successful challenge -- at the end of that year. Hawke, the Labor Party and most Australians knew that Keating had Hawke lined up for the kill. Not so Kevin Rudd. It has been an undeclared, subterranean campaign to reinstall Rudd in the Prime Minister's office -- one from which the candidate has, until now, been able to stay aloof. Rudd has portrayed himself as busy and contented within the Cabinet under Julia Gillard. As he described it last week, he has been ""a happy little Vegemite"" being Australia's foreign minister. Invariably for Rudd, questions about the quality of the Labor Party leadership, the propriety of those who removed him from the Prime Minister's office or of who posted the now-infamous video of his rage on YouTube all are questions that should, he contends, be asked of ""others."" Thus he causes those others -- and we mostly know who he means -- to fall under suspicion. And in the resulting public imagery, it is not Rudd who is seeking to return to the Prime Minister's office; rather it is a semi-reluctant Rudd who is being ferried along by a group of ministers, MPs and Labor fixers who believe the only way that Labor can win against Tony Abbott and the Coalition at the next election is for Rudd to resume the leadership. Gillard calls for Australian Labor Party leadership vote . Their tactic has been to avoid having Rudd, unlike Keating, seen as an active seeker of his Prime Minister's job. The reasons are two-fold. The Rudd camp has not wanted to give the Prime Minister a reason to confront them head-on because to do so would be to risk provoking a leadership ballot before Rudd has assembled the numbers he needs -- and it's still doubtful that he has. Second, for Rudd to be seen publicly tearing at Gillard's leadership would play to a series of strong negatives -- that Rudd is motivated by revenge, that he has no regard for governance, that he is attacking a woman, that he has a monstrous sense of entitlement. It may even be true, as some of Rudd's campaigners have claimed privately in the past few days, that Rudd did not set out to regain his old job after he was deposed by Gillard back in mid-2010. That instead, the ongoing poor opinion polling for the Labor Party, some avoidable stumbles by Gillard, stubborn resentment within the electorate about the manner of her ascendancy and the blandishments of some of his colleagues combined to persuade Rudd that his return was feasible. But Rudd had to be seen to be drafted by his party back into the Prime Minister's office. Behind the scenes of Australia's political 'soap opera' That plan still seemed intact until 1.38pm on Saturday February 18, when a You Tube user, under the name of HappyVegemiteKR, uploaded a video showing a frustrated and increasingly furious Rudd attempting to complete a video message in the Chinese language but stumbling over the words. Filmed at least two years ago in his office, while he was Prime Minister, the video contained Rudd's unusable, profane outtakes, plenty of teeth-gnashing, wild-eyed fury, and blaming others including the ""dickheads in the embassy."" Because the footage most likely had been retained in a Government archive, suspicion falls on the Prime Minister's office or somewhere nearby as HappyVegemiteKR's source. This conspiracy Gillard denies, but the enquiry, Rudd says, is another of those ""questions for others."" Whatever its source, HappyVegemiteKR's video most likely will be remembered as much for the entertainment provided by a filthy Rudd, as for the trigger that brought his leadership challenge into the open. Rudd learned of HappyVegemiteKR's You Tube activity early on Saturday evening as he was eating a Thai take-away meal at his Brisbane home with Bruce Hawker, the Sydney-based political strategist who has guided many Labor election campaigns. Hawker is now openly connected to the Rudd campaign's camp and helped advise Rudd that night. ""The conspiracy theorists are out in number,"" says Hawker. ""But I was with him, and he was embarrassed and concerned and understood that he had to manage the problem quickly. The complication was that he was leaving the country the next morning. So the decision was made to contact Sky, which is a 24-hour news channel, and do an interview. As it turned out, I think that was the appropriate thing to do."" Prompted and legitimized by the leaked video, by midnight Saturday Rudd was on Sky News, effectively sending to the Labor Party and Australians a revised CV that set down his qualifications for another shot at the Prime Minister's job. Apologizing for his language in the video, he said he had changed since being deposed by Gillard almost 20 months ago. He had learned to delegate more, to become less angry and listen up - especially to his colleagues. It was a coded application for the return of his former job. And it was reinforced on Rudd's behalf on Monday morning when the former Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, publicly urged the Prime Minister to hold a leadership ballot. The Queensland band of brothers -- Rudd, Beattie and Bruce Hawker -- succeeded, finally, in flushing out publicly the Prime Minister's senior ministerial supporters to concede that which they have been careful for weeks not to: Gillard's leadership is under siege from within her own Cabinet and party room. Tactically the day was a victory for Rudd; the leadership issue was out in public and now, sooner or later, it will have to be confronted. There is anxiety and uncertainty on both sides over whether they have the numbers. Gillard is not going to a ballot, yet, and behaves as if life is business as usual in her dealings with the man she calls her foreign minister, usually (and unusually) not by his name. And Rudd is in the Mexican resort city of Los Cabos at a G20 meeting and will not return to Australia until the weekend. Will he force a challenge when parliament returns on February 27? Bruce Hawker -- a man who might know -- offers this: ""I think, nevertheless, once Rudd is back in town, there is going to be another buildup of pressure for this matter to be resolved once and for all."" Should Rudd force a ballot? ""I don't know exactly how this is going to be played out. There are various scenarios but one thing that seems completely implausible is that it's just going to go away and that people will forget about it and move on to another issue. This is a boil that has to be lanced."" Gillard, you would expect, knows that. She's wielded that lance before. Read the original piece in The Global Mail .

"(Mental Floss) -- Over the centuries, people have had some very good reasons to dress up like a member of the opposite sex. And I'm not talking about people who live this way out of personal preference, or those who dress up for theater and entertainment. Here are just five examples. 1. Cross-dressing to join the army . Until recently, women have rarely been allowed to serve as soldiers. So what was a gal to do if she wanted to serve her country? Naturally, disguise herself as a man and join the troops. At least 400 Civil War soldiers were women in drag. These included Union Army soldier ""Frank Thompson"" (also known as Sarah Edmonds), whose small frame and feminine mannerisms (rather than causing suspicion) made her an ideal spy, as she could spy on the Confederates disguised as... a woman! She wasn't the first woman to don a male disguise and join the army, though. During the Revolutionary War, women fought as men on both sides. Hannah Snell, for example, joined the British army to find her husband, who had walked out on her to enlist. Once her true sex was discovered (thanks to a pesky groin injury), she became a national celebrity in Britain, and made a post-war career of performing in bars as the ""Female Warrior."" Mental Floss: The Confederacy's plan to conquer Latin America . 2. Cross-dressing to keep a royal family together . With all the power play that went on in the court, the French royal family would go to great lengths to avoid sibling rivalry. In one of the more extreme cases, Philippe I, Duke of Orleans (1640-1701), was raised as a girl to discourage him from any political or military aspirations. This would make things easier for his brother, the future King Louis XIV. Philippe wore dresses and make-up, enjoyed traditionally feminine pursuits, and was even encouraged towards homosexuality. A girly man he might have been, but he married twice and even had a mistress. When necessary, he could even lead an army into battle. (This is the nation, after all, that gave us that famous cross-dresser Joan of Arc.) A brave commander, he would go into battle wearing high heels, plenty of jewelry and a long, perfumed wig. One of his wives claimed that Philippe's biggest fear when going into battle was not bullets, but the possibility of looking a mess. He avoided gunpowder (with the black smoke stains) and didn't wear a hat, to avoid ruining his hair. Mental Floss: 11 weird & wonderful wedding rings . 3. Cross-dressing to win Olympic glory . Dressing in drag has been part of the Olympics (on and off) since ancient times, when women were banned from the bulk of the Games. The Greek historian Pausanias of Damascus said that if a spectator was uncovered as a woman in male disguise, she was duly escorted off the premises... and thrown off a cliff. In later Games, the athletes started performing naked, and the crowd was also ordered to disrobe. It has been suggested that this was to ensure that they were all men. In the modern Olympics, there has been less disrobing -- and not much cross-dressing, either. Gender tests have been normal procedure since 1966 (for athletes, not spectators), so they couldn't really get away with it. Before that time, one of the strangest -- and most controversial -- cases was Polish sprinter Stanislawa Walasiewicz (aka Stella Walsh), who set 11 world records in her career, winning the 100-meter Olympic finals in 1932 with what one official described as ""long man-like strides."" After she died in 1980, however, it was revealed that she had indeed been a man. So had he deliberately set out to fool everyone all that time? Perhaps not. Walasiewicz had a condition known as ""mosaicism,"" which gave her male chromosomes. Did they give her an unfair advantage? It is difficult to say. However, if she tried out for the Olympics today, she would not be allowed to compete as a woman. Mental Floss: 13 medal-worthy Olympic stories . 4. Cross-dressing to commit espionage . There have been many instances of cross-dressing spies (including Sarah Edmonds, mentioned above), but one of the most impressive deceptions in history was carried out by Shi Pei-Pu, a singer with the Beijing Opera (in which, traditionally, all roles are played by men). In 1964 he disguised himself as a woman to seduce Bernard Boursicot, an attache in the French Foreign Service. Their affair lasted 20 years (on and off), during which Boursicot passed several official documents to Shi, believing that ""her"" safety was at risk if he didn't participate. After they were separated in 1965, Shi came back into Boursicot's life by claiming to be pregnant, and even revealed a baby boy. They later lived as a family. The happy couple was eventually arrested for espionage in 1983, and Shi's secret was revealed, Crying Game style, to the stunned Boursicot. But how did they have this romance for so long without Bousicot knowing the truth? Officially, they rarely made love, and always did it hurriedly and in darkness -- something that Boursicot always ascribed to Shi's demure Chinese upbringing. One theory, however, is that he always knew the truth, but played dumb to conceal his homosexuality. (He later came out.) The affair was the basis for the play ""M. Butterfly."" It was filmed in 1993, starring Jeremy Irons and former Beijing Opera player John Lone (better known for the title role in the film ""The Last Emperor""). 5. Cross-dressing to get rowdy . Hindu women in India have traditionally lived inhibited lives, tending the home for their families. But on one night each year, in the city of Jodhpur, they come to life at the so-called ""Festival of Fun."" Dressed as noblemen, complete with turbans and large fake mustaches, they walk the streets in gangs, brandishing sticks, beating any males who are foolish enough to be out there. The festival celebrates an ancient domestic dispute between the Hindu god Shiva and his wife Ganwar. While the women sing devotional songs asking the goddess to return to her husband, they also take this as their only opportunity to do what they long to do all year: behave like men. Their husbands, respecting the tradition, let them go wild. It sounds like fun (as long as you're not a clueless male who forgot to stay at home that night), but one thing concerns me: if a woman's disguise is especially good, does she risk being mistaken for a man and beaten up by her friends?

"(CNN) -- The United States and Iran cut diplomatic ties during the 1979 hostage crisis, and relations between the two countries today can only be described as tense. But that didn't stop a sharp-shooting U.S. basketball player from winding up his professional career in the Islamic republic. Kevin Sheppard -- a six-foot point guard who competed internationally for 10 years after playing college ball -- was one of 13 Americans recruited by the Iranian Super League in the fall of 2008. He joined Iran's only non-government-sponsored team, in the cultural center of Shiraz, mostly ""out of curiosity"" -- and immediately fell in love with the country. ""Iran was beautiful,"" Sheppard said. ""I saw something I'd never really seen on the news, heard from people or read in the newspaper."" What he saw was the generosity of the people -- they treated him to dinners, took him on tours of historic landmarks and welcomed him, a non-Muslim from the West, into their homes. A native of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Sheppard starred in both basketball and soccer for Jacksonville University in Florida. He decided to pursue a professional basketball career overseas, excelling as a shooter and playmaker on teams from Cuba and Venezuela to Australia and Israel. He stunned family and friends when he decided to play in Iran, where he averaged 26 points a game and eight assists as the team captain. Now retired from playing, his memories extend well beyond the basketball court. ""Sometimes you have to go out there and see it for yourself,"" the 32-year-old said. ""I thought if it's nice then I'm going to see one of the best things a lot of people on this side of the world will never see."" Sheppard was taken aback with the level of admiration and respect Iranians showed toward Americans. Despite being the highest-paid player, his teammates welcomed him, introducing Sheppard to their culture and hoping to benefit from his professionalism. ""They brought me in as a brother,"" Sheppard explains. ""And my job was to teach them how to play the game the mental way. They had skills, they could dunk and guys could shoot, but they lacked mental discipline."" Sheppard says he taught his teammates how to prepare for games, watch film and learn from scouting reports. He quickly emerged as the undisputed star and captain of Shiraz; regularly swarmed by young Iranian fans for his autograph. Every Thursday, sell-out crowds jammed the gym, with more than 3,000 fans cheering, ""Kevin! Kevin!"" That first year in Iran, Sheppard, along with another import, Serbian Zoran Majkic, led their team to the playoffs for the first time. ""I brought a sense of belief to them,"" Sheppard recalled. ""When I got there, they had no playoff aspirations. Once we started winning, they realized we can do something special."" By this time, American filmmaker Till Schauder, intrigued with Sheppard's Iranian adventure, had begun shooting a documentary of his success with the team and how he was adapting to life in a faraway land. Schauder and his Iranian-American wife Sara Nodjoumi said they were fascinated by the notion of an American playing basketball ""in a land allegedly full of nukes"" and enjoying every minute of it. In his initial conversations with the couple, Schauder said, ""he had us on the floor laughing."" ""Sara and I looked at each other and said if he's as clever and funny as he is on Skype then I'll stay in Iran and we'll make this film,"" Schauder said. But Sheppard, who also played for Azad University in the Iranian league until this year, had no idea he was about to become the star of what initially struck him as a 24/7 reality show. ""I was starting to think this was like 'Jersey Shore,' or some craziness,"" he said. ""I was like, man, I ain't gonna do this."" But Schauder and Nodjoumi hoped to make Sheppard's story much deeper than his basketball because he was breaking cultural barriers. For instance, Sheppard became close friends with three Iranian women, rare in a country where the sexes are forbidden from interacting in public. The bonding began with Hilda, the team physical therapist, and two friends who became Sheppard's translator and driver. The relationships gave Sheppard his first sense of human rights issues in Iran, especially the inequality between the sexes. ""It was really bad for women. Once I got to know some of the ladies it was so ... it was even worse,"" he says. ""Most of the women are so highly educated and can't use it to their potential. It was so sad."" But the filmmakers insist their documentary -- ""The Iran Job""-- is not meant to be a heavy-handed political documentary on a Middle East country fighting for its freedom. They felt that Sheppard's witty personality attracts colorful characters that bring playfulness and humor to an unusual story. ""Through sports we wanted to get into a society that is often misrepresented and misunderstood,"" Schauder said. ""Kevin had the same perception about these places as many Americans; he just goes there and shatters them."" Schauder continued filming the discussions and cultural exchanges Sheppard encountered both on and off court, but as the 2009 presidential elections and violent street protests took hold, it became increasingly difficult to gather footage of him on the streets of Tehran. Working as a one-man band, Schauder found himself filming non-stop for three to four hours at a time. With nothing but a backpack and endless tapes, he was extra cautious not to attract attention, often trying to blend in as a tourist. He would mail footage to his mother in Germany who would send it to his wife in New York -- in one case, 90 hours' worth. ""I mailed 80 tapes and kept the 10 I felt had the biggest nuggets with myself,"" Schauder says. ""I hid them in my underwear and socks out of fear. ""That was the scariest time for me because I knew that was great footage. I knew this was potentially a really good film if it ever gets to America."" Schauder, who had been denied a journalist's visa, freely traveled in and out of the country before his last planned trip near the end of the basketball season. Shortly before the June elections he was detained in Iran. He spent 24 hours in confinement before being sent back to the United States with no explanation. On the basketball court, Sheppard was unfazed by the street protests. However, off court he found himself enmeshed in the tangle of politics, current affairs and sports. ""I could see it on my teammates' faces,"" he said. ""Their relatives were being hurt and kidnapped. That's when it really hit me that this thing is real, and I just couldn't escape it."" Sheppard is now focusing on his after-school education program mentoring children in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The most talented are given the opportunity to meet basketball scouts in hopes of one day following in his footsteps. While still interested in visiting his friends back in Iran, he admits that might be difficult. ""After this documentary is released, I don't think I will want to go back -- they'll lock me up!""","American Kevin Sheppard played basketball in Iran from 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two years ago in June 2010, the war in Afghanistan surpassed the Vietnam War to become the longest war in American history. Although the U.S. ousted the Taliban from power and killed Osama bin Laden last year in Pakistan, it is clear that recent incidents, including the tragic killing of civilians by a U.S. soldier, are costing Americans the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan. As a result, there should be real concern that the lives of nearly 2,000 American troops and more than 14,000 Afghan civilians who have been killed during this decade-long war could have been lost in vain. The most recent blow to the NATO mission in Afghanistan is the dreadful story of an American soldier who apparently ""went rogue"" in a night-time shooting massacre and allegedly murdered at least 16 innocent civilians, including nine children and three women, Sunday morning near a U.S. base in southern Afghanistan. ""I am deeply saddened by the reported killing and wounding of Afghan civilians,"" President Obama immediately said in a statement. ""I offer my condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives, and to the people of Afghanistan, who have endured too much violence and suffering. This incident is tragic and shocking, and does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the United States has for the people of Afghanistan."" The killings come after several copies of the Quran were accidentally burned last month along with garbage and other materials seized from a detainee facility at Bagram Airfield. President Obama apologized to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, calling the burning ""an inadvertent error,"" but the subsequent furor led to violent protests and physical attacks in which 39 people died, including several American soldiers, and hundreds were wounded. In January, four American soldiers were caught on videotape standing over some Afghan corpses and urinating on the bodies while laughingly saying things like ""Have a great day, buddy."" U.S. officials denounced the actions and made clear it was unacceptable conduct, amounting to a violation of both the Geneva conventions and U.S. military law. In light of these three high-profile and polarizing incidents in Afghanistan within the last three months, prominent journalist Andrew Sullivan wrote that ""after the Koran burnings, I cannot see a future for U.S. forces in (Afghanistan). The pressure to quit before 2014 will grow."" He also said ""our cultures are far too far apart to mesh; and the more we insist on succeeding with an unwinnable transition, the deeper into the mire we go."" Afghanistan is well-known as the ""graveyard of empires."" It cast off the imperialist likes of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and the Mongol empire, the British Victorian colonial empire and most recently, the Soviet communist empire. ""No outside force has, since the Mongol invasion, ever pacified the entire country (of Afghanistan). ... Even Alexander the Great only passed through,"" former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in October, 2009. We have spent more than an entire decade trying to win the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan, we should remember the words of a 2009 CATO Institute policy paper which reminded us there is ""a reason why (Afghanistan) has been described as the 'graveyard of empires,' and unless America scales down its objectives, it risks meeting a similar fate."" As we look back over our 10-year mission in Afghanistan, we should remember that we have successfully struck back at Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, helped transition a more-than-slightly corrupt civilian government into power and somewhat improved the plight of women within the borders of Afghanistan. But we should also concede that the stories of a rogue soldier's killing spree and Quran burnings could be the lasting legacies of the longest war in American history -- and should be overwhelming reasons that we need to leave Afghanistan right now by beginning our troop withdrawal. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Arsalan Iftikhar.","Arsalan Iftikhar: Afghanistan War has lasted longer than Vietnam, anger growing .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan is facing a ""huge humanitarian crisis"" that requires support from the international community, the United Nations' refugee chief said Sunday. Nearly 80,000 refugees have entered the nation from neighboring Sudan, where fighting has flared in the states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said. And ethnic conflicts in South Sudan have displaced thousands, he said. ""My appeal is for the international community to stand by South Sudan and to support this country that became a sovereign state just six months ago to be able to cope with the challenges,"" Guterres told CNN in an interview via Skype from South Sudan. Last weekend, some 6,000 armed men from the Lou Nuer tribe marched on an area of South Sudan's Jonglei state, which is home to the rival Murle tribe, attacking the town of Pibor. Although the Lou Nuer fighters have left, following negotiations with U.N. peacekeepers and the South Sudan authorities, help is urgently needed for those who fled, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan said Friday. Beyond ethnic tensions, deficient health and education systems and a lack of infrastructure are significant obstacles for the nascent nation, he said. ""This is a baby that needs to be nurtured. And the international community, which made such good efforts in order to make sure the baby was born, now needs to go on with those efforts in order to make sure that the baby grows up and becomes an adult partner of the international community,"" Guterres said. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July, human rights monitors expressed concerns that long-standing grievances could lead to violence consuming the region again. The United Nations estimates that more than 1,100 people died and 63,000 were displaced last year by inter-communal violence in Jonglei, not taking into account the latest clashes. U.N. flights have delivered thousands of tents, kitchen sets, blankets, jerry cans, plastic sheets, sleeping mats, mosquito nets and other essential items to refugee camps in South Sudan in the past two and a half weeks. CNN's Jonathan Mann contributed to this report.","U.N. refugee chief: Nearly 80,000 refugees have entered South Sudan .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- As people head to the polls in New Hampshire, the campaigns will learn whether all the funds used for direct marketing to voters was money well-spent. Mailings, robocalls, phone surveys, doorknob hangers, mass e-mails, texts -- it's next to impossible to find a registered Republican or independent voter in the Granite State who hasn't received several of each. A group of voters in the Manchester area told CNN some left an impression but most wound up in the trash or had no impact on their decision. While every candidate sent out something to voters, the group said one politician in particular went beyond the others. ""With Romney, it's been almost a case of overkill,"" said Karin Page, a registered Republican and small business owner from Webster. ""I don't understand why if he's been leading the polls here all along."" Ben LaBrecque received several mailings and phone calls from the Romney campaign. But he seemed more understanding. ""It's a competition; I mean you can't ease up,"" said the Republican from Londonberry. ""If you want to win, you have to go 100%. I think that's what Mitt Romney's doing. So I think that makes sense."" That method didn't have the same effect on Roy Teresky, a registered Republican: ""My take on it is he spends an inordinate amount of time focus-group testing everything he says and sanitizing it to find the exact way to phrase it,"" Teresky said. In addition to multiple mailings from the Romney campaign, the vice president of sales and marketing at the Institute for Environmental Education also received several survey calls. ""It made me pay attention to what he's doing because I feel like everything is calculated."" But James Basbas said he sees it differently. The Republican from Manchester said he thinks it shows that Romney has a team in place that can take him all the way to the White House. ""I think having the political infrastructure to win a campaign is important, especially for a candidate who wants to go up against (President) Barack Obama,"" said Basbas, who has lived in the state most of his life and voted in several presidential primaries. ""He's done a lot of IDing of voters ... so he can understand who he needs to go after and who he needs to target."" Basbas said he has received at least two mailings each week from the Romney campaign for the past few months. The glossy fliers with images of Romney and quotes from people supporting him didn't win over Republican Fred Ashfar. ""I'm looking for substance,"" said the real estate consultant from Manchester. ""Empty promises are not really attractive to me. I'm looking for people who use straight talk and give promises that they can deliver on after the election."" Ashfar said he didn't get that from the mailings and phone calls. Most of the fliers wound up in his trash bin. One piece of marketing material did have an impact on Karin Page. ""There was one from Romney that I did actually open because it was almost like a booklet. It was interesting because it shows his Granite State supporters and a lot of the names in here are people that I support and like."" Their support for Romney made her take another look at the candidate. But on the same day she received that booklet two other Romney mailings arrived at her house. They landed in the garbage. Romney may have blitzed the state with mailings and phone calls. But Rep. Ron Paul followed closely behind him, according to the voters taking part in the discussion. But most of Paul's mailings were the opposite of Romney's glossy postcards. The Texas lawmaker's campaign often sent out long letters laying out the case for his positions on multiple issues. While Melinde Lutzbyrne's mailbox was refilled every day, her phone was also ringing often. ""I got a lot of robocalls. I got a lot of surveys,"" said Lutzbyrne, an independent voter from Bedford who said she felt the most effective ones came from Paul's campaign. ""I was impressed with two of them that actually caused me to go to an event in Nashua a few days ago."" She said the robocalls concerned issues about which she cared. She said she hadn't really looked at Paul's positions before these calls. The folks who participated in the conversation unanimously expressed disdain for the calls and mailings that attacked other candidates' positions. Yet they still received them from the campaigns or organizations supporting them.","Voters in Manchester area say some mailings leave impression but most end up in trash .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Rudolph Byrd, a prominent scholar of African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, died Friday after a long battle with multiple myeloma. He was 58. ""For many of us Rudolph was not only a symbol of dignity, propriety, determination, elegance and stamina, he embodied what it meant to live with purposefulness and grace, even to the very end,"" Earl Lewis, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, wrote Friday in announcing Byrd's death to the Emory community. Byrd joined Emory's faculty in 1991 and he gained accolades with such honors as the Thomas Jefferson Award and the Andrew W. Mellon fellowship from Harvard University. He was a founder of the James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference, and the founding co-chair of the Alice Walker Literary Society, named for ""The Color Purple"" author. As director of the Johnson Institute, which is dedicated to the study of civil rights history, Byrd helped create CNN Dialogues, a community forum ""that aims to highlight diverse ideas and perspectives"" on the current issues of the day. ""Through these myriad efforts, Rudolph sought to fuse his abiding belief that universities helped build civil societies by engaging broadly and vigorously,"" Lewis wrote in his statement. Nancy Seideman, associate vice president for university communications, knew Byrd since he joined Emory 20 years ago. She remembered him Friday as ""a wonderful scholar and a wonderful mentor ... who meant so much to all of us in the Emory community."" A graduate of Lewis & Clark College and Yale University, Byrd was the author of 10 books, including ""The World Has Changed: Conversations with Alice Walker."" Byrd had been on medical leave from the university for some weeks, and it was announced earlier this month that all treatment options had been exhausted. ""As others have said more than once in the last few weeks, Rudolph remained the consummate teacher: he taught us to live and how to die,"" Lewis said. Byrd is survived by his longtime partner, Henry Leonard. A memorial service will be held next week. CNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","Emory University's Rudolph Byrd was 58 .

"(CNN) -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will pay San Bruno, California, $70 million in restitution for the pipeline rupture that killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in September 2010, the utility and city said Monday. ""This money will be used for the benefit of all the citizens of our city and to help us, as a community, get beyond the tragedy and devastation caused by PG&E's explosion and fire,"" San Bruno Mayor Jim Ruane said in a joint news release. Federal officials said in August that a faulty pipe, flawed operations and inadequate government oversight led to the natural gas explosion in the San Francisco suburb. ""The community of San Bruno has suffered through a terrible tragedy and we understand that this accident will affect this community forever,"" PG&E President Chris Johns said. The city will establish a separate not-for-profit public purpose entity to manage the funds and determine how the restitution should be spent for the benefit of the community as a whole, the statement said. ""This $70 million payment is in addition to PG&E's commitment to fund replacement and repair of the city's infrastructure and other costs related to the accident and restoration of the neighborhood,"" it said. ""The utility will not seek to recover the contribution through insurance or customer rates."" During a public board meeting after delivering their final report on the matter, National Transportation Safety Board investigators sharply criticized pipeline owner PG&E for the explosion, saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956. That was compounded ""by a litany of failures"" over the years, including poor record-keeping, inadequate inspection programs and ""an integrity management program without integrity,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. ""It was not a question of if this pipeline would burst,"" she said. ""It was a question of when."" Hersman said the probe yielded ""troubling revelations about a company that exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight, and government agencies that placed a blind trust in operators to the detriment of public safety.""","Money from PG&E will benefit all citizens, San Bruno's mayor says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is still remembered as one of the worst days in the history of modern sailing. The Fastnet race still remains one of the biggest events in the yachting calendar. Yet the Fastnet tragedy of 1979 in which 15 people were killed and ex-British leader Edward Heath went missing helped to usher in a new era of improved safety in the sport. It was 30 years ago today that a freak storm struck over 300 vessels competing in the 600-mile yacht race between England and Ireland. Mountainous seas and vicious high winds sunk or put out of action 25 boats. The British rescue attempt turned into an international effort with a Dutch warship and trawlers from France also joining the search. In spite of the biggest rescue operation launched by the UK authorities since the Second World War a total of 15 people died. Some of them drowned and others succumbed to hypothermia. Six of those lost went missing after their safety harnesses broke. ""It was a catastrophic event that had far-reaching consequences for the sport, the biggest of which was in the design and safety of the boats,"" Rodger Witt, editor of the UK-based magazine Sailing Today told CNN. ""Most people in the sailing community at the time knew someone who was involved in one way or another. I had a friend who lost his father. It was devastating."" In total 69 yachts did not finish the race. The former British prime minister, Edward Heath disappeared at the height of the storm, though he later returned to shore safe from harm. The corrected-time winner of the race was the yacht ""Tenacious"", owned and skippered by Ted Turner, the founder of CNN. Witt said that in the aftermath of the disaster the rules governing racing were tightened to ensure boats carried more ballast. Improvements were also made to the safety harnesses that tied crewmen to their boats, many of which proved ineffective in the tragedy. It also became mandatory for all yachts to be fitted with radio communication equipment and all competitors were expected to hold sailing qualifications to take part. At the time of the tragedy the Fastnet race was the last in a series of five races which made up the Admiral's Cup competition, the world championship of yacht racing. Competitors from around the globe attempted the route which sets off from the Isle of Wight, off the English south coast, and rounds the Fastnet rock on the southeast coast of Ireland. Roger Ware was in charge of handling press for the event on behalf of the organizers, the Royal Ocean Racing Club. Ware said that even today the tragedy ""still spooks me."" The racers set off on a Saturday but it wasn't till three days later that the authorities in the English coastal town of Plymouth realized there was a problem. The press team was based at the Duke of Cornwall hotel in Plymouth and early Tuesday morning Ware got a call from his superiors to go to the hotel immediately in order to field calls from journalists. ""The night before we'd noticed high winds but there'd been no forecast of bad weather so we didn't think much of it,"" Ware told CNN. ""As the morning progressed though, we heard that more and more boats were missing. It became obvious a tragedy was unfolding."" Ware said the worst part for him was fielding calls from concerned relatives. ""The Royal Ocean Racing Club headquarters was overloaded so calls were getting transferred to the press team. ""I found myself talking to a woman whose husband I knew was in one of the boats where there'd been fatalities. I couldn't give her the information she wanted and to this day I still think about that telephone call.""","The 1979 Fastnet race ended in tragedy after a freak storm hit competitors .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- I pitied the other tourists at the car rental lot at the Los Angeles airport: The sight of two Englishmen in their mid-30s sinking uncertainly into a white Mustang convertible is not pleasant. The car was not a natural fit for us. It was very low to the ground and had a mystifying set of buttons. This meant 20 minutes of painstaking trial and error as we grappled with how to work the roof, as if trying to break the Enigma code. But as alien as the muscle car was, it was vital to this trip to California, which was essentially to reclaim lost youth in an early midlife crisis. My companion and I had lived in Los Angeles after leaving university and were curious to see how it had changed. We then planned to drive along the coast to San Francisco, taking in some of California's wine-growing regions. This invited unkind comparisons to the movie ""Sideways,"" which sees aging college friends on a road trip drinking wine and navigating disaster. L.A. has some features that can deter tourists: It lacks a natural focal point, is dominated by roadways and has an abundance of depressing motels and fast-food joints. It also has Venice, a pocket of urban bohemia that has acted as a cultural center for decades. Developed in 1905 by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney, the area derives its name from the canals built to drain off the marshland. It was conceived as a family beach resort but fell into neglect. As real estate prices dropped, the area began to attract an eclectic mix of people. This instilled that bohemian DNA into Venice, which served as a rallying point for the Beat generation in the 1950s and remains an important artistic center. 10 top road trip apps . Much of Venice has hardly changed. The chaotic beachfront boardwalk is alive and well: Tattoo artists, head shops and fortune-tellers hawk their wares to a stream of human traffic, even in winter. We stayed in a free-wheeling art deco style hotel that looked like it had not changed in 40 years. Elsewhere, there are signs of inevitable gentrification. The memory of Venice's developer is preserved in Abbot Kinney Boulevard, a mile-long artery and focal point for residents and local businesses. I walked down the palm-lined street every day when I lived in Venice and always enjoyed its offbeat charm. It was a relief to see the hipsterish local coffee bar Abbot's Habit was still dosing the population and exhibiting local art. But around it, stylish galleries, boutiques and swanky condos now give the road a feeling of imposing wealth, resembling New York's Chelsea district -- certainly the chic end of Boho-chic. The neighborhood has become safer and cleaner, said Joshua Woollen, owner of Urbanic Paper Boutique. Gang-related activity has dropped, and ""what you have now are some of the most influential, creative, progressive and cutting-edge people living within a couple mile radius in one small beach community,"" Woollen said. ""When my wife and I first moved to Venice over 13 years ago, Abbot Kinney felt like a ghost town,"" he said. Perhaps the most dramatic change was seeing the property where I once lived in harder times. Once a teeming human zoo of chancers and borderline personalities, the three houses have been divided and sold. The rough neighborhood is now transformed into a quiet and sunny residential street. I would happily move back. Feeling considerably older already, we began the ""Sideways"" leg of the journey. Channeling the film, the car's top was lowered and we took off along the ravishing Pacific Coast Highway. Hugging California's coastline for 655 miles, the road offers the serenity and endless vastness of the Pacific Ocean as a backdrop. The terrain changes as you head north, taking in plains, craggy headlands and lush green hills that tumble down into the sea. All our heightened expectations were met and rewarded. An hour after leaving Los Angeles, we reached Santa Barbara County. Long overshadowed by the Napa region farther north, Santa Barbara was put on the wine tourist's map by the release of the Oscar-winning film in 2004. Its influence was immediate. ""Its timing created a tsunami of interest,"" says Jim Fiolek of the Santa Barbara Vintners Association. ""Recognition in not only Santa Barbara County, but wine in general, more specifically, Pinot Noir, which flourishes in Santa Barbara."" With mountain ranges running horizontally across the county, Santa Barbara channels ocean air into its valleys and has a cool climate. This geographical oddity makes it a natural home for Pinot Noir grapes, which can ripen too early in warmer temperatures. As one ""Sideways"" character explains in loving tones: ""It's not a survivor like Cabernet, which can just grow anywhere and uh, thrive even when it's neglected. No, Pinot needs constant care and attention. You know? And in fact it can only grow in these really specific, little, tucked-away corners of the world."" At first, the region struggled to cope with the surge in interest generated by the film: Tasting rooms were hastily built on vineyards, leading to a jump in sales. By 2008, wine makers were selling directly to customers some eight times as much as they were selling in 2000. Santa Barbara is a natural target for a day trip from Los Angeles and has the inevitable ""Sideways"" tour guide for visitors, which generated geekish excitement. We took in a few gems: The Day's Inn motel boasting a looming windmill and mock Tudor facade; Ostrich World, which gives you the bizarre opportunity of feeding hungry flocks; and a vineyard which features in one memorable scene. I am far from an oracle on wine, but it's not hard to enjoy the distinctly civilized process of tasting. Visitors to Kalyra Winery gather at a bar featured in the movie and pay $10 to taste eight wines. They can be a mix of red and white and each measure gives the drinker several sips. At the vineyard, we sampled Grenache, Pinot and a blend of Shiraz, Merlot and Cab Franc. Tastings are also an inducement to buy bottles, which start at around $15 and provide estates with their main source of profit. Our final destination was on a grander scale altogether: the Napa and Sonoma valleys north of San Francisco. Here, you get the idea of a real industry geared around global exports as much as local sales. There are some 400 wineries in the region, so the visitor can feel overwhelmed on first arrival. We opted to plan our itinerary on the discerning basis of which vineyards offered two-for-one tasting deals. Most tourists are not averse to sampling wine in the morning, and our first stop took us to Buena Vista, which claims to be the oldest winery in the region. Revealingly, it has been recently taken over by a French brand. The scenery around the valleys is reliably lovely year-round. In fall, the countryside turns a languid golden color, with neatly ordered rows of vineyards set off by the surrounding hills. Driving slowly in the late autumn sun was almost a religious obligation, despite the ensuing tailbacks. On my return flight, I resolved to plan a series of similar midlife crises for years to come.","Two Englishmen in their thirties hit the road in a Mustang convertible .

"(AP) --   The world's largest jetliner made aviation history Thursday, completing its first commercial flight from Singapore to Sydney with 455 passengers, some of them ensconced in luxury suites and double beds. Australians Tony and Julie Elwood share a romantic moment on their double bed in an exclusive suite aboard the Airbus 380. The Airbus superjumbo lifted off from Singapore's Changi Airport and landed about seven hours later in Sydney. Also aboard Flight SQ380 was a crew of about 30, including four pilots. Flight attendants handed out champagne and certificates to passengers, some of whom paid tens of thousands of dollars in an online auction for seats. ""I have never been in anything like this in the air before in my life,"" said Australian Tony Elwood, reclining with his wife, Julie, on the double bed in their private first-class suite. ""It is going to make everything else after this simply awful,"" he said, sipping Dom Perignon champagne after a lunch of marinated lobster and double boiled chicken soup. He paid $50,000 for the two places. The double-decker A380 ends the nearly 37-year reign of the Boeing 747 jumbojet as the world's most spacious passenger plane. Its European manufacturer, Airbus SAS, also claims that the A380 is the most fuel efficient and quietest passenger jet ever built. Thomas Lee, who was also on the Boeing 747's first commercial flight from New York to London in 1970, described the latest experience as ""spectacular ... fantastic ... incredible."" ""It was a festive atmosphere, I can tell you. Everybody was excited. People were up out of their seats in the aisle. It was quite difficult for the cabin crew to do their job ... not like a normal flight I can assure you,"" he said. The A380 was delivered to Singapore Airlines on Oct. 15, nearly two years behind schedule after billions of dollars in cost overruns for Airbus. Still, the wait was worth it, says Singapore Airlines, which got the exclusivity of being the plane's sole operator for 10 months. ""This is indeed a new milestone in the timeline of aviation,"" said Chew Choon Seng, chief executive of Singapore Airlines (SIA) in a speech before the departure. The Boeing 747 jumbo jet generally carries about 400 passengers. The A380 -- as tall as a seven-story building with each wing big enough to hold 70 cars -- is capable of carrying 853 passengers in an all-economy class configuration. However, Singapore Airlines opted for 471 seats in three classes -- 2 Singapore Airlines Suites, 60 business class and 399 economy class. Each suite, enclosed by sliding doors, is fitted with a leather upholstered seat, a table, a 23-inch flat screen TV, laptop connections and a range of office software. A separate bed folds up into the wall. Two of the suites can be joined to provide double beds, one of which the Elwoods occupied. On the upper deck, business class seats can turn into wide flat beds, while the economy class seats on both decks have more leg and knee room, the carrier says. Business class passengers also have a bar area. Francis Wu, a student from San Francisco who turned 22 on the flight, was updating his journal on the in-flight computer system when airline crew surprised him with a white chocolate cake and a song. ""This is the best birthday I have ever had in my whole life,"" he said. SIA auctioned most of the seats on the inaugural flight on eBay, raising $1.26 million for charity. The highest bidder was Briton Julian Hayward who bought two suite seats for $100,380. He was the first passenger to board. SIA has ordered 19 of the A380s, hoping to benefit from a boom in air travel that has seen global air traffic growing 5 to 10 percent a year. Dubai-based Emirates, Airbus' largest A380 customer with 55 on order, will take its first delivery in August. Not all analysts are convinced that the plane, which has a list price of $320 million, will be a success. ""I see there's some demand for the A380, but it's an expensive way to address a small market,"" said Standard & Poor's Equity Research analyst Shukor Yusof. Shukor said the market was set to be dominated by mid-sized, long haul two-engine aircraft such as the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which offers greater fuel efficiency than four-engine jets of the same size. He pointed out that orders for the 787 have exceeded 700. The A380 has received 165 orders to date. Shukor noted that Singapore Airlines renews its fleet frequently to maintain an average age of about six years. Once the planes are older than six years, Singapore Airlines might have trouble selling them, he said. ""What would happen if the plane didn't meet their expectations, say, in a year? Would SIA be tempted to sell it? What is the secondary value of the plane? It has not been commercially tested yet,"" Shukor said.

"(Financial Times) -- China, the biggest consumer of cotton, has lodged a formal protest against India's ban on cotton exports amid signs that India is rethinking the ban that was implemented a few days ago. Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, urgently requested a group of cabinet members to review the ban after the country's agriculture minister said that the curbs on the fibre would hurt farmers. The outcome of the review would be made public today, a statement from the prime minister's office said. An official in the prime minister's office said cabinet members were likely to lift the ban. ""There is a realistic, high chance that the ban will be lifted,"" the official told the Financial Times. The U-turn is, however, not certain as New Delhi balances its relationship with Beijing and the interests of its farmers with the concerns of its powerful textile industry. The abrupt policy changes are adding further volatility to the cotton market after two years of sharp swings in prices. Cotton rose to an all-time high of more than $2 a pound last year amid a shortage in part created by an export ban by India, only to fall afterwards to less than $1 after cotton mills defaulted on contracts. Cotton traders including Cargill, Noble Group and Glencore suffered big losses as a result. Cotton prices have risen this year after India banned exports for the second time in two years. India, the second-largest producer of cotton, instituted the ban with immediate effect on March 5, in a move aimed at ensuring sufficient supply of cotton for domestic textile companies. India's move came after China had aggressively bought bales over the past year for a government reserve as a way of supporting domestic farm prices and buffering against price volatility. By late January, China had bought as many as 5m bales of foreign cotton for the reserve which, along with its domestic purchases, made up 15 per cent of global cotton consumption in the current crop year, the US Department of Agriculture estimated. This week, Sharad Pawar, agriculture minister, wrote to the prime minister the day after the ban demanding that export of the fibre be allowed. He complained that due to higher production this year, farmers were already suffering from lower prices than they had expected and needed to export to recover their domestic losses. However, India's commerce ministry, which enforced the ban, said domestic textile companies had been complaining that they were finding it hard to compete with rivals in Bangladesh and Pakistan because of rising cotton prices in India. The trade regulator's move is expected to push down cotton prices in the country. Cotton for May delivery was up 0.9 per cent to 90.90 cents a pound on New York's ICE Futures US exchange. Futures peaked earlier this week at 94 cents. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, urgently requested a group of cabinet members to review the ban .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN)  -- President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner announced Thursday a ""contingency plan"" to confront the problems affecting Argentina's economy, which has been rocked by the international financial crisis. Farmers in Argentina went on strike in October to demand the government lower export taxes. Fernandez said her goal was to increase domestic consumption -- in the face of a drop in demand for exports -- in order to sustain Argentina's economic growth and avoid a rise in unemployment. ""The restrictions come from outside the country, not from inside, and we are backing this contingency plan precisely because of those restrictions, because of those policies that are devastating the world as we know it,"" she said. She said the government would set aside about $4 billion as an incentive to be used for consumption -- loans to buy household appliances and credits to maintain activity in the auto industry -- though she did not say where those funds would come from. In addition, the central bank will offer financing at 11 percent to companies that promise not to lay off employees, the government announced. One economist welcomed the moves. ""The measures tend, on the one hand, to reactivate the levels of consumption that have been beaten back, especially in the last month, particularly in durable goods, the auto industry and household appliances,"" economist Dante Sica said. ""Second is a program that tends, in its line of financing, to inject liquidity into the business sector, especially the industrial and farm sectors that are paying interest rates above 35 percent."" The government also announced a 5 percent decrease in withholding tax for the export of wheat and corn -- taxes that had stirred fierce debate in the country -- -and the launch of two plans, Wheat Plus and Corn Plus, which will result in another 1 percentage point drop in the withholding tax when production increases. Representatives of the business sector applauded the announcements, saying they underscore the importance of restoring credit in the country and making efforts to keep people employed. But the reaction of the rural sector was mixed, with the Farming Intercooperative Federation calling the measures good but insufficient and the Argentine Agrarian Federation saying they won't solve farmers' problems. Ricardo Haussman, an economics professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, predicted the economic crisis would cause much of Latin America to grapple with difficulties in the coming months. ""The effect is going to be big,"" he said. ""2009 is going to be very difficult for Latin America, in part, because obviously there is a very important fall in the price of Latin American commodity exports and, in part, because the drop in industrial activity will affect the manufacturing sectors of Mexico and Central American, which are connected to the economic activity in the United States."" More importantly, he said, was the freezing of the international financial system and a general lack of access to financing. ""This translates into difficulties in maintaining lines of credit for export and difficulties for countries with external debt to find refinancing."" He called on the U.S. government, ""which has access to financing that nobody else has,"" to use it to redirect resources so that Latin American countries can find financing. Haussman, who is Venezuelan, said the situation in his home country was particularly fragile, ""because the president has been spending thinking that the price of petroleum would be somewhere else.""","NEW: Much of Latin America to struggle in economic crisis, professor predicts .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian labor unions resumed talks with the government Sunday in a bid to reach a deal to stop a national strike over soaring fuel prices, sources close to the negotiations said. President Goodluck Jonathan participated directly in the discussions, they said. Late-night wrangling ended earlier in the day without a compromise. Oil labor unions will not shut down production of crude as planned, according to union sources who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks. Last week, a major oil union, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, threatened to halt production Sunday in solidarity with protesters if the two sides don't reach an agreement. A move to halt production would reverberate on the global market -- Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest crude exporter. Throngs of protesters have taken to the streets to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies that ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. Scattered protests escalated into a national strike that started Monday, paralyzing the nation of more than 160 million people. Union leaders called for a temporary suspension to the national strikes for the weekend to allow protesters to stock up on food and water, but said they would resume Monday if the subsidies are not reinstated. ""The whole labor movement will return to strike Monday but negotiations are continuing,"" said Elijah Okubu, president of NUPENG, another oil workers' union. ""Negotiation is the hallmark of industrial relations."" Nigerians flocked to stores Sunday to buy basic necessities amid uncertainty on how long protests will last once they resume. Long lines snaked around gas stations, as crowds flooded markets to buy food. Demonstrations started as an outcry against the removal of fuel subsidies and grew into anger against government corruption. Nigerians consider the subsidies one of the few benefits of living in an oil-producing nation that has little infrastructure, high unemployment and intermittent electricity. The protests -- dubbed ""Occupy Nigeria"" -- have galvanized the continent's most populous nation. Nigerians accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. The government has said the removal will free up billions this year to boost the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure; Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Nigerians should not let the past determine the future. She said the goal now is to regain the citizens' trust and move forward. ""They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,"" she said. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report .","NEW: President Goodluck Jonathan is participating directly in the talks, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Downgrade -- the most feared word in Europe's financial lexicon. Most attention Friday was focused on France -- Europe's second largest economy -- as Standard & Poor's cut its rating on French sovereign debt. But the debt of several other countries also received the Mark of Cain, including Italy, Spain, Portugal and Austria, whose debt rating was cut by one notch from its AAA status. Austria's inclusion might come as a surprise to those who don't follow the bond markets. Its economy -- by European standards -- is thriving. The Governor of Austria's Central Bank, Ewald Nowotny, described the downgrade as ""politically motivated"" and asserted: ""The structure of the Austrian economy is well-balanced; output has been evolving dynamically at above-average rates; Austria has a sizeable current account surplus; and it is the EU country with the lowest unemployment rate [just 4 per cent]."" But Austria has two problems. Its budget deficit has ballooned and now stands at 4.6 percent of GDP (although by European standards that's toward the lower end of the spectrum.) Finance Minister Maria Fekter told Austrian television Sunday that health spending, pension obligations and the state railway system are in the crosshairs as the government looks for annual budget savings in excess of $2 billion. Opposition parties say the government has been slow to act -- knocking investor confidence. As in the United States and elsewhere in Europe there is fierce debate in Austria over the balance between tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit. Secondly, Austria can't pick its neighbors. To the south is Italy, Austria's second largest trading partner, where the new technocratic government of Mario Monti is embarking on an austerity program and where the economy is struggling to avoid recession. Austrian banks do a lot of business in Italy and a lot in central and south-eastern Europe. Another neighbor is Hungary, where the government recently forced local banks to let millions of homeowners repay foreign currency loans at below market rates. That's hurting Hungarian banks because millions of householders took out mortgages in Swiss francs in recent years and now can't keep up with repayments. And when Hungarian banks sneeze, Austrian banks catch cold. They have loans worth nearly $50 billion in Hungary alone. Last year, one major Austrian bank with considerable exposure in Hungary failed the European Union's ""stress tests"" -- and has since been selling assets to fortify its balance sheet. The Austrian government may have to pump more capital into the country's main banks, but for now Austrian banking officials tell CNN the banks can probably raise the capital they need to pass the next round of ""stress tests"" held by the European Banking Authority. Even so, Central Bank governor Nowotny acknowledges that measures need to be taken to ""ensure the sustainability of the business model of Austrian banks active in central and eastern Europe."" There is only so much that the Austrians can do. Much depends on Hungary's tortured negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union over a bailout for its stricken finances. All three ratings agencies have reduced Hungary's credit-worthiness to ""junk"" status. The chief Hungarian negotiator, Tamas Fellegi, is on a tour of European capitals this week, and sources in Vienna say he will meet the Austrian Finance Minister and Central Bank governor on Thursday. It should be an interesting exchange of views. The Austrians and the European Central Bank have been highly critical of ""populist"" measures by the Hungarian government led by Viktor Orban that have hurt the banking sector. But Orban is under pressure at home not to yield to international pressure. At the weekend, protesters took to the streets of Budapest with banners demanding ""Hands Off Hungary."" Some commentators have begun talking of Hungary as the ""Greece of eastern Europe."" Reuters' Kathleen Brooks blogged last week: ""Once again a small, relatively unknown economy is dominating the headlines and causing a massive headache for the European authorities."" We've been there before. In May 1931 Austria's largest bank, Credit Anstalt, collapsed suddenly. It had built up an unenviable portfolio of bad loans, but they were hidden from public view. As Austrians raced to retrieve their savings, and governments squabbled over a rescue package, panic spread quickly to other European countries. Banks in the Netherlands and Poland collapsed. Some economic historians believe Anstalt's failure triggered what would become known as the Great Depression.","Austria's credit downgrade hidden behind France but could have wide repercussions .

"(CNN) -- Bosnian police have recaptured a former member of Serb paramilitary forces who escaped from prison nearly five years ago, authorities said.

MOEX, which owned 10% of the Macondo well, has agreed to pay $70 million in civil penalties to fulfill its share of alleged violations of the Clean Water Act. Of that amount, $45 million will go toward the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which pays for any response actions, cleanup and damages caused by future spills. Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas will receive $25 million divvied up between the states accordingly. The remaining $20 million will go to land acquisition projects in several Gulf states with the aim of funding environmental and natural resource-protected habitats. ""The companies are pleased to have resolved these claims,"" a spokesman for MOEX said Friday. The settlement is the largest civil penalty ever recovered under the Clean Water Act, instituted in 1972. ""The Department of Justice has not wavered in its commitment to hold all responsible parties fully accountable for what stands as the largest oil spill in U.S. history,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""This landmark settlement is an important step -- but only a first step -- toward achieving accountability and protecting the future of the Gulf ecosystem by funding critical habitat preservation projects."" The three-month-long spill was triggered after an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20, 2010. Eleven people were killed in the blast. MOEX is the first company to settle with the U.S. government, which still has several claims outstanding against eight other defendants -- including BP Exploration and Production Inc., the majority owner on the doomed well.","MOEX Offshore owned 10% of the well that was involved in the 2010 Gulf oil disaster .

"(CNN) -- Didier Drogba scored the only goal as Chelsea beat Juventus 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to give Guus Hiddink's side a slender advantage ahead of their Champions League last-16 second leg in Turin. Didier Drogba celebrates his goal as Chelsea took a narrow advantage after their home tie against Juventus. Drogba, his season hampered by injury, suspension and a fallout with axed coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, looked back to his predatory best when he took a pass from Salomon Kalou and despatched the ball beyond Gianluigi Buffon in the 12th minute. Former Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri, now in charge of Juve, was given a warm reception by the home fans before the game. Ranieri is still held in high esteem by Chelsea supporters even though he failed to win a single trophy during his four-year stint at Stamford Bridge. Hiddink was taking charge of a Chelsea side at home for the first time since his temporary appointment and it was the hosts who made the first inroads towards goal with Jose Bosingwa forcing Buffon into a save with a left-foot shot from the edge of the area in the fourth minute. Four minutes later Drogba almost opened the scoring when he got ahead of his marker to turn a cross from Bosingwa just over the crossbar. But the Ivorian put the home side in front in the 12th minute when a superb through ball from Kalou provided him with a clear-cut shooting opportunity and Drogba supplied the required finish in style. It was the perfect start for the Premier League side although Juventus claimed Drogba was offside before he fired the ball home from 10 yards. In the 15th minute, Drogba should have made it two when he met a corner from Frank Lampard inside the six-yard box, but he inexplicably headed wide. Juventus enjoyed plenty of possession after the interval but found the Chelsea defense in fine form, with Petr Cech only having to deal with a succession of long-range efforts. Marco Marchionni and Alessandro del Piero both tried their luck from distance and Pavel Nedved went close near the end for the visitors. Chelsea also had chances to double their lead, notably when a 20-yard effort from Nicolas Anelka flashed inches wide, but Chelsea held on for the victory. ""We maybe should have scored a second goal to give us some breathing space for the second leg. I felt we suffered a little bit in the second half and Juventus are a difficult side to play, but I'm happy with the result,"" Hiddink told Sky Sports.","Chelsea beat Juventus 1-0 to give them advantage in the Champions League .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi continued his sensational scoring form with a hat-trick as Barcelona set a new Spanish record of 16 successive league victories on Saturday. The two-time world player of the year netted all three goals against Atletico Madrid to take his total to the season in all competitions to a staggering 40. The Argentina forward also moved one ahead of Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo's previous leading La Liga tally of 23. Real's 1960-61 team, spearheaded by Argentina-born Alfredo Di Stefano, held the previous record. Josep Guardiola's team went 10 points clear of Real, who host Real Sociedad on Sunday, and have now scored 70 goals from 22 league matches -- the most of any team in the main European divisions. Barca have also conceded only 11 times in that period, and the closest they came to a 12th against Atletico at Camp Nou was when Gerard Pique cleared off the line from Felipe Luis with the score at 2-0. Messi broke the deadlock in the 17th minute as he cut in from the right in trademark fashion and fired a left-foot shot from the edge of the box across goalkeeper David de Gea. The 23-year-old doubled the lead in the 28th minute, pouncing after David Villa's threaded pass bounced kindly into his path. The forward duo combined again for the third with 11 minutes to play, with Messi this time teeing up Villa and then reacting fastest when the Spain international's shot rebounded off the legs of De Gea. It was Messi's first hat-trick of 2011, coming off his six in the previous calendar year. He is now on course to easily surpass last season's tally of 47 with more than two months left to play. Messi also hit the crossbar with a second-half free-kick, but was booked for taking it too quickly. The result left Atletico in seventh place on goal difference above Getafe, who won 4-1 at home to Deportivo La Coruna earlier on Saturday. Villarreal retained third place despite suffering a shock 1-0 home defeat by Levante, who moved off the bottom thanks to Valmiro Valdo's winning goal three minutes after halftime. The former Espanyol midfielder collected a long pass and rounded goalkeeper to inflict Villarreal's first home defeat since May, having dropped points only once at El Madrigal this season against fourth-placed Valencia. Athletic Bilbao moved up to fifth with a 3-0 win at home to Sporting Gijon, who had defender Gregory Arnolin sent off for a second booking that led to David Lopez's 15th-minute penalty opener. Gaizka Toquero doubled the lead in the 28th minute and striker Fernando Llorente sealed victory in the second half. The Basques leapfrogged Espanyol, whose European qualification hopes were hit by a 3-2 defeat at second-bottom Almeria. The Barcelona-based team could not come back from a 3-0 deficit inside 18 minutes. That result put Malaga, who travel to Sevilla on Sunday, at the foot of the table. Real Zaragoza were held 1-1 at home by struggling Racing Santander, while Mallorca earned the same result at Osasuna. In Italy, Udinese moved up to fifth place with a 2-0 win at home to Sampdoria as Chile midfielder Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring in the 18th minute and striker Antonio Di Natale netted his 100th league goal before halftime. Sampdoria, who sold star strikers Antonio Cassano and Giampaolo Pazzini last month, suffered a fourth consecutive defeat to be 13th in the Serie A table. Juventus lifted the pressure on coach Luigi Delneri with a 3-1 victory at Cagliari that lifted the Turin club up to seventh. January signing Alessandro Matri scored the opening two goals against his former club, while veteran striker Luca Toni came off the bench to seal victory six minutes from the end with his first for Juve. In Sunday's top games, leaders AC Milan travel to Genoa, champions Inter Milan host Roma, second-placed Napoli are at home to Cesena and Lazio welcome Chievo.","Barcelona beat Atletico Madrid 3-0 to set new record of consecutive La Liga wins .

"(CNN) -- Mexico ended 2009 with a record number of drug-related deaths, greatly surpassing the then-record tally reached in 2008, unofficial counts indicate. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said earlier this year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008. Officials say more than 15,000 Mexicans have died since Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006. Some observers, such as former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have likened the situation to a civil war. The vast majority of the deaths have been among criminals, not civilians, Calderon and other Mexican officials have said repeatedly. Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, leads all other Mexican cities in the number of deaths, news report say. There were more than 2,575 slayings in the city in 2009, according to a tally by TV station XHIJ. Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN he could not confirm that number but that it sounded correct. There were 1,600 homicides in the city in 2008. ""This has been a very difficult year. Very complicated,"" Reyes said Thursday in a telephone interview. Chihuahua state, in which Ciudad Juarez is located, accounted for 30 percent of the nation's drug-related killings, according to news reports. Juarez is the central battleground for two organized crime gangs -- the Juarez and Pacific cartels. Those cartels are fighting for the lucrative market across the border in the United States. Gangs affiliated with the cartels have heightened the violence as they fight for turf in street-level sales in Ciudad Juarez, Reyes said. The Aztecas gang, he said, is allied with the Juarez Cartel and has 7,000 members. More than 1,200 Azteca members are in jail, Reyes said. Two gangs are affiliated with the Pacific Cartel -- the Mexicles and the Artistas Asesinos (Assassin Artists). The Mexicles has about 1,200 members and the Artistas Asesinos, commonly know as the AA, has around 600 members, Reyes said. ""There is a very strong fight between those two groups,"" Reyes said. Despite the dire situation, Reyes sees a brighter 2010. The appointment of a new federal attorney general in September has led to more personnel being appointed to Ciudad Juarez, Reyes said. That, in turn, has led to more prosecutions, the mayor said. Reyes also said a new state law in Chihuahua makes it harder for crime suspects to plea bargain or receive lenient sentences. But he points to a nongovernmental program as a major step toward fighting the bad guys: Ciudad Juarez starts working Friday with Crime Stoppers International, a community-based private organization that receives anonymous tips from residents and passes them along to law enforcement authorities. The organization has 1,200 programs worldwide, Crime Stoppers President Gary Murphy said. Mexico is the first country in Latin America to work with Crime Stoppers, and Ciudad Juarez is the only city in the world to contract directly with the group, Murphy and Reyes said. Everywhere else, the anti-crime group works with community organizations. The city contacted Canada-based Crime Stoppers this summer, Murphy said. It was a necessary step, Reyes said, because Juarez residents ""lost confidence in the police a long time ago."" Tipsters will call an 800 number that does not have caller ID or any other way to identify the caller, Murphy and Reyes said. The calls will not be answered in Mexico or the United States, but in an undisclosed nation. Reyes calls it ""a sophisticated system that is digital, anonymous and coded."" The mayor said he believes Juarez residents will embrace the program because they are familiar with Crime Stoppers, which has been used in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for more than 30 years and also in El Paso, right across the border. ""Crime Stoppers is well-known in Juarez,"" he said. ""It will be easy to convince them."" Crime Stoppers guarantees anonymity, Murphy said. ""This way they can pass along the information and not have to worry about the repercussions,"" he said. ""It's the major reason people call Crime Stoppers no matter where they are in the world."" CNN's Mario Gonzalez and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","National media say 7,600 Mexicans died in the war on drugs in 2009 .

"(CNN Student News) -- July 27, 2011 . Download a PDF map related to today's show: . • Washington, D.C. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's been one of the biggest stories of July: Whether you saw the news on the first or the 21st of this month, chances are you've heard something about America's debt ceiling. This special, summer webcast is gonna sum it up for you and explain why it's so important. We're starting right now! First Up: What Is The Debt Ceiling? AZUZ: First things first: What is the debt ceiling, and why do we have to keep on raising it? Our Chief Financial Correspondent Ali Velshi takes just over a minute to explain it. (BEGIN VIDEO) ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The debt ceiling is exactly the same as your credit limit on your credit cards, except it's for everything that you borrow. It's like having one super loan. The United States is one of the few countries in the world that, by law, they have to keep on voting to increase the credit limit. Most countries just continue to borrow more. So, the debt ceiling is the absolute top amount of money that the U.S. can owe to anyone at any given time. and it's about $14.3 trillion. So in order to raise that ceiling so the U.S. can borrow more money to keep things going, the debt ceiling has to be increased by Congress. This has happened many, many times before. It's usually fairly routine; this time it's not. The U.S. actually hit the credit limit on May 16, but the treasury secretary has been able to keep the wolves at bay. He's been able to move piles of money around and basically keep us solvent until August 2nd. If we get to August 3rd and we've not raised the debt ceiling, somebody somewhere isn't getting paid. (END VIDEO) Debt Payments Explainer . AZUZ: And this is what we mean by that, by somebody not getting paid. These figures are for the month of August. The government will bring in about $172 billion, mostly from taxes. But to fund all of its programs, it'll need more than $306 billion. For decades, the government has spent more money than it has taken in, which is why we have debt and why it's so high. But if the government doesn't raise the debt ceiling, it would not be able to spend more than it has. That means some government programs wouldn't get all the money they need to operate. Now, these are the five goverment programs that require the most money. Medicare and Medicaid give medical care to the elderly and the poor. Social Security gives money to retired people. Add defense vendors, who make military equipment, interest on investments, and money for the Education Department, and your total comes to $180 billion. That's just on the five costliest government programs, and it's already more money than the goverment would have! And if the government funded just these programs, people who work for the government wouldn't get paid. U.S. troops -- including those in Iraq and Afghanistan -- wouldn't get paid. Veterans wouldn't get benefits. Your parents might not get their tax refunds from the IRS. Federal highways might not get maintained. A whole bunch of stuff wouldn't get done. Now, this is a simplified example. It's unlikely that the government would give just a few programs all the money they needed and let others go without anything. The Treasury Department would probably spread a thin amount of the money it had over a lot of different areas, giving some programs maybe just enough to operate. But it illustrates two things. One: How much more the government spends than it takes in. And two: Why many people in the government want that debt ceiling to be raised so badly, so the government can continue borrowing the money it needs to pay for all of its programs in full. Goodbye . AZUZ: Things could change any minute. Congress is looking at a number of ways to raise the debt ceiling as we put this show together. So, check in with CNN.com every day to see if an agreement on how to do that has been reached and whether the debt ceiling has been raised. And I will see you again soon! Thank you for watching.

"(CNN) -- St. Louis Cardinals struck first in baseball's World Series on Wednesday, beating Texas Rangers 3-2 in game one courtesy of a pinch-hit from substitute batter Allen Craig. The Cardinals, searching for their 11th success in Major League Baseball's seven-game championship series, owed much to five relief pitchers who yielded just one hit to the Rangers in three innings after taking the lead. ""I don't know what everyone else has been thinking about our team,"" Craig, who came in for starting pitcher Chris Carpenter, told the MLB website. ""But we know what we can do. We've just got to come out and keep doing it."" Carpenter lasted six innings before being pulled for Craig, despite concerns over an elbow injury. Third baseman David Freese scored the decisive run on a cold night at Busch Stadium after outfielder Craig hit a single in the bottom of the sixth innings off Rangers relief pitcher Alexi Ogando. ""When you get in the postseason, you have to win games in so many ways,"" Freese said after Tony La Russa's St. Louis secured a 31st win in 44 games. ""Not every game is going to be the same. Teams that win 90, 95, 100 games, they win ballgames different ways the entire year."" Rangers' starting pitcher C.J. Wilson was critical of his own form, after extending a run which has seen him lose the MLB All Star Game, game one of the American League division series and now the opener of the Fall Classic. ""It stinks. It stinks,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I'm here to win. I'm not here to lose. I'm not here to give up runs. I don't work all year to have these negative press conferences afterwards."" St. Louis broke the deadlock of the World Series' 107th edition at the bottom of the fourth inning when Lance Berkman batted in Albert Pujols and Matt Holliday. Texas leveled at the top of the fifth with a two-run homer from catcher Mike Napoli, but Freese came home for the victory when outfielder Nelson Cruz could not gather Craig's slice. History is against the Rangers, who are searching for their first World Series success, with the last 10 winning teams in game one going on to clinch baseball's biggest prize. Game two will take place in St. Louis on Thursday, before the series moves to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington on Saturday.","St. Louis Cardinals beat Texas Rangers 3-2 in game one of the World Series .

"(CNN) -- The nephew and protege of an imprisoned Mexican drug cartel kingpin pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in a federal court in Brownsville, Texas, on Monday. Rafael Cardenas Vela, 38, admitted to being a ""plaza boss"" in the Gulf Cartel, which prosecutors said was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States from Mexico. Cardenas Vela was arrested by federal agents during a traffic stop in southern Texas in October. His uncle, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, led the Matamoros-based Gulf Cartel before he was convicted in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to serve 25 years at the supermax prison in Fremont County, Colorado. Cardenas Vela fled to the United States in May 2011 to escape an internal power struggle in the cartel after the November 2010 death of another uncle, Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. He was still able to control his drug territory through the use of e-mails to key leadership within the cartel, the prosecutors said. His operation purchased 70 to 80 kilograms of cocaine each month in southern Mexico, which was then smuggled across the U.S. border in small vehicles about 16 to 20 kilograms at a time, prosecutors said. ""At the time of Cardenas' arrest, it was discovered he had approximately 500 men equipped and ready to respond to his call,"" prosecutors said in a news release. Cardenas Vela, who is scheduled to be sentenced on June 18, faces a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, a fine of up to $10 million and up to five years of supervised release, the government said. His plea agreement gives the government a $5 million judgment and the forfeiture of his interest in real estate in Brownsville, which was purchased with drug proceeds, prosecutors said.","Rafael Cardenas Vela admits to being a ""plaza boss"" in Mexico's Gulf Cartel .

"(CNN) -- North Korea continued to mourn its late leader Saturday while calling his successor son the ""supreme commander,"" as the country faces a transition of power following Kim Jong Il's death one week ago. ""Comrade Kim Jong Un, please assume the supreme commandership, as wished by the people, to lead (North Korea) to eternal victory,"" the country's main state newspaper said in an editorial, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. South Korea's Yonhap news agency speculated that the new title could be ""a sign of the successor's imminent rise to control the communist country's military."" Yonhap reported earlier this week that the younger Kim gave his first military orders as leader of North Korea just before the death of his father was announced Monday. CNN.com: Korea demilitarized zone . The man known as the ""dear leader"" died December 17 of a heart attack at age 69. The ruling Worker's Party declared Kim Jong Un, the youngest of three sons, the ""great successor"" to his father's mantle. Analysts have speculated that Kim Jong Un, believed to be in his late 20s, lacks the experience needed to succeed his father, who ruled the reclusive Stalinist state since 1994. Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute, said the challenge for North Korea is to speed up the country's familiarity with the younger Kim: ""The son is a blank slate. They face the challenge of building up his image and reputation faster than they might have done."" Saturday's editorial was full of praise for both son and father. ""This call is an expression of our people's faith to follow respected Kim Jong Un, who is identical to Kim Jong Il, to the last of their life,"" KCNA reported. Kim's funeral will be held Wednesday; the official mourning period will end Thursday.","An editorial calls for the son of the late Kim Jong Il to lead the country ""to eternal victory""

"(CNN) -- An American soldier went on a house-to-house shooting spree in two villages in the Kandahar region of Afghanistan early Sunday, Afghan officials said, killing 16 people. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the soldier acted alone and turned himself in after opening fire on civilians. U.S. President Barack Obama called the killings ""tragic and shocking."" What are people feeling in Afghanistan, and how will this affect the U.S. strategy moving forward? CNN correspondent Sara Sidner in Kabul, Afghanistan, takes a look in this edited transcript. Q: There were some reports suggesting that perhaps it was several soldiers. What can you tell us about that? SIDNER: The U.S. and International Security Assistance Force officials are sticking with the one-soldier story: that just one Army staff sergeant left the base, went on a shooting rampage and then returned and turn himself in. They are still saying that on Monday, that this was the work of one person, that there was no mission going on at the time in the area, that that person obviously has been detained, and a full investigation is under way. But I want to tell you a little bit about some really gruesome images that I've just looked at, coming from one of the locals in the area who took a lot of photos and video of the villagers. The scene is gruesome. Perhaps the worst pictures are burned bodies, including a toddler who has what appears to be a bullet hole in the toddler's head. There are images inside of one of these small homes of blood-covered floors and blood splattered on the walls. And we're also talking about shell casings that are on the ground that are being picked up, obviously from investigators who have come in the next day. This apparently happened somewhere between 2 and 3 in the morning on Sunday. Since then, the villagers have been accusing the U.S. government of not telling the truth, saying there were more U.S. soldiers on the ground when this happened. But we did hear from a couple of people saying that all they know is that at least one of them did open fire. That person, as I said, has been detained. But gruesome images coming out of Panjwai district. This is an area known to have a strong Taliban presence, an area, though, where villagers say, ""look, we were told by the U.S. to come back to this area, and look what has happened to us"" -- a lot of sorrow, a lost people crying and trying to explain what happened through tears there in Panjwai, which is in the western part of Kandahar. Q: And are there worries now about reprisals? SIDNER: Yes, the Taliban has already said Monday that there will be reprisals, perhaps violent ones. We also know that members of parliament here in Kabul have decided to close down the parliament here in protest of the killings. There is a lot of anger brewing. We know that there have been the villagers that have gathered outside of the base. Of course, the funerals will happen on Monday as well. So we'll be getting more and more information from that area. But the anger is growing, and there's a lot of speculation that this really plays right into the hands of the Taliban, who is trying to sort of divide people and trying to say, ""look, you can't really trust these coalition forces who claim to be here to help you."" The U.S. government, NATO and Afghan officials are looking into this, but there are a lot of people asking for swift justice and wanting the person who perpetrated this crime to be tried right here in Afghanistan. We don't know if that's likely to happen or not. Q: And have you heard anything about how this affects the strategy moving forward in Afghanistan? SIDNER: Yes, right now, everyone is just expressing their anger or sorrow or both over what happened. This is certainly going to strain ties again between the Afghan government and the U.S. President Obama has said he is deeply saddened by what happened and this is a deplorable and regrettable incident. But Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said this is unforgivable and an act of terror, in his words. And he, in a statement Sunday, made it seem like he believed that there was actually some sort of a mission that went wrong. We're still trying to clarify exactly what he meant by his words. But certainly, there is anger now, and there's going to be a lot to get worked through because of this incident.","American solider accused in shooting spree in Afghanistan on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A lieutenant colonel from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington pleaded not guilty Tuesday to three counts of felony harassment alleging he threatened to blow up the state capitol in Olympia and hire a hit man for $150,000 to kill his estranged wife and his boss, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. Lt. Col. Robert E. Underwood, who has been undergoing ""a nasty divorce"" the past two years, made the threats between March 1 and Monday, said Pierce County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Lori Kooiman in a court document. Underwood and his estranged wife have children and are dealing with custody and money issues, Kooiman said in the court document. A woman with whom Underwood has been in a relationship the past three months told Underwood's wife in early March that her husband ""was on the edge,"" Kooiman said. Underwood threatened to kill his wife and his boss, also a lieutenant colonel, Kooiman said. ""He stated he has paid a hit man $150,000 to kill them. He said the money is in foreign accounts and it would not be found,"" Kooiman said in court papers. ""The defendant recently had one of their daughters spend the night and he told her that he was going to do something crazy and it would be on the news, the world would know about it and he was going to resign his commission,"" Kooiman said. The girlfriend ""also borrowed the defendant's laptop and found that he (had) a picture of his teenage daughter, naked while sleeping in bed. She also found that he had searched the Internet for how to get teenagers drunk and have sex with them. She confronted the defendant about what she found and he told her that her head was on the chopping block,"" Kooiman said in a declaration for determination of probable cause. The girlfriend told detectives that ""the defendant has nothing to lose, he has an arsenal of weapons and she believes he has the ability to save the $150,000 and hide it,"" the prosecutor said. Underwood's boss told authorities the defendant has been deployed multiple times, but the Army says Underwood doesn't suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, the prosecutor said. However, Underwood witnessed his mother kill his two siblings, and she also shot Underwood ""multiple times and left him for dead,"" the prosecutor stated in court papers.","Lt. Col. Robert E.

"(CNN) -- Thirty-three Haitians were released Thursday from immigration detention facilities in Florida, more than two months after they arrived in the United States lacking proper immigration papers in the aftermath of their country's devastating earthquake. The 33 were among 65 Haitians detained since entering the country without visas after the January 12 earthquake. Thirty-two continue to be held. Many of those freed Thursday were released to family members already living in the United States, but they will remain under supervision of federal immigration officials. Most of those detained came to the United States on military planes, according to Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center attorney Allison Kent. Kent and her colleagues at the center, along with a team of law students from across the country, started working on the release of the Haitians in February. Some of the detainees told Kent that after a violent aftershock in Haiti, U.S. Marines waved them onto a military plane waiting at the Port-au-Prince airport. Kent said others went to the airport in search of food and aid and ended up in a line to board a plane out of the country. At no point did anyone on the ground ask to see the necessary visa documents for the Haitians to enter the United States legally, Kent said. A Department of Homeland Security official who asked not to be identified did not discount the stories, saying that it was a very chaotic situation after the earthquake. But the official added that there were instances where individuals intentionally tried to gain access to the United States illegally. While all the Haitians released Thursday still face deportation orders, the United States halted deportation to Haiti in response to the devastation of the earthquake. No timeline has been set for their removal, according to a DHS official. The advocacy center called the detention of the Haitians unnecessary without a deportation date and claimed that many of them showed signs of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Our clients' prolonged detention only exacerbated the terrible trauma they had already suffered before fleeing Haiti,"" said Cheryl Little, center executive director. ""While we're obviously thrilled and grateful that this group will finally be able to attempt to recover from their horrific experiences, it's difficult to understand why they weren't released sooner."" After the earthquake, the United States extended ""temporary protected status"" clearance to Haitian nationals, but only to those present in the United States before the earthquake. ""In order to mitigate the probability that Haitians may attempt to make a potentially deadly journey to the U.S., we clearly articulated that those who traveled to the U.S. illegally after January 12 may be arrested, detained, and placed in removal proceedings,"" said Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson Brian P.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Since last year's Tohoku earthquake, the scenes of devastation and Daiichi nuclear disaster immediately come to mind when people hear ""Fukushima."" Few see the beauty of Fukushima's landscape, both before the quake and how it now remains.Two photographers, Frances Tong and Katsumi Omori, respectively from Hong Kong and from Japan, are determined to offer artistic alternative. ""In spring, the mist filled up each and every space in the air. In autumn, the falling leaves colored the forest and the sweet scent of maple leaves merged with every breath that I drew in ... and that's the image of Fukushima that I can recall,"" said Tong, an amateur Hong Kong photographer who went to Fukushima prefecture several times before the earthquake. ""Fukushima after the quake is no longer the Fukushima that I once visited,"" said Tong. ""Despite the sad side of Fukushima, I want to show its peaceful and hopeful side as well. The scenes of Fukushima that I've seen on television are so dark and devastated."" Tong founded a charity organization called ""Friends of Fukushima,"" which set up three photo exhibitions in Hong Kong showing 30 photographs of Fukushima's mountains and lakes for charity. Earlier this year, $12,000 was raised and donated to Citizens Nuclear Information Centre, an anti-nuclear organization in Japan, to help the Fukushima nuclear plant workers. Tong, a 36-year-old business development manager, discovered Fukushima prefecture's scenery during a business trip in 2007. Since then, Tong went to Fukushima every year to capture the scenery on film. Tong says she feels a bond with the prefecture's environment, including one unforgettable sunrise. ""I woke up at 3:30 in the morning. I waited there for hours with my tripod. I witnessed the rising sun gradually lightening up the sky, from dark to dawn to morning. I felt so light and relaxed, as if I was merged with nature,"" said Tong. Rather than looking back in the past, Katsumi Omori chose to show the existing beauty of Fukushima. Right after the quake, Omori, who lives in the Tokyo suburb of Urayasu, felt the need to go to the affected areas last April. ""The world has changed. It wasn't what it was before,"" the 48-year-old said. ""I had to see it for myself."" Without any precise idea of what would be seen in the area, he decided to head to Fukushima to take pictures of ""sakura"". These Japanese cherry blossoms are the main theme of his ongoing artistic project since 2001, consisting largely of photos taken in Tokyo and his neighborhood. ""Sakura is planted by people. I wanted to see how those people are living and their conditions,"" he said. His sakura photo series was presented to the British public in ""Everything Happens for the First Time"", his solo exhibition held in London, August 2011. ""People who were expecting to see the massive devastation caused by the tsunami and the earthquake might have been disappointed,"" he said. ""Those who saw my work as an artistic expression of my feelings told me that they really like my exhibition."" Omori wanted to show the ""unseen"" which has not been exposed by the media. He believed that, as a photographer, his job is to capture things out of the ordinary rather than what is easily seen. Some people told him they felt natsukashi, or ""nostalgia"" in Japanese, when looking at his pictures. Being a photographer for 20 years, he observed that artists' attitude has somewhat changed after this disaster. ""People seem to realize that things do break and things that humans made get washed away,"" he said. ""The way artists pay tribute has changed. Their works are sometimes offered to charity organizations and remember what happened."" Haruka Nuga contributed to this story .","To most people, scenes of Fukushima evoke death and destruction .

"(CNN) -- The revelation that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden hid in ""plain sight"" at a house in a bastion of Pakistani military power has touched a nerve in the United States, which relies heavily on the Islamabad government in its grinding war against terrorism. Many Obama administration officials, lawmakers and observers from across the political spectrum want to know how bin Laden -- based at a compound in the military garrison city of Abbottabad -- could have eluded Pakistani capture, or whether the government or elements of it harbored bin Laden. Live blog: Up-to-the-minute developments . They want to know whether Pakistan is firmly backing the fight against terror or is supportive of militants fighting against troops in Afghanistan. The United States has a ""complicated but important relationship"" with Pakistan, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. Carney told reporters that U.S. officials need to learn more about the ""support network"" that sustained bin Laden in Pakistan. But he also warned against ""tarring"" everyone in Pakistan's government because of the revelation that bin Laden had been living so close to Islamabad. There has also been ""a great deal of important cooperation"" in the fight against Islamic extremism, he said. ""The idea that these kinds of complications exist is not new."" But Rep. Peter King, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, said ""this can't be allowed to go on."" In comments Tuesday at a House subcommittee hearing on Pakistan, King noted that bin Laden's compound was near a headquarters for the Pakistani intelligence services. White House: Bin Laden unarmed when shot . ""There are two possibilities and one answer,"" King said. ""One is that it was a direct facilitation by elements of the Pakistani government, or Pakistani intelligence is entirely inept, and that has not proven to be the case over the years."" At the hearing, Seth Jones of the Rand Corporation told the panel that bin Laden's presence in Pakistan showed that ""at the very least, there has not been a high priority in targeting senior al Qaeda leaders"" in the country. ""Based on the threat streams coming from this area, those interests have to change in my view,"" Jones said. Another terrorism expert, Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute, said mistrust between the United States and Pakistan runs both ways, with Pakistani officials fearful that the United States will abandon the region after eliminating bin Laden. Sources: Panetta comes down hard on Pakistan . ""It is essential that we find ways not only to communicate our frustration to Pakistan,"" Kagan said, but also to say ""we're not leaving."" The United States has regarded Pakistan as a top ally in the fight against the Taliban, al Qaeda, the Haqqani Network and other Pakistan-based militants who have launched attacks against internationaland Afghan troops in Afghanistan. At Tuesday's hearing, experts also identified Lashkar-e-Taiba as a major emerging threat from Pakistan to the Indian subcontinent and beyond. Pakistan's president defends his nation . According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the United States has provided $18 billion in foreign assistance and reimbursements to Pakistan, two-thirds of which are security-related. The administration and lawmakers have praised the Pakistanis for their anti-terrorism efforts, but at the same time some lawmakers suspect the country hasn't been robust enough in going after terrorists. Some say elements of Pakistan's intelligence services -- the Inter-Services Intelligence or ISI -- have close ties with militants. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, agrees that they have been ""good at going after some terrorists"" but have ""very subtly walked both sides of the street."" ""That's of concern to many of us, I think, because you have to declare yourself,"" she told reporters, noting that the issue of Pakistan will be addressed by the committee. Denis McDonough, who is President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN that despite legitimate questions about what Pakistani authorities knew, the United States needed to maintain the relationship. ""We obviously recognize that nobody has sacrificed more in this war against al Qaeda than the Pakistanis,"" McDonough said. ""Al Qaeda had declared war, in fact, on the Pakistani government, have threatened and continues to threaten to try to get their hands on nuclear material in that country. ... So they obviously have a lot at stake in this fight. So we're going to continue to work with them and continue to try to partner with them against al Qaeda, because we recognize that it's not only in our interests, but in their interests."" Retired CIA officer: Can U.S. trust Pakistan? Asked if the U.S. funding to Pakistan should continue, McDonough said such investments bolster U.S. security. ""We'll continue to try to work with them to train, to try to target the common threat that we face from al Qaeda,"" McDonough said, adding: ""Nobody has greater concern about our ability to ... carry out the fight against al Qaeda than the president. We're going to continue to do that, either with our Pakistani friends or alone. But this is too big a fight for us to give it up."" McDonough also said he agreed with a reported quote by Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta that the United States decided not to share intelligence with Pakistan in the run-up to the Monday raid that led to bin Laden's death because of fears of a leak. Sen. Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also cited concern that some Pakistani officials might alert bin Laden. ""This is one reason we did not inform the Pakistanis of our actions,"" Lugar said, while noting ""there were probably many who were very uncomfortable about the presence likewise."" The Pakistani government on Tuesday ""categorically"" denied reports that its leadership ""had any prior knowledge"" of the U.S. operation against bin Laden . One ISI official denied any complicity in hiding bin Laden, saying one failure and embarrassment doesn't negate its ""track record"" of capturing more al Qaeda members than anyone else. ""Yes, we did fail to locate him. Yes, we are embarrassed. But that does not mean we are incompetent and straddling the fence,"" the official said. ""Had we known that OBL was there we would have raided it and handed him over to the U.S. to silence the critics talking about the complicity of the ISI."" The United States is reviewing intelligence seized in the compound to determine whether bin Laden received support inside Pakistan, a senior U.S. official told CNN. This comes amid discussions in Washington over the extent of the Pakistani intelligence service's knowledge of his whereabouts and whether it provided him sanctuary. Lugar was asked in Washington why taxpayers should support money for Pakistan. ""It's a very complex country. A very complex set of officials,"" the Indiana senator said. ""To try to obtain perfection in terms of who the recipients ought to be is out of the question. It's a question of if there are goals we can achieve if we have some accountability of the money."" Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN on Tuesday that Pakistan has been an ""important partner in counterterrorism cooperation and we've had very important cooperation from them."" Rice raises concerns about Pakistan . But she questions how bin Laden could ""hide in plain sight in that kind of compound without the knowledge of high-ranking officials."" ""We have captured many, many al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, so Pakistan has been a cooperating counterterrorism partner,"" Rice said, making reference to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. ""But everyone knows that there are elements within Pakistan that are still tied to extremism, that has been a concern, and it is very important now that the Pakistanis take a hard look at how this possibly could have happened,"" Mark Quarterman, director of the Program on Crisis, Conflict, and Cooperation at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an expert on Pakistan, said there have been strong differences between Washington and Islamabad over U.S. drone strikes in the tribal region and calls to remove CIA operatives in the country. The bin Laden operation and the issues surrounding it add to the tension, he said. ""I would not be surprised if there are questions on Capitol Hill about continued level of support to Pakistan, about the U.S. relationship with Pakistan and the consideration of the nature of that relationship and how we handle it going forward,"" he said. The Pakistan government and the ISI supported the Taliban when it controlled Afghanistan during the 1990s, but the government broke ties with the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks. American officials have consistently indicated that there are rogue ISI elements supportive of militants. One reason Pakistanis also have supported militants in the tribal region is that the fighters are seen as serving as a bulwark for Pakistani interests. That includes a focus against the influence of longtime rival India in Afghanistan, Quarterman said. ""The Pakistanis are hedging their bets,"" he said. ""They know the United States isn't there to stay."" Navy SEALs: ""The quiet professionals"" Jamie Metzl, executive vice president of the Asia Society, said the onus will be on Pakistan to do a thorough investigation to assess what happened with bin Laden. ""If Pakistan denies any official involvement with bin Laden, it will be difficult to prevent a backlash among members of the U.S. Congress who will believe that Pakistan is playing a double game,"" Metzl said. Metzl also says Pakistan's fear is that India will increase influence in Afghanistan and surround Pakistan, and that calculation has led Pakistan to keep militants under its sway. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, said Pakistan and the United States have ""a very funny relationship."" Pakistan dispatched ""troops into the tribal areas at our request"" and ""took thousands and thousands of casualties trying to fight Taliban and al Qaeda elements,"" Rogers said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""There are some concerns about their ISI being penetrated, their intelligence services being penetrated, but at the same time,"" he said, ""we've got to have them.""

"(CNN) -- Braving bitter cold, Muscovites in favor of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and those convinced parliamentary election results were rigged took to the streets Saturday. The dueling rallies were held about six weeks after the last major anti-government demonstrations. Putin is seeking the presidency in the March elections and will represent his United Russia party. The move is the latest step toward Putin's reclaiming the presidency after switching to the prime minister's office because of a law barring him from serving more than two consecutive terms as president. Russia's third-richest man, billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, is running against him. Joining tens of thousands of marchers, Prokhorov told CNN Saturday the protesters ""are my potential voters. And I will do my best to help them to live in an open, competitive Russia."" The state-run Ria Novosti news agency, quoting police figures, said the opposition rally in Moscow gathered 33,000 participants, while the pro-government event was attended by 150,000. But anti-Putin organizers said their numbers were close to 160,000. The anti-Putin faction, calling for free and fair elections, carried banners, ribbons and signs. Among them was one depicting a rat with the message ""Put in Trash."" A pro-Putin rally in Ekaterinburg featured music and a wood-burning stove to help marchers deal with the subzero temperatures . Putin has brushed off widespread criticism that the December 4 parliamentary elections in Russia were falsified. He said their results ""reflect the actual lineup of forces in the country, as well as the fact that the ruling force -- the United Russia party -- has lost certain positions."" The results caused mass protests in December. At that time, President Dmitry Medvedev announced sweeping political reforms, an effort to address discontent. Speaking before the newly elected parliament members in the Kremlin's St. George Hall, Medvedev proposed that Russia return to direct elections of regional governors; simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates; and establish a new editorially independent national public TV channel. Medvedev also called for lifting many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by Putin.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Instead of resuming contract talks to prevent a Hollywood movie and TV production shutdown, Screen Actors Guild (SAG) members were in court Tuesday fighting over who should lead those negotiations. Doug Allen was the executive director of the Screen Actors Guild until he was fired by the board. SAG's board fired Executive Director Doug Allen and named a new chief negotiator last week amid a bitter division among the actors over the question of calling a strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The new negotiators arranged for contract talks to resume Tuesday, after several months of a deadlock, but a faction of union filed a complaint Monday disputing Allen's firing. ""In light of this circumstance, both parties have agreed to a postponement of their meeting and will reschedule at a later date,"" a SAG statement said. A Los Angeles judge rejected their request for an injunction, finding ""that the notice and application for the injunction, as well as the underlying complaint, were procedurally defective,"" according to a statement issued Tuesday afternoon by SAG. The statement said the plaintiffs told the judge they would be back Thursday with amended papers asking for an injunction to restore Allen to the post. The actors have been working without a contract since June 30. The two sides have been at odds mainly over the amount actors should be paid when their movies or TV shows are distributed on discs or through ""new media,"" such as mobile phones and the Internet.","NEW: Judge denies injunction by faction of SAG as 'procedurally defective'

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romanian opposition leaders called for a series of protests beginning on Thursday to demand the resignation of government leaders and early elections. The opposition leaders met with Prime Minister Emil Boc on Wednesday to discuss the situation Romania is facing, following six days of citizen protests. ""Early elections are the best solution we have to end the protests,"" opposition leader Crin Antonescu said. His coalition is asking for a new technocrat government to organize the balloting. Boc said the parliament will decide whether or not the early elections are the best solution for the country. The government and opposition leaders have agreed to hold a special parliamentary session next week. On Tuesday, thousands marched on the streets nationwide, asking for the resignation of President Traian Basescu and early elections. Many are angry over unemployment, which has forced Romanians to go abroad for jobs; others demonstrated against corruption or small state salaries. The leaders agreed Wednesday on the creation of an economic council of experts, representing the government and the opposition, to find new ways of creating jobs. A small number of people were arrested at the protests in Bucharest, the capital, officials said. Demonstrations took place nationwide under the supervision of thousands of police officers, officials said. No violent incidents were reported. The protests are the most serious since Basescu's election in 2004. Over the weekend, protesters blocked traffic in the capital, Bucharest, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 revolution. Others carried signs reading ""Liberty"" and ""Down with President Basescu."" Protests broke out last Thursday after Raed Arafat, a deputy health minister and opponent of health care changes proposed by the government, resigned. However, Arafat changed his mind on Tuesday, saying he had withdrawn his resignation. He added Basescu called him over the weekend to discuss the matter. Arafat gained popularity after creating what many Romanians see as an efficient medical emergency system. Boc invited trade unions and employers to meet Tuesday on the labor code, but the labor unions refused to participate. After meeting with employers, Boc said the government is focused on creating new jobs for Romanians and providing financial support to those wishing to start businesses. The protests also follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. The opposition Social Liberal Union has asked Romania's Constitutional Court to analyze the law merging local and parliamentary elections, which are set to take place in the fall. The law passed after the government received a vote of confidence in parliament in December. The court's answer was postponed until January 25.","The opposition is demanding early elections .

"(CNN) -- Until 2011, we were in a Rip Van Winkle-world. Events unfolded so fast that every morning, we seemed to wake up in circumstances unrecognizably transformed from those of the previous night. Yet this year has broken the mold. Nothing happened: certainly, nothing worthy of record by an historian like me. You can imagine the almanac-writers' dilemma as they prepare copy for New Year's Eve, struggling to make the year seem memorable. They'll headline Osama bin Laden's death, but he was a has-been who had ceased to influence history and whose death can make no difference to our world except by adding one more item to anti-Americans' already tedious list of grievances. Newspapers will parade pictures of the Arab Spring, which dethroned Tweedle-dum in favor of Tweedle-dee. Recycled photo montages will revive the embarrassment of an expensive wedding in London, in which a prince of feeble attainments played a bit part in a show dominated by trash celebrities. The death of Kim Jong Il will get little coverage -- partly because few good pictures will be available, partly because it really doesn't matter. The Durban talks on climate change hardly merit a mention: They confirmed not only that environmental change is now out of human control but also that no one is prepared to make real, urgent effort to try to do anything about it. The U.S. ""drawdown"" from Iraq may get some deserved applause, but it has come too late to make much difference to the long-term misfortunes of a war that was worse than a crime, because it was also a mistake. Pundits will reissue dire pronouncements about the European debt crisis, but it already looks as if I was right, when the crisis broke, to predict in British and Spanish media that the euro will emerge barely scathed, with the EU, if anything, marginally strengthened. Politicians have supplied some real-life comic opera to enliven the generally cheerless, pointless record. Silvio Berlusconi added ""bumpa-bumpa"" to the world's lexicon. Nicolas Sarkozy entertained us with his impersonation of the gait and patience of a Gallic cockerel. Jacques Chirac devised amusing excuses to escape jail. Politicians' posturings reached new heights of self-ridicule when Hugo ChÃ¡vez, a noisy mountebank, whose gestures always seem to have the impact of a feebly flung custard pie, called President Obama a clown. The U.S. congressional impasse did only modest harm to America but made the country a world-wide laughing-stock. The inane antics of Republican presidential candidates brought smiles to the faces of U.S. recession victims. Rick Perry couldn't remember which departments he wanted to abolish. Herman Cain revealed unexpected depths in the sex life of a pizza guy. Even Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich became funny in a desperate sort of way when Republican voters turned to the unelectable twins in revulsion from all the other options. But the candidates' parade seemed mainly to show the poverty of democracy and the shallowness of voters' morals. Members of the debate audiences bayed for the blood of death-row inmates and uninsured hospital patients. State legislatures courted the votes of the hateful and resentful by victimizing poor immigrants and their innocent children. 2011 ought to have been a great year. Legislation could have unlocked the bank vaults and reversed recession. But nothing much happened. Punishment could have made an example of the guilty men of the global economic crisis, but the fat cats have gone on gorging. Action could have gutted corruption out of the U.S. political system -- but the 2012 election will be like all the others, bought by millions of dollars, abandoned by millions of voters. Iran could have rejoined civilization, but, instead, the irrational alienation of Iranians has continued. Imaginative initiatives could have helped to reverse the clash of civilizations, but inter-communal violence has gone on accumulating. I relish unmemorable years: They make it easier for me to update my textbook on the history of the world. They absolve me from further work. But, on the scale of those of 2011, missed opportunities are bad for all of us. The year's non-events have, at least, taught us two truths. First, the global political system is sclerotic. The inertia of the U.S. government, with decision-making deadlocked and almost every program frozen -- the promising and menacing alike -- seems representative of a world baffled into pusillanimity by the scale of its problems, while the feebleness of the EU's response to the financial crisis has shown the same sort of freeze-framing, in a system too clogged with complexity to function. Second, 2011, like other unremarkable years, has confirmed the already dominant features of the history of our day: intractable economic stagnation, moral and intellectual torpor, tacky culture, environmental degradation. We can congratulate ourselves, as we head into 2012, only on escaping the infamous old Chinese curse: We do not live in interesting times. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Felipe Fernandez-Armesto.","Felipe Fernandez-Armesto: For all its sound, fury, 2011 was a year in which little changed .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Toyota's president apologized Friday for the gas pedal problems that have forced the recall of millions of vehicles in the United States and Europe, Japanese media reported. It was Akio Toyoda's first remarks since the latest round of recalls began last week. ""We're extremely sorry to have made customers uneasy,"" he told Japanese news agency NHK. ""We plan to establish the facts and give an explanation that will take away the customers' concern as soon as possible."" The recall is to correct a problem that, under certain circumstances, could cause the gas pedal, as it becomes worn, to stick partway down. Toyota recalled 2.3 million vehicles in the United States for the problem this week, although no repair procedure has been put in place. A Toyota spokesman said that the carmaker is close to announcing a solution for cars in the United States. The company would still need to get regulatory approval for any proposed repair in the United States and in Europe before a fix could be made. The European recall involves eight models, several of them not sold in the United States. The number of vehicles involved in that recall is under investigation, but could reach 1.8 million, Toyota said in a statement. The recall is separate from one begun in November to fix a problem in which the gas pedal can catch on the edge of the removable floormat. The floormat recall was recently expanded to cover 5.3 million vehicles. In many cases, the same vehicles are involved in both recalls. It was not clear how many different vehicles, in total, are part of both actions. When it came to capturing U.S. market share, Toyota Motor had its pedal to the metal for years. But the gas pedal problems could throw its sales into reverse. The halt of sales and production of the company's most popular U.S. models will cause this month's sales to tumble 12 percent compared to January 2009, according to a forecast from sales tracker Edmunds.com. Michelle Krebbs, senior analyst for Edmunds.com, said that, if not for this week's problems, Toyota's sales would have been up at least slightly for the month. The expected drop could send Toyota's market share below 15 percent, which would be its lowest level in nearly four years. Most of Toyota's rivals are expected to post higher sales compared to a year ago. Ford Motor, which last year reported its first market share gain in the United States since 1995, is expected to pass Toyota in market share in January, according to Edmunds.com. Ford has joined General Motors and other automakers trying to capitalize on Toyota's problems, offering $1,000 to buyers who trade in Toyotas when purchasing a new car. That could be a big problem for Toyota. ""People buy Toyotas for their bullet-proof reliability,"" said Krebbs. ""That was their main selling point, and that's taken a huge hit."" Share iReports of auto stories . Even after Toyota fixes the gas pedal problems, it is likely to have trouble regaining share, some say. A loss in market share this year would be Toyota's first since 1994. ""This is a game changer for Toyota,"" said Art Spinella, head of CNW Market Research. ""They have some serious, serious work to do to repair the damage done to their image."" Spinella said Toyota was already vulnerable. His firm's consumer survey from mid-January showed Toyota had fallen from its long-held position of first or second in quality estimates to seventh among potential buyers. Apparently, recalls that began late last year are having an impact. ""This was just the latest recall problem for Toyota,"" said Spinella. ""Word of mouth is the key for all of this, and always has been. And it's much tougher to move back up the list than to fall down."" Toyota spokeswoman Sona Iliffe-Moon said the company won't comment about any potential hit to sales or market share before its scheduled release of January sales on February 2. ""Clearly there will be a sales impact with the stopped sales,"" she said. ""Really, right now our focus is working on a remedy.""

"(CNN) -- Two days after an embarrassingly early European Champions League exit, Manchester United have been dealt a further blow with the news that club captain Nemanja Vidic will miss the rest of this season. The defender was stretchered off during Wednesday's 2-1 defeat to Basel in Switzerland, a result which saw last season's finalists exit Europe's premier club competition at the group stage for the first time in six years. The Serbia international has ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee, and manager Alex Ferguson said the 30-year-old will see a specialist on Monday to reveal the full extent of the injury. ""We thought it was a bad one,"" the Scot told reporters on Friday. ""He's out for the season. It's not unexpected but it's still bad news."" The 19-time English champions are second in the Premier League, five points behind arch-rivals Manchester City ahead of Saturday's home match against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vidic's injury limits United's options in central defense, with experienced England international Rio Ferdinand to partner Northern Ireland's Jonny Evans or one of versatile young duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. ""He'll see a specialist on Monday to work out the progress of when he has the operation,"" confirmed Ferguson. ""It won't be immediate as we have to let the swelling come down. ""We'll now have to choose between Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. I thought Rio had his best game of season on Wednesday. His experience will be vital."" Vidic is part of a growing injury list at Old Trafford, with Mexico striker Javier Hernandez also sidelined after damaging an ankle during last week's 1-0 win over Aston Villa. Midfielders Anderson and Tom Cleverley, Brazilian twins Fabio and Rafael da Silva, and veteran striker Michael Owen are also out. However, Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov could return for Saturday's clash with Mick McCarthy's 16th-placed Wolves.","Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic is ruled out for the rest of this season .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court on Wednesday found a Congolese warlord guilty of turning children into killers, marking the war crimes tribunal's first verdict in its decade of operation. Judges convicted Thomas Lubanga of conscripting and enlisting children under age 15 and using them to participate in ""hostilities"" during a civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He will remain in custody pending sentencing. The verdict marks a milestone for the international court that targets war crimes worldwide. It is the first verdict issued by the Netherlands-based court, which has 14 other cases, three of which are in trial stage. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the verdict. ""Mr. Lubanga's conviction for the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 is an important step forward in realizing the international community's commitment to ensuring that perpetrators of crimes against children in situations of armed conflict are brought to justice,"" he said. Lubanga surrendered in 2006, and his trial started three years later. His was the court's first trial and its first verdict since it was established in 2002 to address crimes of international concern, including genocide and war crimes. His trial also marks the first time a suspect has faced an international tribunal based solely on charges involving the use of child soldiers, the court said. ""Today's verdict will give pause to those around the world who commit the horrific crime of using and abusing children both on and off the battlefield,"" said Michael Bochenek, director of Amnesty International's law and policy program. Prosecutors said Lubanga led a rebel force that recruited child soldiers to take part in a bloody conflict. The violence occurred in 2002 and 2003 in the mineral-rich eastern part of the nation. Lubanga coordinated the recruiting of child soldiers and forced some of them to serve in militia roles, including as his bodyguards, the court said. Those testifying against him included former child soldiers, who told the court that he recruited them to kill, rape and rob. ""This case represents a huge step in the struggle against these serious crimes against children,"" Luis Moreno Ocampo, the court's top prosecutor, said in a statement posted on its website. ""Child conscription destroys the lives and futures of thousands of children around the world. This case will contribute to exposing the problem and in stopping these criminal practices."" Lubanga is one of more than a dozen people sought by the international court, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Joseph Kony, the fugitive Ugandan leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. Lubanga's guilty verdict sets a precedent for others accused of similar crimes, including Kony, who became an Internet sensation last week after the release of a video detailing brutality by his rebel army. Kony is accused of using children to kill and mutilate his foes across four African nations, including Uganda and Congo.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China on Tuesday criticized human rights groups' accounts of a violent clash between Tibetan protesters and the Chinese police, accusing them of trying to ""distort the truth."" The dispute over what took place in a remote area of Sichuan Province comes at a sensitive time in China's relationship with its Tibetan population after a string of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months. The International Campaign for Tibet, which promotes human rights for Tibetan people, reported Monday that thousands of Tibetans had marched on government offices before the police opened fire into the crowd, killing at least three protesters and wounding nine. Free Tibet, a London-based group that campaigns for Tibetan independence, said that one person was killed and as many as 30 others wounded by gunfire from the Chinese security forces. The rights groups said the protesters had been motivated by a recent security crackdown on Tibetans in the region following the circulation of pamphlets raising the prospect of more self-immolations. The reports, which could not be independently verified, contrasted with the account given by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. It reported that ""dozens of people, including some monks, stormed and smashed some stores along a main street and a police station"" in the autonomous Tibetan prefecture of Ganzi in Sichuan. ""The mob, some armed with knives, threw stones at police officers and destroyed two police vehicles and two ambulances,"" Xinhua reported, saying that the violence left one of the marchers dead and four wounded. Five police officers were also wounded, Xinhua said. The alternative versions of events from the Tibetan rights groups clearly angered the Chinese authorities. ""The attempts of overseas secessionist groups involving Tibet to distort the truth and discredit the Chinese government will not succeed,"" Xinhua said Tuesday, citing Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Xinhua described the rights groups' accounts as ""ill-intentioned hype."" The protests come ahead of the Tibetan New Year on Feb. 22 and with tensions high following more than a dozen self-immolations by Tibetans in the past year. For a fifth straight year, China will close Tibet to foreign tourists again this year from the Tibetan New Year festival until the anniversary of a deadly anti-government riot among Tibetans in March, according to regional travel agents. Tibetans in the mountainous region of Ganzi, have called for more freedom and the return of the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader who fled to India during an uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Calls to the Ganzi public security bureau and government office went unanswered on Tuesday.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For the most part, the audience won't see his snarling eyes but the menacing growl from the orchestra confirms they are there. Valery Gergiev uses his eyes to convey the feeling of the score while performing with the London Symphony Orchestra. Russian maestro Valery Gergiev may appear to conduct with his whole body; from his sweeping arms to his quivering fingers to the way he stands on the tips of his toes and puffs out his cheeks. But the true message comes from the look on his face, most of all, through his eyes. ""You can do the same thing with your right hand, totally the same, but give a different look, the sound will change,"" Gergiev tells CNN. Valery Gergiev is considered one of the greatest conductors of his time. He's certainly one of the busiest. Not only is he the principal conductor and artistic director of Russia's famous Mariinsky Theater, he's the general director responsible for the institution's opera, ballet, orchestra and latterly Academy of Young Singers. He's also the artistic director of a number of international music festivals: the Stars of the White Nights Festival, the Red Sea Festival and the New Horizons Festival. Last year, he'd barely unpacked his bags after long tenures as the principal guest conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York and principal conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra when he accepted the role as principal conductor for the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). They, of course, were thrilled. ""I often think of the LSO as a wonderful fast car and he is able to drive that and he takes them with him in the most extraordinary way,"" the LSO's managing director Kathryn McDowell tells CNN. Recently, he's been taking that car back to the music of his homeland, launching a worldwide tour in August of the complete cycle of symphonies from Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev at the Edinburgh International Festival. The performances promise to deliver as many surprises for the musicians as they do for the audience. ""We don't really know what he is going to do in the show -- it can vary enormously from the rehearsal,"" says Rachel Gough, principal bassoon with the London Symphony Orchestra. ""For me, that's a positive thing -- it's creative. Something's happening and it's about the emotion and the feeling behind the music and not really the notes, because that's just a means to end."" There's no doubt the musicians could play each piece note-perfect without a conductor: each performance is the culmination of years of practice, hours of painstaking work to refine their art. But it's the conductor who provides the artistic cohesion. From the podium, Gergiev is pulling, willing, compelling them to follow his lead. ""When he is conducting, there is this animal instinct which comes out of him and you don't see it in rehearsal, you see it when he is performing and the look on his face,"" says Matt Gibson who plays the double bass for the LSO. ""When he looks at you and really wants you to do what he wants you to do, you have no choice. You will do it."" See more interviews with the LSO on Gergiev . Gergiev's career started when his mother encouraged him to play piano as a child. It was his father's sudden death when Gergiev was just 14 that drew him closer to music and eventually led to conducting. ""It was a huge shock. My father was totally and completely a healthy man, a young man, he was 49,"" Gergiev tells CNN. ""From that moment it was clear inside that I will never stop this. I didn't know about conducting, but playing piano and my love for music developed hugely."" Gergiev was just 25 when he made his debut with the Kirov Opera in 1978, conducting Prokofiev's ""War and Peace."" He's barely stopped since. On top of his commitments to the world's leading orchestras, he stages impromptu concerts to promote peace. The most recent was in the central square of the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali in August, in front of the bombed-out buildings where its government once met. Watch video of the concert . On October 19, he'll join the World Orchestra for Peace for a rare performance in Jerusalem to promote unity in the Middle East. Read more about the Orchestra for Peace . His manager Doug Sheldon says Gergiev's energy and motivation may at first have come from an early awareness of his own mortality. ""I think he probably wondered if he would live longer than his father and I think he probably felt that life was not very secure, that I have to get a lot done in a short period of time,"" he tells CNN. Sheldon thinks that later evolved into a personal mission to ensure the spirit of classical music -- and the work of the Russian greats -- does not die. ""He sees the need to continually reach out to people and the vehicle is music,"" Sheldon says. ""He sees that as the way to express the very best and the very deepest of the human condition and the soul."" It's often said that the eyes are the window to the soul. Perhaps that's what the musicians are seeing when Gergiev is on the stage. ""If you do something, if anyone in the orchestra does something that he wasn't quite expecting or takes a little turn here or there, then he'll look up and grin and that's a good moment,"" says Rachel Gough.","Russian Valery Gergiev is considered one of the world's leading conductors .
He holds three senior positions at the famed Mariinsky Theater in Russia .
In 2007, he joined the London Symphony Orchestra as principal conductor .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Three Pakistani police officers were found guilty of sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14-year-old Haitian boy while they were serving in a U.N. police mission in Haiti, a U.N. spokesman told reporters Tuesday. The three were found guilty in a court-martial proceeding conducted by Pakistani authorities in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, said the spokesman, Martin Nesirky. Pakistani authorities alerted Haitian officials to the outcome of the military procedure this month, saying that ""the guilty parties will be punished, including dishonorable discharge from service, loss of benefits and imprisonment, with the latter sentence to be served immediately on return to Pakistan."" Each is to serve a year in jail. The three were in a Pakistani-formed police unit serving in Gonaives, Haiti, as part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake there in January 2010. The attack happened this January. The three officers have been sent back to Pakistan. The U.N. spokesman said the international body is in contact with Pakistani authorities to ""examine the formal details of the procedures and to ensure appropriate follow-up."" Asked by a reporter if the one-year sentence was appropriate for the crime, Nesirky responded, ""The United Nations will not comment on the terms of the punishment under the member-states, the judicial procedure. That's obviously a matter between Pakistan and Haiti, but as we stated from the outset, the United Nations considers this to be a case of the most serious sexual exploitation and abuse."" In a separate case, five Uruguayan marines were accused last year of sexually assaulting a teenager at a U.N. base after a video was posted on the Internet. That case is still under investigation.","A court-martial was held by Pakistani authorities in Haiti .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- U.S. airstrikes targeted militant hideouts and arms caches in separate attacks over three days in Yemen, killing at least 64 suspected al Qaeda insurgents before the strikes ended Sunday, senior Yemeni officials told CNN. Officials at U.S. Central Command and the Defense Department contacted Sunday provided no information on the purported attacks. U.S. officials rarely discuss the drone program, though privately they have said covert strikes using drones are legal and an effective tactic in the fight against extremists. The latest strike involved at least five U.S. drones and took place in the Jabal Khanfar region of Jaar, located in southern Abyan province, two senior Yemeni security officials said. At least six suspected al Qaeda militants were killed, Yemeni officials said. A member of the military committee -- Yemen's highest security authority -- confirmed that strike, and said the Yemeni government was given no advance warning of it. ""The United States did not inform us on the attacks. We only knew about this after the U.S. attacked,"" the committee member told CNN. The strike was the third such attack on suspected al Qaeda targets in less than three days, according to Yemeni officials. The United States was also involved in two other major attacks on Friday and Saturday, which killed at least 58 suspected al Qaeda insurgents, two senior Yemeni defense ministry officials said. The Friday airstrikes occurred in the Yemen province of al-Baitha in areas used as launching pads for militant attacks. The second attack took place in the towns of Jaar and Zinjibar in Abyan province. One of the ministry officials said the attacks happened late in the day, when Yemeni air forces are not capable and trained to conduct such operations. Earlier, separate security officials had said Yemeni air forces were behind the first two airstrikes. At least 34 suspected al-Qaeda militants, among them four senior leaders in the network, were killed in the al-Baitha attack, said Mohammed al-Ameri, governor of the province. Smoke from the air raids covered the skies hours after the strike. Security forces also formed new checkpoints in nearby districts. Residents said military aircraft roam the skies of the province around the clock. Yemeni rights organizations condemned the alleged U.S. airstrikes, calling them illegal. HOOD, a prominent Sanaa-based rights organization, said that no one has the right to kill another person without first bringing that person to trial. ""This is illegal and dozens were killed without given a chance to prove their case. We are against any U.S. attack in Yemen,"" said Mohammed Nagi Allow, HOOD's president. More than 200 Yemeni troops were killed recently in clashes against al Qaeda in Abyan. Militants took over a military camp there, seizing large caches of weapons. They are still holding 72 troops hostage. Yemen has been desperately trying to weaken terror militant groups after they succeeded in taking over large parts of Abyan province last year. The United States has been backing Yemeni efforts against al Qaeda and has periodically struck targets inside Yemen, as occurred in September, when a drone strike killed American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.","Officials at U.S. Central Command and the Defense Dept. provide no details .

"(CNN) -- Admirers of the late Czech President Vaclav Havel lined Prague's famous Charles Bridge Wednesday as his coffin was moved to Prague Castle ahead of his state funeral Friday. Havel, who helped bring down communism in Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution, died Sunday, aged 75. A fiercely independent thinker with a wry, playful sense of humor, Havel became president of Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Moscow-backed regime, and the first president of the Czech Republic when it split peacefully from Slovakia three years later. The long-time chain smoker, whose health was permanently damaged by time in prison under the Communists, died peacefully in his sleep Sunday, his spokeswoman Sabina Tancevova said. People poured into the streets of Prague with candles and flowers in memory of him that night. His longtime friend and translator Paul Wilson remembered Havel as ""a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel, who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried, relentlessly, to crush his spirit."" Havel, an absurdist playwright turned political activist, spent four and a half years in prison for opposing Czechslovakia's Communist government before emerging as a leader of the Velvet Revolution. A deeply serious thinker given to long, rambling statements in presidential speeches and conversation, Havel also had an impish sense of humor, reportedly whizzing through the long corridors of Prague Castle on a scooter after becoming president. A perennial contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, Havel never won, but he remained active in anti-communist causes from Cuba to China until his death. He urged Chinese authorities to release dissident Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 call for greater political freedom in China was inspired by Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. Havel and other Czech dissidents attempted to deliver a letter to the Chinese Embassy in January 2010, before Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize, but they found the doors closed and no one to receive it. It was an absurd scene that could have come out of one of the plays he wrote in the 1960s, poking fun at the Soviet-backed authorities who ruled his country at the time. Theater proved a potent weapon against Czechoslovakia's Communist rulers, who stepped down without a shot being fired in the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the defeat of the region's authoritarian Moscow-backed regimes. Havel was unanimously elected president by the last Communist-run parliament of Czechoslovakia 22 years ago this month. His country joined NATO and the European Union under his stewardship, but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency, including his effort to keep Czechoslovakia together. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was ""was inspired by his words and leadership. ... Vaclav Havel was a friend to America and to all who strive for freedom and dignity, and his words will echo through the ages."" But speaking to to CNN's Jim Clancy in March, Havel expressed more modest wishes for how history would remember him. ""I would be glad if it was felt that I have done something generally useful,"" he said. ""I don't care much about personal fame or popularity. I would be satisfied with the feeling that I had a chance to help with something in general, something good. That history gave me that chance.""","Admirers line Charles Bridge as the late dissident's body is moved .

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Tensions ran high in the central Nigerian city of Jos on Sunday in the aftermath of an explosion outside a Catholic church that left six people dead, according to hospital and government officials. The apparent car bomb attack happened outside of St. Finbar's Catholic Church, according to Plateau Gov. Jonah David Jang. A spokesman for the Plateau state government, Machias Abraham Yiljab, said three bodies were at the scene of the explosion. Ishaya Pam, chief medical director of the Jos University Teaching Hospital, said in a statement that the hospital had three bodies and was treating 14 people for wounds suffered in the explosion. He said additional people had been wounded in the blast, but had been treated and released. Images sent by Mark Lipdo, program coordinator for the Stefanos Foundation, showed a charred crater in the pavement, a vehicle bumper in the road and smoke rising in the distance. Stefanos is a foundation that aims to help persecuted Christians in Nigeria and elsewhere. After the explosion, youths took over a roadblock on the street leading to the church, and an agitated crowd of residents upset with the violence gathered nearby to talk with Jang. 'This is an unfortunate situation and we will do all we can to prevent future occurrences,"" Jang said. ""We all must be calm and we all must leave things in the hands of God who knows why he has allowed this to happen."" iReport photo from the scene . The explosion at St. Finbar's church was the second in two weeks at a Christian church. On February 26, a car packed with explosives rammed into the compound of the Cocin (Church of Christ) headquarters, killing three people. It was not clear if anyone had claimed responsibility for the attack. Nigeria has suffered a rash of attacks on churches and mosques in the last year. In December, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in several northern states following a series of Christmas Day attacks on churches. A shadowy Islamic militant group called Boko Haram has been frequently blamed for the violence on Christians, who have sometimes responded with reprisal attacks. In a statement issued by his spokesman, Jonathan urged residents to refrain from reprisal attacks. ""The President urges Nigerians not to despair or be discouraged by the persistence of the attacks in spite of government's efforts to deal decisively with the menace of terrorism within the country's borders because despite seeming appearances to the contrary, government is indeed winning the war against the terrorists and will continue to progressively destroy their ability to unleash murderous attacks on peaceful, law-abiding Nigerians,"" spokesman Reuben Abati said in the statement.","Six people confirmed dead in Nigeria court attack .

"(CNN) -- People arrested amid unrest in Syria are being subjected to systematic torture, including electric shocks, beatings and sexual violence, a report by rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday. Based on interviews in Jordan with dozens of Syrians who have fled the country, the report details ""31 methods of torture or other ill treatment"" at the hands of the security forces, army and pro-government armed gangs. This Thursday marks a year since unrest first broke out, prompting a bloody crackdown and massive wave of arrests by the Syrian authorities. The government says it is battling ""armed terrorist groups"" but international leaders and rights groups dispute that. The torture meted out to those arrested on suspicion of opposing the government has generally followed a set pattern, says the Amnesty International report, titled ""'I wanted to die': Syria's torture survivors speak out."" Many detainees say they were beaten on arrest, and then subjected to severe beatings on arrival at detention centers. But their accounts show the greatest risk of abuse came when they were interrogated, the report says. Several detainees describe being forced into a vehicle tire and then beaten with cables or sticks, the report says. Others tell of being suspended above the ground by their wrists and then beaten, and of being forced to strip naked, often for long periods in extreme cold. An 18-year-old victim named as ""Karim"" told researchers that his interrogators used pincers to gouge flesh from his legs while he was held for 25 days in Daraa in December. Another man, a 29-year-old Arabic language teacher identified as ""Musleh,"" also described horrific treatment while being held in Daraa. ""We were hung from wood -- crucified -- while blindfolded and handcuffed, and then beaten mercilessly and repeatedly between 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.,"" he told the Amnesty researchers. Detainees also were forced to witness abuse and hear others -- sometimes relatives or friends -- being tortured and raped, the report says. ""I heard the screams of those being tortured for 24 hours a day. While in the cell we were busy praying for the safety of those who are being tortured,"" Musleh is quoted as saying. The accounts reveal ""a nightmarish world of systematic torture,"" said Ann Harrison, interim deputy director for Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. ""The testimonies we have heard give disturbing insights into a system of detention and interrogation which, a year after protests began, appears intended primarily to degrade, humiliate and terrify its victims into silence,"" she said. She said the experience for detainees arrested over the past year is similar to that endured under former President Hafez Assad, father of the current leader, Bashar al-Assad. Researchers spoke with dozens of Syrians in Jordan, including 25 who said they were tortured or ill-treated in detention before fleeing the country, an Amnesty press statement says. More than half the 19 cases featured in the report are from Daraa province, it adds. The abuses are being routinely carried out despite Syria being a party to the Convention against Torture and other international agreements, the report says, and the Syrian authorities ""appear to have no desire to try to stamp out these grave human rights violations."" The rights group urges Syria to take ""urgent measures"" to prevent further crimes under international law, including ending the arbitrary arrest and detention of those protesting peacefully against the government and halting the systemic use of torture. It also calls on the international community to take on responsibility for protecting the human rights of the Syrian people and ensuring violations are investigated and prosecuted. International leaders should also assist humanitarian agencies, rights groups and non-governmental organizations in helping the survivors of torture and their families, particularly in cases of sexual violence. Lastly, the report urges the U.N. Security Council to act by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court for investigation, imposing a comprehensive arms embargo and freezing the assets of al-Assad and his associates. Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution last month that many other countries argued could have helped stop the violence. The resolution would have condemned al-Assad and called on him to step aside. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, including many women and children, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, current president of the U.N. General Assembly, said Tuesday. Opposition activists have put the toll at more than 9,000. About 30,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries in the past year, according to Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' coordinator for Syrian refugees. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. Members of the Syrian security forces are also among those killed as the initially peaceful protests have spiraled into widespread violence. CNN's Bruce Conover contributed to this report.","Syrian survivors describe brutal treatment by security forces, Amnesty International says .

"(CNN) -- French league leaders Paris St Germain have confirmed the appointment of Italian Carlo Ancelotti as their new coach on a two-and-a-half year contract as a replacement for Antoine Kombouare, who left the club earlier on Friday. Ancelotti has been out of work since being sacked by Chelsea in May -- despite leading the London club to the English Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010. He replaces former PSG player Kombouare who, despite leading the club to the top of the Ligue One table, has been sacrificed by PSG's mega-rich Qatari owners who were keen for a bigger name to take over as coach. Out with the old and in with the new in 2012 . The 52-year-old Ancelotti, who twice won the Champions League while in charge of AC Milan, is reported to be the highest-paid coach in French football history and his first match in charge will be a friendly against Milan in Dubai on January 4. Ancelotti told a news conference: ""I am delighted to be here as coach of Paris Saint-Germain and I think I can do a great job to help PSG become a big club in Europe. ""The club has everything to succeed and has enormous ambition. I will do my best to learn French in the best possible way, although I'd rather continue to speak in Italian for the moment,"" continued Ancelotti -- who also confirmed that former French international Claude Makelele will be his assistant at the club. Kombouare, 48, issued a statement on his departure, saying: ""I thank everybody who offered me support over these last few days. ""I leave Paris Saint-Germain with a sense of unfinished business but with the feeling of having given everything for the club."" Ancelotti's appointment has increased speculation that David Beckham, who played for both Ancelotti, and PSG's sporting director Leonardo, at AC Milan, could be the next big name arrival in the French capital. However, Beckham's agents released a statement saying: ""There is no agreement with PSG at this time, an offer does not make a contract, we continue to hold negotiations with a number of clubs.""","Carlo Ancelotti has been appointed as the new coach of French side Paris St Germain .

"London (CNN) -- A pair of British journalists held by a Libyan militia have been handed over to the central government, British government sources said Wednesday in what one called a possible step toward their freedom. Nicholas Davies and Gareth Montgomery-Johnson were seized in late February, along with the Libyans who accompanied them, according to Human Rights Watch. Libya's transitional government had been trying to get the militia to hand over the two men, the group said. The British sources said the men have now been transferred to the transitional government. ""We are pretty hopeful this is a prelude to their release,"" one of the sources, who asked not to be named while discussing sensitive issues, told CNN. Some militias that established themselves to fight former dictator Moammar Gadhafi have remained intact and outside government control since Gadhafi's government fell in August. The Saraya Swehli militia accused the journalists, who work mainly for Iran's state-run Press TV, of lacking proper immigration paperwork. The group told Human Rights Watch that it did not have faith in the central government, an HRW official told CNN in February.","""We are pretty hopeful this is a prelude to their release,"" a source tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Invisible Children, which produced a hugely popular half-hour documentary about notorious African warlord Joseph Kony, released a new video Monday to try to address criticisms about its nonprofit organization, its approach and its goals. The group's ""KONY 2012"" video had been viewed more than 74 million times on YouTube by Monday. Invisible Children, which is based in San Diego, said it hopes the film and other efforts will make Kony a household name and drum up international support to halt killings, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by his group the Lord's Resistance Army, or LRA, in central Africa. The 30-minute video became a sensation thanks to thousands of posts on Facebook and Twitter, including from celebrities including Bono, Angelina Jolie, Jay Z, Ryan Seacrest and Rihanna. But in dramatically introducing Kony to many for the first time, the video also spurred a flurry of questions about Invisible Children's intentions, its transparency and whether the social-media frenzy was too little, too late. ""I understand why a lot of people are wondering is this some slick, kind of fly-by-night, slacktivist thing, when actually it's not at all,"" said Invisible Children CEO Ben Keesey on the 8 minute, 32 second video released Monday. ""It's connected to a really deep, thoughtful, very intentional and strategic campaign."" Kony has operated in central Africa for two decades and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. In October, the United States sent 100 combat-equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture Kony. Evelyn Apoko, who spent three harrowing years in captivity after the LRA abducted her in 2001, said last week that she agreed that Kony needs to face justice and she hoped the documentary would help make that happen. But she said she worried that a military campaign against Kony might bring more injury to children who have suffered enough. Apoko was severely disfigured after a military bombing targeting the LRA. ""They should open their eyes more on the people affected by the war,"" she said of Invisible Children. ""And the children -- they need to find a way to protect them. They have no hope, no way to escape."" Keesey said on Sunday that Invisible Children was acutely aware of those risks. ""Any approach to stop the LRA needs to be sensitive to that,"" he said. ""It needs to do everything possible to protect those innocent women and children."" And again, on the video released Monday, Keesey said that while most agree that Kony needs to be stopped, how to accomplish that is far more complicated. ""That's not that easy. It's actually really difficult,"" Keesey said. ""Therefore, the effort to stop the LRA has to be comprehensive, and it has to be huge."" Keesey did not directly address criticisms from several observers, who have urged caution and said Invisible Children has manipulated facts in the past. A student blog called ""Visible Children"" linked to a photograph of Invisible Children's founders -- Bobby Bailey, Laren Poole and Jason Russell -- posing with hard-core weaponry with members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, who have battled the LRA. ""The group is in favor of direct military intervention, and their money supports the Ugandan government's army and various other military forces,"" the Visible Children blog post said. ""Both the Ugandan army and Sudan People's Liberation Army are riddled with accusations of rape and looting, but Invisible Children defends them."" In Monday's video, there was no mention of arming any one group. Keesey said only that ""our goal has always been the same ... to stop the violence of the LRA permanently."" Keesey added that a large mass advocacy campaign, that ideally would spur public pressure on government leaders worldwide to act in some way, was one pillar of Invisible Children's three-pronged approach. The other two were producing media, such as the films, and funding development programs to directly help people in central Africa. Keesey was particularly adamant in defending his organization against criticisms it had not been open about its finances. ""Any claims that we do not have financial transparency or that we're not audited every year by an independent firm or that we don't have financial integrity just aren't true,"" Keesey said. On its website, Invisible Children said it spent 80.46% on programs in 2011, 16.24% on administration and management costs and 3.22% on direct fundraising. Keesey also noted that ""audited financial statements, tax returns and our annual report"" are all online. Invisible Children spokeswoman Noelle Jouglet has said money generated from the film will go to help build schools in Uganda. Money will also go to support a high-frequency radio station that Invisible Children operates, which broadcasts anti-LRA messages to fighters urging them to defect. CNN was unable immediately to verify this information or any of Invisible Children's activities in African nations. Keesey defended some line items that have drawn scrutiny in recent days. They include ""travel and transportation expenses"" related to staging 3,000 free screenings annually of the group's films at high schools and colleges, as well as production costs to create items like DVDs and T-shirts ""that fund all of our work."" Russell, the video's director, on Sunday told CNN that Invisible Children had chosen Kony as a focal point to get its larger message out about ending violence and promoting peace in the region. Because of the zeitgeist of the culture and the world, we need an enemy,"" he said. ""We need to know who the worst is."" On April 20, the group plans to paper cities with Kony posters. But the media attention on Kony may actually hamper efforts to catch Kony, said Peter Pham of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. The film comes after a regional -- and covert -- military operation that has been under way for several months. The attention could prompt Kony to go on the move again and may set back African and U.S. efforts to catch the warlord. ""All I can say is, it couldn't have happened at a more unhelpful moment when you look at it strategically and operationally,"" said Pham, a civilian adviser to the military command that sent the U.S. troops. CNN's David McKenzie spoke with Jacob Acaye, a Ugandan featured in the video. McKenzie returned with Acaye for exclusive access to go to the exact spot where he says LRA rebels took him in the middle of the night years ago. Acaye was able to escape a few days later, saying his life would be very different if he hadn't. ""I reached a point when I said, 'I can even die now' because I thought it would be the immediate resolution of my suffering,"" Acaye said. The Ugandan called criticism against the documentary unfair. ""The same thing that was happening here is going on in other parts of the country,"" Acaye said. ""I feel like it is not good for a human being, for any other child, for any other village to be suffering,"" he said. While millions around the world have viewed the first documentary, many people in remote areas of Uganda haven't been able to see it because they don't have access to the Internet or a television. The African Youth Initiative Network said it will have a community screening of ""Kony 2012"" on Tuesday in northern Uganda. Organizers have said their purpose is to help victims of war. The LRA terrorized Uganda for years in a failed attempt to overthrow the government. But since 2006, when it was pushed out of northern Uganda, it has largely operated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic. The U.N. refugee agency said last week that 3,000 people were recently displaced after fresh LRA attacks in Congo's Orientale province. The agency reported 20 new attacks since the start of the year, with one person killed and 17 abducted. The cultish rebel group stands accused of using vicious tactics to recruit and force thousands of children into taking up arms. There are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents. Actress Mia Farrow, a good will ambassador for UNICEF who has visited areas attacked by the LRA, commended Invisible Children for bringing ""unprecedented focus"" to a horrific situation but urged people to donate money to agencies like the Red Cross and UNICEF that work to help victims. Ugandan government spokesman Fred Opolot was more critical, saying Invisible Children's campaign portrayed Africa as a dark and incessantly troubled continent. ""Invisible Children, if it is using such images to dupe the international community into, into ensuring that they contribute financially into its works, I'm afraid to say it is a wrong approach,"" Opolot said. ""And indeed its activities in northern Uganda will be further questioned, in as far as the amount of money they receive vis-a-vis the actual interventions that they make in northern Uganda where he thinks he is concerned about."" In the video released Monday, Keesey said he understood why people might challenge Invisible Children's model and strategy. At the same time, he vowed that his group plans to answer questions in the coming days -- urging people to tweet @invisible, including #askicanything, so that he and others can respond. ""We want you to know all about the next steps, so we're going to be sending details in the coming days,"" said Keesey. ""And we want to answer any question that you have, that maybe wasn't addressed in this video.""

"(CNN) -- Amnesty International is urging Saudi Arabia to stop the ""outrageous restriction"" of peaceful protests, a call that comes after a crackdown last week on protesters in the country's Shiite region. About 24 protesters were detained in the eastern city of Qatif last week as they denounced ""the prolonged detention"" of nine Shiite prisoners held without trial for more than 14 years, the human rights group said. Police kicked and used batons to beat three protesters in what was an apparent peaceful demonstration, Amnesty said in a statement dated Monday. ""The Saudi Arabian authorities have a duty to ensure freedom of assembly and are obliged under international law to allow peaceful protests to take place,"" said Philip Luther, deputy director of the human rights group's Middle East and North Africa program.'' ""They must act immediately to end this outrageous restriction on the right to legitimate protest."" There was no immediate reaction from the Saudi government to the Amnesty statement. The protests in the majority Sunni kingdom occurred Thursday and Friday, and they've accompanied the calls across the Arab world for more freedom and democracy. Rights activists have been urging the right to protest for months in the kingdom, which prohibits all kinds of public demonstrations, and they have been denied permission to assemble. Lately, grass-roots ferment mirroring the unrest across the Middle East and North Africa has emerged, with a Facebook group calling for days of rage and Shiites taking to the streets. Activists have been calling for reform and the release of people jailed without charge or trial. Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry warned Saturday that its security forces will be ""authorized to take all measures against anyone who tries to break the law and cause disorder,"" the ministry said, according to the country's state-run news agency. Amnesty said the recent detentions came a week after a prominent Shiite cleric, Sheikh Tawfiq Jaber Ibrahim al-'Amr was arrested after a sermon calling for reforms in Saudi Arabia. He was released without charge Sunday. Most of the protesters are believed to be held in a police station in Dhahran, an eastern city. Among them are activists who have protested arrests and discrimination against the minority Shiites. ""The Saudi authorities must investigate reports of beatings of protesters by security forces. They should also ensure that those detained are either charged with recognizable offences and tried fairly or released,"" Luther said. ""While in detention they must be protected from torture and other ill-treatment and given regular access to their family, lawyers and medical staff."" The Shiite activists in ""prolonged detention"" have been held in connection with the deadly 1996 bombing of a U.S. military complex in Khobar in which 20 people were killed and hundreds injured. ""According to reports, they were interrogated, tortured and denied access to lawyers together with the opportunity to challenge the legality of their detention,"" Amnesty said.","Amnesty International decries ""outrageous restriction"" of peaceful protests .

"(CNN) -- An Italian who was killed during a failed hostage rescue attempt in Nigeria was shot four times, a doctor told reporters. Doctors conducted an autopsy on Franco Lamolinara on Saturday, immediately after his body arrived in Rome, said Dr. Paolo Alberello of the Forensic Institute of Rome's Sapienza University, according to Italian media reports. Italy's ANSA news agency reported that a funeral will be held Monday for the 47-year-old engineer, who was abducted in May 2011, along with Briton Chris McManus. Six dead in car bomb attack at church . Kidnappers killed the men last Thursday while a raid to free them was under way, according to British government sources briefed on the matter. The case has drawn attention -- and criticism -- from top Italian officials, who have questioned why Rome was not consulted before the operation, which was launched by Nigerian forces with support from Britain. Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti visited Lamolinara's family Sunday in the northern village of Gattinara, ANSA said. Italian lawmakers were scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the lack of communication between British and Italian officials before the failed operation. The Parliamentary Committee for National Security will question Italy's head of foreign security over the matter, according to a statement on the Parliament website. In a meeting Friday with his Italian counterpart, British Foreign Secretary William Hague ""made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages, whose lives were in imminent and growing danger,"" said a joint UK-Italian statement issued by Britain's Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Under these circumstances it was only possible to inform Italy once the operation was already getting under way."" Lamolinara was married and had two teenage children, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. He and McManus worked for the construction and civil engineering firm B. Stabilini and Co., which is based in Abuja, Nigeria. British Prime Minister David Cameron said last week that he had worked to free the two men since they were kidnapped in May 2011 and authorized the rescue attempt. Authorities could not find the men for months, he said, but eventually got credible information about their location, and ""a window of opportunity"" presented itself. ""The terrorists holding the two hostages made very clear threats to take their lives, including in a video that was posted on the Internet,'' Cameron said. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said the men were killed before the joint forces could reach their hideout in the northern state of Sokoto. He blamed the kidnapping and killings on Boko Haram, the militant Islamist terror group responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria in the past two years. But a statement posted on a pro-jihad forum on which the militant group has been active in recent months denied any link. ""The hostage-taking operation was not a Boko Haram one, we have always claimed responsibilities for our attacks, beware allowing the Kaffir [infidel] government of Nigeria to mislead you,"" it says. In December, a Nigerian group calling itself ""al Qaeda in the land beyond the Sahil"" announced that it had captured McManus, according to the Press Association in Britain. Journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","An autopsy is conducted on Franco Lamolinara, who was killed in a failed rescue attempt .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Brazilian filmmaker Jose Padilha knows how to get people talking. Jose Padilha's movie ""Elite Squad"" examines police violence and corruption in Brazil. The director of ""Elite Squad"" stirred controversy when his action thriller premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival earlier this year. The movie tells the story of an elite police squad that employs a no-holds-barred approach when it comes to battling the drug gangs who control Rio de Janeiro's slums, known as favelas. Told from the perspective of a member of Rio's State Police Special Operations Battalion, or BOPE, Padilha's film has elicited criticism for its extreme violence and what some say is a glorification of ruthless police tactics. Padilha, who co-wrote ""Elite Squad"" with ""City of God"" screenwriter Braulio Mantovani and Rodrigo Pimentel, a former BOPE captain, says he wanted the film to explore the roots of police violence and corruption in Brazil. The movie, which casts light on the vicious cycle of violence in Brazil, ""is basically about how the police institution turns individuals into corrupted cops or violent cops,"" Padilha told CNN. ""Elite Squad,"" or ""Tropa de Elite"" in Portuguese,"" is one of the harshest Brazilian slice-of-life movies since Fernando Meirelles's 2002 drama ""City of God."" The violent tone of Padilha's film contrasts sharply with other recent movies chronicling favela life. Walter Salles offers a somber look at Sao Paulo's underclass in ""Linha de Passe,"" which was released earlier this year. The film from the director of ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" and ""Central Station"" depicts the lives of four brothers and their mother as they struggle to overcome their circumstances. Meanwhile, Lucia Murat's ""Mare, Nossa Historia de Amor"" (2007), or ""Mare, Our Love Story,"" sets the tale of Romeo and Juliet in a Rio slum and tells the story of gang warfare through music and dance. Padilha started out making ""Elite Squad"" as a documentary. But the members of the police who he interviewed for research didn't want to appear on screen so he decided to turn it into a fictional movie instead. The movie was filmed in the favelas, and people on the street offered input as the scenes were shot, Padilha said. Shooting in the slums added to the grim realism of the movie, but the undertaking wasn't without its own perils. At one point during the shoot, a car containing fake guns and five crew members was hijacked by armed drug dealers. (The crew members were eventually released and a police raid ensued.) Rio's slums are, for the most part, populated by honest people striving to survive by honest means, Padilha told CNN. ""But unfortunately, favelas have small groups of heavily armed drug dealers that control the life of everyone there. They are the rulers, they are the judges and they can kill you and that's it."" ""Elite Squad"" became the focus of heated debate when it was released in Brazil last October, prompting discussions about acceptable thresholds of police violence. (The police in Brazil even went as far as trying to get a court order to ban the film.) Those efforts failed, and the film went on to achieve commercial and critical success. It became the most popular film in Brazil last year and took home the Golden Bear, the top prize at the Berlin festival, in February. The drama, which raises challenging questions about the problems confronting Brazilian society, is not the first time Padilha has tackled tough issues on film. He earned acclaim for his 2002 documentary ""Bus 172"" about the true-story hijacking of a Rio bus by a former street child. ""In that documentary I told how or why the street kid became so violent and I said basically that it is the way the state restricts small time criminals -- by torturing, by killing, by putting them in crowded jails,"" Padilha said. ""Elite Squad"" follows a similar vein. It takes the same idea but applies it to the police. ""The bottom line is we are trying to say that the whole violence that goes on in Rio is mainly caused by ourselves and we can possibly undo that,"" he said.","""Elite Squad"" tells the story of a violent special operations unit in Brazil .

"Editor's note: CNN agreed not to use the full names of the family members in this article due to concern for their safety. CNN and CNN.com will continue to follow Youssif's journey in the months ahead as he faces more surgeries. Youssif attempts a climbing wall, his helmet carefully strapped around his wounds. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Burned Iraqi boy Youssif shows no fear as he stares up at the rock-climbing wall. ""I can do it fast and then I am going to stand on top."" It's a declaration of defiance and strength from the 5-year-old who will need plenty of both as he continues his long recovery from horrific burns suffered when masked men set him on fire. In the eight weeks since his last surgery, the doctors' predictions are coming true and Youssif's face actually looks worse even as it gets better. The skin graft on his nose is still healing and balloons placed under the skin of his right cheek and on his neck are almost fully inflated. Extra skin will grow over these tissue expanders and will then be stretched over Youssif's scars. It's a noticeable change, but one that doesn't seem to be bothering Youssif as he waves frantically at his parents, a huge climbing helmet perched on his head and held on by straps fitted around his swollen skin.  Watch a giggling Youssif run, roll and ride at sports camp » . His emotional transformation is continuing along with the physical changes and Youssif's parents say he is now a more cheerful child. ""It makes me happier than he is, in all honestly, when I see him like this,"" says Youssif's father, who doesn't want his identity disclosed. As he speaks, Youssif is shrieking with laughter, darting around the circle playing his new favorite game -- ""Duck, duck, goose"" -- with new friends at the Canyon Creek Sports Camp, about an hour north of Los Angeles, California. It's a day of fun and learning for burn survivors and their families. Along with Youssif are 7-year-old Walter, burned with his parents in a car accident, and Dami, 4, burned when a generator accidentally exploded back home in Africa. ""This is a day away from the public. It is a day of fun, but we are also going to do some activities that are a little more challenging, confidence building,"" says Keely Quinn, program director with the Children's Burn Foundation. The foundation, which worked nationally and internationally, agreed to sponsor Youssif's treatment after CNN readers and viewers learned of the boy's plight and donated thousands of dollars to bring him from Baghdad to the United States for help. Fun and games aside, the day at the camp is also meant to help the children and their families cope with the trauma they've gone through. ""They [the children] have learned that the world isn't a safe place anymore,"" Quinn says. At the camp, the families get a chance to hear from long-time survivors like Bonnie Weatherbee, 37, who was burned at the age of 18 months. ""We are unique, we are special, we are not freaks, we are not contagious,"" she tells the group. Everyone here has been confronted with hostility or ignorance.  See photos of how Youssif's face is changing » . ""How do you just deal with people who see the child and go hysteric?"" asks Dami's mother, Shade, as she waves her arms to mimic a woman's nearly frantic reaction to her son. Youssif was recently going down a slide when nearby children burst into tears at the sight of him, his dad says. ""Youssif came out and his face had gone pale and he said 'Daddy, they were crying, they were scared of me.' "" Weatherbee says families can choose how to react, but it's important to empower the children so they know how to cope with the questions and the stares as well. ""Most of the public is interested in the story out of concern, they want to know that your child is OK,"" Weatherbee tells the families. At the camp, parents and children color in paper figures representing themselves to go in cardboard homes in an activity designed to help them find ""safe places"" again. Clutching a figure elaborately splashed in colors and decorated with feathers, Youssif shrieks, ""This is mommy,"" before dissolving into laughter. He is still learning about new things to play with that he never had in Baghdad -- like glitter, and he soon discovers it's much more fun to coat real people rather than their paper counterparts with the sparkly stuff. Youssif's dad even jokes about it when the families ""visit"" each other's cardboard homes: ""We'd like to apologize since the house is a mess and we haven't had time to clean up."" All laughter aside, this is still a difficult journey for the young family, struggling to adapt to a country so different from Iraq and the stress of their son's surgery.  Watch how the family makes it through the agonizing ordeal of Youssif's first surgery » . ""It's hard to be a foreigner,"" Youssif's father says. ""God willing things will go well. The doctor said the next surgery is going to be harder and that we need to be ready for that."" Youssif's mother, Zainab, dissolves into tears just thinking about Iraq, saying homesickness is just beginning to set in. But the mood lightens when talk turns to Thanksgiving. They don't know much about this U.S. holiday, but they say they are lucky to be here. ""I thank the Americans so much,"" Zainab says. ""They really helped my son in ways no one else did.""

"(CNN) -- The former mistress of 2008 Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards is expected to be a prosecution witness in his federal criminal trial next month, a federal judge said in court Thursday. At issue in the approaching North Carolina trial is whether money given to support Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, by the then-candidate's benefactors should have been considered donations toward his presidential campaign. Edwards maintains the money was a gift. Edwards is charged with six felony and misdemeanor counts related to donations to and payments from his failed 2008 campaign. He is accused of conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. He denies any wrongdoing. In federal court in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday, Judge Catherine Eagles said that attorneys in the case should expect Hunter to testify on behalf of the government. If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million. His attorneys have claimed the investigation and prosecution are politically motivated, and the charges do not clearly establish any violation of election law. His lawyers have argued in federal court the money was a gift unrelated to campaign expenditures and that legally, donors can help pay for a candidate's personal expenses unrelated to the campaign, according to a report by CNN affiliate WTVD in Raleigh, North Carolina, last October. The attorneys also said money from donors never went directly to Edwards, but was handled through third parties, WTVD said. Edwards was Sen. John Kerry's running mate on the 2004 Democratic presidential ticket. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Federal judge tells attorneys to expect ex-mistress to testify for government .

"Washington (CNN) -- Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius spoke out against bullying Wednesday at a middle school in Washington during a premiere of the anti-bullying documentary ""Speak Up."" The documentary, set to air Sunday on Cartoon Network, consists of interviews with children who say they were bullied in school and includes strategies on how to bring an end to bullying. Cartoon Network is owned by Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN. Sebelius told students gathered at Stuart-Hobson Middle School that bullying is simply unacceptable, ""You shouldn't ever have to go to class with an empty feeling in your stomach, trying to figure out what was going to happen in that class. You shouldn't be afraid to eat in the cafeteria. You shouldn't be afraid to speak up in class. That happens to too many kids too many days of the week,"" Sebelius told the students. Before part of the documentary was screened, students watched a taped message from President Barack Obama in which he said bully prevention is important to him both as the president and as a father. ""Bullying is not a rite of passage or a harmless part of growing up, it's wrong, it's destructive and we can all prevent it. I care about this issue deeply, not just as the president but as a dad,"" Obama said in the message. After the documentary screening, a panel consisting of bully prevention experts, the president of Cartoon Network and some victims of bullying discussed bully prevention. CNN Anchor Don Lemon moderated the discussion. To demonstrate how prevalent bullying is, Lemon asked the students in the auditorium whether they had been victims of bullying; about half of them raised their hands. While Sebelius acknowledged there's only so much the federal government can do to prevent bullying, she did say its prevention is a basic human right. ""Every child in this country has a right to feel safe,"" Sebelius said.

"Mutare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- After weeks of negotiations with the government, CNN's Marketplace Africa show has been granted access to the controversial Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe. Some experts believe that Marange is the largest diamond discovery in generations but the find has been dogged by allegations of human rights abuses and corruption going right to the heart of Mugabe's government. There are four diamond companies operating in the area. With a large delegation of government minders in tow, CNN was first taken to visit Marange Resources. It is exclusively owned by the state-run company, the Zimbabwe Diamond Mining Corporation (ZMDC). Security is tight. High voltage barbed wire fences surround the diamond mines and the processing plant's equipment. Several full body searches are done as you get closer to the sorting area where the diamonds are picked from the dirt. To avoid ""leakages"", as it is called - or, in other words, worker theft -- the diamonds are kept in a glass case and the sorters use gloves to drop the diamonds into an underground vault. The company says at no point in the extraction process does a human being touch any of the diamonds. The mining manager of Marange Resources, Munashe Shava, tells CNN that ""between our three plants we can produce a minimum of 200,000 carats every month."" All four mining companies - Marange, Mbada, Anjin and DMC - have been certified to sell their diamonds on the international market by the Kimberley Process. Read more: What are 'conflict diamonds?' The human rights organization Global Witness called the decision ""shocking"" and pulled out of the international scheme it helped create. But despite the intense criticism of the Marange diamond fields, one of the two monitors of the Kimberley Process -- the U.N. protocol to certify origin of the gems and curtail trafficking of ""blood diamonds"" to fund militant groups - said he has seen significant improvements. ""You could not find a bigger transition than that one,"" Van Bockstael told CNN in Harare. ""This is not a granny that is digging with an old shovel in a pit or something -- that happened in 2007, 2008, which was when the problems started. You are talking about now top-notch diamond companies that are using state-of-the-art equipment. "" The Chinese-run company Anjin has been one of the most heavily criticized companies operating in the field. Global Witness claims that this 50-50 partnership between a Chinese engineering firm and the state owned ZMDC has ""board members including senior serving and retired military and police officers."" They argue that this ""creates opportunities for off budget funding of the security sector"" and "" a real risk of these revenues being used to finance violence during a future election"" in the country. Read more: Is 'blood diamond' definition about to change? Human Rights Watch says while it has seen an improvement in Marange, it also believes questions remain over who is involved in running these mining companies. ""Well, when we say things have improved it simply means the violence has certainly ended"" Tiseke Kasambala of Human Rights Watch told CNN. ""There is no longer much torture, and the forced labor has come to an end, but why has this taken place? It is because the army has gained pretty much most of the control of the fields."" CNN confronted Zimbabwean director of Anjin, Munyaradzi Machacha, with these allegations. ""In Zimbabwe, boards are made up of all its citizens,"" Machacha said. ""With Anjin and all other companies, they are free to bring in persons with different skills and backgrounds. So really it is not like Anjin is a military (controlled) area, it is a civilian company operating like any other."" The Chairman of ZMDC, Godwills Masimirembwa, told CNN that there is nothing wrong with serving military figures connected to the ruling ZANU-PF being on the boards of these mining companies. ""There is nothing wrong with them sitting on some of the boards, they are Zimbabweans, they are entitled to sit on those boards."" When asked which military figures were connected with these companies, he replied: . ""When you deal with sensitive issues, particularly in the background of sanctions against us, if you look at the sensitivity of that area, and the attack that is against Zimbabwe on the assumption that everything that goes there is for the benefit of ZANU-PF, it is obviously important that we protect the national interest"". But despite these mines getting the green light from the Kimberley Process, the European Union's so-called ""restrictive measures"" and U.S. government sanctions remain in place. According to Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic, speaking to CNN's Marketplace Africa in her first interview as the new U.S. chair of the Kimberley Process, sanctions have been imposed because ""these entities are undermining democracy and democratic institutions."" Ramzi Malik is the project manager of DMC, another mining company operating in the fields. The U.S. sanctions anger him. ""It was actually quite shocking that sanctions would be slapped on us even though we are fully compliant by the Kimberley Process,"" Malik says. ""So for us we just continue doing our business and doing our thing, and that is the end of it."" ""Sanctions or no sanctions diamonds get sold to clients all over the world, be it Belgium, be it Israel, be it India, be it customers in Dubai. They come from all over. You have the product available, they will come, they will pay their money for it and they will take it.""","CNN granted exclusive access to the controversial Marange diamond fields .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Two documentaries at this year's Cannes Film Festival dealt with sporting legends. From left to right: Former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson, director Emir Kusturica and ex-footballer Diego Maradona at this year's Cannes. In both cases, however, their immense achievements are coupled by an equally impressive appetite for self-destruction. The footballer Diego Maradona provides the subject for an intimate portrait by one of Europe's most respected directors and two-time winner of the Palme d'Or, Emir Kusturica. In ""Tyson"", director James Toback uses hours of footage mixing fight sequences with interviews and photographs to tell the story of Mike Tyson's climb from his impoverished New York childhood to fame, and then ignominy. Both have been eagerly anticipated and it's easy to see why. When it comes to committing sporting legends to the silver screen, one equation seems to hold true -- the more controversial the better. Consequently, documentaries celebrating sporting greats like Michael Jordan or Pele tend to be unremarkable -- dealing as they are with men whose incredible talent was matched by a relaxed temperament and a shrewdness that kept them out of trouble. By contrast, two of the most critically-acclaimed sports documentaries of the last 20 years featured flawed sporting legends: the self-styled ""greatest"" Muhammad Ali and the brooding French footballer Zinedine Zidane. Equally, the lives of Maradona and Tyson lend themselves perfectly to the drama of cinema. Like characters in a Shakespearean tragedy, both reached the absolute pinnacle of sporting achievement only to be laid low by a mixture of hubris, greed and their own personal demons. That Tyson and Maradona both seem to have been returned from the brink, rehabilitated and with (at least in Tyson's case) a degree of humility, gives their stories a redemptive quality worthy of a Christian parable. ""I've lived a wild and strange life,"" Tyson told a news conference at Cannes ahead of this week's screening. ""I've used drugs, I've had physical altercations with dangerous people, people were angry. I've slept with guys' wives, they wanted to kill me. I'm just happy to be here. It's just a miracle."" Read a timeline of Mike Tyson's life . Kusturica's film about Maradona details the Argentine footballer's well-documented problems with cocaine that saw him sent home in disgrace from the 1994 World Cup finals after he failed a drug's test. The Bosnian-Serb director, however, is more interested in the footballer's cultural and political significance than his off-field antics. A committed socialist and fierce critic of U.S. involvement in South America, Maradona counts among his friends the Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. An avowed fan of the diminutive footballing genius, Kusturica told the British paper The Guardian that his film reveals ""the politically incorrect citizen against the unilateral politics of the U.S."" In the director's eyes Maradona embodies Latin America's underdog status against the power of the West in general, and the U.S. in particular. For example -- and England football fans of a delicate nature might want to avert eyes at this point -- Kusturica calls the game in which Maradona sent England crashing out of the 1986 World Cup, scoring twice (once with his hand) ""perhaps the first and the last time there has been justice in the world."" Read a timeline of Diego Maradona's life . To illustrate his point, Kusturica ends the film at the Aztec Stadium in Mexico City: the scene of Maradona's routing of the English. A sports star like Maradona, whose life has transcended the sporting arena to encompass the political is a rarity. The best instance of this was Mohammed Ali, whose lightning fists and an even quicker tongue made him a legend around the world. At the same time, his outspoken political views turned him into a divisive figure in his homeland. ""When We Were Kings"" tells the story of Ali's famous comeback fight against the undefeated champion of the world George Foreman staged in then Zaire -- the so-called 'Rumble in the Jungle.' Told through original footage and interviews with some of those who were at the fight, the film received widespread critical acclaim on its release in 1996, winning the award for best documentary features at the Oscars. Considering the fascinating subject matter though, it's hardly surprising. Staging the fight in Africa was a potent political symbol given the fevered state of race relations back in the U.S. At the time of the bout in 1974, the civil rights battles of the sixties had radicalized African-Americans and the black power movement was growing in numbers. Ali's support for the controversial Nation of Islam and his refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in Vietnam put him at the center of much of this political upheaval. Considered past his prime, Ali's unexpected and remarkable defeat of Foreman appeared almost a victory for African-Americans consciousness set in this context. In many ways French-born footballer Zinedine Zidane seems the polar opposite of Ali. Whilst the boxing legend spent his career trash talking opponents and waxing lyrical about his beliefs, Zidane -- who retired two years ago -- is notoriously publicity shy, preferring usually to let his football do the talking. ""Zidane: A 21st- Century Portrait"" consequently focuses on the personal rather than the political, capturing the brooding intensity of the French maestro. Filmed during a Spanish league game in 2005, Zidane's every move, breath and emotion was captured by 17 different cameras trained on him alone for the entire match. The myopic focus is strangely hypnotic, leaving you with a sense of not only the artistry of the man but also his isolation on the football pitch. In a stadium of 80,000 his sublime talent and obsessive dedication to his sport set him apart from those around him. For all the adulation showered on these sporting greats, the film reveals just how lonely it can be at the top.","Two documentaries at the Cannes Film Festival dealt with sporting legends .

"Washington (CNN) -- FBI Director Robert Mueller said Thursday he is concerned about the potential for terrorists mounting cyber attacks and that the bureau is working ""to stay ahead of these threats, both at home and abroad."" ""While to date terrorists have not used the Internet to launch a full-scale cyber attack, we cannot underestimate their intent,"" Mueller testified to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee in which lawmakers pressed him about what additional funding and laws may be necessary to combat the cyber threat. Mueller did not provide many details during the public session, but later met with senators behind closed doors to provide additional information. Mueller noted that terror groups are becoming more ""cyber savvy."" As examples, he cited al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which publishes an online magazine called Inspire, and the Somali group Al-Shabaab, which has its own Twitter account. More importantly, however, he said, terrorists are ""using cyberspace to conduct operations."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina asked Mueller whether a cyber attack suspect tied to al Qaeda would be treated differently than a regular criminal suspect. Many members of Congress have said terror suspects are better handled by the military than going through a criminal court process. But Mueller did not debate the issue, saying when a cyber intrusion happens, his agency's goal is to find out who is behind the computer. ""At the point in time of an intrusion, you don't know whether it's going to be a country, a terrorist or the 18-year-old kid down the block,"" he said.","FBI director: Terror groups are becoming more ""cyber savvy""

"(CNN) -- One year after the Syrian conflict began, the numbers are staggering: more than 8,000 killed, tens of thousands detained, and dozens of towns decimated, according to the United Nations. But beyond the statistics, the people of Syria find their tragic struggle often reduced to 45-second fragments on YouTube or static-filled Skype phone calls. The reason? The government's tight constraints on media access. Of the few journalists brave enough to defy the Syrian government's restrictions, at least five paid the ultimate price, including veteran war correspondent Marie Colvin and award-wining photographer Remi Ochlik. One year on, Syria still boiling . The constant danger means the media have been left to rely on official government accounts, as well as a network of opposition activists scattered across Syria and a passionate expatriate community. The opposition details what's happening on the ground through amateur videos, messages describing the latest carnage and eyewitness accounts offered over the phone or Internet. Yet while news organizations go to great lengths to verify such amateur reporting, it is no substitute for independent eyes and ears on the ground. In other conflicts, a handful of media personnel might capture the full-scale horror of violence. A reporter and perhaps his crew may record the moment -- for instance, a young man being shot and killed -- and then edit their content and wrap it into a television piece for air or for a newspaper or magazine story. Journalists missing in Syria . But when it comes to Syria, it seems everyone in the country is on the front lines, witnesses to tragedies large and small. On our Twitter accounts, on our Facebook pages, and in our e-mail inboxes, we are confronted regularly by depictions of mutilated corpses, wailing mothers and the pain of a people under siege by their own government. How will it end? The result is jarring: a world forced to watch as Syrian security forces appear to continually broaden their wrath, with international initiative after initiative faltering in their efforts to resolve the crisis. The uprising began in March 2011, when at least 15 children from the southern province of Daraa were reportedly tortured at the hands of state security. Their crime was defacing a school's walls with anti-regime graffiti, at a time soon after the longtime leaders of Tunisia and Egypt had fallen under the weight of popular revolutions. Many of the young boys and girls came home traumatized, their nails pulled out by Syrian security forces. One video showed a young boy in a red-striped shirt, his face bruised and full of fear. He introduced the world to a regime with seemingly no limits on what they would do, as well as defiant citizens who were willing to confront it. Perhaps no video captured the plight of Daraa's children more than a 2-minute, 22-second clip showing the mutilated corpse of 13-year old Hamza al-Khateeb. After being detained for just a few days by authorities, Al-Khateeb's body was bloated almost beyond recognition. For activists, YouTube a key weapon . More horror stories came out as the months passed by: soccer stadiums packed with detainees in Banyas, hundreds killed in the military assault of Hama during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, thousands fleeing shelling in the border of town of Jisr al-Shughur in hopes of reaching refugee camps in Turkey. With each incident, videos came showing nameless victims pleading, crying or falling silent. President Bashar al-Assad's regime, in statements and through official media, has routinely insisted that ""armed terrorist groups"" are to blame for the bloodshed. Its forces, they say, are trying to guarantee security even as they act to defend themselves. Leaked e-mails remove al-Assad's veil . Yet the opposition and a growing number of international governments and institutions, including the United Nations, say the government is the aggressor. More recently, and more regularly, they report that security forces have moved from targeting individuals to waging indiscriminate and widespread military assaults on opposition areas. Amidst this broader crackdown, the people of Baba Amr -- a neighborhood in the embattled city of Homs -- made history. They became the first citizens believed to have broadcast their own destruction, live via social media. As Syrian troops pummeled the 5-square-mile area, a small group of activists pointed a live stream camera over their rooftops. Yet many of those activist journalists, among others, have gone silent. For example, amateur photographers Basil Al Sayed and his cousin Rami Al Sayed once had relayed a steady stream of reports before they suddenly stopped. The reason why became evident when YouTube videos showed their bullet-ridden bodies. Many Syrian opposition members, however, said it's not death they fear most. ""Those who are dead are in the mercy of God now. But it is those who are alive, who still suffer, that we are worried about,"" an activist told me as he described the death in detention of his friend Ghiyath Mattar, a peace activist who'd attended demonstrations with a rose in one hand and a Syrian flag in the other. So far, after taking steps like bolstering sanctions and withdrawing ambassadors, other nations haven't managed to end the suffering. Yet Syrians continue to point their camera phones at tanks every day in hopes of getting outsiders' attention, asking, ""How many more people have to die before someone helps us?"" Early on, a common rallying cry was, ""People demand the fall of the regime."" Today, as the blood continues to flow, that has been replaced on many Syrian streets with the more ominous chant, ""Death and not humiliation.""","Syria's government blames ""armed terrorist groups"" for ongoing violence .

"Washington (CNN) -- Confronted with recent polling suggesting rising gas prices may already be damaging President Obama's political standing ahead of the summer driving season, the president on Thursday reiterated the case that neither he, nor any other politician, has the power to bring down prices in the short term. ""We are starting to see a lot of politicians talking a lot and not doing much,"" Obama told an enthusiastic crowd at Prince George's Community College in Largo, Maryland. ""We've seen this movie before."" ""Every time prices start to go up, especially in an election year, politicians dust off their three point plan for $2.00,"" the president continued, deviating from prepared remarks the White House had distributed to reporters before the speech. ""I guess this year they decided they were going to make it $2.50."" That was a direct reference to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has pledged of late that he will dramatically lower gas prices to $2.50-a-gallon if he is elected president. Fellow GOP presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have also pledged to bring down the cost of gasoline, though not with same rhetorical flourish as Gingrich. ""You know better,"" Obama said Monday. ""There's no such thing as a quick fix when it comes to high gas prices. There's no silver bullet. Anybody who tells you otherwise isn't really looking for a solution -- they're probably just looking to ride the political wave of the moment."" It's the same argument the president made during a recent speech in Miami and at his presidential news conference last week, trying to counter Republican arguments that the president is sitting idle as prices at the pump soar. On Monday, the president ticked through a series of measures his administration had already taken to wean the country off foreign oil in the long-term, including opening new lands to domestic drilling, investing in alternative sources of energy, and raising fuel efficiency standards. Still, both Republicans and the president's political advisers recognize such long-term arguments bring little solace to Americans who are feeling the pinch of higher gas prices now. Indeed, a series of recent polls suggest the president's approval rating has begun a slide into the mid 40s as gas prices tick up. The same polls show the president losing significant support with lower income earners who report feeling the pain of higher gas prices most acutely. An ABC/Washington Post poll reported about half of those who make less than $50,000 a year consider the higher gas prices a ""serious hardship."" Of that group, the president's approval stood at 44%, down eight points before gas prices began their climb last month. Moreover, a New York Times/CBS poll last week found 54% feel the president does have the ability to control gas prices, compared to 36% who say he does not. It is poll results like those that led the president in recent weeks to engage in an education mission of sorts over just what drives the prices of gasoline, hoping he doesn't become the target of Americans' frustration if prices continue their march well over $4.00 a gallon. ""Every time there's instability in the Middle East, we'll feel it at the pump,"" he said. ""As rapidly-growing nations like China or India keep adding more cars to the road, the price of gas will rise. That's not the future I want for the United States of America.""","Obama reiterates that no politician can bring down gas prices in short term .

"(CNN)  -- Trailing what would become a fatal flight by some 27 minutes, the same kind of aircraft operated by the same airline traveled the same route last week and landed safely, the NTSB said Monday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The pilot of the second Continental Connection flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo, New York, reported ""moderate icing"" during the trip and ""made it to destination in Buffalo,"" said Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board. The second plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, like the plane that crashed Thursday night near the Buffalo airport, killing 49 people on board and one person on the ground. Also like the fatal flight, the aircraft was operated on the Continental Connection route by Colgan Air, Chealander said. Possible icing -- and how the aircraft and the flight crew performed if icing was an issue -- has become a focus in the aftermath of the crash of Flight 3407. The pilot and first officer of the flight discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, the NTSB said after listening to the cockpit voice recorder. Chealander said Monday that he had been asked about possible icing on the aircraft's tail. ""If there's icing on the wings, there's icing on the tail,"" he said. ""The significance of that is yet to be determined."" The flight data recorder indicated the plane's deicing system was activated 11 minutes after takeoff from Newark and remained on until the crash, according to the NTSB. Chealander said investigators have recovered most of the pieces of that system and will examine those materials to determine whether the system was operating properly. Chealander also said questionnaires were being sent to every pilot who flew in the Buffalo vicinity the night of the crash to find out what icing conditions they might have encountered. He said the only report to air traffic controllers of ""severe"" icing that night came from a pilot ""well south of the Buffalo area."" On Sunday, Chealander gave details of the final violent seconds of the flight, saying the flight data recorder indicated that in the final seconds, the plane's nose pitched drastically up, then down, and the plane then rolled left 46 degrees and then right 105 degrees, or past the 90-degree vertical point. Before impact in a residential neighborhood, the plane fell 800 feet in five seconds, Chealander said. On Monday, he said about half the aircraft wreckage had been removed from the crash site and taken for detailed examination. Giving an indication of the explosive nature of the impact and subsequent fire, Chealander said wreckage is being taken away ""in bins and on trailers."" He said investigators hope to have all wreckage removed from the crash site by Wednesday, when a snowstorm is forecast for the area. Authorities have not discussed the status of the removal of victims' remains since Saturday night, when they said 15 bodies had been recovered.","NTSB says pilot who traveled same route in identical plane reported ""moderate icing""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's government is considering financial offers made by imprisoned members of former President Hosni Mubarak's regime to resolve cases of corruption and illegal profiteering brought against them, the Egyptian finance minister said this week. If the proposed deals are accepted, the prisoners -- including steel tycoon Ahmed Ezz, former tourism minister Zoheir Garana and former housing minister Ahmed Maghraby -- would be freed without penalties or trials. Ezz was sentenced to 10 years in prison in September for corruption and fined the equivalent of about $11 million. Garana's lawyers have appealed his five-year prison sentence on corruption and embezzlement charges based on the country's amended investment law. Maghraby was sentenced to five years in prison in May for an illegal land deal. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's ruling military council, amended the country's investment law on January 3, 2012, two weeks before the first session of parliament. The amendment allows the suspects in graft, embezzlement and corruption cases to pay back the amount of illegal finances noted in the case at the time the crime was committed using assets, real estate, cash, or land as a way of reconciliation in return for dropping the charges. The government is working to locate and retrieve money obtained and ""smuggled"" abroad illegally by officials including Mubarak, his sons and former members of his regime, as well as quantify it, Finance Minister Mumtaz Al Saeed said in a news conference. ""We are pursing the money through judicial channels and by governmental efforts as we have requested from many countries the retrieval of funds, but these issues take time and legal procedures must be followed,"" he said. The United Arab Emirates and Switzerland are two of the countries that have received the money, according to Al Saeed. Prime Minister Kamal Al Ganzoury leads a committee in charge of retrieving the money, believed to be in the billions. The government has not accepted the offers made by the former Mubarak officials, and the issue is still being studied by the government, Al Saeed said after meeting with Al Ganzoury. The amendment to the investment law infuriated the Egyptian people, including lawyers and Islamists dominating the parliament. Khaled Abu Bakr, a civil rights lawyer, was among several attorneys submitting a memo to Egypt's general prosecutor and the parliament calling for a review of the law. ""I am totally against this law issued by a military decree days before parliament is convened and I have officially requested an immediate freeze to the negotiations,"" Abu Bakr told CNN. ""If the government accepts then the suspect is immediately freed with no trial or penalties."" Both the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafi-led Nour Party, which holds a majority of parliament seats, also issued statements opposing the release of former Mubarak officials under the amendment. Activist Hala Mahmoud considers the law a farce and accuses the ruling Supreme Council of orchestrating new laws to their benefit. ""I am sure members of the ruling council have mutual interests with those thieves behind bars, so they came up with this decree that defies the constitution to save themselves,"" Mahmoud said. ""If it passes, then why don't they allow drug dealers to do the same? How is that different?""","An amended law would allow imprisoned regime members to make restitution .
The former officials would then be released without trial or penalty .
The law has caused controversy in Egypt ."
"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- As senior U.S. officials sought to figure out how to respond to North Korea's announcement that it will launch a satellite using ballistic missile technology, a State Department spokeswoman said Friday that an agreement by the United States to deliver food aid to the impoverished country would be put on pause. 'I think we're going to take a pause here and see what happens,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. "" A North Korean launch of a satellite would be highly provocative."" Planning for the delivery of food aid -- under a deal struck last month in which Pyongyang agreed to halt nuclear tests, long-range missile launches and enrichment activities in exchange for food aid -- had been ""relatively far advanced,"" she said. At the time of the food aid agreement, under which North Korea would receive 240,000 metric tons of foodstuffs, the United States told Pyongyang that such a launch would be contrary to the accord, Nuland said. ""Frankly, if they were to go forward with this launch, it's very hard to imagine how we would be able to move forward with a regime whose word we have no confidence in and who has egregiously violated its international commitments,"" she said. Nuland's announcement came hours after the country's official news agency said that Pyongyang plans to launch next month an ""Earth observation"" satellite using a carrier rocket, a move that would potentially violate U.N. Security Council demands. Though the United States makes it a practice not to link humanitarian aid with other issues, ""a launch of this kind, which would abrogate our agreement, would call into question the credibility of all the commitments that the DPRK has made to us,"" she said, referring to the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The announcement surprised the Obama administration and the other countries involved in the six-party talks intended to find a peaceful resolution to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. It raised questions about whether North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong Un, is any different than his late father, Kim Jong Il. During talks in Beijing between the United States and North Korea, U.S. officials said North Korea had been explicitly warned against the use of space technology. ""They knew if they were to launch a satellite, this would be a matter of grave concern to the U.S.,"" said one senior official who would not be identified publicly because of the sensitivity of the issue. The North Koreans notified the United States about their intention but did not make clear they were going to make the announcement public, which has made the move more difficult to deal with, the officials said. In providing a rationale for the launch, North Korea told the United States that they have the ""right"" to peaceful access to space, as do all other nations, one senior official said. The official said that the United States replied that all other nations have not been judged to be a threat to international peace and stability and enjoined explicitly against conducting ballistic missile launches. ""This is not about their 'rights'; it's about their obligations as a member of the U.N.,"" the North Koreans were told, according to this official. ""The DPRK announcement talks about a satellite launch,"" Nuland said. ""However, as we know, it requires the use of missile technology to launch a satellite, and it's the use of the missile technology that is an explicit violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. So it's a matter of semantics. ... They say they're launching a satellite. We say 'you're launching it with ballistic missile technology, which the U.N. Security Council resolutions have explicitly precluded.' "" Ri Yong Ho, a senior North Korean nuclear envoy, traveled this week to Beijing and Moscow after attending a conference in New York sponsored by Syracuse University. The officials said he raised eyebrows in both countries by suggesting that North Korea would undertake the launch. Theories abound on why the North Koreans made the announcement: Was this the last wish of the country's late leader, Kim Jong Il? Is this something devised after Kim Jong Il's death in December to mark his greatness? Is this the regime marking the centennial of the birth of the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, with something flashy? Kim Il Sung was born April 15, 1912, and died in 1994. In fact, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said that the planned launch -- scheduled to take place between April 12 and April 16 -- would mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung. It cited a spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology. The centenary of Kim Il Sung's birth is a huge event in the North Korean calendar. Since the announcement, U.S. officials have been huddling with officials from Japan, Russia and South Korea, all of which have issued tough statements warning against any such launch. The officials, who have also spoken with Chinese officials, were awaiting an announcement from Beijing. In terms of consequences, it was not clear whether the announcement would derail the deal announced by the United States and North Korea or whether anything can be salvaged. Several nations on the U.N. Security Council quickly criticized the North Korean announcement. ""Well, the position of the Security Council, of course, is that all Security Council resolutions must be abided by,"" said Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Lyall Grant, speaking in his capacity as president of the Security Council for March. ""And if this launch goes ahead, our understanding is, it would be violation of Security Council resolutions."" The French Foreign Ministry on Friday also called the move a provocation. North Korea ""must abandon"" plans to launch a rocket to put a satellite into orbit next month, because doing so would violate the terms of U.N. Security Council resolutions, it said. ""The launching of a rocket by North Korea would contribute to the development of its ballistic missile capabilities,"" the ministry said. Russia called the announcement a ""grave concern."" ""We are calling on Pyongyang not to oppose the international community, stay away from actions that heat up the situation in the region creating additional complications for re-launching the six-party talks on the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Previous satellite launches by the reclusive North Korean regime have been widely viewed as ballistic missile test launches in disguise. The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action, saying it breached a resolution forbidding North Korea from conducting ""missile-related activities."" The Security Council demanded that North Korea not conduct further launches. South Korea's foreign ministry said Friday that it urged the North to respect the United Nations ruling and ""observe its international responsibility."" Academics said the North Koreans' announcement is about more than developing the technology needed for satellite launches, which is the same technology needed for missile launches. ""They're trying to remind the world they are dangerous and working hard to develop a delivery system,"" said professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul. But the North Korean news agency said North Korea will ""abide by relevant international regulations and usage concerning the launch of scientific and technological satellites for peaceful purposes."" The satellite, named Kwangmyongsong-3, will be ""blasted off southward"" from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in the western province of North Phyongan, according to the official report. ""A safe flight orbit has been chosen so that carrier rocket debris to be generated during the flight would not have any impact on neighboring countries,"" the report said. North Korea's previous rocket launches that it said aimed to put satellites in orbit were Kwangmyongsong-1 in 1998 and Kwangmyongsong-2 in 2009. While Pyongyang says those launches succeeded, outside agencies have found no evidence of the satellites being placed in orbit. Experts say Kwangmyongsong-2 flew over Japan, farther than any other North Korean missile, before crashing. The 2,000-mile flight suggested that North Korea is getting better at building long-range missiles. ""The upcoming launch will greatly encourage the army and people of the DPRK in the building of a thriving nation and will offer an important occasion of putting the country's technology of space use for peaceful purposes on a higher stage,"" the news agency report said Friday. CNN's Tim Schwartz, Jethro Mullen, Paula Hancocks and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We're going to take a pause here,"" State Department spokeswoman says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A jury began deliberating Wednesday afternoon in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against ""Desperate Housewives"" creator Marc Cherry. The jury of nine women and three men is to decide whether Cherry killed off a Sheridan's character in retaliation for the actress complaining that he hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy. A verdict requires the agreement of nine jurors. Sheridan is asking for $5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry, although the actress was paid $4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series. Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute, in his closing Wednesday morning, told jurors they have two questions to answer: Did Cherry hit Sheridan on the head on September 24, 2008, or was it a ""light tap,"" as the defense claims? And, did Cherry get ABC's approval to kill Sheridan's character in May 2008, as the defense claims, or was the decision made in December, after a human resources investigator cleared him in the slapping incident? Baute called Cherry a ""really obvious liar"" who was covering up the real reason he killed off Edie Britt, the sassy blonde character Sheridan played for the show's first five seasons. He accused other ABC employees of conspiring to cover up evidence that it was a revenge firing in order to protect a show that has earned over $1 billion in eight seasons. Cherry and ABC claim they decided Britt would die in season five in May 2008, four months before the incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan. Baute told jurors that there were ""no notes, no calendar, no documents,"" supporting that claim, except for a writer assistant's notes that he accused the defense of fabricating and backdating. Cherry and ABC executives testified they did not write e-mails because they wanted to keep the decision a secret. ""It's not a 'Navy SEAL Team Six how are we going to kill Osama bin Laden' decision,"" Baute told jurors, questioning the need for such secrecy. Defense lawyer Adam Levin, in his closing, said the plaintiffs were asking jurors to accept a ""complicated story of conspiracy,"" while the reality is much simpler. ""Mr. Cherry wanted to kill Edie Britt for creative reasons,"" to shock and surprise viewers and boost ratings, he said. ""'Desperate' is claiming that 10 good citizens of California conspired to get their stories straight and then took the stand, looked you in the eyes and lied,"" Levin said, noting that five of the 10 defense witnesses had ""no incentive to lie"" since they are no longer associated with ABC or the show. Former ABC studio chief Mark Pedowitz, who now works for the rival CW network, testified that in May 2008 he approved Britt's killing since the character ""had run its creative course,"" he said. Former ABC network chief Steve McPherson, who no longer works in the entertainment industry, told jurors that he also approved the decision in May 2008, Levin said. Levin also pointed to three former show writers who each testified of hearing the plan to kill off Britt in writer meetings in May and June 2008. One former show writer called as a witness by Sheridan's lawyer testified that she did not hear about the plan until later in the year, after the hitting incident. On Tuesday, the show's set construction coordinator testified that he received an e-mail that suggested a ""conspiracy to cover up"" information regarding Sheridan's lawsuit. Michael Reinhart, who has supervised construction of the show's sets since it began eight years ago, told jurors that he called Baute on Sunday to alert him to his suspicions of a cover-up conspiracy because what he read in an e-mail ""started gnawing at me"" and he ""began to lose sleep."" ""It was my understanding that they were going to delete e-mails from the hard drives,"" Reinhart said about the e-mail he received in fall 2010, soon after Sheridan filed her lawsuit. He read the e-mail and immediately deleted it because he believed it was not intended for him, he said.

But if he had not come forward, he ""would've had to live with that doubt the rest of my life,"" he said. Under cross-examination by Cherry's lawyer, Reinhart said Sheridan's lawyer suggested he could help him find a job if ABC fired him. Baute denied that outside the courtroom.

Five months and 11 episodes later, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on ""Desperate Housewives.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against ""Desperate Housewives"" creator Marc Cherry told the judge they were ""having difficulty reaching a verdict"" Wednesday afternoon. The jury of nine women and three men began deliberations Wednesday on whether Cherry killed off Sheridan's character in retaliation for the actress complaining that he hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy. ""I'm sensing some frustration and polarization,"" said Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute, after the judge sent jurors home for the day with orders to try again Friday morning. ""It's very early for a jury to come back and say, 'We're having trouble deliberating,'"" Baute said. Sheridan is asking for $5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry, although the actress was paid $4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series. Baute said he believed the ""majority of jurors are in Nicolette's favor, but it requires nine to get to the finish line."" A verdict in the civil case requires the agreement of nine jurors. Jurors have two questions to answer, Baute told them in his closing arguments Wednesday. Did Cherry hit Sheridan on the head on September 24, 2008, or was it a ""light tap,"" as the defense claims? And, did Cherry get ABC's approval to kill Sheridan's character in May 2008, as the defense claims, or was the decision made in December, after a human resources investigator cleared him in the slapping incident? Baute called Cherry a ""really obvious liar"" who was covering up the real reason he killed off Edie Britt, the sassy blonde character Sheridan played for the show's first five seasons. He accused other ABC employees of conspiring to cover up evidence that it was a revenge firing in order to protect a show that has earned over $1 billion in eight seasons. Cherry and ABC claim they decided Britt would die in season five in May 2008, four months before the incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan. Baute told jurors that there were ""no notes, no calendar, no documents,"" supporting that claim, except for a writer assistant's notes that he accused the defense of fabricating and backdating. Cherry and ABC executives testified they did not write e-mails because they wanted to keep the decision a secret. ""It's not a 'Navy SEAL Team Six, how are we going to kill Osama bin Laden?' decision,"" Baute told jurors, questioning the need for such secrecy. Defense lawyer Adam Levin, in his closing, said the plaintiffs were asking jurors to accept a ""complicated story of conspiracy,"" while the reality is much simpler. ""Mr. Cherry wanted to kill Edie Britt for creative reasons,"" to shock and surprise viewers and boost ratings, he said. ""'Desperate' is claiming that 10 good citizens of California conspired to get their stories straight and then took the stand, looked you in the eyes and lied,"" Levin said, noting that five of the 10 defense witnesses had ""no incentive to lie"" since they are no longer associated with ABC or the show. Former ABC studio chief Mark Pedowitz, who now works for the rival CW network, testified that in May 2008 he approved Britt's killing since the character ""had run its creative course,"" he said. Former ABC network chief Steve McPherson, who no longer works in the entertainment industry, told jurors that he also approved the decision in May 2008, Levin said. Levin also pointed to three former show writers who each testified of hearing the plan to kill off Britt in writer meetings in May and June 2008. One former show writer called as a witness by Sheridan's lawyer testified that she did not hear about the plan until later in the year, after the hitting incident. On Tuesday, the show's set construction coordinator testified that he received an e-mail that suggested a ""conspiracy to cover up"" information regarding Sheridan's lawsuit. ""It was my understanding that they were going to delete e-mails from the hard drives,"" Reinhart said about the e-mail he received in fall 2010, soon after Sheridan filed her lawsuit. He read the e-mail and immediately deleted it because he believed it was not intended for him, he said. ""I honestly tried to put it out of my mind,"" he said, until this past weekend as he realized the Los Angeles trial was nearing an end. The defense later called Jean Zoeller, ABC's chief litigation lawyer, to testify that she sent memos to every employee connected to the case instructing them to save all their electronic documents. Asked if she asked anyone to delete e-mails, she said, ""Absolutely not.""

"(CNN) -- The latest version of Apple's iPad, the genre-defining tablet computer that has outperformed virtually everyone's expectations since first released in 2010, went on sale Friday at 8 a.m. local time. At Apple's flagship retail store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, lines snaked around an entire city block as the doors swung open . ""I bought [an iPad 2] for my husband two weeks ago, and then Apple surprised me by announcing the new one,"" Dezi Swing of Manhattan told CNNMoney. ""The new iPad has better resolution, so I think he'll like that. I'm going to try to trade in the old one."" First-day buyers weren't the only ones excited about the tablet's display and other features. Critics who got an early look at the new gadget were similarly impressed. ""Since it launched in 2010, the iPad has been the best tablet on the planet,"" wrote Walt Mossberg for All Things D. ""With the new, third-generation model, it still holds that crown."" The new 9.7-inch display screen features a ""retina display"" of 2047 by 1536 pixels, compared with the iPad 2's 1024 by 768 pixels. It will have a a 5-megapixel camera, representing a significant leap from the current iPad's lens. The new version is available in the United States on AT&T and Verizon networks and will be the first iPad to connect to 4G networks. In addition to Apple retail stores, it will be on sale at Best Buy, Radio Shack, Sam's Club, Target and Walmart. It also went on sale Friday in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Apple diehards in Asia were among the first to sample the new product. In Tokyo, about 400 people lined up at an Apple store, where the first wave of buyers were raving about the ""beautiful"" high definition screen. ""There is some criticism that this [new iPad] isn't enough of a leap,"" CNN's Kyung Lah reported from the store. ""But for the people who stayed out here overnight, the real devotees, they say it's enough of a revolution for them to brave the cold weather to be among the first in the world to get the new iPad."" It will cost the same as the iPad 2 -- from $499 to $829 based on storage capacity and Wi-Fi capability. Apple also will be slashing the prices of the iPad 2 by $100, making a 16GB Wi-Fi only model $399 and putting it closer to the price point of some less expensive tablets, such as Amazon's Kindle Fire, that have hit the market in the past year. Camping outside Apple stores for the latest products has become something of a tradition, and Thursday was no different. Apple's No. 1 fan, co-founder Steve Wozniak, has made a habit of joining the throngs. In October, he was first in line at his local Apple store in Los Gatos, California, to get an iPhone 4S, and he lined up at a store in Los Angeles where he was giving a speech, at about 2 p.m. Thursday for Friday's rollout. ""Oddly enough to say, I didn't get the high memory iPad in the past, and I can't put on a bunch of movies like I want to,"" he said. ""So I've got a good reason to upgrade now."" Wait in line for an iPad? Some readers baffled . In Mossberg's review, he said the new tablet's display is visibly crisper than the iPad 2's. ""My epiphany came when I placed my iPad 2 next to the new model, with the same text on the screen,"" he wrote. ""Letters and words that had seemed sharp on the older model five minutes earlier suddenly looked fuzzier."" That was a selling point for photographers Heather Waraksa and Jonathan Mehring, who arrived at Apple's new Grand Central store in New York and, as such, found themselves leaning against a wall, eating bagels in line a half hour later. Neither has ever owned an iPad before. ""I had a meeting last week where I showed my [photo] portfolio on my laptop, and the guy was like, 'You should really get an iPad,'"" Mehring said. ""It looks much better, and a laptop is cumbersome anyway."" Not everyone outside the stores was focusing on the new tablet's features. Protesters from Change.org were also in attendance at the flagship store, with a large banner. The organization said it has received petitions from 250,000 people asking Apple to improve its working conditions for factory employees in China.. ""Apple has been a little forthcoming since we first delivered the petitions at Grand Central, but we want them to do better than that,"" said Shelby Knox, senior organizer for the group. The New York Times' David Pogue said the new iPad isn't a revelation, just a solid revamp of the current model. ""Really, the new iPad should have been called the iPad 2S. In the past, Apple added the letter S to iPhone models that weren't exactly new but had been tastefully enhanced (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4S),"" Pogue wrote. ""That's exactly what's going on with the new iPad. Its technical improvements keep it at the forefront of desirability -- just ahead of the snapping jaws of its Android competition -- but don't take it in any new directions."" David Goldman and Julianne Pepitone of CNNMoney contributed to this report.","New iPad goes on sale Friday .

"(CNN) -- Neither his name is known nor a motive for the grisly crime he allegedly committed. But what is clear is that the U.S. soldier, a staff sergeant in his 30s, faces grave accusations unlike others faced by Americans in Afghanistan so far. He is alleged to have killed 16 villagers, nine of them children, in the sanctuary of their homes deep into the night. The dearth of information from the U.S. military heightens speculation by the day about the accused soldier and his mental condition. What soldier could commit such a heinous act? Authorities and mental health experts caution against drawing conclusions, but what's known is that the soldier was on his fourth combat tour. He served in Iraq three times and potentially was at risk for combat stress symptoms -- anxiety, depression, anger. He also suffered a brain injury in a vehicle rollover, though the extent of it is unclear. ""We're going to look into all of that,"" Gen. John Allen, who commands U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, told CNN, declining to say more. The full details will likely surface after the military investigates and begins legal proceedings. ""It's a tragedy all the way around. There's no question about that,"" said Seattle attorney John Henry Browne, who told CNN Thursday that he was representing the accused soldier. ""I think it's of interest that we have a soldier who has an exemplary record, a decorated soldier who was injured in Iraq to his brain and to his body, and then despite that, was sent back. I think that's an issue. I think it's a concern."" Michael Waddington, a civilian lawyer who has represented U.S. soldiers in military murder trials, said Sunday's shootings in the villages in Kandahar province represented the worst of chilling incidents involving U.S. troops. FBI: Massacre could prompt attacks in U.S. There have been cases of the innocent who are mistakenly killed or die in the crossfire. But it was shocking to Waddington to hear of a U.S. soldier turning his weapon on civilians. If true, he said, the crime amounts to no less than executions of people inside their homes. The soldier could face 16 counts of premeditated murder, Waddington said. The officer who will preside over the soldier's Article 32 hearing, the military's rough equivalent of a grand jury proceeding, will decide whether to try it as a capital case. There has to be at least one aggravating factor -- such as the accused knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to U.S. national security -- in order for a death penalty proceeding. Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar was sentenced to death for carrying out a grenade and rifle attack on his comrades in Kuwait during the opening days of the Iraq war, killing two officers. Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Pvt. Steven Green, who raped a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and murdered her and her family, but a jury could not reach a unanimous decision, and Green received life in prison without parole. Other than those two cases, Waddington said he could not think of another instance where a soldier was condemned to die for murders committed on overseas combat tours. The soldier accused in Sunday's shooting spree has been transferred to Kuwait, where he is likely being detained in solitary confinement. The military will consider several factors in determining a location for the trial. Among them will be key witnesses, forensic evidence and expert testimony. Prosecutors, Waddington said, may push for the Article 32 hearing to be held in Afghanistan so that witnesses from the villages where the killings took place are able to come to court to testify. They are unlikely to do so if the hearing is held outside Afghanistan and lawyers on both sides will have to rely on depositions. But a hearing and then a trial in Kabul could present security risks with angry Afghans clamoring for the accused's head. ""I do believe security is going to become a problem the longer he is in the country,"" Waddington said. ""There's a chance someone is going to kill him. You'd be a national hero if you killed this guy."" Given the risks, the military could decide to hold the trial in the United States. If so, it would most likely be at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, where the soldier was stationed. Waddington said the military will probably order a full sanity probe in this case. That entails comprehensive interviews with the soldier, his family, friends and colleagues by three mental health officials, including a forensic psychologist. Waddington has defended soldiers charged with killing Iraqis and Afghans. Among them was Pvt. Jeremy Morlock, one of five Stryker Brigade soldiers also based at Lewis-McChord, charged with belonging to a rogue ""kill squad"" that targeted civilians. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. Morlock said the soldiers in his squad carried out the executions on the spur of the moment. Waddington said he was struck by the brutality of killing children inside their homes but is somewhat surprised these sorts of crimes don't occur more often. Some soldiers are on medications. Since 2001, many have had no lives other than to deploy over and over again. Others struggle to find tangible successes to their mission. Sometimes, Waddington said, they despise the people they have to defend. ""Take the postal worker and multiply him by a million. That's a service member,"" he said of the stress. Some people have suggested the soldier accused in the Kandahar village shootings suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. But Paul Newhouse, a professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University and a former Army psychiatrist, said the violence against others is not usually considered a part of the cluster of symptoms associated with PTSD. ""So I think it's more likely that we're going to discover that there was some either psychotic illness or delusional condition or some evidence that this person was more seriously deranged or impaired than we would typically see in PTSD,"" Newhouse said. Neuropsychologist Eric Zillmer, co-author of ""Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Applications,"" said more than 1 million people in the United States suffer a traumatic brain injury each year. Many experience problems, but execution-style killings are not among them. ""So while it's possible that 'brain damage' is a contributing factor, it is unlikely to explain the slayings,"" Zillmer wrote on CNN.com. A convenient answer, he wrote, would be to explain the slayings as the act of a bad apple who temporarily lost his sanity. ""If that were the case, then no military leader or peer could have predicted the rampage,"" Zillmer wrote. ""However, one can't help but wonder whether the recent spate of events, including the desecration of Taliban corpses by four Marines, the burning of the Quran by U.S. troops and now the slaying of Afghan civilians point to the toll that the Afghanistan war is taking. Has the psychological impact of the long war been underestimated?"" And there is another question circulating after Afghan President Hamid Karzai urged U.S. troops to withdraw from village outposts and international forces to hand over security control of the country by 2013 instead of the planned 2014. How will Sunday's shootings affect the U.S. role in the war? ""This may be the end of our mission in Afghanistan,"" Waddington said. On the streets of Afghanistan, angry people thirsted for justice. But that could be a long time coming. Waddington predicted that at the very least, it would take a year for a trial to begin, probably longer. And given the current situation, time may preclude a trial from taking place in Kabul. The U.S. military might be long gone by then.

"(CNN) -- When Iranian director Asghar Farhadi accepted his Golden Globe for best foreign film last month, he spoke a few words of thanks, paused and announced he wanted to say something about his people. Two nations held their breath. ""They are a peace-loving people,"" Farhadi said, and then was gone. Brief though it was, his comment was eloquent, to the point and unsettling in its simplicity. Likewise his movie. Much of the reason that ""A Separation"" has made such an impact in the West -- a virtual sweep of the critics' prizes, a Golden Globe and two Oscar nominations, including a virtually unheard of nod for a non-U.S. screenplay -- is that it isn't a foreign film at all (except for all that Farsi). If anything, it's a feel-good movie, albeit in a wildly perverse way: Having experienced the anguish of Farhadi's characters, the viewer comes away with the inescapable sense of our common humanity, the resounding sense that we're all in this life together. If that sounds clichÃ©d, so be it. This is not a politically acceptable position, of course. Amid the glib militarism of Republican presidential candidates, the bellicosity of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the nuclear recklessness of the mullahs, ""A Separation"" drives home the oft-ignored fact that Iran is full of educated, sophisticated and cultured people who don't necessarily agree with their government either. Particularly the lead characters of ""A Separation."" Farhadi doesn't ask for trouble. No one in the cast declares that, ""Our impossible, infuriatingly theocratic regime is anti-intellectual, anti-opportunity, anti-woman, anti-freedom, anti-human."" Nevertheless, Simin (Leila Hatami) wants out. A young mother of Tehran's educated middle-class, she wants a better life for her daughter, Termeh (played by the director's daughter, Sarina Farhadi) and -- why not? -- a better life for herself. She works, she takes classes, she harbors an intellectual curiosity. Under her hijab, her hair is dyed an unnatural but quite chic shade of red, which more or less reflects her disposition. She is adamant. She's going, whether her husband, Nader, is willing or not. And he's not. His father is suffering from dementia and can't be left behind. And, as Islamic law demands that the husband decides where the daughter goes, Termeh is staying, too. Without giving away the whole plot, it's worth saying that ""A Separation"" snowballs into a demi-tragedy propelled by institutional hubris: Simin is judged by the system to have insufficient grounds for divorce, but what can happen otherwise when the grounds for her request are the very system that is denying her the divorce? Nader, needing to find a housekeeper who can care for his father while he goes to work, rashly hires Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a woman so fearful of religious impropriety that she has to call for a ruling before she can change the incontinent old man out of his soggy clothes. That she cannot touch Nader's father, played by Ali-Asghar Shahbazi, lest she violate some religious tenet, verges on the absurdly comedic. The series of misunderstandings and various acts of dishonesty that intertwine so gracefully and with such a dreadful sense of destiny, are all predicated on a system that denies reality. As such, it can find a mirror in an American political system in which politicians are willing to mouth any absurdity to appeal to a noisy, marginalized and in many cases fundamentalist minority, whose inclinations toward freedom, intellect, diversity and reason don't place them all that far from the mullahs. Frankly, you don't want either group to have a nuke. But that makes ""A Separation"" something of a dangerous movie, at least among those for whom division among peoples spells political profit. At a time of nationalism-cum-tribalism, and a seemingly sweaty eagerness for the United States and Iran to mix it up militarily, Farhadi's camera cultivates emotional generosity: The point of view swings from objective to subjective, capturing the emotions of the characters via their shared point of view. The perspective swings from Simin to Termeh to Razieh to Nader, the upshot being a marriage of perception, a unity of view, a sharing of experience not only among the characters, but the audience. It all adds up to an experience that is rare at the movies, directorially demanding and which creates the very phenomenon that makes ""A Separation"" unique and resonant.

"(CNN) -- I get asked by political candidates all the time ""what can I do to learn how to grow my Twitter following?"" After last night, I have a new and simple answer. ""Watch NASCAR."" Or at least, watch and emulate NASCAR's savviest tweeter. NASCAR drivers and politicians have the same objective on Twitter: grow an echo chamber of supporters for unfiltered communication to build loyalty. In one incident during Monday night's Daytona 500, a 28-year-old NASCAR driver named Brad Keselowski delivered perhaps the most useful campaign schooling on the keys to effective use of the fastest growing social media tool. By the time most East Coast politicians were asleep Monday, a freak accident caused a 200-gallon jet fuel fire on the track in the closing stages of the rain-delayed Daytona race. Keselowski (his twitter handle is @Keselowski), used his camera phone to take a picture from his car of the disaster in front of him and then tweet it out to his 55,000 followers. His tweet went viral instantly, ballooning his Twitter following by more than 100,000 followers over the next couple of hours. As of this Tuesday afternoon (a 12-hour stretch), his following was up 300% to 201,000. That surge makes Keselowski one of the most followed figures in racing, but also way up there in the larger world of sports. As a reference point, the winner at Daytona, Matt Kenseth (@mattkenseth), has more than 72,000 followers and racing scion Dale Earnhardt, Jr. (@DaleJr) has around 91,000. NASCAR driver tweets from car, gains 100,000 followers . To be sure, Keslowski's band is but a fraction of the ones behind early Twitter adopters Chad Ochocinco of the New England Patriots and Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic -- but his number is now four times larger than the Twitter following of one of baseball's biggest names, New York Yankee star Mariano Rivera (@MarianoRivera). Mere stardom does not build a social media presence; it takes regular tweets that are good enough to inspire followers to spread them further via re-tweets to their own networks. What can politicians take from this? Compared to nationally known politicians, many of whom are in the news every day, Keselowski's ""instant"" following is bigger than Rick Santorum's (147,000), closing in on Mitt Romney's 351,000, double Sen. Marco Rubio's (73,000) and double the size of the Democratic senator who is perhaps most talented at Twitter's use, Claire McCaskill (64,300). The relative sizes of those followings put into perspective how hard it is to grow an audience, what a big move Keselowski made in just a few hours and the huge potential for those who know what they're doing on Twitter. How did that one tweet (and the conversation that followed) do it? Yes, it was about a sensational event -- a fire during a NASCAR race. But I would argue it was something more than that. It bore all the characteristics of effective communication on this most personal broadcast medium: . 1) It was authentic, . 2) It was revelatory to what the tweeter was thinking and experiencing, . 3) It was time-sensitive, . 4) It added value to a national conversation that was already ongoing. These same four lessons have great teaching values to political candidates and campaigns as they seek to build a following on social media and thus develop a new and powerful way to reach out to voters. A few have already heeded them. For starters, McCaskill (@ClaireCMcC) and Sen. John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) thrive on Twitter because they do their own tweeting, unlike politicians who leave Twitter duty to staff members -- it's a personal medium and authenticity is the most important quality. Second, we got a window into Keselowski's attitude: When it works in politics Twitter reveals things about the candidate's sense of humor or values as much or more than his or her positions. Third, Keselowski's tweet didn't wait until the next business day or until he could get to pit row. It happened on track, and in the moment. Finally, a good tweet becomes a viral sensation beyond one's current pool of followers when it adds a new chapter to a broader conversation already raging. Keslowski's tweet didn't start a conversation about the jet-fuel fire, it fed it, and then steered it in a new direction. That's why Twitter is a must-use tool during key national events like debates, presidential speeches, major sporting events, etc. It's like having 20 million of your closest friends in your living room. Political candidates who take Twitter seriously should be active in the conversations millions of Americans have during those big events, whether they are about politics or not. To put these two worlds together, imagine if Santorum had been the first to react to Keselowski's on-track tweet and engaged the driver's fans in ""can-you-believe-it"" conversation? His own following would have grown -- adding new followers he likely would never give up. Campaigns and elected officials should work hard at developing a Twitter following that is organic and earned. It provides a mechanism to communicate directly to the people most interested in what they have to say, for free, and without the filter of a hostile opponent or a skeptical media. Any questions? Just follow @keslowski. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brad Todd.","Brad Todd: NASCAR driver's viral tweet Monday could be instructive for politicians .

"Washington (CNN) -- After months of bloodshed that has left the Syrian people on the brink of civil war, more than 1,000 activists gathered outside the White House on Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the uprising in Syria. The activists -- ranging in age from children to senior citizens -- waved Syrian flags and held posters denouncing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The protesters were calling upon U.S. President Barack Obama to intervene in the conflict that has left more than 8,000 people dead, according to U.N. estimates. Mahmoud Khattab, chairman of the Syrian American Council and one of the organizers of Saturday's rally, said he's tired of Obama's words and wants to see them turned into action. Khattab, who has met with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, said the Obama administration hasn't stepped in to help Syria for a number of reasons, including a divided opposition. ""That might be true, but I don't think that that's an excuse, you know, to let things as is in Syria,"" said Khattab, adding that the administration told him there is danger of a civil war if it interferes. ""What I feel and what I tell them, in fact, if they don't interfere, there will be civil war and there will be a big mess in Syria that will spread to all surrounding countries."" According to organizers, more than 1,200 protesters from around the United States -- many of them Syrian-Americans -- attended the rally, where a surprising youth presence expressed their frustration with the situation. Wearing Syrian headbands and face paint, they clapped and chanted in unison, ""We just want to stop the killing, freedom for Syria, God willing!"" Some of that frustration comes from a lack of American awareness, said 14-year-old Tala al-Saghir.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Two Italians have been kidnapped by Maoist insurgents in eastern India, the local authorities said Monday, in what is believed to be the first abduction of Westerners in the region. Italian nationals Bosusco Paolo and Claudio Colangelo have been held hostage by left-wing rebels in the eastern state of Orissa since Wednesday, said Rajesh Prabhakar Patil, the top administrator of the state's Kandhamal district. ""As of now, the government has expressed its willingness to negotiate"" to secure the Italians' release, Patil said, noting that the kidnappings came to light Sunday. Anti-Maoist operations, part of a decades-long conflict, have been suspended in the troubled Kandhamal area, and the authorities are in the process of appointing a mediator for talks, he said. It was not immediately clear what the kidnappers were demanding in return for the release of the Italian tourists. Patil said unconfirmed reports from some local journalists had suggested that the fighters wanted government troops to pull out from the region and for charges against their fellow rebels to be withdrawn. ""Demands will be clear and confirmed once talks begin,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Indian external affairs ministry has briefed the Italian government about the matter, ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said in a post on Twitter. The Maoist rebels have been battling the Indian government in several eastern states in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s. They say they are fighting for the poor and the dispossessed. The authorities have said they suspect the Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities, but also among youth and intellectuals. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people the Maoists call ""class enemies,"" the insurgents also are believed to have carried out attacks on infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.","The rebels have been holding the two Italians hostage since Wednesday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Well, our recent list of top 'derby' matches certainly got you talking; most in disagreement with me it has to be said! Though it is about to be replaced with a new stadium, the atmosphere at Anfield can't be beaten. Having viewed football all over the world, I thought I'd publish my top 11 stadiums. I am basing my opinion on a variety of different variables; tradition, atmosphere, beauty etc. Do you agree? Have we left off the best football ground? Let us know in the Sound Off box below. 1) Anfield -- Liverpool, England . The stadium was first built over 120 years ago and, quite frankly, it shows. Anfield is looking old and tired and the club is actively seeking a new home, yet it simply has to be in the list for atmosphere alone. The sound of 45,000 Liverpool fans simultaneously singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" is spine-tingling -- especially on European nights. The Kop is an awesome stand and as the players come down the tunnel to the pitch, a sign above them says ""This is Anfield""...That says it all.  See a photo gallery of our First 11 stadiums » . 2) Westfalenstadion -- Dortmund, Germany . Borussia Dortmund are the best supported single-city club in Europe and the Sudtribune is Europe's largest standing terrace, packed with more than 25,000 of Dortmund's most vocal supporters on Bundesliga match days. With a capacity of 80,000, this is a real temple of football, close, intimidating and passionate. Just imagine what it would be like if Dortmund returned to being the force in German football they once were. 3) The Millennium Stadium -- Cardiff, Wales . Now used only for Welsh international home fixtures, the Millennium stadium proved a revelation as a temporary home for English finals while Wembley was being refurbished, so much so that many people -- myself included -- felt that it was the perfect stage for such major matches as the FA Cup final. A retractable roof meant the atmosphere could be enclosed within the stadium, and its position in the heart of Cardiff made it very accessible. Sadly missed by many Englishmen. 4) Azteca Stadium -- Mexico City, Mexico . The home of the Mexican national team and to club side America, the Azteca really is an iconic football arena. It is the only stadium to host two World Cup finals, in 1970 and 1986 and has played host to undoubtedly the two greatest goals in football history; Carlos Alberto (Brazil v Italy in 1970) and Diego Maradona (Argentina v England in 1986). With a capacity of 105,000, it is the fifth-largest stadium in the world. If a stadium could write an autobiography -- the Azteca would wipe the floor with everyone else! 5) La Bombonera -- Buenos Aires, Argentina . The home of Boca Juniors, La Bombonera (the Chocolate Box) gets its name from its rectangular shape. Despite a capacity of only 57,000, the atmosphere in the ground is unique and the vibrating caused when fans start to jump up and down in rhythm, is believed to intimidate many opposition teams. As well as the atmosphere, the murals that line the interior and exterior of the stadium add a special touch that is rarely matched elsewhere. 6) The Maracana -- Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Has to be included for history purposes alone. Unbelievably, just shy of 200,000 people packed into the ground to see host nation Brazil lose out to Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup finals and although modernization has meant a marked reduction in the capacity, a total of 95,000 makes it the 12th biggest arena in the world. Flamengo and Fluminese share the stadium but in six years time the eyes of the world will be back on the famous old ground when it joins the Azteca in Mexico as the second stadium to host two World Cup finals. 7) Old Trafford -- Manchester, England . The biggest club ground in England with a capacity of over 76,000, Old Trafford is known as ""The Theatre of Dreams"" for good reason. Such has been United's domination since the inception of the Premier League, that sour-faced rivals claim many Old Trafford supporters are just there for the ""day out"" and don't actually come from Manchester. Who cares? The ground is always full and the roar from the Stretford End is worth the admission money alone. 8) Nou Camp -- Barcelona, Spain . With a capacity of just over 98,000, the Nou Camp -- which simply means ""new field"" in Catalan -- is the largest stadium in Europe and an absolute must to visit for any football fan. Only 50 years old, the stadium stands like a shining beacon, dominating its surroundings. Despite its size, the high over-hanging stands somehow still manage to give an enclosed, intimidating feeling, although the locals' displeasure at a bad display (cue the waving of white hankies) can give the stadium an eerie feeling when things are not going Barca's way. 9) San Siro -- Milan, Italy . The San Siro, or to give it its proper name, the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, is a work of art and the only Italian stadium to make my list because it doesn't have an athletics track and that gives the feeling of a real football venue. The stadium has played host to both Milan and Inter since 1947, previously Milan had been sole tenants, with the 11 towers that adorn the outside giving it a unique appearance. 10) Madrigal -- Villarreal, Spain . I make no excuses for including the tiny Madrigal stadium, because of the atmosphere generated within and outside it. The ground only holds 25,000, but as the town itself has a population of under 50,000, it means half its inhabitants are watching the action when the stadium is full. The tiny surrounding streets occasionally play host to a giant yellow submarine -- the team's nickname -- which is paraded before kick-off and the general feeling is one of friendliness mixed with steely determination. I guarantee that no ground this size anywhere in the world makes more noise, a reason, I'm sure, why the club continues to punch above its weight in La Liga. 11) Stadium of Light -- Lisbon, Portugal . A real work of beauty. The home of Benfica and the Portuguese national side was entirely rebuilt for the Euro 2004 finals -- and what a job the architects did. Known as 'The Cathedral' by supporters and locals, the stadium's capacity, once a remarkable 120,000, was nearly halved, but what it lost in terms of spectators, it made up for in a stunning, modern arena. Bedecked in the red and white color of Benfica, the stunning red arches over the roof and pretty surroundings, makes this one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world.","We have compiled a list of the world's best football grounds .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian emergency officials have begun evacuating 800 families from an area at high risk from the expected eruption of a volcano that killed at least six people in November. Colombians make their way across a landslide in November after the Nevado del Huila volcano erupted. The Nevado del Huila volcano is on orange alert, meaning an eruption is probable within days or weeks, the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining said last week. An eruption would cause an avalanche down the Paez and Simbola rivers, officials said. The town under evacuation, Belalcazar, sits on the bank of the Paez River about a half-mile (less than a kilometer) from the junction with the Simbola River. It was the worst-hit area in November's eruption. The volcano's crater holds 52 million cubic meters (1.8 billion cubic feet) of lava, said Colombia's Caracol Radio. That's the equivalent of 13.8 billion gallons. The Colombian national emergency agency said Monday it is ready to evacuate thousands of residents if the volcano's condition turns to red, which means an eruption is imminent or ongoing. The snow-capped Huila, the highest active volcano in Colombia, last erupted on November 20. At least six people, including four children, died then. Gas and hot ash caused snow on the mountain peak to melt, sending mud, rocks and floodwater rushing down the Paez and destroying at least 20 homes and washing out five bridges, the presidential office said at the time. Much of the sparsely populated region about 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Bogota is a reservation for Nasa indigenous communities. All six fatalities were native Indians, the government said. The youngest victim was a year old. The Huila volcano, which has a summit of 17,598 feet (5,364 meters), has erupted four times. The first documented eruption occurred in the 1500s, then it stood silent for more than 400 years, according to the Web site volcanolive.com. Colombian emergency officials said Monday they are asking the 800 families where they want to be moved to, Caracol Radio said. Scientists with the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, commonly known as Ingeominas, said they did not detect any major action inside the volcano Monday, Caracol reported. Ingeominas and the National System for Emergencies are monitoring the volcano around the clock and have acquired new equipment, including additional telecommunication gear and an infrared camera to monitor Huila's temperature. Officials also plan to install a microphone on Huila to detect any new rumblings from inside the volcano, Caracol said. Officials already are monitoring the volcano with four stations that detect seismological activity, a video camera, a communications network and a system that measures mudflow, Caracol said.","Eruption likely within days or weeks at Nevado del Huila volcano, agency warns .

"(CNN) -- The new fantasy film ""Inkheart"" has at its center the relationship between father Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart and his 12-year year old daughter Meggie, played by Brendan Fraser and Eliza Hope Bennett. Brendan Fraser and Eliza Hope Bennett star as father and daughter in the film ""Inkheart."" The dynamic between the two was evident as they bantered playfully during an interview with CNN. ""There's a real trust between them, but also keeping secrets so it has to sort of have ... the right balance and stuff,"" Bennett said, explaining Mo and Meggie's relationship. ""So it's important that we got on."" ""But we didn't,"" Fraser joked. ""It's a shame that we didn't really because it would've been a good film,"" Bennett shot back.  Watch what Mr. Moviefone thought » . ""Inkheart"" is a modern-day tale about a father and daughter who have a passion for books. Dad Mo also has the ability to bring the characters to life by reading aloud. The trade-off is that for every character brought to life, a real person disappears into the pages. The pair set out to rescue Meggie's mother, Resa, whose deliverance from the mystical world is tied to ""Inkheart,"" an illustrated book of medieval castles and fantastical creatures. The film, which also stars Helen Mirren and Paul Bettany, opened Friday. Fraser, best known as the star of ""The Mummy"" and its sequels, said ""Inkheart"" director Iain Softley created an atmosphere on the set that made his job playing Mo easier. ""He made sure that you felt you were immersed into the reality of a world that we live in now as if there were certain magical elements possible to it, and you never felt like you were taken along into something that you didn't want to believe in,"" Fraser said. The film is based on the best-selling novel by Cornelia Funke. Fraser said he hopes the film will inspire moviegoers to read more. ""I think that it all starts with the imagination and a well-written book can take you on a journey to a place that you've never actually traveled to,"" he said. Co-star Paul Bettany plays Dustfinger, a fictional fire juggler, and said he believes the film will appeal to book lovers. ""It's a kids' action-adventure movie and I feel proud that it's sending a positive message about the power of the written word,"" said the actor, known for his work in ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""A Beautiful Mind."" Child actress Bennett said she enjoyed the concept of characters coming to life, especially a certain little dog from Kansas. ""Yeah, I love Toto, he was my favorite,"" she said. Her comment provided an opportunity for further teasing from Fraser. ""Was he your favorite co-star?"" he asked Bennett. ""He was so well-behaved,"" she responded. ""What made him so well-behaved?"" Fraser inquired. ""He was just well-trained,"" she said. Fraser joked about the dog knowing his lines and being able to ""hit the mark and bark."" ""I could do that,"" Fraser kidded his co-star.

"(CNN) -- Six kids, one RV, 10 weeks and dozens of U.S. states. A group of orphans from Afghanistan has embarked on a journey from Massachusetts to California and places in between, seeing more of the United States than many Americans see in a lifetime. The road trip, which kicked off in January, is about ""the kids getting an education in the landscape and history of America,"" says Ian Pounds, an American who's both their driver while in the U.S. and a volunteer at their orphanage in Kabul, the Afghan capital. The four girls and two boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have seen the Boston Science Museum and Aquarium, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. Destinations down the road include Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Native American storytellers in the Southwest, and nature hikes near San Francisco, before heading to New York City and back home to Afghanistan in March. The youngest traveler is 11-year-old Shokofa, who also goes by Frishta. She wears a fuzzy pink hat and scarf, loves pizza, and plays the trumpet. The boys, Araj and Mohsen, are 13 and 12, inseparable. Mohsen dreams about being a filmmaker. The older girls -- Hala, Maria and Lida -- are 16, 17, and 18, respectively. ""It's amazing,"" Maria says of her American experience so far. ""I like very much here. I learned more things and (have had) many experiences."" The kids are among an estimated 2 million orphans in Afghanistan. They are in the care of orphanages run by the Afghan Child Education and Care Organization and were chosen for this trip because of their grades and academic achievements. The tour, funded by grants from the U.S. Embassy's Afghan Women Empowerment program and Goldman Sachs, is also helping to raise money for the orphanages and building relationships between the two countries. Pounds moved from the U.S. to Kabul to volunteer in the orphanage three years ago. He says the experience has changed his life, and he hopes the same type of travel experience can influence the children. ""It was important to me to climb up into the mountains near Nuristan and see the village where many of the children come from,"" he says. ""It's equally important for them to come and discover America, where their teacher comes from, to immerse themselves, to develop a worldliness, poise, communication skills -- everything a teacher values in education."" The RV -- or ""Magic Freedom bus,"" as they call it -- has everything they need for the road trip: plenty of beds, bathroom, kitchenette, refrigerator, stove, oven and microwave. And it's hard to miss the big bottle of ketchup on the counter. Outside the front passenger door, a sign reads ""Afghan Orphanage Children's Tour of America"" with a photo of the children. That's spurred many impromptu meetings and kindness from strangers. ""So many people have stopped us, to say hi and to meet the kids,"" says Pounds. And when someone at the Boston rental company found out what the RV was for, Pounds says, she gave the group a discount despite the almost 10,000 miles they expect to put on the vehicle. Pounds is chronicling the experience in blog posts at the AFCECO orphanage site. ""There's laughter at every turn as these children grow by leaps, and deeply affect the people they meet,"" Pounds wrote after one day. The children all have similar stories full of heartache: parents dead from war or illness, or parents no longer able to take care of them because of drug addiciton, extreme poverty or other reasons. But sitting together inside the RV, the children reveal no bitterness or despair, only a determination to succeed. ""We are the future of Afghanistan,"" says Maria, who wants to be an engineer one day. ""We want to stay in Afghanistan and help our country,"" says Hala, who wants to be a doctor. Lida aims to teach. Also traveling with the kids is Nasrin Sultani, a teacher from the orphanage. She worries about the violence the children have witnessed and continue to see. ""We have troops from all over the world and still no security,"" she says. ""Afghans, especially the women, don't feel safe."" Her biggest wish: ""feeling safe, and women having the same rights as men."" Pounds says one of the best ""sights"" so far for the children has been witnessing women's equality in action. ""I think most notable is the freedom of girls and women to be in a position ... to be equal to men. That's very outstanding to them."" The older girls say their sources of inspiration are not pop stars but rather the late Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Myanmar democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi. So the journey continues, until their flight back to Kabul in March, just in time for Afghanistan's New Year celebrations, called ""Noruz."" ""I hope by seeing America, these children work even harder for peace and stability in our own country,"" says Nasrin. And as they learn about all things American, they hope Americans come away with a deeper understanding of their world.","A group of kids from an Afghanistan orphanage have begun a U.S. road trip .

"(CNN) -- In April, a dejected Rory McIlroy slumped away from the well-manicured Augusta National golf course after suffering one of the most dramatic final-round collapses in the sport's history. Despite starting the day as the dominant force and with a four-shot lead at the prestigious Masters, nerves and neuroses combined in the Atlanta sunshine to see him drop six strokes in three holes on the back nine on his way to an eight-over-par 80. His first career major had slipped through his fingers and his meltdown -- excruciating miss after excruciating miss -- had been captured by the world's media. The disintegration of McIlroy's focus and golfing faculty was such that doubt was cast on his burgeoning talent. Did the young Northern Irishman have what it took to be a champion? The question did not remain unanswered for long. Fast forward two months, having not long passed his 22nd birthday, when McIlroy showed the steel that many feared he lacked by destroying all before him at the U.S. Open with a tournament-record 16-under-par total at Congressional. His first major had been won, redemption had been achieved. After a turnaround worthy of Hollywood -- which is maybe fitting for a man born in the small town of Holywood -- McIlroy became a superstar. And the scintillating form of 2011 that had driven his meteoric rise continued: he is currently second in the world rankings and on the verge of finishing top of the European Tour's money list for the first time. Tiger holds no terror for golf's new world order . Maybe unsurprisingly, he is looking forward to 2012. ""I'm in a very happy place in my life,"" McIlroy told CNN. ""I'm very happy with what's going on on the golf course. ""There have been a few changes in my life. One of the biggest ones is becoming a major champion and realizing the different pressures that come with that status. ""It's nice to have one major, but then to get your second and to call yourself a multiple major champion would be something very special and it's something I want to try to do next year."" In 1997, another 22-year-old had similarly lofty ambitions. After a year which saw him clinch the Masters title, Tiger Woods used his first major triumph as a springboard for one of the most devastating spells of dominance that golf, and indeed sport, has ever seen. Another 13 majors followed for Woods during a decade of almost uninterrupted supremacy, before injury and revelations about his personal life in late 2009 led to a meltdown both on and off the golf course. Woods' collapse was dramatic. First, he surrendered top spot in the world rankings for the first time in 281 weeks when Lee Westwood usurped him in November 2010. It marked the start of Woods' troubles and his nadir arrived in October this year, when a two-year winless streak culminated with him slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since 1996. But recently Woods has shown signs of flickering back into life, exhibiting flashes of his dominant best to clinch last week's Chevron World Challenge and finally stop the rot. Far from intimidating McIlroy, the possibility of facing a rejuvenated Woods inspires him. McIlroy hopes to test himself to the limit by putting himself through a final-day showdown with the 35-year-old in 2012. ""I'm looking forward to hopefully having the chance to go up against him next year on the final day of a tournament,"" McIlroy said of Woods. ""I'm sure a lot of the younger guys are as well because it's something we've never been able to do before. ""It's new to us and it's a big challenge, to see how we handle it and to pit ourselves against possibly the best player to ever play the game."" The younger guys McIlroy speaks of have capitalized on the power vacuum created by Woods' fall from grace. Although hardly a youngster, England's Luke Donald has benefited the most by rising to the top of the world rankings and sealing his position at the top of the U.S. PGA Tour money list. In fact, if the 34-year-old can fend off competition from McIlroy at this weekend's Dubai World Championship he will become the first player in the sport's history to finish a season top of both the European and U.S. money lists. In addition to Donald, an array of rising stars have blazed a trail up the world rankings. One such player is Australia's Jason Day, who finished second at the Masters and U.S. Open during a breakthrough 2011. ""There's quite a few of us out there, the likes of myself, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day,"" explained McIlroy. ""Jason Day is a guy who really impresses me. ""I've played quite a lot of golf with him this year. He's only 23 years old and he's been second in two majors this year and he's really cemented himself among the top players in the world. I think he'll have a very good season next year."" As one of the sport's bright young hopes, McIlroy's profile is bound to rise in 2012. But it is not just his on-course performance which is attracting media attention. McIlroy's blossoming romance with the world's top-ranked female tennis player Caroline Wozniacki is another reason why his celebrity stock is on the rise. ""I'm very content,"" McIlroy said. ""I'm happy with the team that I have around me and I'm happy with everything else that's going on. We both lead very similar lifestyles. If I'm perfectly honest, Caroline is a very good influence on me."" McIlroy explained how the drive exhibited by his Danish girlfriend in pursuit of her maiden grand slam title acts as an inspiration to him. ""She is incredibly hard-working, she puts 100% effort into her game. It's nice to be able to share things with someone who really understands,"" he said of the 21-year-old. ""I've really enjoyed the time that I've spent with her over the past few months."" McIlroy has certainly come a long way since that disastrous Sunday at the Masters, with his new-found confidence best illustrated by his response to the question, ""Would you back yourself to win a major next season?"" His three-word answer: ""Yes I would.""","Rory McIlroy is seeking more major success in 2012 after a breakthrough year .

"(CNN) -- Roughly etched onto Brian's arm is a swastika tattoo. Brian's sinister-looking tattoo is etched into his skin . The 11-year-old says his 10-year-old friend Temashi spent two days ""scratching"" the image onto his skin with a match stick. It only hurt a little bit, said Brian, one of thousands of Zimbabwean children who have fled their ravaged homeland for what they hope will be a better life in South Africa. For Brian and his friend, the symbol of the swastika does not represent the horrors of Hitler and the Holocaust. Instead, they say the ominous jagged lines on their arms mean ""Germans never surrender."" It is a twisted interpretation that, however misguided, gives strength to Brian, marking him as a ""man"" and ""someone who does not surrender,"" he said quietly in a soft voice.  Watch the boys explain what the tattoos mean to them » . Brian and his young compatriots from Zimbabwe are on their own in a new country. Charities such as Save the Children and UNICEF classify them as ""unaccompanied minors,"" but those words do not begin to describe their situation. They endure unimaginable hardships traveling to South Africa by themselves or with small groups of friends. They hitch rides on trucks, trains and taxis. Brian and his friends told CNN that when they got to the South African border at Beitbridge authorities let them walk through without passports or other documents. They then made their way to the border town of Musina, where boys beg on the streets or work on farms, and girls seem to disappear into South African society. UNICEF representative Shantha Bloemen said many Zimbabwean girls either turn to prostitution or work as domestic servants. Nearly all of the children -- some younger than 10 -- leave Zimbabwe because they hope their life will be better in South Africa. They said hunger, non-functioning schools and poverty were the reasons they left. Many are orphans, while some have parents, but they all dislike Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's regime -- a government that has left them with no choice but to abandon their homes and join the exodus south. A quarter of Zimbabwe's population has fled the country, mostly to neighboring South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique, humanitarian groups said. The United Nations and Save the Children, which has an office based in Musina, report there has been a troubling increase in the number of children under 18 years old who are making the risky journey south from their homes in Zimbabwe to South Africa in search of work and food. Social workers from Save the Children and UNICEF told CNN that in June, 175 Zimbabwean children came over the border illegally and alone. In November, 1,016 kids made the same perilous journey. The boys older than 16 hang around Musina, sleeping on the sidewalk by a sports stadium along with older homeless men. Their days are spent waiting in line, jostling alongside hundreds of Zimbabwean adults, trying to apply for political asylum at a makeshift center opened by South African authorities. A South African official who processes asylum applications says it is common for youngsters to lie about their age so they can get the papers to stay in the country legally. Many, though, cannot get the necessary papers because they do not carry documentation or have adults who can vouch for who they are and where they come from. So, they wander the streets, begging for money. The younger ones like Brian are picked up by police and housed in a safe place until authorities and aid agencies can figure out what to do with them. While they wait for a future that never seems to arrive, boys like Brian and Temashi -- a legacy of Mugabe's regime -- struggle to survive in the world they now find themselves in.","25 percent of Zimbabwe's population has fled the nation, humanitarian groups say .

"(CNN) -- An eagerly-anticipated clash between two of the greatest boxers of the modern era looks likely to happen this year if the two camps can compromise on a date. U.S. boxer Floyd Mayweather Jnr took to his Twitter account this week to throw down the gauntlet to Manny Pacquiao, calling on his arch-rival from the Philippines to ""step up punk"" for a May 5 fight. But Pacquiao's official website said that the 33-year-old wanted a date at the end of that month. And Filipino broadcaster ABS-CBN reported that Pacquiao's adviser Michael Koncz said late May was preferable so that a temporary outdoor stadium could be constructed in Las Vegas to maximize revenue from the showdown. However, Pacquiao's business manager Eric Pineda told CNN that the fight might not take place until November. ""It's not going to be in May,"" Pineda said on Thursday. ""As far we know, he (Mayweather) has a jail term to serve. With a November date, he can still do a lot of training in jail."" Mayweather was sentenced to a 90-day prison term after being found of domestic violence, however a judge in Nevada ruled last week that the Mayweather could postpone reporting to jail until June because he had already lined up a fight date in May. Mayweather faces jail for domestic violence . Mayweather chose Twitter to issue his challenge to Pacquiao. ""Manny Pacquiao I'm calling you out let's fight May 5th and give the world what they want to see,"" he wrote on Tuesday. ""My jail sentence was pushed back because the date was locked in. Step up punk."" The two fighters have had a famously rancorous relationship. Last year, Pacquiao filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Las Vegas for defamation against Mayweather and others for allegedly claiming he had used performance-enhancing drugs. Pacquiao had been infuriated by the insistence of Mayweather and his team at Golden Boy Promotions that both fighters submit to Olympic-style blood testing in the buildup to a previous ""super fight."" The talks between the two parties broke down. ""Floyd Mayweather is a coward. He will never fight anyone that will remotely give him a tough fight,"" Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum said at the time. The 34-year-old American boxer has won all 42 of his professional fights (26 by knockout) but Pacquiao, 33, also has an impressive record with, with 54 wins from 59 bouts -- 38 by knockout -- plus three losses and two draws. He is the first boxer in the sport's history to have won world titles in eight weight divisions and recently launched a successful political career after being elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in June 2010. Pineda said the details of the much-vaunted fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao were still being studied. ""We haven't seen a contract yet. It's all still on the drawing board,"" he said.","Super fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao likely to happen later this year .

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Serena Williams has withdrawn from the Brisbane International tournament in Australia after suffering an ankle injury in Wednesday's third-round victory over Bojana Jovanovski. However, the American hopes it will not stop her from competing at this month's Australian Open, an event that the 13-time grand slam champion has won five times -- a record in the post-1968 Open era. The world No. 12 sustained the injury while serving for the match at 5-3 in the second set of her clash with Jovanovski at the Pat Rafter Arena. The Serbian broke to keep the contest alive, but fourth seed Williams responded to earn a 6-2 6-4 win before the results of a scan forced her to exit the Queensland event. Serena: 'I don't love playing tennis' ""I'm disappointed to have to pull out of the Brisbane International,"" the 30-year-old Williams told the tournament's official website. ""I have been to hospital and it has been confirmed that I have a left ankle sprain that I probably shouldn't play on. I'm going to take a couple of days off, not too many, and see how I feel. I'm still hopeful of playing the Australian Open."" Williams was playing in her first event since losing to Samantha Stosur in the final of the U.S. Open in September, when she was fined $2,000 for verbally abusing the match umpire. The Michigan native has been plagued by injury in recent years, having twice undergone foot surgery after stepping on a piece of glass in July 2010 and then suffering blood clots on both lungs. ""It was such an unexpected end to the tournament,"" she said. ""I didn't expect to be getting an MRI today. I've had a great time here in Brisbane -- the tournament is great, the fans are fantastic and hopefully I'll see them again next year."" Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova is guaranteed a place in the last four as a result of Williams' withdrawal, having beaten American Vania King 4-6 6-2 6-3 in the third round on Tuesday. Jovanovski's fellow Serb Jelena Jankovic reached the quarterfinals after the former world number one earned a straight-sets 6-3 6-2 win against Russian qualifier Nina Bratchikova. Jankovic next faces Italian third seed Francesca Schiavone, who defeated Kazakhstan's Galina Voskoboeva on Tuesday. Estonia's Kaia Kanepi set up a last-eight clash with German second seed Andrea Petkovic after cruising past Russian No. 7 Anastasia Pavlyuchenko 6-0 6-3. Elsewhere on the WTA Tour, top seed Sabine Lisicki battled the elements to record a hard-fought 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-3 success against fellow German Mona Barthel in second round of the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. A 90-minute rain delay disrupted the opening set, which Lisicki eventually won in a tie-break, and the world No. 15 clinched the decider in a match which saw both players surrender seven breaks of serve. Lisicki next faces compatriot Angelique Kerber, who upset fifth seed Julia Gorges 6-2 6-3 in another all-German encounter. Chinese second seed Peng Shuai crashed out of the hard-court event, losing 6-4 6-3 to the Czech Republic's Lucie Hradecka. The 26-year-old Hradecka will face Peng's compatriot Zheng Jie in the last eight, after the world No. 48 eliminated Romanian eighth seed Monica Niculescu 6-0 6-2. Russian third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova thrashed American Christina McHale 6-1 6-1 to set up a clash with Italy's Sara Errani -- who beat 2010 champion and 2011 runner-up Yanina Wickmayer. The Belgian seventh seed lost 4-6 6-1 6-1 in her second match since an injury retirement at September's U.S. Open. Fourth seed Flavia Pennetta beat Britain's Elena Baltacha 6-4 6-2 to set up a quarterfinal with Russia's Elena Vesnina, who eliminated the 2010 runner-up's fellow Italian Roberta Vinci 6-3 6-4. Meanwhile, the United States' hopes of retaining the Hopman Cup ended after a 3-0 Group A loss to the Czech Republic. World No. 2 and Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova got the Czechs off to the perfect start by beating Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-2 6-1, then Tomas Berdych defeated top-ranked American men's player Mardy Fish. World No. 7 Berdych and Kvitova made it a clean sweep for the Czechs by taking the dead doubles rubber 6-3 7-5. The result put the Czechs in a strong position to qualify for the final ahead of their last group match against Denmark on Friday. The Danish pair of world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki and Frederik Nielsen lost 2-1 to Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova and Grigor Dimitrov. Wozniacki defeated Pironkova 7-5 4-6 6-2 in the opening rubber, before Dimitrov leveled for Bulgaria with a 7-6 6-2 win over Nielsen. Bulgaria won the deciding doubles rubber 6-3 7-5, but both teams can still qualify for Saturday's final.","Serena Williams withdraws from the Brisbane International due to an ankle injury .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- I have a confession. As a music style, heavy metal has completely passed me by. I don't understand it. I'm not even sure I want to. ""Bring your daughter to the slaughter,"" bellows Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Why would I want to do that? Why would I want to listen to anyone even suggesting I do that? Outside The Crobar in London's Soho our intrepid reporter tries out her rock moves. While the thought of spending the evening head banging leaves me longing for an expensive glass of merlot, slightly fruity, and perhaps a long sit down, I can't escape the feeling that I'm somehow missing out. As a child of the 70s, how could I have missed the birth of a wildly popular new music genre right in the next decade? Even at the end of the 80s, when Iron Maiden was releasing its ""First Ten Years"" compilation of greatest hits, I would have been sixteen (or thereabouts), the perfect age to fall for the charms of a long-haired, rebellious rocker in tight leather pants. You'd think. There's only one thing for it -- a crash course in all things metal with the man who knows, self-confessed metalhead Malcolm Dome, who also presents the chart show for 24-hour UK rock and metal radio station TotalRock. I meet him at the TotalRock studios in Central London. The stairs are scuffed. It smells of stale sweat. I'm pleased to see Malcolm is wearing the traditional heavy metal attire of black T-shirt and black jeans. Obviously I'm going to have to go and buy a T-shirt, perhaps one with a skull on it. ""You can wear anything you want,"" Malcolm assures me. ""You'd probably be surprised how many heavy metal fans there are who have very high-powered business jobs -- even members of parliament who are into metal. They can't go around dressed as I'm necessarily dressed now all the time because it doesn't fit into their jobs."" Fortunately for Malcolm, his job as heavy metal journalist and broadcaster almost requires him to look the part. He's been involved in the scene since the late 1960s, when he fell for a young heavy metal group called Black Sabbath. His main allegiance later shifted to Led Zeppelin, but when it comes to music styles he's not fussy. ""I've got eclectic tastes,"" he says. ""I'm happy to listen to Frank Sinatra, listen to AC-DC, to all sorts."" Finally, we've found some common ground. If there's anyone who can convince me of the joys of heavy metal, it's someone who also appreciates the soothing, melodic tones of Sinatra. I've heard someone compare heavy metal to pantomime, I say. Surely that can't be true? ""It's absolutely panto,"" Malcolm enthuses, adding ""Sammy Goldwyn said that any film should start with a climax and build it from there. And that's what metal does. It starts with a big, big stage show and builds it from there. Of course it's panto. It's 'he's behind you', it's the whole larger than life character, it's circus, it's frivolity."" He hastens to add that a lot of time and effort goes into staging the shows, and from that perspective, it's completely serious. The problem with heavy metal, Malcolm says, is that the mainstream media misrepresented it for years. ""Every time the mainstream media used to cover it in the 70s and 80s, it was done from the point of view that 'this is weird, we don't understand it, we're going to go away not understanding it but we're going to present it to you anyway,'"" he says. Heavy metal was painted as the dark preserve of working class men who wore denim and leather and were, for the most part, sexist. That's even before you take into account accusations of devil worship and Satanism leveled at the genre by Christian activists in the 80s. ""You can understand people actually seeing what was being presented to them thinking 'I don't get it and I don't want to get it,'"" Malcolm says. Now many more people ""get it."" Some 30,000 people listen to TotalRock each week, many of them women. ""It's ended up being I think a music that attracts if not fifty percent female fans then certainly a very big minority. The fact is metal has never tried to exclude women."" So what of lyrics like ""bring your daughter to the slaughter""? ""'Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter' was actually written for a movie,"" Malcolm explains, ""One of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. However, it is not about killing people. Slaughter was a metaphor for the party. So it was actually a fun representation. Metal has never openly espoused violence towards anybody."" It should be stated here that there are varying degrees of heavy metal, from the hair metal of carefully-coifured Jon Bon Jovi to the black art of New York doom metal band Unearthly Trance. ""What makes Unearthly Trance so heavy is that they literally make your bowels rumble,"" Malcolm says. ""They are so intense. But it's also hypnotic. And strangely soothing,"" he adds. Dozens of sub-categories of metal have evolved to include black metal, stoner metal, thrash metal, power metal, goth metal, death metal and grind core, to name a few. What binds them all is a fierce dedication to the style of music and an admirable loyalty to their chosen bands. There seems to be none of the fickleness associated with the pop world where young performers are routinely thrown on the scrapheap after a few hits -- or flops. As Malcolm says, it's not unusual for bands to have a career that spans decades. Iron Maiden has been going for almost 30 years. Black Sabbath for even longer. So is there any age when heavy metal fans should retire gracefully from the scene? ""Absolutely not, no, no, no,"" Malcolm says, looking slightly shocked. ""If you love it and enjoy it why should you have give it up because you reach a certain age? Definitely not. Metal is ageless."" It's not too late for me then. What a relief.","Malcolm Dome of TotalRock conveys the joys of metal to the unconverted .
Heavy metal concerts likened to panto, ""it's circus, it's frivolity,"" Dome says .
Metal 'uniform' of black t-shirt, jeans and leather apparently unnecessary .
Metalheads display fierce loyalty to their bands, unlike fickle world of pop ."
"(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga boosted his Australian Open hopes by overcoming difficult conditions to beat fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils in the final of the Qatar Open on Saturday. The match was delayed by misty conditions, and world No. 6 Tsonga suffered one worrying slip on the greasy hard-court surface before completing a 7-5 6-3 victory in Doha. The 26-year-old claimed the first title of the 2012 ATP Tour season and the eighth of his career, showing the sort of form that took him to the final of the year's opening grand slam in Melbourne four years ago. He became the third Frenchman to win the event, being played in the Gulf state for the 20th time, and extended his career record over his Davis Cup teammate to 3-1. Federer and Nadal exit Qatar tournament . ""It was difficult. The surface was very slippery especially on the 'Qatar' sign painted on the court,"" Tsonga, who won 16 of the last 19 points, told reporters. ""It was dangerous but they did enough to make it okay. This is a good win for me going into the Australian Open, it's just amazing."" Tsonga took his place in the final after world No. 3 and three-time defending champion Roger Federer withdrew before their semifinal due to a back problem. Monfils qualified after beating second-ranked Spaniard Rafael Nadal in straight sets. Meanwhile, world No. 4 Andy Murray will take on Ukrainian third seed Alexandr Dolgopolov in Sunday's Brisbane International final. The top-seeded Briton beat Australian teenager Bernard Tomic 6-3 6-2 on Saturday in his first match under the guidance of his new coach, former world No. 1 Ivan Lendl. Murray, last year's Australian Open runner-up, reached his 31st career final after eliminating the 42nd-ranked 19-year-old. World No. 15 Dolgopolov defeated French second seed Gilles Simon 6-3 6-4 to reach his third hard-court final and third overall, giving him the chance to win his second title in a clash with a player who has beaten him in both their previous meetings. In India, Serbian top seed Janko Tipsarevic will face Canadian No. 4 Milos Raonic in Sunday's Chennai Open final.

"(CNN) -- Top seed Rafael Nadal and second seed Roger Federer are both through to the quarterfinals of the Qatar Open in Doha after comfortable straight sets victories on Wednesday. French Open champion Nadal took 90 minutes to see off fellow-left-hander Denis Gremelmayr of Germany 6-2 6-2 while Federer's 6-2 6-3 success over Slovenian Grega Zemlja was achieved in exactly and hour. Nadal told reporters he was happy with the way he played, saying: ""The worst thing I did last year was my return and I was happy with the way my return worked today. ""I also want to have enough shots not to be predictable. I want to attack the ball faster and hit with more power and spin,"" he added. Both Nadal and Federer had to contend with a troublesome wind and Federer said: ""I used to be very emotional when I was younger, after growing up in Switzerland where we didn't have wind that much, and where we also played indoors a lot. ""It was difficult learning how to play in the wind -- but I have had a lot of practice playing in windy places and it doesn't bother me any more."" Federer next faces eighth-seeded Italian Andreas Seppi, while Nadal will take on Russian Mikhail Youzhny.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer pulled out of his defense of the Qatar Open Friday with a back injury before his arch-rival Rafael Nadal was beaten in the semifinals of the $1 million tournament by Gael Monfils. Federer, the three-time defending champion at the season-opening tournament, was due to face France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for a place in the final. Monfils, who brushed aside top seed Nadal in straight sets, 6-3 6-4, will now play his compatriot for the first title of the 2012 ATP Tour season. Swiss maestro Federer had nursed back spasms during his wins over Greg Zemlja and Andreas Seppi and undergone treatment between matches as well as taking painkillers. But with the Australian Open looming on Monday week, the 16-time grand slam champion decided against risking the injury against Tsonga. ""I hurt my back in my second round match (against Zemlja) and I don't see any improvement today,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I've played through two matches in pain and don't think it's the right thing to risk anything more now. It's the only right decision to make. ""It's only the second time I have pulled out from a tournament, and I have never pulled out during a match. It's a sad moment for me, the tournament, and the fans, but health comes first."" Federer sounded a cautious note ahead of the first grand slam of the season. ""Although it's not very good it's not crazy bad,"" he said. ""I have had bad backs on the past, but this is not very good, otherwise I would definitely be playing,"" added Federer, who is on a 20-match unbeaten run on the ATP Tour. In the later action on court, a single break of service saw fourth seed Monfils take the opening set. Nadal hit back to lead 4-1 in the second set before Monfils conjured up five games in a row to compete a stunning victory in one hour 36 minutes. Tsonga holds a 2-1 career winning record over Monfils, but he lost their last encounter in Montpellier in 2010. Earlier, Andy Murray raced into the semifinals of the Brisbane International with a straight sets win over Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus.

"(CNN) -- When Jon Huntsman announced his campaign for president last summer, he received the type of media attention that presumed he would be an immediate and formidable challenger for the Republican nomination. Unlike other early casualties like Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann, Huntsman did not self-destruct. There was no spectacular immolation or flameout that rocked the political world, nor had there been the type of stratospheric rise that marked Cain and Bachmann's campaigns. Instead, there was just a long, steady flatline, with maybe the slightest sign of a heartbeat in the days before the New Hampshire primary, but far too little and too late to make any difference. It was only in the superheated world of cable TV and online media that his withdrawal received more than a moment's notice. So what went wrong for a candidate who entered the race with a biography and a bank account that seemed to presume a major impact on the primary campaign? The conventional wisdom is that Huntsman was unnecessarily confrontational toward conservatives early in his campaign, the Republican who didn't seem to want to be a Republican. For a candidate with such strong conservative credentials on almost every issue, the strategy didn't make sense. But that combative approach, combined with his time in the Obama administration, allowed him to be typecast by a lot of GOP voters from the outset and he never recovered. The other, bigger problem he faced was his lack of presence in the candidate debates. The debates this year, for better or worse, became the stage on which the contenders defined themselves for the voters in the early primary states. They provided campaign-changing moments for Cain, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich and others. But Huntsman just faded into the background and was never able to use them as a platform from which he could draw attention to his candidacy. Exacerbating his irrelevance was Huntsman's decision to skip the Iowa caucuses, condemning him to be overlooked in most daily campaign coverage. John McCain made the same decision 12 years earlier and used the time to build a New Hampshire campaign that catapulted him to victory in that state's primary. But McCain's biography as a Vietnam POW drew public attention in a way that Huntsman's time as ambassador to China could never duplicate. Worse, Huntsman never developed a policy proposal that created a rationale for an insurgent candidacy the way McCain's embrace of campaign finance reform did for him that year. It's not that Huntsman made any major errors in his campaign. He was perfectly presentable and mostly polite, the perfect lodger and the perfect guest. For most of the campaign, though, Jon Huntsman was simply the man who wasn't there. Join CNN Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on Twitter .

"(Financial Times) -- Two Russian billionaires have clashed publicly over corporate governance at the world's largest aluminium company, after Viktor Vekselberg said United Company Rusal was in ""deep crisis"" because of bad management and a heavy debt load. Mr Vekselberg resigned as Rusal's chairman on Monday night, saying it had been transformed from ""a world leader in the aluminium industry into a company overburdened by debt and involved in a huge number of legal battles and social conflicts"". Oleg Deripaska, Rusal's controlling shareholder and chief executive, hit back at Mr Vekselberg on Tuesday. ""There is no crisis, either deep or shallow. There is a difficult situation on the market which determines the economic results,"" he said, adding that Rusal would replace him with an independent chairman. Rusal, which suspended its Hong Kong-listed shares on Tuesday, had earlier said that Mr Vekselberg failed ""to perform his duties as a public company board chairman"". A spokesman for Mr Vekselberg declined to comment on Rusal's accusation. Rusal's shares were down over 3 per cent as trading resumed Wednesday morning in Hong Kong. Falling aluminium prices and heavy debts have cast a cloud over Rusal since it launched an initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange in early 2010. The company attracted large investments from the financier Nathaniel Rothschild, hedge fund manager John Paulson and two of Asia's richest men, Hong Kong-based billionaires Li Ka-shing and Robert Kuok. The stock is now 43 per cent below its IPO price. Rusal's IPO was controversial in the Chinese territory because of corporate governance concerns, and regulators initially restricted its sale to retail investors. Rusal's banks, which could have called in the company's loans if aluminium prices continued to fall, gave it a 12-month reprieve in January. Mr Deripaska said the agreement would allow Rusal to service its $11.4bn debt. Mr Vekselberg co-owns a 15.8 per cent stake in Rusal with another Russian oligarch, Leonard Blavatnik. Mr Vekselberg and Mr Deripaska have also been at odds over whether Rusal should sell its 25 per cent stake in Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest nickel miner. Mr Vekselberg has been seeking to sell many of his Russian assets over the past year, and supported a $12.8bn offer from Norilsk to buy back most of Rusal's stake. The deal, made at a big premium to the market price at the time, would have allowed Rusal to pay off its $11.4bn debt burden and begin paying dividends to shareholders. But Mr Deripaska, who sees Norilsk as a ""strategic asset"", refused to sell. A person close to one of the shareholders claimed the problems had broken out over a potential sale of Mr Vekselberg's stake in Rusal. Mr Deripaska declined to comment on which shareholders Mr Vekselberg had been in discussions with. He said: ""[Mr Vekselberg] has been receiving proposals all the time, but he always refuses them and raises the price."" © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Two Russian billionaires clash on governance at the world's largest aluminium company, .

"(CNN) -- A senior British lawmaker on Sunday condemned the execution in Belarus of one of two men convicted of a fatal subway bombing last year. Minister for Europe David Lidington said independent reports had raised ""serious and credible concerns"" over the standard of evidence and fairness of the trial that led to the conviction of the men, Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev. ""The UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle and any miscarriage of justice leading to the death penalty is of course irreversible and irreparable,"" Lidington said, urging Belarus to halt all executions and work toward abolishing the death penalty.

Kovalev's mother said Saturday her son had been executed by shooting, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti reported. She maintained her son's innocence. The private Belarus newspaper Telegraf reported Saturday that the other man, Konovalov, had also been shot dead. The European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned the execution, saying Saturday the men, both citizens of Belarus, were not accorded due process. Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland condemned Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's decision not to pardon the men. ""Belarus is the only country in Europe which still executes people,"" Jagland said. ""With its disrespect of basic human rights and democratic standards, the government of Belarus is increasingly isolating its country and its people from the rest of the world."" The bomb had been hidden beneath a bench and was filled with shrapnel, nails, and small metal balls and had the estimated power equivalent of 5 kilograms of TNT, the Belarusian state news agency Belta reported last year. In its ruling, the court described the two men as ""explosive enthusiasts"" and said they posed an ""exceptional danger to society,"" according to RIA Novosti.","The April 2011 bombing killed 15 and wounded more than 200 .

"(CNN) -- Two goals from striker Javier Hernandez helped Manchester United go four points clear at the top of the English Premier League on Saturday after a 4-0 win at Wigan Athletic. The 22-year-old converted Portugal winger Nani's cross after 17 minutes, and the Mexico international put Alex Ferguson's team two goals ahead with 16 minutes of the match left. England's Wayne Rooney added a third goal for the 18-time champions on 84 minutes as he finished from substitute Dimitar Berbatov's pass, and Brazilian full-back Fabio completed the rout three minutes from time. The result helped the Old Trafford team move onto 60 points from 27 matches, four points clear of second-placed Arsenal -- who face Birmingham City in the League Cup final on Sunday. United's comprehensive victory against second-bottom Wigan served as perfect preparation for Tuesday's trip to reigning champions Chelsea, who are 15 points behind the Red Devils in fifth and not playing this weekend. Elsewhere, 10-man Newcastle United stayed in ninth position after a 1-1 draw at home to seventh-placed Bolton Wanderers. Captain Kevin Nolan gave Alan Pardew's Newcastle an early lead with a header against his former club, but Bolton's on-loan striker Daniel Sturridge leveled the match with his fourth goal in four games. Newcastle defender Ryan Taylor was dismissed after 54 minutes for a two-footed tackle on Sweden forward Johan Elmander, but Bolton could not make the most of their numerical advantage. Two goals from Jermaine Beckford secured a 2-0 home success for Everton over Sunderland, who dropped below Bolton on goal difference. David Moyes' side took the lead at Goodison Park thanks to a Beckford shot which deflected off defender Titus Bramble, and the former Leeds United forward secured his first-ever Premier League brace after 39 minutes. It was a disappointing result for Sunderland boss Steve Bruce, who signed a new contract this week which will keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2014. Aston Villa moved away from the relegation zone courtesy of a convincing 4-1 defeat of Blackburn Rovers at Villa Park which moved the home team up to 12th -- a point above their opponents. Stand-in captain Ashley Young fired Gerard Houllier's side ahead with a second-half penalty, and Villa went two goals clear when Rovers defender Grant Hanley diverted a Marc Albrighton cross into his own net after 62 minutes. England winger Stewart Downing raced clear of the visitors' defense to calmly convert a third goal in the 65th minute, but Croatian striker Nikola Kalinic responded for Blackburn with nine minutes left. England international Young made sure of the win when he hammered home Downing's pass, and Blackburn's misery was complete when captain Ryan Nelsen received his marching orders in stoppage time. Wolverhampton Wanderers moved out of the relegation zone on goal difference above West Brom with a 4-0 win against Blackpool. It was a fitting victory for Wolves, on the day it was announced former defender Dean Richards had died, aged 36, after a long struggle with illness. Mick McCarthy's team took the lead thanks to Matt Jarvis' curling shot after two minutes, and it got worse for Blackpool -- who beat fourth-placed Tottenham 3-1 on Tuesday -- when striker DJ Campbell was sent off for a push on Richard Stearman. On-loan Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara doubled Wolves' advantage nine minutes into the second half, before two late goals by Sylvan Ebanks-Blake confirmed the three points and left Blackpool in 14th -- four points above the drop zone.

"(CNN) -- Jon Meacham is quick with a quip when asked why he decided to write a biography of Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson is the president of his time who is ""most like us,"" says biographer Jon Meacham. ""Any president who tried to attack his own assassin is worth writing about,"" Meacham says. But Meacham quickly turns serious when tallying the seventh president's historical importance -- and personal flaws. ""He is the president [of his era] most like us,"" the Newsweek editor says in a phone interview from Charleston, South Carolina. ""He was capable of great grace, but he could also be terribly cruel. ... In his complexities, I saw our own."" It's those kinds of contradictions that have kept historians revisiting Jackson for the past 175 years, and got Meacham going on ""American Lion"" (Random House). Jackson was the first president not from Virginia or Massachusetts, a frontiersman and general not connected to the Founding Fathers or Washington aristocracy. He was viewed with distaste by some, admiration by others. Some Washington colleagues, including Kentucky congressman Henry Clay, believed he was little more than an erratically tempered hick with dictatorial impulses. ""I cannot believe that the killing of 2,000 Englishmen at New Orleans qualifies a person for the various difficult and complicated duties of the Presidency,"" Clay once said, referring to Jackson's victory at the 1815 Battle of New Orleans. But he also was the subject of hero worship among citizens who admired him for his military leadership, his steadfast loyalty to national ideals, and the fact that he wasn't what would now be called a ""Washington insider."" Meacham, who had access to a trove of heretofore-unreleased letters from Jackson intimates, sees him as closer to the latter. ""He could use his passions and temper to his ends, or he wouldn't have been president,"" Meacham says. ""I don't believe he could have been president, even in 1828, if he were a wild man."" Jackson obviously still inspires fascination today. Meacham's biography has been high on the New York Times bestseller list since it came out in mid-November. As portrayed by Meacham, the president was not without wounds. Some were psychological: He ""never recovered from being an orphaned little boy,"" says Meacham. Some were political: He saw himself as the victim of a ""corrupt bargain"" in the 1824 election, in which he had won a plurality -- but not a majority -- of popular and electoral votes in a four-way race. By law, the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, where the presidency was awarded to John Quincy Adams (with, Jackson believed, the conniving of Henry Clay, who became Adams' secretary of state). And some were both. Jackson married his wife, Rachel, before she was officially divorced from her first husband, unbeknownst to either of them; when she died at 51 just after the 1828 election of a heart attack, Jackson blamed the stress on the attacks of the national press, which had found out about her past. Indeed, Jackson's own health was often questioned, and some observers wondered if he would survive his first term. A number of Jackson's policies still bother historians, most notably his instigation of ""Indian removal,"" which forced Native American tribes from their homes east of the Mississippi River. Ironically, Jackson was friendly with a number of Native chiefs, but he was determined to open their lands to white settlement. But Meacham finds much to admire in the seventh president. Though a religious man, he was a strong believer in the separation of church and state, ""which was unusual for a man of his background,"" Meacham says. (He also didn't trust ministers; during his first term, one reason for a cabinet crisis was a clergyman's whispering sanctimony.) And Jackson's passion came in handy, whether in shutting down the Bank of the United States (which he saw as a rival power center and a tool of the wealthy) or simply staying alive. When a deranged painter attempted to shoot him near the U.S. Capitol in 1835, Jackson -- as Meacham says -- attacked the man. (He also won a duel in 1806, killing a man named Charles Dickinson; he carried Dickinson's bullet in his chest for the rest of his 78 years.) This was also the man who, upon leaving office in 1837, purportedly said he had only two regrets: ""that I have not shot Henry Clay or hanged [former Jackson vice president] John C. Calhoun."" Though duels are no longer in vogue, Meacham says Jackson can still provide a template for the new occupant of the White House. Indeed, he says, Barack Obama would be wise to use Jackson's most noble passion: his belief in the power of the common man, which to Jackson was more than mere words. ""As long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property, liberty of conscience, and of the press, it will be worth defending,"" Jackson once observed. ""[Obama should] keep people connected,"" says Meacham. ""People want to be a part of things.""","President Andrew Jackson subject of new biography, ""American Lion""

"TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- Russia has likely moved additional troops into Georgia and its breakaway provinces over the past several days, several administration officials told CNN on Wednesday. The officials said Russia probably has at least 15,000 troops in the region. The U.S. government had estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Russian troops had moved into Georgia when fighting began last week. A Bush administration official stressed that the scope of Russia's military effort remains unclear. Russia was blasted diplomatically Wednesday by President Bush over reports of ongoing Russian military operations. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also said Russian military action in Georgia ""must stop and must stop now."" Georgia and Russia accused each other of violating the cease-fire deal agreed Tuesday to end fighting over the breakaway South Ossetia province. Bush said he was told the Russian military had blocked Georgia's major east-west highway and had soldiers at the main port at Poti, and there were reports that some ships had been attacked. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that there were no Russian troops in Poti but that there were soldiers on the outskirts of Gori and Senaki, to the west, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Senaki is south of another separatist province, Abkhazia. ""They are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of Gori and Senaki. These arsenals remain unguarded. Apparently those who guarded them fled,"" Lavrov said. He added that Russia's operations are ""aimed at ensuring the peace-enforcement operation in respect to the Georgian side, which violates all of its obligations,"" and his office denied that Russia had violated the cease-fire. International agreements signed in the early 1990s allow Russian peacekeepers to maintain a presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Bush said he was sending Rice to France and Georgia to discuss the violence over disputed provinces within Georgia's borders and to express ""America's unwavering support"" to the Georgian government.  Watch Bush pledge ""unwavering support"" for Georgia » . He also announced U.S. aircraft and ships would deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the fighting between Russian and Georgian troops, which erupted Friday. A U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo jet carrying medical supplies already has arrived in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, with more aid missions are planned by the Navy and Air Force. Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili said Russian forces have been ""advancing slowly but surely towards the capital"" of Georgia in violation of the cease-fire agreement. He accused the Russians of never intending to hold up their end of the truce. ""The cease-fire never stood in the first place,"" Saakashvili told CNN's ""Situation Room"" on Wednesday. ""Russia never intended to stop fire."" He added that ""Russian tanks continue to ravage Georgia town and villages, killing people, destroying buildings, looting. ... They've been doing worse things to what I've heard in the past and I could never imagine happening in my country."" A spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry bristled at reports of Russian troop movements and said they ""are not reflecting the real situation.""  Interactive map: See how far the Russians advanced » . ""We as the Russian Federation are [sticking] to the agreement, which [has] been made in Moscow yesterday, and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same,"" Andrei Nesterenko said. He chided Saakashvili for ""blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation."" A Russian convoy was seen by a CNN correspondent as it traveled on the road from Gori eastward toward the Georgia capital, Tbilisi -- well outside the mandated area for Russian peacekeepers confined to South Ossetia. Watch Russian spokesman explain tank movement . However, not far from Tbilisi, the convoy turned north into territory between Gori and South Ossetia, CNN correspondent Matthew Chance said. A Russian government spokesman said the soldiers ""never had plans"" to travel to the capital.  Watch more on the convoy outside Gori » . Saakashvili said Russian forces ""are encroaching upon the capital"" of Georgia in violation of the cease-fire agreement. He said the Russians never intended to hold up their end of the truce. ""This is the kind of cease-fire that, I don't know, they had with Afghanistan, I guess, in 1979,"" Saakashvili said. ""There is no cease-fire. [Russian forces] are moving around.""  Watch Saakashvili speak » . Interfax reported that a spokesman for the command of the Russian peacekeeping force said Russian soldiers who discovered an unguarded arms depot near Gori were emptying it as part of their goal of demilitarizing the area near South Ossetia. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Georgian government officials had fled Gori, and the Russian soldiers were providing food and water to residents. There were reports of looting. Using a cell phone, one Gori resident said he was hiding in the basement of his house, and there was chaos in the city. Russian tanks were parked at a nearby Georgian military base, he said. The Russian General Staff in Moscow accused the Georgians of not honoring the cease-fire, saying Georgian troops should return to their barracks. Saakashvili said Western leaders had ""failed to analyze Russia's intentions"" before it invaded Georgia and ""are partly to blame"" for the current situation. iReport.com: Share your story of how the crisis is affecting you . ""The response has not been adequate,"" Saakashvili said. ""Not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible, but those who don't react to that, I think they also share responsibility."" The six-point deal between the sides, negotiated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was meant to end the fighting over the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Watch more on push for peace » . However, Saakashvili, flanked by the leaders of Lithuania, Poland, Estonia and Latvia in a media briefing early Wednesday, said Russian tanks were attacking and ""rampaging"" through the Georgian town of Gori despite the cease-fire. Journalists in Gori, the birthplace of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, said they had seen no Russian tanks.  Watch more on battle-ravaged South Ossetia » . Reports of casualties on each side varied widely, and CNN could not confirm any of them. Fighting has raged since Thursday when Georgia launched its crackdown on separatist fighters in autonomous South Ossetia, where most people have long supported independence or reunification with neighboring North Ossetia, a territory within Russia. Russia sent its tanks into South Ossetia on Friday, saying it needed to protect Russian citizens living in the enclave, and quickly pushed back the Georgian forces. Russian forces also moved into Abkhazia, another breakaway Georgian region. Copyright 2008 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

"(CNN) -- Less than a year after a tornado swept through central Alabama, killing scores of people, a debris field created by that tornado caught fire Tuesday, threatening more than a dozen houses in the town of Brookwood, an official said. ""It is currently burning 100 acres in the tornado debris field,"" Alabama Forestry Commission Spokeswoman Coleen Vansant told CNN. The field was created April 27, when the powerful EF-4 tornado killed 64 people in Tuscaloosa and Jefferson counties and flattened a number of houses. Tornadoes took terrible toll almost a year ago . On Monday, firefighters contained a pile of burning debris that had spread, but it jumped the containment line on Tuesday in Brookwood, which has 1,483 residents and is about 17 miles east of Tuscaloosa. The fire then spread into a field of debris left by the tornado, threatening at least 20 houses, Vansant said. Among them were some that had been rebuilt after the tornado, she said. Dry weather, low humidity and gusty winds made the firefighters' job more difficult, she said.","Brookwood, Alabama, gets double whammy in less than a year .

"(CNN) -- Thomas Muster believes in reinvention, and he doesn't do things by half measures. The former ""King of Clay"" beat career-threatening injuries at the age of 21 to become Austria's first grand slam tennis champion and only world No. 1 player. But he shocked everyone by disappearing into early retirement in Australia. After years of excessively good living, he made his top-level comeback at the age of 43, having lost 25 kilograms in a punishing get-fit regime. And now, after finally putting his racket down a year or so later, with his desire to compete on court at the highest level sated again, Muster will focus on his family and wine-making business. ""When I went back to Austria I was looking for property. I grew up in this area and I knew these vineyards and property and the streets around it,"" he says of the Hochkittenberg wine estate he bought off a church diocese in 2004. A winning partnership . Muster teamed up with vintner Manfred Tement, who cultivates the eight hectares of land and put out their first joint Toms Hochkittenberg wine in 2005. ""He's a great tennis fan and I asked him if this vineyard was worth a dollar. He said it's a fantastic vineyard and it's got great soil and everything you need,"" the Liebnitz-born father of two told CNN's Open Court. ""That's how we started working together and that's how he started developing the vineyard around our house. Now it's a beautiful area with sauvignon, burgundy and muscatel grapes. ""It's all about the Styrian wines, it's about white wines -- 85 or 90% of our produce is white wine or white grapes. It's one of the best sauvignon areas in the world. It's still undiscovered here, that's what we like about it, but I think in the next few years people are going to find out where this is."" Muster won the French Open in 1995 and was the world's top-ranked player for six weeks the following year before quitting in 1999. It turns out he has the same passion for grapes as he did on the court. ""It's lovely be here and it's lovely to be back home. Manfred loves tennis and I love wine. It's not my profession, it's my passion,"" says Muster, who also produces bottled spring water from the Styrian Hochschwab area. ""He's such a great teacher and over the last years I've learned so much about wine, about the culture of wine, It's a great adventure. I love him as a friend and we have such a great time in the vineyards. ""It's hard work. To work a vineyard, you need a lot of guts to do that. To go out there and work all year, you almost feel that these people talk to the grapes. Wine is a lifestyle and you can talk about it for ages. It's a passion but it's not something I can do on a daily basis."" Disappearing Down Under . When Muster moved to Australia after feeling burned out by tennis, he quickly ballooned in weight to almost 100 kg. ""When I lost to Nicolas Lapentti on Court Two at the French Open I knew this was going to be my last match and it was very emotional for me,"" he recalls. ""On the other hand it was so great to feel like, 'I don't have to get up in the morning and practice!' When I went back home I threw everything I had related to tennis in the bin. I was so tired of playing tennis, so tired of traveling, of hotels, everything related to this sport. ""Maybe I should have just taken six months off. I don't know if this was the solution but I just felt that I was ready to stop."" Known as the King of Clay before Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal came on the scene, Muster won a record 12 tournaments in 1995 -- a feat that was not matched until Roger Federer in 2004. He won 40 of his 44 career titles on clay, but was also a strong competitor on hard courts as he twice reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and made the U.S. Open quarterfinals on three occasions. Overcoming adversity . It was in the United States where his career almost ended in 1989, when he was hit by a drunk driver in the car park at the event now known as the Miami Masters in Key Biscayne, where he was due to play the final the next day. ""Coming back from two sets down (against former French Open champion Yannick Noah) and achieving top 10, you're entering the level everyone wants to be in. Then I'm seeing myself in hospital a couple of hours later and having a smashed knee. It was devastating,"" Muster recalls. ""But I didn't really know meant to have ligaments torn, I didn't know the consequences that people have after that. So I was very positive. I thought it was going to be a few weeks and I'll be walking again, running again. But looking back it was a really, really hard time suffering from that injury. ""We started rehab straight away and it helped me a lot. I stayed in a rehab center for three months, working every day. I knew I couldn't run, but I had that touch, hitting balls and that routine I was going through, getting up, practicing, having therapy, doing weights. ""As soon as I could walk again I was able to play pretty good tennis because it was a great chance to build up my upper body. I almost felt like a chicken before, really skinny."" The King of Clay . In 1995 Muster won 40 consecutive matches on clay, the best run since Bjorn Borg's 46 successive victories. Nadal surpassed that mark when he won 81 in a row from 2005-07. Muster returned to Key Biscayne and beat two-time French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the 1997 final. It was to be his last ATP Tour title, with final defeats in Cincinnati later that year and Estoril in 1998. After his last outing at Roland Garros, he decided to skip Wimbledon -- where he is the only top-ranked player to have never won a singles match on the hallowed grass courts in London. ""I just didn't come back and then suddenly people started asking, 'Where is Thomas, why isn't he playing?' The press started to call me and I said, 'I'm going on a holiday and I don't know when I'm going to return,' so I never actually retired,"" Muster explains. He went to Australia, got married and had a son -- and completely forgot about tennis. ""I gave up everything I had in Europe and moved to a town north of Brisbane called Noosa Heads. I was 99 kilos, I smoked two packs of cigarettes a day,"" Muster says. ""When we got divorced it was a time to come back home. It's my secure place, my haven with my family. I came back here to get grounded again, and that's also when I started to play tennis again."" Back to basics . Working out up to seven hours a day, Muster soon trimmed down again and was able to compete on the seniors' Champions Tour. But the desire to play at the top level burned deeply, and he started again from the bottom on the Challenger circuit, where he found victories difficult to come by. ""It was a completely mad decision -- but it was great, I would do it any time again. I had the best time in the past year and a half ... to practice, to play, to get fit, to fight these guys and not be given a game,"" he says. ""I took my car and my coach, and we were driving thousands and thousands of kilometers. We had to drop in our keys to get three balls and a towel -- all things that are given at the big tournaments where they pick you up with great cars and they have the hospitality, food all day, trainers, physios. ""You go to a Challenger and it's in the middle of nowhere, there's no sun shining for you, a little crowd of a few hundred spectators. Okay I lost all those matches, I won a few, but it was great, it was grounding."" Family ties . Muster finally called it quits at the highest level at his home tournament in Vienna in October, losing in the first round. ""I decided to retire in Vienna because I left the scene very quietly and never had the chance to say goodbye,"" he says. ""I was never homesick when I played before, but now when I leave, when I see my daughter and I have to pack my bags, it's like, 'Do I have to go?' And when I lose I want to come back, and that's not a good sign for a professional player, you have to want to be out there. ""I don't want to stretch it to a limit where people think I'm stupid what I'm doing. I want to be respected for what I did. I don't want to use wild-cards for players who deserve it. ""It's been a great honor but at the end I want to say it's been a great time. I want to play a couple of senior tour events next year, but that's the level I can play at. You don't want to play tennis at 50 on a competitive level. ""I think my family needs me more than anybody else, and tennis doesn't need me anymore. I respect my wife a lot for taking all that in. She said, 'I didn't marry a tennis player, you'd retired.' Now it's time to do something else.""","Thomas Muster tells CNN about his life after retiring from top-level tennis .

"Ottawa, Canada (CNN) -- Victims of former Canadian junior hockey coach Graham James expressed anger Tuesday as he was sentenced to two years in prison for sexually abusing now-retired National Hockey League star Theo Fleury and another player, his cousin Todd Holt, when they were teenagers. ""The sentence today was nothing short of a national travesty because we know that childhood abuse has reached epidemic proportions in our country,"" said Holt as he read from a statement on behalf of himself, Fleury and their families. ""He conned the judge with his 'poor me' and 'I regret' statements,"" he said, ""and Graham James is laughing all the way back to the life he's always lived, knowing that justice for him is but a blip on the radar screen."" James, 59, entered the courtroom in Winnipeg, Manitoba, wearing a red ski mask to conceal his face. Later in court, the judge who ruled on the sentence acknowledged it could not make up for the lifetime of damage and pain inflicted by James. Judge Catherine Carlson â€ªsaid she realized James' victims were multiple and that his behavior was predatory and orchestrated to make victims dependent on him. Still, she stopped short of issuing the six-year term the prosecution was seeking, saying James had shown remorse and was receiving help. ""To sit in there and hear that Graham James was rehabilitated really drives me nuts and I think that was probably the most disturbing part of it all,"" said former NHL player Sheldon Kennedy who was also sexually abused by James. But Kennedy did say that the case offered hope and a platform for change. ""We need to come forward because not only do we need to heal and get our power back but we need to keep coming forward so we can keep raising the bar,"" he said. James pleaded guilty in 1997 to sexually abusing Kennedy. He served 18 months of a three-and-a-half year sentence and was released in 2000 and pardoned in 2007. Since then, the Canadian government has banned pardons for those convicted of sexual assault against minors. Twitter, call-in shows and Canadian websites all fielded hundreds of comments and postings from people who said they believed the sentence was too lenient. Many said they expected James to serve less than two years in prison. In evidence, the court heard that James lured players with money, gifts and trips to Disneyland, where he took advantage of them. Victims also testified that he always reminded them of his influence in helping them break into the pro ranks of hockey.","Former Canadian junior hockey coach Graham James sentenced to 2 years for sex abuse .

"(CNN) -- A politically active Marine who has questioned President Barack Obama's authority said Thursday that he is facing administrative discharge proceedings over his comments. Sgt. Gary Stein, who founded the Armed Forces Tea Party, said his commanding officer at Camp Pendleton near San Diego has accused him of violating a catch-all military justice provision against conduct endangering ""good order and discipline."" He is also accused of violating a Department of Defense policy limiting the political activities of service members. Stein came under scrutiny from Marine officials after saying he would not obey Obama's orders. In a January 26 post to the Armed Forces Tea Party Facebook page, Stein called Obama a liar. Two days later, he said the president is ""the 'Domestic Enemy' our oath speaks about."" In a March 4 posting, he questioned Obama's birth certificate. Another discussion on the site in March said he would refuse to obey orders given by Obama. He later clarified to say he meant illegal orders, which he has explained as orders such as sending the military to Syria without congressional approval. ""The allegations drummed up against me are no more than an agenda by the Marine Corps to use me as an example,"" Stein said in a statement posted to his page. ""If I am guilty of anything it would be that I am American, a freedom loving Conservative, hell bent on defending the constitution and preserving Americas greatness."" He noted that the opinions he expressed were his own, saying, ""I have never spoken on behalf of the Marine Corps or in uniform."" Appearing on CNN on Thursday morning, he called the charges a ""PR thing."" ""They have to make some sort of stand with this,"" he said. A Marine Corps spokesman confirmed Thursday that Stein's commanding officer had chosen to address the allegations through ""administration action"" after he had received the results of a preliminary inquiry into the case. While the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the free speech rights of ordinary citizens, a Defense Department rule prohibits service members from engaging in some forms of political activity. Among the prohibited activities are publishing partisan political articles or serving in an official capacity with a partisan political club. Stein has said that has carefully followed the Defense Department directive. He said Thursday that his unit has known about his off-duty activities since he joined the outfit eight months ago. He also said a similar investigation two years ago found that he had done nothing wrong and officers at the time told him he could continue running the site so long as it carried a disclaimer. The Facebook page notes that it does not represent and is not affiliated with the military or government. About 18,000 people follow posts on the page. Comments Tuesday on the page were largely, but not entirely, supportive of Stein. ""Gary Stein I stand behind you 100%. Keep up the good fight,"" one poster commented. ""Like it or not Obama is the Commander in Chief and this Marines job is to protect him Right or wrong,"" another poster said. Stein is not the first service member to face controversy over comments about Obama. In 2010, a military court sentenced Army Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin to six months in prison and removal from the military over his refusal to deploy to Afghanistan. Lakin argued that Obama was not born in the United States and therefore was not legally president, making his orders illegal.

"(CNN) -- From Morocco to the foothills of the Himalayas, the call for revenge echoes across the internet. Online forums associated with al Qaeda overflow with eulogies for Osama bin Laden, and with declarations that global jihad will continue. Even Facebook groups have emerged to mourn the demise of the world's most wanted man. Al Qaeda's affiliates across the Muslim world have published effusive tributes to bin Laden and pledged support for al Qaeda ""central."" The Islamic State of Iraq made a point of pledging loyalty to bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri: ""May Allah increase your reward and may Allah grant you the best consolation in this calamity,"" the group declared. Along with the condolences have come threats, both vague and specific. In a message posted on the Shumukh al-Islam forum and translated by the SITE Institute (a U.S.-based group which monitors jihadist sites), one contributor wrote: ""We declare that all American interests, wherever they may be, are legitimate targets for the mujahideen, and the interests of the NATO countries as well, because they are one alliance."" The leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- the most active of the group's franchises, warned Americans: ""You have to fight another generation in the wake of another, until your life is ruined, your days are disturbed and you face disgrace."" There have also been calls in jihadist forums for al Qaeda to revive its experiments with weapons of mass destruction. The SITE Institute translated one such appeal on the Shumukh al-Islam forum: ""We want to manufacture soman, ricin, mustard gas and VX nerve gas,"" it declared. But there have also been calls for more basic attacks. ""Go out at night in a targeted infidel compound with thirty canisters and a phone,"" read one. Some want immediate retribution. A contributor calling himself Abu Suleiman al Nasser wrote: ""We direct the supporters of jihad to the necessity of taking immediate action,"" he wrote, according to SITE. ""We will not be content but with tens of casualties, if not hundreds, if not thousands,"" wrote another. But there are also appeals for careful planning. Hussein bin Mahmoud, a frequent contributor to jihadist websites, wrote on May 2: ""We do not want operations here and there for vengeance; we want specific operations that are planned with wisdom and patience."" So much for aspirations. In its only statement since bin Laden's death, al Qaeda issued familiar threats -- to the leadership of Pakistan and the people and interests of the United States. The Pakistani Taliban, in a show of solidarity, also declared President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan its No.1 target. Perhaps no idle warning: Pakistan blamed a senior al Qaeda figure for planning a bomb attack that nearly killed then-President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, at the end of 2003. And the Pakistani Taliban has assassinated many senior Pakistani officials. Most analysts concur that al Qaeda wants to launch a large-scale attack to prove its resilience and rally supporters. But that's easier said than done. Al Qaeda ""central"" has spent much of the past decade on the defensive -- deflated by the loss of senior leaders, the drone campaign in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and a withering bank balance. Some Europeans who went to wage jihad in recent years told of being asked for money by their hosts, having to purchase their weapons and being on the run from one mountain refuge to another. CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank, who studied their experiences for the New America Foundation, wrote that one Belgian-French group ""was trained inside small mountain shacks, away from the all-seeing eyes of the drones. The loss of an increasing number of operatives prompted an order from al-Qaeda's top command that fighters remain inside as much as possible,"" according to Walid Othmani, a French recruit. Better intelligence has made it more difficult to launch coordinated attacks in the United States and Europe. In the last decade, U.S. surveillance of would-be jihadists, and their movements in and out of the country, has improved dramatically - as shown by the arrest and conviction of conspirators such as Najibullah Zazi, Bryant Neal Vinas and others. Similarly, cells in Europe have been broken up -- especially in Belgium, Germany, Spain and Denmark. The last major attack attributed to al Qaeda sympathizers was the London subway bombings in 2005. So al Qaeda may look for other targets. Mario Mancuso was deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and counterterrorism during the Bush administration. ""The U.S. homeland is relatively harder now, logistically,"" he said. ""My chief worry at the moment is the Saudi and Gulf oilfields. Energy security has been a principal rationale for U.S. involvement in the region. ""Such an attack would be highly symbolic, practically significant, and logistically easier"" than trying to mount an attack in the United States, said Mancuso. An attack on oil sources would fit with al Qaeda's long-held belief that the U.S. economy is vulnerable. ""Just as it claimed credit for bringing down the Soviet Union because of the cost it imposed on the Soviets for invading Afghanistan, it has the aim of bringing us to our knees economically,"" Mancuso said. Sabotaging Gulf oil exports would also fit with al Qaeda's core goals. In 2004, bin Laden urged supporters: ""Be active and prevent them from reaching the oil, and mount your operations accordingly, particularly in Iraq and the Gulf."" It became known as al Qaeda's ""bleed until bankruptcy"" strategy. Since bin Laden's death, jihadist forums have talked of attacks on shipping in the Strait of Hormuz at the tip of the Gulf, and in the Suez Canal. There are precedents. In the last year, al Qaeda has launched several attacks on oil installations and pipelines in Yemen. In October 2002, a suicide attack by a small boat on the French tanker Limburg, off the coast of Yemen, left one crew member dead and 90,000 barrels of oil in the Gulf of Aden. And in February 2006, militants in vehicles loaded with explosives tried to break through the gates of the Abqaiq oil refinery in eastern Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi intelligence has been successful in subduing al Qaeda cells in the kingdom in recent years, while security at oil refineries and pumping stations has been reinforced. For the United States, there remains the threat from ""lone wolf"" radicals, enraged by bin Laden's assassination but with little in the way of training and infrastructure to carry out an attack on the scale of 9/11. Faisal Shahzad's attempt to explode a car bomb in New York's Times Square a year ago is the most obvious recent example of such an attack. That's the foremost concern of the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, which issued a bulletin to law enforcement saying bin Laden's death ""is likely to provide motivation for Homeland attacks, particularly from like-minded, ideologically focused lone offenders ... unburdened by organizational constraints."" So far, as information from the Abbottabad compound is analyzed, no concrete plots to the United States have emerged. But according to one document recovered in February 2010, al Qaeda had discussed derailing trains in the U.S. Such a modest objective compared to the 9/11 attacks may be an acknowledgment of the group's tougher surroundings -- and a sign that al Qaeda is moving toward attacks focused on causing maximum disruption and economic cost. The Yemeni cleric Anwar al Awlaki has championed this approach. Last year, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- in its online magazine 'Inspire' -- boasted of spending just $4,000 in an effort to bring down U.S.-bound cargo planes by hiding PETN explosive in printers. Assassinations may also play a greater role. In 2009, an attempt to kill the Saudi security chief, Prince Muhammed bin Nayef, using a suicide bomber with PETN in his underwear, came within feet of achieving its aim. A few months later, a suicide bomber killed seven CIA employees at a base in Khost. Whatever the future brings, it is likely al Qaeda's plans will be more difficult to track. In the past 10 years it has spawned cells active from Casablanca to Java -- thriving wherever the authority of the state is absent and the territory remote. Al Qaeda ideologue Abu Musab al-Suri once said: ""Al Qaeda is not an organization, nor do we want it to be. It is a call, a reference."" Counter-terrorism analysts say that operationally, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, strengthened by some veteran Saudi jihadists, may now pose a greater threat than al Qaeda central. In Somalia, al Qaeda affiliate Shabaab has taken advantage of anarchy; in the Sahel, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has made money from smuggling and possibly drug-trafficking. Some analysts say it may have used the proceeds to acquire sophisticated weapons such as shoulder-launched ground-to-air missiles. There is also growing evidence that Salafist cells have established themselves in the Gaza Strip. Add to this the risk that al Qaeda and other Salafist groups, after being bypassed by the largely secular nature of the Arab Spring, will try to take advantage of new instability in Arab states. The likely heir to bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri, has already spoken at length about such opportunities, focusing on his native Egypt. In Iraq, al Qaeda (whose animosity toward Shiite Muslims almost matches its hatred of the West) has already shown it will take drastic steps to inflame Sunni-Shiite tensions by attacking shrines and religious festivals. Growing tensions in Bahrain and the Shia-populated provinces of eastern Saudi Arabia could provide openings. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has already warned of the struggle to come against ""Shi'ites and the apostates and their men so that Allah will judge between us and them."" For now, al Qaeda's core leadership is probably focused on survival, anxious that the ""treasure trove"" of Abbottabad might give away its refuges and tactics. But, says Mancuso, ""the succession dynamic itself may fuel the urgency of a spectacular attack. There may even be regional competition to do this, so bin Laden's demise might make al Qaeda more dangerous structurally.""","Better intelligence has made an attack on U.S. or Europe more difficult .

"(CNN) -- Swedish prosecutors Tuesday asked a judge to extend the detention of four terror suspects, telling the court they were ""planning to commit murder,"" according to legal documents obtained by CNN. Three men of Somali origin and one man born in Iraq were seized Saturday in a raid led by a SWAT team and backed by local police in Gothenburg, Sweden, the country's Security Service said. A court named them Monday as Kulan Mohamud Abel, Mahamud Abdi Aziz, Mahmood Salar Sami and Mohamud Abdi Weli, and tax authorities confirmed their nationalities. All are between the ages of 23 and 26. Prosecutors had until Tuesday to release them or ask the court to extend their detention. The four face allegations of plotting an attack this month in Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city. The legal papers filed by the prosecutor Tuesday do not accuse them of terrorism, only plotting murder. But Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the Swedish prosecution authority, said that should not be interpreted to mean they are no longer suspected of planning terror. Prosecutor Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstrom said the men might try to go ahead with the attack or hinder the investigation if they are released. They were arrested Saturday night on ""probable cause"" of plotting attacks, the highest level of suspicion in the Swedish legal system. They are expected to appear before a judge in Gothenburg on Wednesday, the court told CNN. Judges usually decide such cases on the spot. They have not yet been formally charged. Lawyer Eva Henriksson, who represents Weli, said he denies the allegations. ""He says he has no idea what these accusations are about and that he has no explanation to why he would have been arrested,"" she said, adding that she had gotten ""only very basic and sparse information about what he is accused of."" She criticized the police for taking so long to inform her and her client about the details of the accusations. Weli, who was born in Somalia and became a Swedish citizen in 2000, got a suspended sentence and fine in 2009 for assault, court records show. Lawyers for the other three did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Sami, who was born in Iraq and is now a Swedish citizen, has a long criminal record, court documents show. He has been charged with multiple counts of theft, assault and making threats, among other crimes, and has served several years in prison. Aziz, who was born in Somalia and has lived in Sweden since 1999, but is not a citizen, has been fine for minor driving offenses. Abel, a Swedish citizen who was also born in Somalia, has no known criminal record. Sweden's Security Service refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip-off, saying the details of the ongoing investigation could not be discussed. ""Through these arrests, we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring,"" Malena Rembe, head analyst at the Swedish Security Service, told CNN affiliate TV4 Sunday. Swedish media have reported that the four are suspected of having links to the Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab, but prosecutors and police refused to confirm that to CNN. The Swedish Security Service did warn last year that several Swedes have gone to Somalia for terrorist training. Sweden is not raising its terror threat level, which is currently at 3, with 5 as the highest. There is ""no reason for the public to be alarmed. ... These arrests have not changed this threat level,"" Kvarnstrom said. An art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time, police said, but they declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests. A party was going on at the Roda Sten gallery at the time, with about 500 people attending the inauguration of an arts festival, according to an interview with a witness in Goteborgs Posten, a local newspaper. Stockholm was hit by a suicide bombing in December. The attack on the capital, Sweden's first suicide bombing, wounded two people in a district full of Christmas shoppers. Police arrested two people in Gothenburg on suspicion of plotting a bombing in October. They were later released without charge, police said.","NEW: A lawyer for one of the men says he denies the charges .
