"(CNN) -- International scientists have announced the discovery of a tiny moon orbiting Saturn. The speck of light, captured by cameras on board the Cassini spacecraft, was first observed on August 15. The speck of light, captured by cameras on board the Cassini spacecraft, was first observed on August 15. A review found the moonlet on two earlier images and it has since been seen on multiple occasions. The finding appeared in Tuesday's edition of the International Astronomical Union circular. The moon is about one-third of a mile (a half-kilometer) across and circles Saturn as a part of the planet's sixth, or G, ring. ""Before Cassini, the G ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon, which made it odd,"" said Matthew Hedman, a Cassini imaging team associate at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. ""The discovery of this moonlet, together with other Cassini data, should help us make sense of this previously mysterious ring."" Early next year, Cassini's camera will take a closer look at the moonlet. The Cassini Equinox mission, an extension of the original four-year mission, is expected to continue until fall 2010. If the craft continues to function properly, the mission could be extended up to two more years. Cassini, which was funded by NASA and the European and Italian space agencies, launched in 1997 and took seven years to make the 934 million-mile (1.5 billion-kilometer) trip to Saturn. Since its arrival, Cassini has been making a looping voyage through the Saturn system and is returning loads of data on the ringed planet and its moons. Three years ago, a space probe launched from Cassini found evidence of geysers erupting from underground pools of liquid water on Saturn's moon Enceladus. High-definition pictures beamed back from the probe showed huge plumes of ice coming from the moon's south pole.","The speck of light was first observed on August 15 .

"(CNN) -- From Pac-Man to ""Pretty in Pink,"" Dungeons and Dragons to Devo, Rush to ""School House Rock"": If this pop culture laundry list brings back fond memories, then do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Ernest Cline's new novel, ""Ready Player One."" Packed with '80s nostalgia, it is part intergalactic scavenger hunt, part romance and all heart, a love-letter to growing up geek. Described as ""Willy Wonka meets the Matrix"" the book takes place in a dystopian future. The year is 2044 and the real world is an ugly place. People escape their grim surroundings by accessing the OASIS, kind of like the Internet on steroids. Hidden somewhere deep inside this virtual utopia is the ultimate golden ticket, the key to unlimited fortune and power, but to find it, players will have to unlock an increasingly difficult series of pop culture puzzles. It's an addictive read. The book has become a best-seller and a movie is in the works. ""Ready Player One"" came naturally to author Cline. He's a self-described geek, a fan of video games, manga and Monty Python. He wrote the 2009 cult classic movie ""Fan Boys,"" an ode to obsessed ""Star Wars"" fans. How serious is Cline's geek cred? He has spent the last few weeks driving cross-country to promote his book in a souped-up DeLorean. Cline's tricked out car incorporates elements from his favorite movie vehicles, including ""Back to the Future,"" ""Knight Rider,"" ""Buckaroo Banzai"" and ""Ghostbusters."" He's even got an ""ECTO 88"" personalized license plate. CNN spoke to Cline recently about his debut novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark that led you to write ""Ready Player One""? Cline: The initial idea for the story came to me way back in the summer of 2001. I was working a technical support job at the time, helping people use computers and the Internet, and so I spent a lot of time thinking about the future of the Internet. I believed it might evolve into a sprawling virtual universe, sort of a cross between World of Warcraft and Facebook. When I start imagining what sort of person would create such a virtual world, I pictured a Willy Wonka-esque video game designer holding a grand video game contest inside his virtual world, and the rest of the story grew out of that first idea. CNN: What was your introduction to geek culture growing up? Cline: That's hard to say. I feel like I was hit by all of geek culture at once while I was growing up in the '70s and '80s. Saturday morning cartoons like ""Star Blazers"" and ""Robotech."" Live action Japanese shows like ""Ultraman"" and ""The Space Giants."" I spent most of my childhood welded to my Atari 2600, until I got my first computer, a TRS-80. I grew up immersing myself in all of these things, and they informed my whole adolescence. CNN: You demonstrate an encyclopedia-like knowledge of '80s pop culture. It seems like a lifetime of research went into your novel. Cline: It did, in a way, because I was writing about everything I love. It took me a long time to write this novel, and I maintained my interest in the project by filling the story with things I'm passionate about. I was also being lazy, in a way, since I didn't have to do a lot of new research. Now, all of the geeking out I've been doing my entire life can retroactively be classified as ""research"" for my novel. CNN: Tell me about ""Ready Player One"" the movie. I hear you're writing the screenplay? Cline: Yes, I wrote the first draft of the screenplay adaptation earlier this year, and that's what Warner Bros. is using to find the right director. They're very excited about the reception the book is receiving, so the movie could go into production as early as next year. Fingers crossed. CNN: You also wrote the movie ""Fanboys."" How did that experience compare to writing your first novel? Cline: It was a lot more frustrating, because I had to give up control of the story to get the movie made, and so the end product didn't turn out exactly the way I'd hoped. That experience actually motivated me to finish ""Ready Player One,"" because I wanted to see what would happen if I was able to have total control of my story, with no filters between me and the audience. CNN: Tell me about your ""Ecto 88"" DeLorean. I understand you're wrapping up a cross-country road trip? Cline: Well, I've wanted to own a DeLorean since I was 10 years old, but it always seemed like a silly daydream. Like owning the ""A-Team"" van or something. But once I sold my novel, it occurred to me that I could finally buy a DeLorean and us it to promote the book, since the protagonist drives one in the story. I could pose with the car in my author photo, then drive it across the country on my book tour, thus making it a business expense! It's one of the best ideas I've ever had. When I bought the car, I knew I wanted to trick it out like the DeLorean in the book, which combines elements from Doc Brown's Time Machine, KITT from ""Knight Rider,"" the ""Ghostbusters"" Ecto-1, and ""Buckaroo Banzai's"" Jet Car. So I went on the Internet and found a Flux Capacitor, an Oscillation Overthruster, and a wide array of Ghostbusting equipment, including a screen-accurate Proton Pack (which rides shotgun). Then I installed a blue KITT scanner on the front of the car and got some personalized ECTO88 license plates. Then I took my time traveling, Knight Riding, Ghostbusting Jet Car out on the road. It was a big hit at every bookstore I stopped at on my tour. Get a guided tour of Cline's tricked out 1982 DeLorean. CNN: It seems like recently geek culture has gone mainstream. Would you agree? Does that change anything about being a geek? Cline: I have no choice but to agree. I wrote the geekiest novel in history and it's now been on The New York Times best-seller list for several weeks. From my perspective, it definitely seems that the geeks have inherited the Earth. It's changed my whole life. CNN: What are you geeking out to now? Cline: Neal Stephenson's new novel, ""Reamde."" I managed to snag an advance copy and I can't put it down. Mr. Stephenson is one of my favorite writers. CNN: What's next for you? Cline: Well, I've started working on an outline for a possible sequel to ""Ready Player One."" But at the moment, I'm working on a geeky coming-of-age movie set in the late '80s. Sort of my version of ""Dazed and Confused,"" but instead of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, my characters are steeped in Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games and comic books. It's going to be the nerdiest coming-of-age movie ever made. Read an excerpt from ""Ready Player One.""","Ernest Cline's novel is described as ""Willy Wonka meets the Matrix""

"London (CNN) -- One British citizen was killed and another one was kidnapped overnight at a resort near Kenya's border with Somalia, Britain's Foreign Office told CNN Sunday. The attack occurred at a beach resort north of Lamu, Kenya, the foreign office said. A maritime security source aware of the situation said the victims were a couple and the husband was killed. His wife has likely been taken by Islamic militants by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia, the source told CNN. ""We are working to secure the safe and swift release of the British national who has been kidnapped and ask those involved to show compassion and release the individual immediately,"" the foreign office said in a statement. British officials did not release further details about the kidnapping case, but said they are working closely with Kenyan authorities. The office said it has amended its travel advice for Kenya in light of the attack. ""We continue to advise against all but essential travel to within 30 kilometers of Kenya's border with Somalia. There have been previous attacks by Somali militia into Kenya,"" the advisory said. CNN's David Wilkinson contributed to this report.","NEW: Kidnapped British woman may have been taken to Somalia .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military has blocked access to a range of popular commercial websites in order to free up bandwidth for use in Japan recovery efforts, according to an e-mail obtained by CNN and confirmed by a spokesman for U.S. Strategic Command. The sites -- including YouTube, ESPN, Amazon, eBay and MTV -- were chosen not because of the content but because their popularity among users of military computers account for significant bandwidth, according to Strategic Command spokesman Rodney Ellison. The block, instituted Monday, is intended ""to make sure bandwidth was available in Japan for military operations"" as the United States helps in the aftermath of last week's deadly earthquake and tsunami, Ellison explained. U.S. Pacific Command made the request to free up the bandwidth. The sites, 13 in all, are blocked across the Department of Defense's .mil computer system. ""This is a response to a time of extreme demand for networks,"" Ellison said. Ellison emphasized that it was a temporary measure. ""This blockage will be of a temporary nature and may increase or decrease in the size and scope as necessary,"" according to the message distributed to military announcing the move. ""We are doing this to facilitate the recovery efforts under way in Japan,"" Ellison explained. ""We are trying to make sure we are giving them as many avenues and as much support as we can.""

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Jurors began deliberations Wednesday in the case of Joshua Komisarjevsky, the second man to be tried in connection with a deadly Connecticut home invasion in 2007. A day before, the jurors heard lawyers' final pleas in the case as prosecutors cast Komisarjevsky, 31, as the instigator of the attack, while the defense insisted ""he did not want anyone to die."" The trial has gone on for a little over three weeks, during which time jurors heard emotional testimony detailing the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. After closing arguments wrapped up Tuesday, Judge Jon Blue started walking jurors through the 17 charges facing Komisarjevsky, including three counts of murder, four counts of kidnapping, burglary, arson and assault. If convicted, he could receive the death penalty. The judge got through 45 of 48 pages detailing the charges late Tuesday afternoon before sending the jury home. Steven Hayes, the first defendant to stand trial, was sentenced to death in December 2010 after a jury convicted him on 16 of 17 charges. As closing arguments began Tuesday, prosecutor Gary Nicholson told jurors, ""Once Komisarjevsky and Hayes completed their plan, where there was a family, there were three corpses."" Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters, and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. William Petit managed to escape. Before assaulting and killing Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said. Nicholson recounted for jurors Tuesday the ways in which Komisarjevsky aided Hayes during the crime, including driving him to the Petit home, helping him beat William Petit and helping him restrain other family members. ""Make no mistake about it, this intrusion into the Petit home was Mr. Komisarjevsky's idea,"" Nicholson said. Defense lawyer Jeremiah Donovan stressed to jurors that his client didn't enter the Cheshire home with a lethal weapon. Komisarjevsky, in his view, didn't kill William Petit when he had the chance, and he closed doors to the girls' room to buy them time to survive the fire. Komisarjevsky was contrasted with Hayes, whom Donovan claimed strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit, then lit the fatal fire. ""He did not intend that anyone should die,"" Donovan said of Komisarjevsky. On Monday, a 90-minute tape of Komisarjevsky's police confession was played for jurors. He told authorities he followed Hawke-Petit and her youngest daughter home after seeing them in a shopping center parking lot. He said he started thinking the Petit home was ""very nice."" Komisarjevsky said in the confession he was beating William Petit with a baseball bat when ""he let out this unearthly scream. I kept hitting him until he finally backed up into a corner of the couch. ... He quieted down and was just staring at me with open eyes, just sheer confusion."" But he also denied killing anyone, saying that Hayes ""pulled me to the side"" and said, ""'We gotta kill them and burn the house down.' I'm like, 'I'm not killing anyone, there's no way. We have the money. There's not a problem.'"" William Petit addressed the media after Tuesday's courtroom session, admitting he was bothered by the defense's strategy -- including its claim that his escape from the house may have precipitated the chain of events that led to the three deaths, or that things may not have unfolded as they did if Hawke-Petit had acted differently. CNN's Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","On Tuesday, the judge ran the jury through the 17 charges .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina man accused of plotting to wage holy war overseas also planned to attack the U.S. Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, according to new charges announced Thursday. Daniel Boyd previously was charged with conspiracy to support terrorists and conspiracy to murder. The charge is one of three counts in a new indictment against Daniel Patrick Boyd, who authorities allege is the ringleader of a group of men charged with training in North Carolina for a ""violent jihad."" Boyd and another man, Hysen Sherifi, are charged with conspiring to murder U.S. military personnel. ""Boyd undertook reconnaissance of the Marine Corps Base located in Quantico, Virginia, and obtained maps of the base in order to plan an attack on Quantico,"" the charges state. FBI agents found weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition and $13,000 cash in Boyd's Raleigh-area home, an FBI agent testified at an August bond hearing for the men, who were arrested in late July. The original indictment says the men practiced military tactics in a North Carolina county that borders Virginia. The latest indictment also charges Boyd, Sherifi, and Boyd's son Zakariya with possession of weapons in furtherance of a crime of violence, while Boyd faces an additional charge of providing a rifle and ammunition to a convicted felon. Boyd and seven others already have been charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people. One of the men is believed to have fled to Pakistan, and the remaining men are in custody. In August, a federal judge denied bail for the seven in custody, but expressed skepticism about the charges against them. Magistrate Judge William Webb said the defendants made a number statements espousing holy war, and said the statements could be interpreted in isolation as braggadocio. But he agreed to keep them in jail because some of them had amassed a large arsenal and engaged in firearms training.","Daniel Boyd, another man charged with conspiring to murder U.S. military personnel .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's capital was braced for unprecedented flooding Wednesday, amid the monsoon rains that have overwhelmed much of the country as well as Laos, Cambodia and the Philippines in recent weeks. ""It's going to be clearer over the next couple days"" whether Bangkok can be spared the brunt of the flooding said Matthew Cochrane, spokesperson for the International Red Cross in Bangkok. So far, 281 people have been killed and four people are missing in Thailand, according to the country's Flood Relief Operations Command. Some 60 of the country's 76 provinces have so far been affected, impacting some eight million people. ""It's really quite serious, these are the worst floods in Thailand since 1949,"" Cochrane said. ""These floods started in June really and started to move south and have really caused huge damage the whole way down,"" Cochrane said. ""They've affected hundreds and hundreds of villages and towns, they've wiped out 2.5 million acres of farmland. This is a very, very serious disaster."" Over half a million square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- are affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Asia's wet and wild 2011 explained . In Bangkok officials beefed up flood prevention measures as waterways, including the main Chao Phraya River, became bloated by rising water. ""There are walls still being built in the north of the city,"" Cochrane said Wednesday. ""One of the challenges is the areas where flood waters are typically diverted to protect the capital and protect the economic center of the country, those areas are already flooded, so there's potentially not much room for those waters to go."" ""For Bangkok we are still confident that the inner part of the city will be safe from (flooding),"" said Thitima Chaisaeng, Thailand government spokesperson, but the eastern and western parts of Bangkok face flooding. On Monday, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered canal dredging and reinforcement of flood-prevention embankments to protect the city, state-run news agency MCOT reported. In addition, three new flood-prevention walls were being built at two locations in Rangsit, in northern Bangkok, and in Taling Chan, in the western part of the city. Tourists warned as floods continue to wreak havoc in Thailand . The government needs another 1.5 million sandbags, MCOT reported. The prime minister called on the private sector to supply them, but said the government will buy all the needed sandbags by Wednesday, the news agency said. Meanwhile, around 1,200 people have taken shelter in a gymnasium at Bangkok's Thammasat University. Most of them are from neighboring Ayutthaya province and other flood-affected areas around the capital, said Thanawat Srisuwan, a volunteer at the makeshift shelter. The authorities have set up almost 200 other temporary shelters around the city to receive flood victims. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said plans were in place to evacuate people from nine areas, mainly in eastern Bangkok, if needed. Elsewhere, patients in two hospitals in Thailand's Ayutthaya and Nakhon Sawan provinces had to be evacuated after water reached the first floor, the flood operations command said. Multiple tropical weather systems have moved over the region in recent weeks, enhancing monsoon rains and leading to the flooding. Heavy rains are expected in Southeast Asia through the end of October. According to the government website Thaiflood.com, water from northern Thailand has finally reached lower parts of central Thailand, penetrating dykes in Pathumthani and Nonthaburi provinces and flooding outer areas of Bangkok, including the market in Nonthaburi and Chiang Rang road. The giant Rojana Industrial Park has halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building. Honda also confirmed operations at its Rojana plant have been halted. The Japanese automaker says the closure of the plant has already affected the manufacture of 4,500 vehicles. Meanwhile the UNESCO-listed Ayutthaya historical park, which includes the ruins of the old city of Ayutthaya, has been submerged since last week, according to local authorities. ""This is the worst flood in our historical site in 16 years,"" said Somsuda Leeyawanich, from the Thai Fine Arts Department. She said the water level in the park is almost three meters, compared to levels of around 80-90 centimeters during the floods of 1995. ""We are very concerned that if the site is under water more 30 days it may cause serious damage,"" she added. ""The temples are over 400 years old.""

"(CNN) -- Is this just a normal year, or is the southwest monsoon acting more aggressively than normal? The 2011 tropical cyclone season in the west Pacific has been about average, not significantly above or below usual events. We did have a few consecutive storms that made landfall in the Philippines and other parts of South East Asia in late September and early October, such as Haitang, Nesat, and Nalgae -- but that had more to do with a steering pattern caused by high pressure over the Pacific, not the monsoon. The remnants of these storms did make their way farther into South East Asia, which likely enhanced the monsoon trough, thus leading to higher than average rainfall in countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Rainfall in most of Thailand is running 15% to 25% above average for the year (with a vast majority of that rain coming in the monsoon months of May to October). What exactly is the southwest monsoon? When does it start, end, and how is it generated? The southwest monsoon occurs during the northern hemisphere summer, and is caused by the land masses of the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia heating up faster than the Indian Ocean. This creates an influx of cooler, moisture-laden air from the ocean over the land. The southwest monsoon generally begins in mid-May and ends in late October/early November, though start and end times vary based on location. India, for example, has a southwest monsoon season that begins June 1 and ends September 30. Which countries are most affected by this monsoon? India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, and Malaysia are all affected in a significant way. India is largely considered the most ""affected,"" since it has the most-consistent monsoon season and depends the most on the rains of the monsoon for their life-sustaining agriculture. Some areas in Asia are recording above-average precipitation, such as in Bangkok which has so far received 58% more rainfall than usual this year. Why is the monsoon bringing more intense weather than usual in 2011? Some monsoons are more active than others, and there can be a myriad of reasons for this. I think the monsoon rainfall was enhanced in September by numerous tropical systems interacting with the monsoon trough. But other reasons could be much more complicated. There could be interactions with other large-scale weather and climate variables, such as El Nino or La Nina (in the case of this summer, La Nina was in place, and this does normally lead to higher than average precipitation in South East Asia). Sea-surface temperatures that are slightly above or below average can also lead to a variation in monsoon rainfall. Scientists will need to look into how all of these potential ingredients came together to produce these flooding rains. Also, the monsoon can be very active in one region, while being relatively inactive in another. It just so happens that for the last several weeks, the monsoon trough has been very active over central Thailand (in and around Bangkok), but other areas of the country have seen below average rainfall. In general are Asian summer monsoons becoming more destructive, or is it just cyclical? I believe it is just cyclical, and as mentioned above, depends on a wide variety of factors. The consequences, however, could be getting worse as populations and cities grow along the major rivers, which see rapid and intense rises during monsoon floods. Is there anything that Asia can do to help alleviate higher than usual rainfall? Better city planning and flood prevention strategies would be the biggest thing. Monsoon floods have always occurred, and these rivers naturally flood their banks occasionally (which is what makes the land in these areas so fertile). But if people continue to build more in these vulnerable areas, natural disasters like floods will continue to become more frequent. CNN meteorologist and weather anchor Jennifer Delgado also contributed to this report.","The 2011 tropical cyclone season in the west Pacific has been about average .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court has suspended the death sentence of Mumtaz Qadri, a security guard who killed a liberal politician over the latter's remarks on the nation's controversial blasphemy law. ""Qadri was provoked by the governor and should therefore be tried for murder, not an act of terror which is what he was tried for earlier"" said his attorney Raja Shuja Ur Rehman in confirming the judge's decision. Earlier this month, a terror court in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near Pakistan's capital, sentenced Qadri to death. The Islamabad High Court suspended the sentence Tuesday until the appeals process is complete. The court did not say when it will meet again to consider the case. Police said Qadri, a policeman serving as a security guard for Punjab Gov. Salman Taseer, fatally shot him in a market in Islamabad on January 4 because of Taseer's remarks on Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law. Police said Qadri confessed to gunning down the man he was supposed to be protecting. Qadri's lawyer appealed the sentence imposed by the Anti-Terrorist Court, saying the court did not have the jurisdiction to make the death penalty decision. Taseer, a successful businessman as well as politician, had said Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law is too harsh. The law makes it a crime punishable by death to insult Islam, the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed. The legislation has been criticized by some as being used to entrap minorities .","A terror court sentenced Qadri to death for Taseer's death .

"(CNN) -- All BlackBerry service has been restored following the largest network outage in that smartphone's history, Research in Motion executives said in a conference call on Thursday morning. ""We've now restored full services,"" RIM's co-CEO Mike Lazaridis told reporters. Some BlackBerry users may still see e-mails coming in slowly as the system recovers, he said. The major outage frustrated customers on nearly every continent who were unable to send and receive e-mails and text messages this week. It also comes at a bad time for RIM, which is facing increased competition from Android and Apple smartphones. The iPhone 4S is set to be released on Friday, and social media posts suggest some BlackBerry users may switch to other phones in part because of the prolonged break in services. The outage started on Monday in Europe and spread to North America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America over the course of the next two days. A failure at one of the company's messaging servers in Europe, along with the subsequent failure of its backup system, led to a ripple effect that reportedly caused problems for millions of BlackBerry owners. Executives on Thursday did not answer questions about how many people were impacted by the four-day service outage, but they did say this breakdown was the largest in the company's history. ""We've worked 12 yrs since the launch of BlackBerry to win the trust of our 70 million BlackBerry subscribers and we're going to fully commit to win that trust back -- 100%,"" Lazaridis said during the press conference. This is not the first time RIM has faced a major service outage. ""I have been an analyst for 25 years and have watched RIM wrestle with this same outage problem time after time. Every few years we get pinched by yet another major problem,"" tech analyst Jeff Kagan said in a statement. This outage, however, comes at a particularly unfortunate time for RIM, since it faces increasing competition in the smart phone market, Kagan says. BlackBerry users, many of whom use the devices primarily for business purposes, took to the Web to vent their anger about the outage. Twitter and other messaging platforms have been full of complaints since the outage began almost four days ago.

"New York (CNN)   -- For years, Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi has been speaking out against human rights violations in her country of Iran, where her defense of political prisoners and support for human rights and democracy have earned her the ire of the ruling regime. In 2008, Iranian authorities shut down the Center for the Defense of Human Rights, of which she is president, and since 2009, she has been living in exile. Ebadi is now in the United States to promote her latest book, ""The Golden Cage: Three Brothers, Three Choices, One Destiny"" (Kales Press, 2011). The book tells the story of an Iranian family torn apart by competing ideologies. Roxana Saberi interviewed her at Columbia University in New York. Here is an edited transcript. Question: In your book, ""The Golden Cage,"" the first sentence quotes Iranian sociologist Dr. Shariati saying: ""If you can't eliminate injustice, at least tell everyone about it."" But some people ask, ""What's the use of speaking out?"" And does the Islamic Republic of Iran care when others criticize its human rights record? Answer: If no one speaks out when a government violates human rights and uses oppression, this oppression continues. But when people are informed, they gradually become aware, and when they become aware, they begin to object. No change happens in society unless people become aware. Q: And does the Islamic Republic care? A: About the Islamic Republic, it's the same. In 1988, there was a massacre of political prisoners in Iran. At that time, there was no internet, people couldn't spread news much to one another, and very few knew of this story. As a result, Iran's government quietly continued. But [after Iran's disputed presidential election in] June 2009, with the help of the internet, people took photographs and film of the many individuals who were killed in the streets, then put these images on YouTube. The whole world understood what was happening. For example, the killing of Neda [a young Iranian woman shot to death at a protest] shook the world. Q: What more could or should the U.S. government and the international community do about Iran's human rights record? A: The development of democracy and human rights in any country is the duty of that country's people, and foreign countries must watch from a distance and provide help without interfering in internal affairs. It was very important that the U.S. government and other member countries of the U.N. Human Rights Council voted to condemn Iran's human rights violations and to assign a special U.N. rapporteur on human rights for Iran. It was also important that the United States announced travel bans and asset freezes for certain Iranian individuals who have had a direct role in killing or repressing the Iranian people. This is not interference in Iran's domestic affairs but support of the people. ... These types of steps must continue. Q: How can citizens of the U.S., Europe, and other countries help promote human rights in Iran? A: They can do the most. When you vote, vote for those who are not warmongers, and vote for those who respect human rights. When you see a president who doesn't respect human rights, don't vote for that person. In fact, I have always said that U.S. policy won't change unless the American people change, and the American people won't change unless they get more information about the world. So this is our duty, to give necessary information to the people. Q: And in your opinion, does the current U.S. president respect human rights? A: Mr. Obama has so far shown that he respects human rights. Q: At a talk at The New School, you said that Iran's Green Movement has in no way become weaker but has just changed its form of resistance. What hope is there that the movement for democracy in Iran will prevail? A: There is a lot of hope that the people of Iran will prevail because fortunately they don't resort to violence, they continue their resistance, and also the economic situation is very bad. The price of food in Tehran has even become more expensive than in the United States. And most importantly, many divisions have formed among conservatives. Altogether, these factors will cause the regime to weaken. Q: Will we see the democratic movement prevail in our lives? A: This depends on whether I die tomorrow or in another 30 years. Q: Let's say you live another 30 years. Will we see it? A: Yes, within 30 years, of course. Q: What influence do revolutions and protests in countries such as Egypt, Libya and Syria have on Iran's democracy movement? A: Syria is the Islamic Republic's only ally in the Middle East, and it is not only an ally but also a puppet of Iran. A revolution has begun in Syria, and the people there are protesting against the dictatorship of the Assad family. If they succeed in bringing democracy to Syria, this will help democracy in Iran a great deal. In Tunisia and Libya, democracy will also help Iran very much, and the people coming to power in those countries will help democracy in Iran progress. In Egypt, the fundamentalists are strong, and in the beginning, it's possible they will be very close to the Iranian government, but they won't become a puppet of Iran because they are Sunni, while the Iranians are Shiite, and feelings of racism exist between the Iranian government and Arab governments. There are no common interests between Iran and Egypt. Also, Egypt sees itself as a big brother of Islamic and Arab countries, and Iran also sees itself as a leader of Islamic countries, ... so while Egypt and Iran will build political relations, Egypt certainly won't transform into a puppet of Iran. Q: What about events in Bahrain? A: In Bahrain and Yemen, the Shiites have protested because they faced discrimination and their situation is not good. Shiites are being killed, and this has caused the Iranian government to support them. Iran even wrote a letter to the United Nations and requested that the issue be sent to the U.N. Security Council. The West has remained quiet, while Iran tells the Shiites that you see, we are the only country supporting you. It is clear that when the people of Yemen and Bahrain reach power, Iran will have a lot of influence on them. The best path is for the West, especially the United States, not to remain indifferent toward the repression of the Shiite people in Bahrain and Yemen. Q: As you know, when I was in prison in Iran, I wanted to retain you, as well as your colleagues Mr. Soltani and Mr. Dadkhah, as my attorneys, but the authorities pressured my father and me not to work with you. I realize that many prisoners in Iran suffered and are suffering more than I did. But to what extent was my experience representative of the experiences of many other prisoners and attorneys in Iran, and what kind of pressures do attorneys there face? A: If Iranian attorneys want to defend political prisoners, problems will certainly be created for them. For example, Nasrin Sotudeh has been sentenced to 11 years in prison. ... Mr. [Mohammad] Seifzadeh was sentenced to nine years in prison. After the 2009 election, Mr. [Abdolfattah] Soltani and Mr. [Mohammad Ali] Dadkhah went to prison. They are now free on bail. Mrs. Shadi Sadr, Mr. Mostafaei and me -- all of us were forced to come out of the country because of harassment by the authorities. So you see that every person who supports political prisoners becomes the target of the regime's anger. Moreover, the court forces political prisoners to choose from among the attorneys who work with the regime itself and who are puppets of the Intelligence Ministry. Q: During these past few years, particularly under the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, what changes for women's rights have you seen in Iran? A: There have been no changes, except that the repression has become greater for women. There has been no change in the laws, but whatever happened has not been in women's interests. Q: You talked about your being abroad. What positive or negative aspects does your exile have for your human rights efforts? A: I preferred to be in Iran, but the situation there is such that because of censorship and repression, there is no possibility for any kind of human rights activity.","Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi was in New York to promote her new book .

"(CNN) -- Calls by Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary Hillary Clinton to ""unite the world in the isolation of and dealing with the Iranians,"" in response to an alleged Iranian plot to kill Saudi Arabia's Ambassador in Washington, reflect a hubristic misapprehension of reality. The Obama Administration mistakenly believes it can exploit the accusations for strategic advantage. In fact, they are likely to play to Iran's advantage, not America's. The U.S. foreign policy community profoundly misunderstands the Islamic Republic's national security strategy. The Islamic Republic seeks to defend itself not primarily by conventional military power, in which it is deficient, but by forging ties to proxy allies around the region-actors with the ability to affect on-the-ground outcomes in key regional settings who are inclined to cooperate with Tehran. In some cases, these actors are discrete political movements, often with paramilitary capabilities, for example, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia political parties-cum-militias in Iraq. In other situations, Tehran sees public opinion as its chief ally. By contrasting some regimes' cooperation with the United States and Israel with its own posture of ""resistance"" to American and Israeli ambitions to regional hegemony, Tehran cultivates ""soft power"" across the Middle East. Iran conceives its strategy, especially in a period of relative decline in America's standing, as one that constrains unfriendly regimes in the short term and undermines them in the longer term. Over the last decade, it has helped the Islamic Republic reap significant political and strategic gains in important theaters across the Middle East-Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories. With the advent of the Arab awakening at the end of last year, Iranian decision-makers are confident that some Arab states' shift toward governments more reflective of their peoples' attitudes and concerns-and, hence, more inclined to pursue more independent foreign policies vis-Ã -vis the United States and Israel-will work to Iran's advantage. Iranian policymakers correctly calculated that virtually any successor to Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq would be a net positive for Iranian interests. Now, they calculate that a successor to the Mubarak regime in Egypt is bound to be less enthusiastic about strategic cooperation with the United States and Israel and more receptive to Iran's message of resistance. Iran's strategy toward Saudi Arabia runs very much along these lines. Tehran's approach is to highlight Saudi collusion with Washington and (at least indirectly) with Israel on important regional issues, thereby attracting support from ordinary Saudis-not just Saudi Shia but also Sunnis who dislike their government's pro-American stance. In the short term, Iran seeks to constrain the Saudi government from cooperating in military strikes or other coercive actions against it by making this an unpopular prospect for much of the Saudi population. In the longer term, Iran is working to transform the regional balance of power from one in which the United States, the Saudis, and other American allies dominate to one in which American, Israeli, and Saudi influence is marginalized by the diplomatic realignment of Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Turkey, post-Saddam Iraq, and now Egypt. The Saudi leadership tries to push back by portraying Iran as an ""alien"", Shia/Persian element in its environment. At times, this helps the Kingdom hold the line against the Islamic Republic's soft power offensive. But the long-term trend is toward rising Iranian influence. In this context, the notion of an Iranian government plot to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to the United States simply has no logic. History also suggests we treat the Obama Administration's claims of Iranian government complicity with deep skepticism. For eight years, during 1980-1988, the fledgling Islamic Republic had to defend itself against a war of aggression launched by Saddam Hussein -- a war of aggression financed primarily by Saudi Arabia. Nearly 300,000 Iranians were killed in that war. But, during the entire conflict, the Iranian government never targeted a single Saudi anywhere in the world. This is not because the Islamic Republic loves the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is because Iran's national security strategy ultimately depends on appealing to the Saudi public not to support attacks against Iran, by harnessing popular anger over Israeli actions and U.S. overreach in the war on terror. Killing a Saudi Ambassador would have exactly the opposite effect. Whatever Mansour Ababsiar and his cousin may have talked about, it is wholly implausible that the Iranian leadership decided that this was a smart thing to do. The Obama Administration's calls for more concerted action against Iran will ultimately backfire-because they will be seen in most of the Muslim world (outside Saudi Arabia and Gulf Arab monarchies closely linked to Saudi Arabia) as the United States yet again leveling dubious life-and-death charges as the pretext to contain or even eliminate another Muslim power. President Obama, his advisers, and all Americans need to ask themselves if this is really the time to bring the United States even closer to another Middle East war fought in blind defiance of the region's strategic realities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leverett.","Flynt Leverett and Hillary Mann Leveret say Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton reflect a hubristic version of reality .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's upcoming Christmas message will say Jesus would be a defender of the oppressed if he were alive today. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will deliver his Christmas message on Channel 4. ""Jesus the Son of Mary is the standard-bearer of justice, of love for our fellow human beings, of the fight against tyranny, discrimination and injustice,"" Ahmadinejad will say, according to a preliminary text of remarks he is planning to deliver in a message to be broadcast Thursday -- Christmas Day -- on British TV. The fiery Iranian leader, who has angered Western countries with his sharp comments on Israel, nuclear power, and the role of the United States in the world, will be delivering the Alternative Christmas Message on Britain's Channel 4. The network, which calls the event a ""traditional alternative to The Queen's Christmas Day broadcast,"" issued the preliminary text. The thrust of his words and the overall message contained religiously inclusive rhetoric, such as his congratulating ""the followers of Abrahamic faiths, especially the followers of Jesus Christ, and the people of Britain."" And his words conjured a hopeful future. But some of his remarks reflected Ahmadinejad's trademark bluntness. ""If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would stand with the people in opposition to bullying, ill-tempered and expansionist powers,"" the text says. ""If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers, occupiers, terrorists and bullies the world over. ""If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would fight against the tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems, as he did in his lifetime.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A member of Congress Friday called on the State Department to stop doing business with Xe, the North Carolina-based security company formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, on Friday urged the State Department ""not to enter into further contracts"" with  Xe. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whether the State Department had just signed a new $20 million dollar contract with Xe for Iraq, saying she is ""very concerned"" that the State Department may be signing new security contracts with Xe, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I urge you not to enter into further contracts with Xe and to immediately review any existing contracts,"" the letter said, according to a copy provided to CNN. ""The behavior and actions of both the company's leadership and a number of individuals employed by the company have harmed our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan and endangered the lives and welfare of our troops and diplomatic personnel serving overseas."" The State Department decided in January not to renew a personnel protection contract with Blackwater, as the company was then known, when it expired in May. That decision came amidst an investigation by both U.S. and Iraqi authorities of a 2007 shooting involving Blackwater guards in Baghdad in which 17 Iraqis were killed. The company has repeatedly denied any wrong-doing. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request Friday for reaction to Schakowsky's questions and criticism. The State Department had said that it would continue a Blackwater air-support contract after the much-larger personnel protection contract ended. Xe spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke told CNN that, ""Right now we have no contracts with the State Department in Iraq."" DeLuke said the company would review calls for bids to provide security for U.S. officials in Afghanistan. ""The thing is we are totally open to bidding on some of the contracts that may come up in Afghanistan just like anyone else,"" DeLuke said in a telephone interview. The Nation magazine released an article Friday that said the State Department had signed a new contract for Iraq with Xe for $20 million to extend an earlier aviation contract. ""The State Department contract is scheduled to run through September 3. In May, the State Department announced it was not renewing Blackwater's Iraq contract, and the Iraqi government has refused to issue the company an operating license,"" the article said. The controversy over the role of Blackwater in Iraq was revived earlier this week by a lawsuit filed in Virginia by two former employees accusing Blackwater guards of smuggling weapons and using excessive force in Iraq. And the lawsuit claims Blackwater founder Erik Prince ""views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe."" Xe said in a statement that it would respond ""to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs,"" in a brief to be filed August 17. Blackwater changed its name to Xe in February.","State Department says it will continue Blackwater air-support contract .

"(CNN) -- Desiré Henriksen feared that there would be no Christmas for her two boys. She had lost her job at Denny's, where she worked the graveyard shift. Her fiancé, who works as a glazier, was having a hard time finding regular work. And the couple fell behind on the mortgage last month. Desire Henriksen decided to sell her hair after losing her job and falling behind on her mortgage. So Henriksen, of Phoenix, Arizona, cut her hair and sold it on the Internet to a hair trader in the Netherlands. ""Everyone was telling me how beautiful my hair was,"" the 27-year-old said. Her friends suggested that she sell it. ""I thought, 'Why not? I'll check it out,' "" she said. ""We're trying to keep our place here,"" she said. ""We don't want to become like people right now who are losing their homes."" With the economy squeezing the budgets of more Americans, some people are looking for creative ways to pay their monthly bills. Selling hair on the Internet is just one of those unusual methods. ""We've seen about a 20 percent increase in the last four months,"" said Jacalyn Elise, co-founder of TheHairTrader.com, referring to the number of ads offering hair for sale posted on her site. ""These days, some people are just in need of money."" Henriksen was paid $1,200 for 27 inches of her tresses. But most hair is sold for about $300 to $900, says Marlys Fladeland of Hairwork.com. The hair is used to make wigs or hair extensions or is used in artwork. The longer the hair, the more it is worth. Untreated hair is also likely to fetch a higher price, Elise says. For Henriksen, cutting her hair was always in the cards. But she had planned to give it to a nonprofit organization that provides hairpieces for children who lost their hair after cancer treatments. ""Initially, I had grown my hair out to donate to Locks of Love in memory of my mother, who passed away from cancer last year. I was going to try to give back to people who didn't have any hair. But it didn't work out that way. Instead, I got my kids Christmas [gifts],"" she said. In addition to buying presents for her 10-year-old son and 3-year-old stepson, Henriksen paid off the overdue mortgage bill. She was so pleased with how easy her hairy business deal was, she says she's planning on growing her hair out again and selling it on TheHairTrader.com to help pay for her wedding. A professional lab rat . Others are taking more drastic measures, becoming medical guinea pigs. Paul Clough, 30, fell on hard times five years ago. A homeless man suggested that Clough take part in medical clinical trials, and now it's his full-time gig. Clough estimates that he brought in $28,000 this year by participating in seven medical trials, having his blood taken 500 times and ingesting about a dozen medications. The Austin, Texas, resident has tested everything from cholesterol-lowering drugs to hepatitis C and HIV treatments. He even set up a Web site, Just Another Lab Rat, which explains how and where to volunteer. Clinical research requires testing drugs on volunteers to determine whether the drug is appropriate for the market. The test subjects may be required to stay at a clinic or may have to visit the clinic a few times. Depending on the clinic and the trials they participate in, they may be paid $50 to $5,000 each time. Trials can last 10 days to a month. Safety concerns include side effects or drug reactions, but for many volunteers, the payout outweighs the risks. ""Some people live study-to-study,"" Clough said. ""They have immediate bills to take care of. And a lot of times, when people don't get into the study, they are concerned about how to pay those bills. They don't know what they're going to do."" ""Five years ago, it was mostly students,"" he said. But today, he sees ""Realtors, taxi drivers. ... It's any walk of life you can think of."" Your personal gold mine . Jeweler Les Harrell of Littleton, Colorado, struck gold when he had the idea to give people cash for their gold -- at parties. It started out as a fundraising event. But seven months later, he has a Web site, Gold Exchange. He's hired three employees, and he's throwing gold parties seven days a week. Friends and neighbors assemble to swap gossip, have drinks and get their jewelry appraised. Harrell pays cash on the spot for folks willing to hand over their gold. Later, he sells it on the market. He has operations in Colorado, New York and California. Deanna Molinaro was skeptical when she was invited to one of Harrell's gold parties this summer. But the Denver, Colorado, resident changed her mind after walking away with $700 for a wad of tangled gold bracelets, a herringbone necklace and some mismatched earrings. ""I was floored,"" she said, when she first heard about the cash. ""I made a lot of money on things that were lying around in my jewelry box for 20 years."" Harrell says he typically pays $5,000 per party, not including the cut the hostess makes and the referral fee. And it's not always jewelry he's appraising. ""I've seen it all,"" he said. ""Grandma's old dinosaur ring, gold teeth. I buy a lot of gold teeth, class rings."" One item he remembers fondly: Uncle Louie's bridge. ""It weighed almost 2 ounces,"" he said with a hint of amusement. People have, on average, about $300 worth of gold just lying around, Harrell says, and liquidating that hidden treasure can help them balance the family budget. Harrell's parties were initially geared toward the upper class, but his clientele is changing. ""What was fun money becomes, 'Oh, my gosh, this is a big help,' "" he said. In reality, a drawer full of costume jewelry, broken chains, errant earring backs and muddled memories may turn out to be next month's heating bill. One woman, living alone on Social Security, recently turned over a shoebox full of jewelry to Harrell to see what, if anything, she could get for it. ""She really didn't know what was real or not,"" related Molinaro, who helped with the transaction. But she cleaned out everything she had. In the end, her shoebox was worth $350. ""She was so excited to get it,"" Molinaro said. ""I got a big hug out of her for it, too.""","Many Americans are looking for creative ways to make ends meet .

"(CNN) -- One of the 78 wives of jailed polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs left the Arizona community of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints this week and is receiving medical treatment at a shelter, authorities said. The woman, who is not being named by the Washington County, Utah, Sheriff's Department because she's considered a victim of abuse, was taken to the shelter after a tense standoff with church members Monday. The woman fled to the home of Willie Jessop, a former top church associate expelled by Jeffs. Jessop said the woman came there because she knew he would protect her. Warren Jeffs found guilty of sexual assault . The standoff began when men from the FLDS arrived at Jessop's office, wanting to take her back to the community, Jessop said. Detectives removed the woman and took her to the shelter. Jeffs, leader of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is serving a life-plus-20-year term for sexual assault. He was convicted in early August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl Jeffs claimed were his ""spiritual wives."" Warren Jeffs' life sentence raises questions about future of breakaway sect . The FLDS is a breakaway Mormon sect that openly practices polygamy in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, as well as on its Yearning For Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas.

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be one of the happiest days of Albert Florence's life. He had just secured funding for the home he was building and was traveling along Interstate 295 outside Trenton, New Jersey, one Sunday with his wife and child. That's when he first heard the sirens. ""We were not doing anything illegal, we were obeying the speed limits,"" Florence told CNN. ""It's just a normal routine stop, I thought."" A state trooper pulled the family SUV over to the side of the road. Even though his pregnant wife was driving, Florence said, the officer focused on him, discovering a warrant for his arrest. The alleged crime, he said, was an unpaid traffic fine. The 35-year-old Bordentown resident was arrested, handcuffed, and hauled off to the Burlington County Detention Center. That began what he called a ""six-day nightmare."" Florence was strip-searched by corrections staff, all because of what he terms a misunderstanding, a computer glitch. ""It was very disgusting. It was just a bad, bad experience,"" he told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan recently. ""I was just told, 'Do as you're told.' Wash in this disgusting soap and obey the directions of the officer who was instructing me to turn around, lift my genitals up, turn around, and squat."" Still shaken by the experience six years later, Florence sued, and now his appeal is before the U.S. Supreme Court. He is challenging the county's rules allowing routine strip searches of everyone arrested for even minor offenses, regardless of the circumstances. It is an important test of police detention powers in the post-9/11 security-conscious environment, a chance for the justices to offer clarity on an issue in which both inmates and the police have sought guidance. Oral arguments are scheduled for Wednesday. Court records show Florence was subjected to what he terms an invasive strip and visual body-cavity search. He was then held for nearly a week in the county lockup before being transferred to a Newark correctional facility, where he was subjected to another search before being placed in the general prison population. The next day a judge freed Florence, confirming what he had insisted all along, that the fine had been paid. The state argues the ""intake search"" for new prisoners was applied fairly, and applied to everyone. ""At the time Mr. Florence was admitted into the facility, the policy and the practice were to ask him to take off his clothes, take a shower and be subject to a visual search,"" said Carter Phillips, who will argue Burlington County's side of the case before the high court. ""His allegation is that they went further than that, and that's obviously a disputed matter at this point."" The case has yet to go to trial, pending outcome of the constitutional issues now before the high court. The justices will decide whether corrections officials should have a less intrusive, ""reasonable suspicion"" standard that would prevent the kind of search currently permitted in at least 32 states, including New Jersey. ""Where the counties went wrong is, they're doing a blanket policy of strip-searching anyone that comes in that jail or the prison. So basically, your constitutional rights stop at the prison door,"" said Susan Chana Lask, Florence's New York-based attorney. ""It's a balance -- what are you brought in there for? For failing to pay a fine? Or for murder? You know, failing to pay a fine does not justify strip-searching you."" But the counties counter by saying that kind of individualized scrutiny does not work in such a controlled environment, when so many new inmates need to be initially processed. ""The basic purpose, obviously, is to avoid the risk of contraband or weapons or anything else being smuggled into the jail, and so therefore, it protects not only the guards, but also protects all of the other inmates,"" Phillips told CNN. ""The question is: Do you have a reasonable expectation of certain kinds of privacy? And it seems to me when you are being lawfully admitted into a prison facility, and he was, at that point, your expectations of privacy essentially drop to zero and the importance of maintaining security rises to about 100 percent. So the balance, it seems to me, clearly favors the prison."" Florence also points out his alleged offense, failure to pay a fine, is not considered a criminal offense in the state and would not normally result in incarceration. His family said their efforts to free Florence were thwarted by repeated bureaucratic run-arounds. State officials draw a distinction between a strip-search policy for those newly admitted and for those later entering the general prison population. Such initial searches are justified, said the state, when applied for proper reasons, including potential health threats. Federal courts since the September 11, 2001, attacks had been at odds over the constitutionality of strip searches. The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" The Supreme Court in 1979, in what is called the Bell precedent, upheld a search similar to the ones Florence had undergone for those prisoners who had contact visits with outsiders. Using a balancing test, the justices said the prison's security interest justified intrusion into the inmates' privacy. But subsequent appeals courts have found those arrested for minor offenses may not be strip-searched unless authorities have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person may be concealing a weapon or contraband such as drugs. In 2008, however, appeals courts in Atlanta and San Francisco found searches of every inmate coming into a prison population are justified, even without specific suspicions. Those opinions were the first of their kind since the 9/11 attacks and, along with Florence's case, now give the high court the chance to clarify an issue that a number of civil and human rights proponents have tried to highlight. Local jails in New Jersey at the time of Florence's arrest were subject to federal monitors after allegations that minority motorists and their passengers were being unfairly targeted for police stops and arrests. Stops of that nature are not at issue in the current appeal. Florence, who is African-American, is not alleging any racial discrimination by the state or individual officers. The case is Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, New Jersey (10-945). A ruling can be expected early next year.","Albert Florence, mistakenly arrested for an unpaid traffic fine, was strip-searched .

"(CNN) -- Four kidnapped Afghans who worked for a French aid agency have been released, the group said Tuesday. The staffers were abducted Monday in the Almar district of Faryab province in northern Afghanistan, said Adrien Tomarchio, press officer for a Paris-based non-governmental organization called the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development. Tomarchio told CNN in an e-mail Tuesday that they were freed ""unharmed."" Ahmad Jaweed Bedar, the Faryab governor's spokesman, said the Taliban kidnapped the four and took their vehicle, a Toyota Hilux Surf. Zeenat Garewal, ACTED country manager, said three of the staffers were community health trainers and one was a driver.

"(CNN) -- Bosnian Serb genocide suspect Ratko Mladic is suffering health problems, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said Tuesday. The court, however, denied media reports Mladic had collapsed, and refused to comment on reports he had pneumonia. ""Mladic was transferred to the Tribunal with a series of pre-existing medical conditions for which he is receiving treatment. The Tribunal continues to provide Mladic, as any other detainee, with the best possible medical care and attention available in The Netherlands,"" spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said in a statement. Mladic, wanted in connection with the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, Bosnia in 1995, among other crimes, was captured in May after 15 years in hiding. He is 69 and told the tribunal in June that he was ""gravely ill."" Prosecutors want to try the former general in two separate cases, they said in August -- once over the Srebrenica massacre and once for spreading terror in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and for taking UN personnel hostage. Mladic faces charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the laws and customs of war in both cases, prosecutors said in an August 17 statement. Mladic led Bosnia Serb forces in the civil war that broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina when Yugoslavia dissolved in the early 1990s. More than 200,000 Muslims and Croats died in the 1992-95 civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including nearly 8,000 slaughtered at Srebrenica -- Europe's worst massacre since World War II. Mladic has been a combative witness at the ICTY. At a July 4 appearance, Mladic refused to enter a plea, demanded new lawyers and repeatedly interrupted the judge until he was removed from the court. The case is now in pre-trial hearings.","Mladic did not collapse, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia says .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's devastating floodwaters are draining southward towards Bangkok Friday, and residents have been told to prepare for the worst when the spring high tide and a huge volume of water flowing down the Chao Phraya River merge over the next couple of days. Workers in the city are rushing to shore up barriers and warnings have been posted for the northern suburbs. ""Between seven and eight billion cubic meters of water a day is being released from the Bhumibol Dam in the north of the country, which is heavily affecting provinces like Nahkon Sawan and Ayutthaya,"" government official Wim Rungwattanajinda told CNN. ""From that, about one to 1.2 billion cubic meters of water is reaching Bangkok every day."" So far, 283 people have been killed and two people are missing in Thailand, according to the government website Thaiflood.com. Some 61 of the country's 76 provinces have so far been affected, impacting more than eight million people. More than 500,000 square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- are affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Asia's wet and wild summer explained . About 100 kilometers north of Bangkok, the UNESCO-listed historical city of Ayutthaya has now been submerged for 10 days, CNN's Paula Hancocks reports. Shops in Ayutthaya are mostly flooded and closed, and people unable to leave their homes are waiting for help to arrive. Roads have become rivers, with people having to swim or use boats to get food and water. ""Doctors are patrolling the flooded areas in small boats and are making house-calls to residents to those incapable of moving,"" Hancocks says. ""It's one of the worst hit areas in the country. Even if there are no more storms, one government estimate says it'll still take a month for the floodwaters to recede."" Flood warnings: Crocodiles, snakes and centipedes . Temples and monuments are unable to keep the rising waters at bay, and there are fears that the longer the city's treasures are covered by water, the more likely it will be that the damage could be permanent. ""This is the worst flood in our historical site in 16 years,"" said Somsuda Leeyawanich, from the Thai Fine Arts Department. She said the water level in the park is almost three meters, compared to levels of around 80-90 centimeters during the floods of 1995. ""We are very concerned that if the site is under water for more than 30 days it may cause serious damage,"" she added. ""The temples are over 400 years old."" Along with people and historical sites, animals are also are being severely affected by the floodwaters. Fifteen elephants, including seven mothers with babies and a nine-year-old known for its painting skills, are stranded on top of Ayutthaya's Royal Elephant Kraal. The elephants climbed on top of the building last week and are going hungry now that food can only be brought in small quantities via rowing boats. Elephants can swim but it's feared the babies would drown in the floodwaters if they attempt to escape. iReporter shares photos of Ayutthaya flooding . Meanwhile, the country's economy may be badly affected from the floods. Manufacturing areas just north of Bangkok have been particularly hard hit hard, including a Honda factory that has been submerged, ruining hundreds of cars. The giant Rojana Industrial Park has also halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told state-run news agency MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building. ""The Thai finance ministry says overall damage from the floods could be more than $2 billion, with the worst yet still possibly to come,"" Hancocks says.

"(CNN) -- The August downing of a Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan that killed 38 people, including 17 U.S. Navy SEALs, was caused by a rocket-propelled grenade, fired by insurgents, that struck the aircraft's aft rotor blade, the U.S. Central Command officially confirmed on Wednesday. An investigation determined that the ""operational planning and execution"" of the ill-fated August 6 mission in Wardak Province ""were consistent with previous missions, and that the forces and capabilities were appropriate given the agility required to maintain pressure on insurgent networks,"" CENTCOM said in a news release issued Wednesday. ""There was no evidence of a pre-planned ambush,"" CENTCOM said. The attack made for the the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan in the 10 years since allied forces began their campaign there. Seventy-one American troops died in August, six more than in July 2010, which previously had been the worst month for U.S. casualties.

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Joshua Komisarjevsky, the second man to be tried in connection with a deadly 2007 Connecticut home invasion, was found guilty on all counts during the second day of deliberations Thursday in a case that drew worldwide attention and sparked broader discussions about safety in the home. Komisarjevsky was convicted of 17 charges, including three counts of murder, four counts of kidnapping, and charges of burglary, arson and assault. He could receive the death penalty. On Tuesday, the jurors heard lawyers' final pleas in the case as prosecutors cast Komisarjevsky, 31, as the instigator of the attack, while the defense insisted ""he did not want anyone to die."" The trial has gone on for a little over three weeks, during which time jurors heard emotional testimony detailing the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. Steven Hayes, the first defendant to stand trial, was sentenced to death in December 2010 after a jury convicted him on 16 of 17 charges. Prosecutors had argued that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters, and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, though William Petit managed to escape. Before assaulting and killing Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said. As the verdict was read, the victims' family members wept openly. Petit called Thursday's verdict ""a relief,"" describing Komisarjevsky as ""a lying sociopathic personality."" ""I personally felt this case was a case about sexual predation,"" he said. ""There is just a huge plague of violence against women in this country."" He added that he wondered what it would have been like ""if I had two sons, instead of two daughters."" Standing sullen-faced before reporters in front of a New Haven courthouse, Petit said there are only ""occasional moments of peace."" ""It's not clear to me that time heals all wounds ... but you form some scars."" Petit also reminded reporters that the case had not reached its conclusion. ""We still have the penalty phase to go through,"" he said. The sentencing phase of the trial is set for 10 a.m. October 24.","Petit calls the verdict ""a relief,"" describing Komisarjevsky as ""a lying sociopathic personality""

"(CNN) -- A deal which would have seen English football club West Ham United move into the London 2012 Olympic Stadium collapsed on Tuesday, casting doubt over the future of the purpose-built venue. The British government announced the stadium, which is located in the Stratford area of east London and has the capacity to hold 80,000 spectators, will be kept in public ownership and rented out to a suitable tenant. ""The government and mayor of London have decided to end the current process to dispose of the Olympic stadium,"" read a statement on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's website. ""The stadium will now be retained it (sic) as a public asset, and the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) has been asked to start a new process to secure tenants for the stadium."" The latest development also secures the future of the stadium as an athletics venue, with London bidding to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships. West Ham originally won the right to move into the stadium in February, beating off competition from rival London club Tottenham Hotspur, after their bid received the unanimous backing of the OPLC. But the decision has now been reversed amid concerns that a continued legal challenge from Tottenham could cause delays which would impact negatively on the future of the stadium. Another contributing factor is the time London would need to prepare for hosting the 2017 athletics showpiece, with Qatar also bidding to stage the championships in Doha. ""The government is committed to securing a legacy from the Olympic stadium, and wants to see it re-opening in 2014,"" British sports minister Hugh Robertson said. ""The process to sell the stadium has become bogged down. ""We are acting today to end the legal paralysis that has put that legacy at risk. Ending the current sale process and looking for a leasehold solution will remove the current uncertainty and allows us to help secure the future use of the stadium with more confidence."" Despite the setback, a statement from West Ham vice -chairman Karen Brady insisted the news was positive and the club would be interested in pursuing tenancy of the site. ""We would welcome a move by OPLC and government to end that uncertainty and allow a football and athletics stadium to be in place by 2014 under a new process. ""If the speculation is true, West Ham will look to become a tenant of the stadium while Newham Council will aim to help deliver the legacy. The stadium will be the center of global attention when London becomes the first city to host the Games for a third time next year, with the opening ceremony kicking off proceedings on July 27, 2012.","West Ham United's move to the London 2012 Olympic Stadium has collapsed .

"LONDON (CNN) -- The search for missing workers in a flooded Wales coal mine ended tragically Friday as rescuers discovered the fourth and final man's body, South Wales police said. Authorities identified the men as Phillip Hill, 45, from Neath; and Charles Breslin, 62, David Powell, 50, and Garry Jenkins, 39, all from the Swansea Valley. Searchers have recovered all of the bodies, police said. Three other miners escaped Thursday after water rushed into the area where the men were working, apparently after they broke through to a neighboring abandoned mine, Rescue Officer Andrew Watson said. One of the surviving miners was hospitalized. His condition was not immediately known. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who leads the Welsh government, paid tribute to the efforts of rescue workers and families of the miners before the discovery of the fourth was announced. ""My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with all of the families as this horrifying news filters through,"" he said. ""The people of Wales, and indeed people across the world stand together in solidarity with the families through this terrible tragedy."" The British government will carry out a full investigation into the incident, Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said in a statement released Friday. As of June 2011, 1,500 people in Wales worked in the mining industry. according to government figures. In a drift mine like the one where the men were trapped, coal is excavated from the side of a hill using shafts that are almost horizontal.

"New York (CNN) -- What happens when you give thousand of cans of food to really creative people? How about a ""canned"" tornado or an ""uncanny"" sculpture of an apple being eaten by ants. Swarms of people are being delighted by the construction work in New York's World Financial Center during the city's  18th Annual CANstruction Competition. On display are 25 sculptures created from more than 100,000 cans of food -- designed and built by architects and engineers. Mia Tsiamis, a structural engineer from the firm ARUP, has been her team's captain for five years. Their entry ""Cangsta's Paradise"" took three months to design and 10 hours to build. ""The whole process is a lesson in project management. It's certainly a challenge squeezing it in with the rest of our daily work,"" said Tsiamis. New York is one of about 100 cities around the world taking part in the international charity competition known as CANstruction that is aimed at helping the hungry. Rules allow each team five people to work on their entry. The cans cannot be bound with glue or adhesives and designers are not allowed to color the cans -- so there is endless time donated to finding the tuna or bean cans with the properly colored labels for the particular design. Among the entries were an enormous Mr. Potato Head, the original Battleship board game, King Kong, Russian Babushka dolls and the Metropolitan Transit Authority designed a train. ""With some of the sculptures, you have to stand way back to see what has been created,"" said Daniel Garwood, a volunteer with American Institute of Architects, one of the presenters of the competition. A representation of Mario and Luigi of the ""Mario Brothers"" video games is one of those objects better seen from afar. Children were especially excited to see the exhibits, snapping pictures and staring in awe. Second- and third-graders of The Mustard Seed School in Hoboken, New Jersey, visited the site on a field trip. ""This year we are teaching them about buildings, foundations and service projects so this is the perfect combination!"" said art teacher Lynn Hamill. The youngsters were running around the larger-than-life canned art feverishly trying to complete an assignment. Jennifer Groce, a parent chaperone for the school, was trying to focus the kids'  excitement. ""They have to sketch the different projects and write down how many cans each structure is made of and how many New Yorkers will it feed,"" Groce said. The children picked favorites but  their top choices changed each time they saw the next structure down the line. ""I love Mario,"" one student said. ""Oh and this one too!"" He was pointing at another one. Celebrity chef and cookbook author Rocco Dispirito and host of Bravo's TV show ""Top Chef: Just Desserts"" Gail Simmons are among this year's judges who selected the winning sculptures. CANstruction is designed to raise hunger awareness during the Thanksgiving season. All of the cans used in the contest will be donated to City Harvest for distribution to programs that feed impoverished New Yorkers. Co-Presented by the American Institute of Architects, the Society for Design Administration and Arts World Financial Center, Canstruction is on display until November 22.","Cans of food turn into  Mr. Potato Head, King Kong, a ""Tomato Tornado""

"(CNN) -- South Korean pop star Rain, who stars in ""Ninja Assassin,"" releasing nationwide on Wednesday, has all the trimmings of an international superstar in the making. His talent, good looks and charming swagger have captured the devotion of the Asian continent, where tickets to his concerts evaporate in minutes. He was hailed as one of People magazine's most beautiful two years ago, and, despite being relatively unknown to most Americans, beat Stephen Colbert in a Time magazine online poll of most influential people in 2007. Yet Rain's climb from unknown backup dancer to a member of Asia's A-list wasn't easy: His lack of Western features caused many music labels to look right past him and getting his footing in the United States has been particularly difficult. Despite having six albums under his belt and selling out a two-day Madison Square Garden tour in 2006, Rain's ""Justin Timberlake meets Usher"" brand of bubble-gum pop never saturated pop charts here as it did in the East. But Rain isn't one to accept defeat. ""The more criticism I get, the more it gives me a stronger urge to win. So I try harder,"" he told CNN's Talk Asia. ""The more times I was turned down, the more I believed I was getting closer to making it. A lot of people in Korea say that failure is the mother of success, so I believed that more times I failed, the more likely I was to succeed,"" he said. The 27-year-old tested Hollywood waters with last year's ""Speed Racer,"" but the action film, which he now calls a ""warming up period,"" failed to give him cross-over recognition. Now, Rain has a second shot at swimming in the American mainstream with another Wachowski produced film, the cut 'em and gut 'em ""Ninja Assassin,"" where the pop star does most of his own stunts. ""I put my heart and soul into this movie,"" he said. Rain trained hard for months to get ready for the movie's slick violence. ""For about a year, I couldn't eat properly, I was working out from 7 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon,"" he said. ""I went through a lot of pain in my efforts to get 100 percent close to the character that I was playing."" To get the opportunity to finally become an American household name, though, it's worth it. After all, Rain isn't the type of guy who shies away from a challenge. ""What I want to do now is start from the bottom again and build up a name in the U.S.,"" Rain said. ""I experienced firsthand what it means to be poor, what it means to go hungry, and that I think may be the reason, the root cause of why I'm able to work so hard even these days,"" he said. ""I'm hoping people expect a lot from this movie, because I think they will not be disappointed.""","Korean singer Rain is a huge hit in Asia, but has struggled to find large success in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Verizon Wireless is releasing the third smartphone to take advantage of its faster fourth-generation data network on Thursday. Like the others, the Revolution from LG Electronics runs Android and has a large 4.3-inch touch screen. It also has a pair of cameras and a mobile hot spot feature, allowing users to share the fast data connection with eight devices connected via Wi-Fi. The Revolution will cost $250. That's the same price as HTC's ThunderBolt, which was the first 4G phone on Verizon, and $50 less than the Droid Charge from Samsung Electronics, which also came out this month. For a conference in February, a prototype version of the new LG phone was picked to demonstrate an Internet calling service from Verizon that is expected to debut next year. Last week, Verizon added nine new towns to its 4G map and expanded coverage in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, New Orleans and Philadelphia. The network, which offers faster download speeds, is available in 55 metropolitan areas, the company said. Verizon began rolling out the service in December. AT&T Mobility named launch cities for its upcoming 4G LTE on Wednesday. The new 4G network, not to be confused with the old 4G network that's basically a faster version of 3G, will debut in the summer, AT&T said. Traditionally, several months separate the commercial launch of new cell network infrastructure and the release of phones that use it. But AT&T said in January that LTE phones would launch sometime in the second half of the year. In the meantime, Verizon will continue to take advantage of its lead. Also in January, Verizon pledged to launch four 4G phones by midyear, but it may miss that target. Motorola Mobility has said it will delay the release of the Droid Bionic until the summer in order to add features.","Verizon Wireless will debut the Revolution from LG Electronics on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Investigators are leaning in the direction that the same person or persons who crafted the Christmas Day underwear bomb were behind the PETN-based devices hidden in packages sent from Yemen, a U.S. government official told CNN. ""The thinking is it's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb because of the way it's put together,"" said the official, who had been briefed by multiple U.S. authorities and law enforcement sources. ""But this one is about four times as powerful."" American authorities are now endorsing British Prime Minister David Cameron's position that the explosives were designed to take down an airplane, the official said. One package was found in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The other was discovered at an airport in England. On Friday, U.S. officials said they had not taken a position on whether planes or two Chicago, Illinois, synagogues were the ultimate targets. The packages had the synagogue addresses. Meanwhile, a woman believed to be connected to a plot to send explosive packages bound for the United States has been arrested in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, according to a Yemeni government official and a reporter with the state news agency. A female relative of the woman was also being questioned by Yemeni authorities, the government official said. The relationship between the two women was not immediately known. Authorities are looking at a specific material found in the devices and used in the foiled ""underwear bomb"" attempt in 2009. A source close to the investigation said the type of material found in the devices was PETN, a highly explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Six grams of PETN are enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft. PETN was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. AbdulMutallab is alleged to have been carrying 80 grams of PETN in that botched attack. ""The quantity of PETN in these [new] devices was about five times the volume used at Christmas"" by AbdulMutallab, Col. Richard Kemp, the former chairman of the British government's Cobra Intelligence Group, told CNN affiliate ITN. The plot ""does appear to be a typical al Qaeda-type operation,"" he said. A source closely involved in the investigation said the detonating substance was Lead Azide. Lead Azide is a ""very powerful initiator"" which is easily prepared and is a standard substance in detonations, the source said. Believing that a Yemen affiliate of al Qaeda was involved, American and British authorities said explosive devices jammed into ink toner cartridges were powerful enough to bring down a large aircraft. British authorities said they believe East Midlands Airport in central England was simply a conduit for shipment of one device to the United States. ""We believe that the device was designed to go off on the airplane,"" Cameron said. ""We cannot be sure about the timing when that was meant to take place. There is no early evidence that that was meant to take place over British soil, but of course we cannot rule it out."" UK Home Secretary Theresa May said authorities do not believe the perpetrators would have known the location of the device had they detonated it. As they studied the devices and toiled to understand the extent of the plot, authorities pointed their fingers at al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The group is based in Yemen, a poor Arab nation that has emerged as a major operating base for al Qaeda and other terror groups. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told CNN on Saturday that the plan to send the explosives has the ""hallmarks of al Qaeda, the AQAP -- they are constantly trying things to test our system."" Yemen has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups, but the country, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, is still used for operations, U.S. officials say. The failed ""Christmas Day Bomber"" plot, for example, is believed to be the workings of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And in January, the United States and United Kingdom temporarily closed their embassies in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, because of terror concerns. U.S. authorities were grateful for a tip from Yemen's oil-rich neighbor, Saudi Arabia, alerting them to the suspicious packages. The Saudi government provided U.S. officials with tracking numbers of the two packages, enabling quick tracing to the United Kingdom and Dubai, a source told CNN. President Barack Obama called King Abdullah on Saturday to thank him, the White House said. On Friday, Obama confirmed the two devices contained explosive material and were bound for two ""places of Jewish worship"" in Chicago, Illinois. ""We ... know that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ... continues to plan attacks against our homeland, our citizens, and our friends and allies,"" Obama said during a press briefing. Obama's presidential counterterrorism advisor, John Brennan, spoke to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh, stressing ""the importance of close counterterrorism cooperation, including the need to work together on the ongoing investigation into the events over the past few days,"" according to the White House. Saleh told reporters that Yemen could not confirm the packages contained explosives, but he acknowledged the nation's economy and tourism industry have suffered because of al Qaeda's presence. He vowed to fight the terror group. ""We do want anyone to interfere in Yemeni affairs and start chasing al Qaeda,"" Saleh said. ""We will chase al Qaeda with our airplanes and our equipment. We will chase al Qaeda wherever they are."" Over the past several months, Yemen, which wants to be seen as a committed partner in the fight against terrorism, has asked for assistance from other countries. Saleh's appearance before reporters a day after Friday's developments is considered significant. Authorities, meanwhile, said the explosive devices were meticulously crafted. They were ""professionally"" loaded and connected using an electric circuit to a mobile phone chip tucked in a printer, Dubai police told WAM, the official news agency for the United Arab Emirates. The devices were packed in toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The package found at East Midlands Airport contained a ""manipulated"" toner cartridge and had white powder on it as well as wires and a circuit board, a law enforcement source said Friday. A similar package set to be shipped on a FedEx cargo plane was discovered in Dubai, officials there said. When the Saudis warned Britsh law enforcement that there were explosives inside the cartridge at East Midlands, the British -- using human and canines -- could not detect the material, according to a U.S. law enforcement official familiar with investigation. The British authorities contacted the Saudis to verify the tip, the official said. The Saudis told them to inspect the cartridge again, and that is when the British authorities discovered the material, the official said. In response to the threat, authorities stepped up searches Friday of cargo planes and trucks in several U.S. cities, said law enforcement sources with detailed knowledge of the investigation. Also Friday, the Transportation Security Administration stopped all packages originating from Yemen, and shipping companies UPS, FedEx and DHL all said they were complying with the order. May said Saturday that all cargo into or through the United Kingdom originating in Yemen was halted as well. The U.S. Postal Service also announced a temporary suspension of acceptance of inbound international mail originating in Yemen. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, a ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that authorities believe ""the current threat has been contained. They're not expecting to find anything else."" Officials are checking on packages sent from Yemen over the past several weeks, King said. As authorities pressed forward in the investigation Saturday and strengthened security, a leader of a small LGBT-friendly synagogue in Chicago, Illinois, said her place of worship was one of the targets of the intercepted packages. ""It was unnerving, but we carried on as normal,"" Lilli Kornblum, co-president of Or Chadash, said of Friday night's services. The FBI in Chicago would not confirm whether Or Chadash was targeted, spokesman Royden Rice said. ""We notified both targets yesterday,"" Rice told CNN Saturday. ""We always notify potential victims of crime. If they wish to reveal who they are, it's up to them."" CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Mohammed Jamjoom, Susan Candiotti, Kathleen Johnston and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigators see link between devices, underwear bomb .

"Manzanillo, Mexico (CNN) -- The storm recently known as Jova has dissipated over western Mexico, but its rains and flooding were responsible for at least six deaths, officials said. In the Mexican state of Colima, one person was swept away in a car by rushing water on the highway, state civil protection spokesman Luis Enrique Venegas told CNN. Three others in Colima were reported missing, he said. ""The main problem for us is damage to roads, bridges and streets. Infrastructure was severely affected by this hurricane and it's going to take a while to get back to normal,"" he said ""We're trying to reopen roads as soon as possible."" Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane late Tuesday, packing winds of more than 100 miles per hour. It weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved over western Mexico Wednesday. In Jalisco state, civil protection authorities said that they found a body after a mudslide, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. A total of five people have died in Jalisco, the agency reported. The bodies were found as the focus Thursday shifted to cleanup along Mexico's Pacific coast, while the floodwaters from Jova recede. Some residents took to rooftops in the resort town of Manzanillo, one of the hardest-hit areas, as a normally small stream turned into a raging river. Water was waist-deep in some areas on Wednesday. At least 1,400 people were in shelters, police said. ""The roads are all flooded. Bridges are about to fall down. Cars can't get through anywhere. People's homes are destroyed,"" Manzanillo resident Seth Berkowitz said. ""What came through here has really been a terrible disaster for everybody."" Floodwaters rushed into many homes in low-lying areas of Manzanillo. Resident Roberto Robles lost most of his furniture and spent Wednesday dealing with massive amounts of mud inside his home. ""We were really afraid, especially for the children, who still don't understand what a hurricane is,"" he said. Javier Velasquez said mud ruined his refrigerator when his kitchen filled with water in the early morning hours. ""Only God knows why something like this happens,"" he said. ""They had warned us, but we thought they were crying wolf.""","NEW: In the aftermath of Jova, six deaths are reported .

"(CNN) -- Costa Rican President Oscar Arias presented an updated proposal to end the Honduran political crisis, but its adoption seemed unlikely, as one side described the talks as ""failed"" and the other asked for more time. Honduras' ousted President Manuel Zelaya answers questions in Managua, Nicaragua, on Sunday. The document, dubbed the San Jose Accord, calls for ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya's return to power, the creation of a unity government and early elections. The accord is very similar to an original plan suggested by Arias but with more details and a creation of a truth commission to investigate the events that led to the crisis. It also includes a timeline for its implementation, which could have Zelaya back in Honduras by Friday. Arias signaled that his latest effort as mediator after two unsuccessful rounds of talks was also his final. Zelaya and his successor, interim Honduran President Roberto Micheletti, can turn to other forms for negotiations if they cannot agree to the deal, Arias said. Arias read the proposal on Wednesday at a news conference in San Jose, Costa Rica, flanked by Zelaya and Micheletti's delegations. Responses from the two camps following Arias announcement gave slim hope that the accord would be signed. Zelaya delegate Rixi Moncada said the opportunity for compromise had already passed with Arias' original proposal, which Zelaya accepted but Micheletti rejected.  Watch the reaction of the Organization of American States » . ""(The talks) failed because of the intransigence of the coup regime,"" she said. For Micheletti's side, Mauricio Villegas said his camp would present the San Jose Accord to the three branches of government for their approval, which would be necessary before moving forward. Earlier this week, another Micheletti negotiator said that the supreme court had already signaled that it would not accept Zelaya's return as president. ""We must make way for peace and democracy, because the alternative is a cliff where even bigger trouble than we know awaits,"" said Arias, who had been serving as mediator between the two sides. ""So today I ask you respectfully, but with urgency, to carefully review this document and reflect on it."" Earlier, Micheletti had offered a counterproposal, Honduras's foreign minister, Carlos Lopez Contreras, told CNN affiliate Televicentro. Sources close to Micheletti's delegation told CNN that the counterproposal would have given amnesty to Zelaya and allowed him to return. But the nation's Supreme Court, which supports the coup and insists Zelaya must be held responsible for allegedly trying to subvert the constitution, rejected the amnesty provision, the sources said. Negotiations had stalled over Arias' proposal that Zelaya be reinstated. Zelaya was going to hold a referendum that could have led to changing the Honduras Constitution, even though Congress had outlawed the vote and the Supreme Court ruled it illegal. Zelaya was deposed June 28, the day the vote was supposed to be held, in a military-led coup and replaced by congressional leader Micheletti a few hours later. Micheletti's counterproposal would have instituted a six-month moratorium on legal action against either side. In another development, Honduras gave Venezuela's diplomats 72 hours to leave the country Tuesday on the grounds that leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has been making threats against the provisional government. Venezuela called the expulsion order ""absurd"" and said it will not comply because it does not recognize Micheletti's government. Chavez and Zelaya are political allies. The coup has drawn international condemnation, including demands by the U.N. General Assembly and Organization of American States that Zelaya be reinstated. The European Union and United States also have curtailed some aid. Micheletti has steadfastly refused, saying Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup.","NEW: Chance for compromise passed with Arias' original plan, Zelaya side says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama pledged Monday to cut the nation's $1.3 trillion deficit in half by the end of his first term. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, speaks after Obama called on him at the fiscal summit's closing session. He identified exploding health-care costs as the chief culprit behind rising federal deficits during a bipartisan ""fiscal responsibility summit"" convened to discuss ways to restore fiscal stability without deepening the recession. Meeting with the congressional leadership of both parties, as well as a range of business, academic, financial and labor leaders, Obama warned that the country cannot continue its current rate of deficit spending without facing dire economic consequences. ""I refuse to leave our children with a debt they cannot repay,"" he said in remarks opening the one-day summit at the White House. ""We cannot and will not sustain deficits like these without end. ... We cannot simply spend as we please.""  Watch more about the summit and the deficit » . The country, Obama argued, is already starting to face the consequences of greater deficit spending, noting that roughly one in 10 taxpayer dollars in 2008 went toward paying $250 billion in interest on the national debt. The president pledged to take the first step toward fiscal responsibility by, among other things, ending ""accounting tricks"" such as refusing to include money for expenses such as the Iraq war or natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in the regular budget. Such practices, Obama argued, only serve to mask the real size of the deficit. He also pledged to end no-bid contracts in Iraq, root out waste and abuse in entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, require every Cabinet member to scrub department budgets ""line by line,"" and reinstate a ""pay as you go"" rule from the 1990s. ""This is the rule that families across this country follow every single day, and there's no reason their government shouldn't do the same,"" he said. ""You don't pay what you don't have."" But the biggest challenge, he said, would be controlling spiraling health-care costs -- ""the single most pressing fiscal challenge we face by far."" The projected increase in the deficit is largely due to anticipated growth in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which in turn is driven by rising health-care costs, budget analyst Bob Greenstein noted shortly before Obama spoke. Greenstein minimized the effect of the $787 billion economic stimulus plan on the budget shortfall, saying that it amounts to only one-tenth of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Obama later added that, without a stimulus package, the recession would deepen, tax revenues would decline and long-term deficit projections would ultimately be worse. ""I have no interest in making government bigger for the sake of it,"" he said. But if health care is not reformed, Greenstein warned, the national debt could soar to 300 percent of the gross domestic product by 2050. ""We are [currently] on the path to the very debt explosion we must avoid,"" he declared. ""Health care is the key"" to getting the nation off an unsustainable fiscal course, added Peter Orszag, head of the Office of Management and Budget. After Obama's remarks Monday, the fiscal responsibility summit participants separated into small working groups to discuss the specific fiscal challenges facing the country, including taxes, health care, Social Security and the budget process. The administration is planning to issue a final ""fiscal sustainability project"" list of recommendations based on the conclusions of those working groups in 30 days. After the working groups met, Obama stood at a podium and called on participants to share what the groups had discussed. Sen. John McCain, Obama's Republican opponent in November's presidential election, told Obama that a proposal to order new helicopters to transport the president was a prime example of government waste. The price tag for a proposed new fleet of 28 Marine One helicopters has virtually doubled to more than $11 billion over the past six years. Each helicopter in the fleet, which would have several security upgrades, would reportedly cost around $400 million. McCain's group at the summit had discussed procurement. Obama said he has asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to review the helicopter proposal. ""The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me,"" a smiling Obama said, drawing laughter from the audience. Rep. Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, told Obama that if he is interested in bipartisanship, then he should encourage House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to ""have a true, open process"" in crafting legislation. The stimulus bill passed this month with no GOP votes in the House and only three in the Senate. ""I think the House Republicans have shown that, when we're not included in the decision-making, we're disinclined to sign off on the solution,"" Barton said. Obama's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night is expected to be dominated by economic and budgetary issues. The president is slated to officially unveil his fiscal year 2010 budget Thursday. Obama intends to cut the federal deficit in half primarily by spending less on the war in Iraq, raising taxes on those who make more than $250,000 a year and streamlining government, an administration official told CNN Saturday. The president's budget proposal will project that the estimated $1.3 trillion deficit inherited from the Bush administration will be halved to $533 billion by 2013, or from 9.2 percent of the gross domestic product to 3 percent, the official said. Obama's plans to cut the deficit might be complicated by the continuing economic downturn, which threatens to reduce tax revenues. A group of leading economists is now forecasting a far deeper and more painful recession ahead in the first half of the year, with a solid recovery not taking hold until 2010. The economy is likely to decline at a 5 percent rate in the first quarter, even sharper than the 3.8 percent drop recorded in the fourth quarter of last year, according to a survey of 47 top forecasters from the National Association for Business Economics. And according to estimates by economists Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley and William Gale of the Brookings Institution, the deficit -- largely because of the recession and the new economic stimulus effort -- will average at least $1 trillion per year for the next 10 years, even if the stimulus is limited to two years and the jobs picture improves dramatically.

"Washington (CNN) -- A famous French painting stolen during World War I by the German Army was returned to the government of France by U.S. officials on Thursday. The 1876 Jules Breton work is called ""A Fisherman's Daughter/Mender of Nets"" or to the people of France it's ""Une Fille de Pecheur/Raccommodeuses de Filets."" In 1918 the German army confiscated that painting and others from the Musee de Douai in the city of Douai and transported them to Belgium. The following year the Belgium government went to return all the French works of art, but the ""Fisherman's Daughter/Mender of Nets"" was missing. Spring forward to 2010 and French officials alerted Interpol that the painting might have been imported by a gallery in New York City. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators worked the case, concluded the painting in New York was the same one stolen from France more than 90 years ago and seized it. The painting, which is worth an estimated $150,000 dollars, was handed over to the French ambassador to the United States during a repatriation ceremony in Washington. ICE did not provide details about how the painting reached the gallery in New York or where it might have been in the decades since it was stolen. ""Returning a painting to a museum is a significant contribution to the celebration of our cultural heritage and a gift to all future visitors who will enjoy the work of art, but it is also yet another symbol of Franco-American cooperation,"" said French Ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre in a written statement. ""We are celebrating today a gesture of friendship by the United States toward the French Republic."" The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York worked on the case. ""One of the very few ways that we are able to redress the awful legacy of war is to return stolen art to its rightful owners so it can be shared and enjoyed, ""said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. ""In this case, it took nearly a century, but it is nonetheless extremely gratifying. ICE does numerous investigations into stolen art or cultural artifacts and has helped repatriate many other items to various nations. ""We remain committed to combating cultural heritage crimes, which are one of the oldest forms of organized cross-border illicit activity,"" said ICE Director John Morton.","The work by Jules Breton was stolen during World War I .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Nearly 27 years ago, amid a crowd of people in Central Park, Ruth Bendik's wallet was stolen. The culprit is still at large, but the wallet has been found -- in the hollow trunk of a cherry tree. Nearly 27 years ago, amid a crowd of people in Central Park, Ruth Bendik's wallet was stolen. The wallet was snatched on October 24, 1982, while Bendik, now 69, was in Central Park watching the New York marathon. She went to greet runners at the end of the race and, ""when I got out of the crush of people, I realized my purse was much lighter,"" Bendik told CNN. ""I was just so grateful not to have been harmed."" Last week, Josh Galiley, tree-care supervisor for the Central Park Conservancy, was chopping down a hazardous black cherry tree near Rumsey Playfield when he discovered her blue leather wallet in the trunk of the tree, which he estimates is around 65 years old and 50 feet high. ""I started poking in the soft stuff and this wallet turned up. Having been that low in the tree ... the location indicated it had been there for quite some time,"" Galiley told CNN. The old wallet was a unique find, he said. ""When you're cutting a tree and it's hollow, you expect stuff inside, shreds of material, old marbles, really just knickknacks compared to this,"" he said, ""Nothing with a story. ... We peeked in and there were dates from the early '80s. We figured this was different."" After the wallet was recovered, Galiley said, officials were careful to inform Bendik properly. ""We thought she may not want to relive it,"" he said. Bendik sang praises for the individuals who returned her wallet, including detective Frank Irizarry, who helped track her down. ""The lengths they went to find me, the extent that they went through and the fact that they were concerned about my feelings really impressed me,"" she said. The wallet still contained her old driver's license and credit cards, she said, although $20 was missing. ""Twenty dollars was a lot of money then,"" she said. After two decades, much more has changed. Referring to two of her old bank cards from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank and Banker's Trust, Bendik said, ""I was shocked that both banks had closed."" But some things haven't changed. Bendik continues to have fond memories of Central Park. The Ohio native, who has lived in New York for 40 years, still describes the park as one of her favorite areas in the city. ""It's a public place in an impersonal city,"" she said, ""It brings everyone together in a pleasant way of reconnecting with nature and beauty."" Today, Bendik smiles at the idea of her wallet buried in a cherry tree in Central Park for nearly 30 years, and she's happy to have it in her hands again. ""After all these years it's still available as a time capsule of my life.""","Ruth Bendik's wallet was snatched in 1982 during the New York marathon .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Apple chief executive Steve Jobs' announcement today at the Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple's new iCloud service will allow music fans to reproduce their entire digital collections on locker-style servers accessible via 10 devices -- including iPhones, iPads and computers -- may not save the ravaged record industry, but it could provide a crucial new revenue stream while allowing consumers to easily consolidate their music libraries in the cloud. ""Keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy,"" Jobs said in his keynote speech today at the WWDC in San Francisco today. ""We have a great solution for this problem. We are going to demote the PC to just be a device. We are going to move the digital hub, the center of your digital life, into the cloud."" Rumored for weeks, iCloud will be free for up to 5 gigabytes of music downloaded via iTunes, Jobs announced. The service will scan and match users' current music collections for music carried by the iTunes store, and then make it available to all of the users' devices by sending the songs' metadata to the cloud. The new iTunes iMatch service will cost $25 a year, with unlimited storage, for users to copy digital music ripped from CDs or downloaded illegally. (The free version is available immediately, while iMatch will roll out in coming months, most likely with a new version of Apple's operating system in the fall.) The service will also allow storage of movies, photos and other data files, replacing Apple's MobileMe, in an attempt to shift consumers from physical hard-drive to Web-based storage. Choose Rolling Stone's Cover: The Sheepdogs vs. Lelia Broussard. Vote Now . ""It is one way to make someone pay for music they've already bought. It's pretty ingenious,"" Syd Schwartz, a former EMI Music executive who is now a consultant to artist managers and record labels, tells Rolling Stone. ""I'm sure someone in an executive office at a major label somewhere is going, 'At least that's one way we can monetize the stuff people stole from Napster over the years.' "" Apple isn't the first to provide such a service -- Amazon unveiled its Cloud Drive in late March, and Google jumped into the market with Music Beta a month ago. (Also, in the late 1990s, MP3.com created a very similar service, Beam-It, but since the company had no licenses with major labels, Universal Music successfully branded it illegal piracy and sued, putting the service out of business.) But, in a swipe at his competitors, Jobs declared Apple's iCloud to be significantly faster than Amazon and Google's services. ""It certainly appears like it's going to be a better experience,"" Schwartz says. ""The Amazon and Google services were an attempt to bring them to market quickly."" And more important, unlike competitors Google and Amazon, Apple has licensing deals with record labels to use their vast song catalogs by artists from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin to Lady Gaga in the new service. As the world's biggest music retailer, with longstanding label deals for iTunes, Apple had the clout to make these deals where Amazon, Google and Spotify could not. The deals allow Apple to scan a user's hard drive and make copies of the songs in the cloud, rather than forcing users into the cumbersome process of uploading their collections. ""You don't have to store individual copies of every track. Which Amazon and Google do,"" says a source at a major label. ""And they have to pay for storage costs. ... Scan-and-match is a big advantage of a licensed locker."" Apple entered the music business in 2002, when it made digital-music deals with major record labels still shell-shocked from Napster and online piracy. In so doing, the computer company almost singlehandedly transformed the record business' longstanding sales model from selling $15 to $18 CDs to far less profitable 99-cent digital tracks. Apple did not give music companies a cut of the iPod, iPhone or other devices, however, and record executives have loudly complained as Apple's shares have skyrocketed during the same period labels have laid off staff, cut artist rosters and in the case of once-powerful EMI, flirted with bankruptcy. Britney Spears' Life in Photos: Her Rise, Fall and Comeback . Labels have struggled in the past several years to find new revenue streams, and numerous top executives point to music subscriptions as a powerful new business model based on monthly fees. However, existing subscription services such as Rhapsody and MOG have yet to gain a foothold in the U.S. music market, and American labels have yet to make deals with Spotify, the free service that has been popular in Europe the last three years. Also, in the past, Jobs has been critical of the subscription model, although he seemed to change his position in late 2009, when Apple bought the growing subscription company Lala. For iCloud, Apple will give the four major labels almost 60 percent of future profits, as well as roughly 12 percent to music publishers, according to music-business sources. (One source at another major label says Apple will determine future percentages based on labels' sales -- and that labels will then give profit shares to their artists based on the artists' sales.) Many in the music business predict Apple will use iCloud as a gateway to a broader subscription service, perhaps in the next few months, although Jobs did not address this point in his speech. ""It's a good start,"" says another music-business source. ""If everyone in America who consumed music paid $25 to put their music in a cloud and then [iCloud] turns into a subscription-based music service -- doesn't sound bad to me. Those economics would work well for everyone."" Copyright © 2010 Rolling Stone.","The new iTunes iMatch service will cost $25 a year, with unlimited storage .

"(CNN) -- Nearly six months after an explosion aboard an oil rig sent crude spewing from a BP-owned well deep below the Gulf of Mexico, cleanup work along the Gulf Coast is far from over. Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, federal on-scene coordinator for the Deepwater Horizon spill, said Wednesday that operations in some areas won't stop once winter hits. ""I envision there will be some areas where cleanup will go on through winter, although there will be others that will close down within a matter of weeks,"" Zukunft said. Shoreline cleanup assessment teams still have yet to analyze 557 miles of oil-affected beaches and declare them clean. In the meantime, Zukunft said, oil spill response teams will be in place to clean up any residual oil as necessary. ""What we have during this spill, this was 87 consecutive days of a major spill, reoccurring, day in and day out. During that phase, we were in a crisis. Now [crews are] along the traditional lines, dealing with last release of oil and whether that impacted, time-consuming, labor-intensive process,"" he said. Seafood testing continues to be a priority, according to Zukunft. Christine Patrick, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service, said out of more than 2,700 seafood samples that went through rigorous sensory and chemical testing, none have come up positive for the presence of oil or dispersants. ""No samples have been taken from opened fishing areas that haven't passed those tests,"" Patrick said. As for the search for existing oil still within the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA scientist Sam Walker said Wednesday there is an ""aggressive program"" of work being conducted both offshore, near-shore and within the water to locate hydrocarbons. Walker said more than 31,000 samples have been tested and are in the process of being analyzed for evidence of dispersants or oil contamination, and that the results should be released in the next few weeks. Although it's been nearly three months since oil has last been released into the Gulf, Zukunft said the effects of the disaster remain substantial. ""If you look at what a traditional oil spill has been, you know this is anything but that,"" he said. ""What's different about this is now we have oil that's in a very deep water column."" Zukunft said even though the highest concentrations of oil detected in the water column is in the parts per billion, the Gulf of Mexico seafood industry is suffering from an unfair stigma attached to its product. ""As I've said, and will continue to say time and again, it is the most sampled seafood anywhere on the face of the Earth,"" the rear admiral said. ""The science, and I've seen it on a first-hand basis, is thorough, it's comprehensive, and so those are some of the hardships that the Gulf of Mexico residents are trying to recover from right now, especially those who make their livelihood harvesting seafood, and then dealing with the image of that.""","Federal officials say work will continue through the winter in some Gulf areas .

"(CNN) -- A Jordanian official ordered an investigation Saturday to look into police officers' attacks on pro-reform demonstrators in Amman, state-run media reported. Riot police punched, kicked and beat protesters with sticks Friday on the streets of Amman, according to CNN reporters on the scene. Several journalists were among those caught up in the violence, in some instances attacked by police. Police Capt. Mahmoud El-Khatib initially said that authorities only used ""appropriate force"" to prevent even worse bloodshed among what he called two groups of protesters -- one backing the government, the other calling for reform. But witnesses said there were no such rival groups, blaming police using batons and other means to beat back protesters. Lt. Gen. Hussein Majali, the head of Jordan's public security department, on Saturday described the incident as a ""police attack on a pro-reform march in Amman,"" according to the Petra news agency. This same report said the demonstration was organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and youth groups, which is distinct from its account the previous day. Majali called for the creation of a panel of ""senior officers"" to investigate, a probe that began Friday night. This investigation, which will use ""video material available to the committee,"" is expected to be done within 72 hours, followed by possible criminal trials. Already, four policemen have been detained as suspects for their involvement in the violence, according to Petra, which was citing a statement from the Middle Eastern nation's public security department. While there have been demonstrations in Jordan, as elsewhere in the Arab world, they have been largely peaceful and few have called for the ouster of its ruler, King Abdullah II. Still, the violence Friday was at times stark. One man lay on the ground, covered with blood-soaked tissues after a witness said he was hit in the head. Another man had a big gash on his arm. A woman, part of a group of 20 huddled together, said she felt shaky after being knocked in the head. The state-run news report did not offer a casualty count, beyond claiming that 17 police officers were injured in the clashes. There were ""light to medium injuries to a number of journalists,"" Petra reported. Mohammed Hanoun, a photographer, said he was attacked by police -- arguing with an official press liaison, who denied the media was being targeted. ""This is the moment I was hit,"" said Hanoun, showing a picture. ""Do you see it? This is the last picture I took; he hit me with the shield."" Journalists typically wear orange vests in Jordan so they can be identified from protesters or police. Many media members took off their orange vests in solidarity with attacked journalists on Friday. Salman Al Masaed, who was in the front row of the pro-reform demonstration, said he had no doubt that it was police -- and not rival protesters -- waging the offensive. ""We did not see a single person attack us,"" he said. ""The only people that attacked us were the security forces, with their batons.""","A Jordanian official promises to probe ""a police attack on a pro-reform march""

"London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will discuss BP, whose leaking well has caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history, when he speaks by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama this weekend, Cameron's office at Downing Street said Friday. It will be a ""routine call"" and BP will be one of several issues they discuss, Downing Street said, without providing more information. The phone call follows concern about anti-British rhetoric from Obama and others in America about BP's role in the disaster. London Mayor Boris Johnson said the remarks are ""slightly worrying"" and Piers Morgan, a British TV host and former newspaper editor, said Obama seems to be on ""an absolute witch hunt"" against the BP boss. ""You know, accidents do happen,"" Morgan told CNN's ""Connect the World"" on Thursday night. ""There are major issues in terms of safety here, in terms of environmental tragedy that's going on where this spillage is occurring, but I think simply to demand the guy's head on a plate when he's trying to fix it is not sensible politics, and it's slightly self-serving. ""And I, if I was Barack Obama, would cool the rhetoric. I wouldn't make it a British thing, because BP is not a British company anymore, they are an international company. And it's looking to me a little like Brit-bashing."" Johnson told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday he wants to see ""cool heads and a bit of calm reflection"" about the problem, ""rather than endlessly buck-passing and name-calling."" He said many British pension funds are exposed to BP and could be at risk if the company's share price plummets. ""I do think that it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great British company is being continually beaten up on the international airwaves,"" he said, adding that the disaster is the result of an accident that BP is trying to remedy. ""Ultimately (BP) cannot be faulted because, I'm sorry, it was an accident that took place, and BP, I think, is paying a very, very heavy price indeed."" Obama said earlier this week that he was talking with experts about the oil disaster so ""I know whose ass to kick."" U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said BP was probably lying in its comments about the spill. ""Here's a viewer's guide to BP media briefings: Whenever you hear someone with a British accent talking about this on behalf of British Petroleum, they are not telling you the truth,"" Weiner told MSNBC this week. ""I think we as a government have been giving them too much credence for the things they've been saying,"" Weiner said. ""Just about everything they've said at some point has turned out to be wrong. So every time they say they're doing something, your first instinct should be, it just ain't true."" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley denied Thursday that Obama or the United States is ""Britain-bashing"" and said it would probably be a topic the president discusses with Cameron on the phone. He said there are certain to be ""ripple effects"" as America demands that BP live up to its responsibilities to clean up the spill. ""The British people understand the frustration and anger that the American people are seeing in this,"" Crowley said. ""It is not going to affect our relationship between the United States and Britain."" Crowley said the United States understands ""the importance that BP has within British society and the British economy ... but this is ultimately about a private company and its responsibility in light of what's happened in the Gulf.""","Cameron, Obama to discuss BP in phone call this weekend .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Two Gadhafi loyalists and one National Transitional Council fighter were killed Friday in the Abu Salim neighborhood of Tripoli, an NTC member told reporters. A group of about 10 Gadhafi loyalists had entered the streets of Abu Salim waving green flags and holding a picture of the ousted Libyan leader in a move to draw NTC fighters into the neighborhood, which has remained largely loyal to Gadhafi, council member Abdelrazaq Al Aradi said. When anti-Gadhafi forces responded by entering the streets, the loyalists opened fire, Al Aradi said. Afterward, Omar Khadrawi, the assistant to the interior minister, directed a message through reporters to any remaining loyalists. ""Their names have been discovered and the information about them receiving weapons is in the hands of the security now,"" he said. He added that he was offering them ""a last chance"" to hand in their weapons to authorities. On Friday evening, the mood on the streets of the capital was tense. Heavily manned checkpoints dotted the streets en route to Abu Salim. Fighters and area residents told CNN that a small number of Gadhafi supporters started looting and burning cars after Friday prayers. NTC fighters, some drawn from other neighborhoods, responded quickly. Witnesses and fighters said a number of Gadhafi loyalists were detained. Reports conflicted on whether they were armed. Later in the evening, gunshots could be heard in a number of neighborhoods in the city. Al Aradi told CNN separately that NTC fighters think they have captured the organizer of clashes Friday in the Tajoura neighborhood of eastern Tripoli. On Friday, the U.N. human rights office raised the issue of the number of prisoners in Libya and their treatment. ""It could be up to 7,000,"" said Mona Rishmawi, a senior official with the group in Geneva, Switzerland. ""At this stage, there is no police infrastructure, there is no prison authorities. The prison authorities were under the Justice Ministry and, right now, the Justice Ministry is not fully functional."" ""There is allegations and evidence of torture"" in the prisons, she said, citing lawyers, clients and human rights groups. CNN's Raja Razek and Ingrid Formanek contributed to this report.","2 Gadhafi loyalists and a NTC fighter killed, NTC member says .

"(Ars Technica) -- Bloomberg is reporting that Microsoft will cease development of its family of Zune-branded music players due to weak demand and a desire to focus on its smartphone platform. Zune will live on as a software and services platform, according to Bloomberg's source. Windows Phone 7 embeds the Zune player for media playback on the phone, uses the Zune Marketplace for online music sales, and the Zune PC software for media syncing and firmware updates. These uses will be unhindered by the cancellation of the standalone Zune hardware. Since their introduction in 2006, the Zune players always played second fiddle -- if that -- to Apple's iPod line. The 2009 Zune HD model was a well-received, well-designed, and supremely elegant device, but it was a case of too little, too late. It was competing against Apple's iPod touch, with its enormous App Store advantage. Microsoft also did little to promote the Zune brand beyond US borders; the original models were also available in Canada, but until recently, the Zune HD was US-only. As a result, Microsoft failed to threaten Apple's dominance, leaving Cupertino to take 77% of the digital music player market last year. Ars Technica: Zune marketplace going to Europe, Down Under . Over the past couple of months, rumors have been swirling around that Zune would either be killed off or rebranded, and Microsoft has yet to officially confirm the hardware's demise. The apparent decision to cancel the standalone hardware may be the fact behind the rumors, or this could be the first step in a complete overhaul and rebranding of the platform, possibly codenamed ""Ventura."" The decision to end Zune hardware production also means that it's unlikely that Microsoft will ever mimic Apple and produce an iPod touch equivalent for Windows Phone 7 -- the phone platform without the phone part.

"(CNN) -- It seems a certainty that the biggest headlines coming out of Tuesday night's CNN debate in Las Vegas will be about race, gays, religion or immigration. It has to be, because only Herman Cain is gaining any traction on Mitt Romney, and it is as much for his freshness as it is for his ideas. Last week, both Romney and Cain showed they were going to own the debate on the economy. Little air was left for anyone else on the subject. And this week's CNN/ORC Poll shows that it worked for them. So how do the others gain? By challenging them on the old standby Republican primary issues: those of the social order, of course. Given the stuff that Cain has said -- that he wouldn't hire a Muslim, he wants to zap immigrants like bugs if they try to get over the wall from Mexico, and blacks only vote for Democrats because they are brainwashed -- there is plenty of fodder to rile him up. And mess him up. Not because most Republican primary voters don't agree with him, but because his inflammatory messages will ricochet differently in the media if he repeats them as a front-runner. Then there is Mitt. On an anti-gay scale of one to 10, with Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum registering zero and everyone else but Jon Huntsman earning perhaps a two, only Romney has flipped-flopped up and down the scale. We now know that Bachmann's small business -- which she co-owns with her husband and is always touting -- is actually a clinic that takes people's money with a promise to cure them of homosexuality. Perhaps it would work equally well to cure Romney of his hatred of his own views about gays. And Romney has just as scratchy a record on abortion. Nevada is a touchy place to debate immigration. The large Latino population votes mostly Democratic, and the state has long depended on immigrant labor. And we saw from Sharon Angle's failed race for the U.S. Senate in 2010 that immigrant bashing might get headlines, but it doesn't get enough Nevada votes. I predict that Tuesday night, the candidates will go for the headlines. Then there is the third rail of religion. What will Cain trip up on tonight? Hiring Muslims? Vying with Rick Perry to be the best at avoiding a defense of Romney's freedom of religion? Can Perry get into the conversation at all? Or is he really bearing too much resentment from being brutalized by his opponents for his evangelical Christian faith, as his wife recently said? He is sure to challenge Cain and Romney's credentials to represent the evangelical and tea party wings of the Republican Party. Yes, Tuesday night's debate is going to matter Wednesday, mostly because of the issues that divide the U.S. Let the red meat be thrown. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Hilary Rosen.","Hilary Rosen: Romney and Cain seemed to own the debate on the economy last time .

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie scored early and late in the game to secure a 2-1 victory for his struggling Arsenal team over Sunderland at the Emirates Stadium Sunday. The Dutch international's opener after just 31 seconds was the quickest in their English Premier League history but it needed his curling free kick with 10 minutes to go to grab the three points. Sunderland, struggling just above the relegation zone, weathered the early storm before equalizing with a virtuoso free kick from former Gunner Sebastian Larsson in the 31st minute. But Arsenal were the better side in the first half and got their reward when top scorer Van Persie struck again. Manager Arsene Wenger used his program notes to dispel rumors that Van Persie would be leaving in the next transfer window and the player himself told Sky Sports after the match that he was ""committed"" to Arsenal. The victory lifts them into top half of the table for the first time this season, but they still trail leaders Manchester City by 12 points. Tottenham beat Arsenal in the north London derby game before the international break and were held later Sunday 2-2 at Newcastle. Tottenham, bidding for their fifth straight league win, twice led through a Rafael van der Vaart penalty just before halftime and then substitute Jermain Defoe's clinical strike. But Ibrahim Ba and substitute Shola Ameobi twice pulled them back and it was Newcastle, unbeaten this season, who were pressing at the end. They stay in fourth place, with Tottenham in sixth having played a game less. In the other game played Sunday, West Bromwich Albion pulled clear of the relegation zone with a 2-0 Black Country derby win over Wolves, who have lost five straight. There was a goal drought in Italy's Serie A as only one of 12 teams in action in the afternoon fixtures Sunday managed to score . Juventus were held 0-0 at Chievo and Udinese, who finished with 10 men, failed to score at Atalanta. The results left Juve ahead of Udinese at the top on goals scored. The only positive result came at Novara where visitors Bologna won 2-0 to move off the bottom. In German Bundesliga action, struggling Hamburg scored only the second win of their campaign with a 2-1 victory at Freiburg. Hamburg stay bottom, just behind FC Augsburg, but secured three points through goals from Korean Heung Min Son and Ivo Ilicevic with a penalty. Papiss Cisse equalized for the home side but missed a late penalty for a second leveler.","Arsenal beat Sunderland 2-1 at Emirates to move into top half of EPL .

"HANOVER, Germany (CNN) -- Archaeologists have found more than 600 relics from a huge battle between a Roman army and Barbarians in the third century, long after historians believed Rome had given up control of northern Germany. Some of the artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines. ""We have to write our history books new, because what we thought was that the activities of the Romans ended at nine or 10 (years) after Christ,"" said Lutz Stratmann, science minister for the German state of Lower Saxony. ""Now we know that it must be 200 or 250 after that."" For weeks, archeologist Petra Loenne and her team have been searching this area with metal detectors, pulling hundreds of ancient Roman weapons out of the ground. They paint a picture of a highly organized, technologically superior Roman army beset by Germanic tribes in a forest about 80 km (50 miles) south of the modern city of Hanover. The hillside battlefield was discovered by relic-hunters illegally searching for souvenirs of more recent wars near the town of Kalefeld-Oldenrode. One of them brought some of the items he found to Loenne, who works for the local government. The artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines.  Watch how the battlefield discovery could re-write history » . ""We believe the Germans ambushed the Romans here, but the legions quickly fired back with catapults and archers -- and then it came to a massive man-on-man onslaught,"" Loenne said. The items unearthed so far include an axe, still sharp after nearly 1,800 years; horseshoes; shovels; spearheads; and dozens of arrowheads for a Scorpio, a cross between a catapult and a crossbow -- the ancient equivalent of artillery. ""With a very high speed, on a very long distance -- about 300 meters -- you can hit targets precisely,"" said Henning Hassman, of Hanover's archeological institute. Researchers say the evidence suggests the tribesmen lured the Romans into the forest to keep them from making full use of those long-range weapons and draw them into hand-to-hand combat, outside of the formations the imperial troops had mastered. However, they believe the Romans ultimately prevailed. Other relics include coins depicting the late second-century Roman emperor Commodus, depicted in the Oscar-winning Hollywood epic ""Gladiator"" -- a film that opens with a scene of battle against a barbarian horde that scientists say appears to be largely accurate. And Loenne said her team may have only begun to scratch the surface of the forest. ""We hope we might find fortifications and if we are lucky, maybe even battlefield graveyards,"" she said.","Relics found from battle between Romans, Barbarians in third century .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Supporters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi continued Thursday to put up stiff resistance in pockets across the country, despite growing international pressure and persistent attacks from domestic forces. NATO estimates that 200,000 of Libya's 6 million people remain threatened by Gadhafi loyalists. Yet Libya's longtime ruler, his family and his supporters continue to be under stress from an array of sources. That includes Interpol's issuance Thursday of a Red Notice calling for the arrest of Saadi Gadhafi, one of Moammar's sons, who allegedly used force and intimidation to take property while serving as head of the Libyan Football Federation. The notice allows the international police agency to widely circulate an arrest warrant with the intention of extraditing the suspect. His father is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands on charges of crimes against humanity perpetrated since the Libyan uprising erupted in February. Saif al-Islam, Moammar's son and Saadi's brother, as well as intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi are also wanted by the court. In Tripoli, Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said Thursday that $16 billion in Libyan funds have been unfrozen by international banks, though not all of it has been made available to the country's new leaders. Still, the funds have eased the new country's financial situation, he said. Soldiers and families of soldiers killed in fighting will be paid a monthly allowance, he said. Noting the continuing fighting in Sirte and Bani Walid, he said a new government would not be formed ""until Libya is fully liberated."" And Libya will import 750,000 lambs to be sacrificed in the upcoming Eid festival, he said. Weeks after he lost his hold on power, Moammar Gadhafi's whereabouts are unknown, though the National Transitional Council reported Wednesday that he was somewhere near the western border town of Ghadamis. Saadi Gadhafi, meanwhile, fled last month to neighboring Niger, where he was granted safe haven on humanitarian grounds. Niger officials have refused to heed the demand of Libya's interim government that it hand over Gadhafi family remembers and/or regime officials who have fled there. They have said that Saadi Gadhafi, like other loyalists who have taken refuge, could be sentenced to death if returned to Libya. U.S. Sen. John McCain said Thursday during a visit to the North African nation that Libyans would like to see Moammar Gadhafi captured and tried. ""There is no doubt this guy was hated by the people of Libya,"" McCain said. He and Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois traveled to Tripoli to see the nation's post-dictatorship progress. Among other stops, they visited a prison. While saying that Libya's interim council ""still has a lot of work to do,"" McCain called Libya a showcase of the Arab Spring: the movement in North Africa and the Middle East against a number of long-serving rulers. ""The Libyan people have inspired the world,"" McCain said. ""They have turned cynics into supporters."" But Gadhafi loyalists were still putting up stiff resistance in Bani Walid, Sabha and Sirte, the birthplace of the strongman. The accuracy of attacks on forces in and around Bani Walid -- home to a powerful tribe loyal to Gadhafi -- has prompted allegations by at least one military field commander that Gadhafi supporters may have infiltrated into the ranks of anti-Gadhafi units. ""There are spies among our revolutionaries who send our coordinates to the snipers and Gadhafi loyalists firing from inside Bani Walid, and the proof is that their attacks have been precisely targeted,"" said Emad Ziglam, a field commander for anti-Gadhafi troops outside the city, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of Tripoli. ""The mistake was mixing the rebel units. We should not have allowed fighters from Benghazi among others to join in, since we do not know them all. There are definitely traitors among us."" Division among anti-Gadhafi fighters is not unusual. During the months-long war, there have been reports of infighting, raising concerns about a lack of discipline and leadership among the ragtag group of fighters and the possible threat that could pose to the country's stability . Neither side appeared to be making headway in Bani Walid, Ziglam said. He described the humanitarian situation in Bani Walid as ""really bad"" and said 30,000 of the city's residents had fled toward Tripoli and 12,000 toward Sabha, in the south. Thousands of people have fled the fighting in Sirte, where the ousted leader retains a following. The National Transitional Council said that about 100 families left the city Wednesday, and agencies like the Red Cross have described dire conditions for those caught in the fighting. The council also said Sirte was surrounded by revolutionary fighters but estimated that about 5,000 pro-Gadhafi fighters remained within the city. Transitional council military commanders said Wednesday that its forces would wait a few days before launching any major offensive against the city in order to give civilians there more time to leave.

"TRIPOLI, Libya (CNN) -- When Libya's National Transitional Council set up shop in the capital, Tripoli, it found the cupboard was bare. ""We only had $13.5 million in the Central Bank of Libya,"" according to Ali Tarhouni, the oil and economy Minister and one of the first senior officials of the NTC to arrive in the capital. Moammar Gadhafi was on the run, but an acute shortage of Libyan dinar -- the national currency -- threatened to stop the revolution in its tracks. ""I was willing to do anything to get the urgent needs to the Libyans,"" Tarhouni said last week. ""We used parallel markets in the exchange of the money."" ""Parallel markets"" meant wealthy currency dealers in Benghazi, who apparently had many more dinar at their disposal than Gadhafi's Central Bank in Tripoli or the rebels' own Central Bank in Benghazi. With names like Golden Dinar and Sahara International, they became the financial lubricant of anti-Gadhafi forces. The NTC's financial arm, the Temporary Financing Mechanism, had by then already tapped into this informal network of foreign exchange dealers, but not without some controversy. Early in August, according to one source familiar with the TFM's dealings, it exchanged $10 million at a rate of 1.45 dinar to the dollar. The source said that was less than the prevailing market rate of 1.55 dinar, suggesting that the dealer involved did exceptionally well. Another transaction later in August also appeared to be at less than the market rate. ""On what basis did they choose those dealers and those exchange rates?"" the source asked. One currency dealer in Benghazi, Ibrahim Salaby, said the TFM's dealings smacked of favoritism.. The TFM says all its dealings have been transparent. It says it had to use the ""parallel"" market and was sanctioned to do so by the rebels' ""Central Bank,"" which was established in Benghazi soon after Gadhafi's forces were ejected from the city. TFM officials said the central bank simply did not have the available funds to exchange large sums of cash, so it designated exchange dealers to be used. E-mails obtained by CNN suggest that those dealers drove a hard bargain with the TFM. One wrote in August that he was withdrawing an offer to exchange at a rate of 1.45 dinar to the dollar because ""no transfer was made, with situation changing in Libya. ... Therefore we had to change the ex-rate to be 1.3LD/US."" In the chaos of the uprising, there was plenty of cash floating -- and flying -- around Libya. Much of it came from the Gulf and went to groups and fighters beyond the NTC's control. On one occasion, according to the TFM's director, Mazin Ramadan, a currency trader arrived at Benghazi airport short of 20,000 dinar. The money was due to leave on a flight to aid civilians in the western mountains who hadn't received salaries and pensions. Time was short, and a TFM official who had previously spent his own cash on a project was told to take an equivalent sum from a stockpile of cash held on board the plane. A guard thought he was stealing and reported the incident. ""It was a bad judgment call on his part,"" says Ramadan of the official, ""and I paid for it through the gossip channels."" ""It was a big mistake not communicating every step of our work. We were too busy getting things done,"" Ramadan says. But he insists the TFM has had plenty of oversight. ""We have a steering board which includes a representative from the governments of Qatar and France. We have an independent financial managing agent....They have to approve every transaction, every exchange and every project we do,"" he told CNN in an e-mail. As for the shortage of Libyan dinar, that has eased, in part thanks to the Royal Air Force. At the end of August it flew banknotes worth 280 million dinar to Benghazi, part of a stock of 1.86 billion dinar that had been frozen in the United Kingdom with the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1970.","Libya's new government was faced with urgent financial needs, says an official .

"Juneau, Alaska (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign and other Republicans began circling Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in the weeks before McCain picked her as his 2008 running mate, according to e-mails from her old office. Prominent Republicans had touted Palin as a possible running mate for a few months before. But the courtship appears to have accelerated in early August of 2008, just as the biggest controversy of her administration was gathering steam, according to some of the 24,000 pages of e-mails released by Alaska's state government Friday. ""Governor -- I received a call from Charles Adams, Communications Advisor Department for Senator McCain. Mr. Adams was inquiring as to whether or not you would be interested in participating in a National Press Call on Wednesday, 08.06.08,"" Palin's scheduler, Janice Mason, wrote the then-governor on August 4. ""This would be with their National Pool of Reporters. It has very good attendance on calls. It would help the elected official. It would be a total of 15 minutes of your time and would be in regards to Energy."" It was not immediately clear whether Palin accepted the invitation. In her response to Mason, she questioned whether she could take part in the call, given a planned trip to southwestern Alaska. Around the same time, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley requested a brief courtesy visit during an August 11 trip to Alaska's capital Juneau. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich also e-mailed Palin to ask her advice on how Alaska distributed its oil taxes. Gingrich suggested Alaska's model, which guarantees every resident a cut of the proceeds, could be adopted in other states. And the Republican National Committee had Palin lined up for a 9 p.m. speaking slot at the party's convention in Minneapolis on September 2, the day she eventually delivered her acceptance speech, as early as August 20. ""RNC feels that this is a much better slot for you and they want you on Primetime,"" Mason wrote. Nothing in the documents indicates whether Palin knew she was being considered for a slot on the national ticket, and further documents indicate she planned to stay at a Hilton Garden Inn and return from Minneapolis the day after her speech. Neither her husband, Todd, nor infant son, Trig, would be able to accompany her, she wrote -- ""All the more reason to keep the trip short."" McCain eventually named Palin his choice for vice president on August 29, catapulting the once-obscure governor into the national spotlight and making her a potential contender for the GOP's No. 1 position in 2012. State officials released the trove of e-mail -- six 11-by-17-inch boxes worth -- on Friday, the result of Freedom of Information Act requests dating to her vice presidential nomination. About three dozen reporters and photographers crammed into the crowded hallway of a state office building in Juneau and hauled them away for review Friday morning. Around the same time that she was being considered for the vice presidential nomination, Palin was coming under increasing scrutiny over her firing of the state's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan. Monegan's backers asserted that Palin had fired him because he refused to sack her ex-brother-in-law, a state police officer who had been involved in a bitter custody dispute with Palin's sister. The flap became known as ""Troopergate,"" and it dogged Palin throughout the remainder of the campaign. Two investigations came to differing conclusions about her actions: One found she violated state ethics law by using state employees to put pressure on her former in-law, another found she had stayed within the law and little evidence she knew of the actions of her subordinates. The first investigation was commissioned by the state Legislature, the second requested by Palin herself. On August 6, 2008, Palin was told that the Legislature's investigator, Steven Branchflower, had requested ""a laundry list"" of records from the governor's office: ""Emails, files correspondence, names and addresses of any and all staff that would have any knowledge of Walt's firing,"" wrote her then-chief of staff, Mike Nizich. In the e-mail, one of those released Friday, Nizich adds, ""You got to be kidding me."" And Palin replies, ""Geez. This is crazy."" Earlier records in the stash show Palin's frustration with complaints about her family's state-paid travel even before she entered the national spotlight, instructing an aide to remind a reporter ""of the family travels w (with) me that I have personally pd (paid) for."" ""Hopefully our records very clearly show that,"" Palin wrote on July 10, 2008. ""Also, my return of every per diem offer for everything related to the kids ... and we need to be proactive in this issue with reminding him of all the steps taken to save state monies like no Anchorage apartment ... no chef ... security down from 7 to 2, whatever."" Palin eventually paid back about $7,000 for travel expenses for her children after an ethics investigator determined nine trips were questionable. The settlement stated that Palin did not violate Alaska's ethics law or commit any wrongdoing, and that she followed the advice of experienced staff. A spokesman for her political action committee said Friday that the documents show ""a governor hard at work."" ""The thousands upon thousands of e-mails released today show a very engaged Governor Sarah Palin being the CEO of her state,"" said Tim Crawford, treasurer of Sarah PAC, Palin's political action committee. Meanwhile, in a scandal that rocked Alaska's political establishment, Palin moved quickly to link a key figure to her defeated predecessor, Frank Murkowski, the documents show. ""FYI -- I've asked Frank Bailey to help me track down soem [sic] evidence of past administration's dealing with Bill Allen,"" Palin wrote on May 8, 2007, a day after Allen pleaded guilty to bribery, extortion and conspiracy. Palin had beaten Murkowski in 2006 in a primary battle in which she campaigned as a reformer, and backed an unsuccessful 2010 challenge to Murkowski's daughter, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Allen had been the CEO of the Alaska oilfield services company VECO, and federal prosecutors accused him of leading a scheme to bribe top lawmakers in exchange for favorable state action. The scandal disgraced several lawmakers and led to prison time for Allen. Aides soon replied that VECO had paid $15,000 to fly Frank Murkowski and Allen to a Council of State Governments meeting in Thailand in 2004. Palin aides also asked Allen to resign from a seat on a state board that cultivated ties with the Canadian province of Alberta, a request to which Allen -- who was later sentenced to three years in prison -- quickly agreed. The documents include messages from Palin's official account as well as private accounts, according to Linda Perez, the administrative director for current Gov. Sean Parnell. A search was done ""in an effort to capture everything in the state e-mail system"" that would comply with the request, Perez said. Perez said 2,275 pages are not being released due to legal privileges, while some documents were redacted to remove names. E-mails for the remaining 10 months of Palin's tenure, leading up to her 2009 resignation, have yet to be released. Before the release, Palin told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the messages ""obviously weren't meant for public consumption,"" saying she was sure the material would be taken out of context. ""I think every rock in the Palin household that could ever be kicked over and uncovered anything, it's already been kicked over,"" she said. CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Katie Glaeser and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","NEW: Palin documents show GOP overtures in August 2008 .

"(CNN) -- The director of a battered women's shelter in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was being held Wednesday on charges that she forced the women she cared for to commit sex acts with strangers, local authorities told CNN. Authorities were also investigating if children who lived at the shelter -- some as young as 5 years old -- were forced into prostitution as well, Arturo Sandoval, spokesman for the state attorney general's office, told CNN. ""That is an aspect of our investigation, but that's still yet to be determined,"" Sandoval, whose office has taken the lead of the investigation, said. Soledad Griensen Porras, 50, of Juarez was arrested Tuesday afternoon after one of the women in the shelter stopped police in the street asking for help, according to Adrian Sanchez, spokesman for the Juarez municipal police department. ""Our officers responded immediately and that's when they found the shelter, which had pretty much become a brothel,"" Sanchez said. Officers found ""several irregularities"" at the shelter ""as well as five other women...and eight children,"" Sanchez said. The children had been beaten and had ""chile put on their private parts"" according to a press release from the Juarez municipal police department. ""Griensen is the only person being held in relation to these charges,"" Sandoval told CNN. ""She is currently in our custody. I can't give you anymore details about her since our investigation is ongoing,"" he added. It was unclear how long Griensen had owned the Mujeres Unidas Contra la Violencia (""women united against violence"") shelter or how long its residents allegedly had been forced to perform sex acts, Sanchez said.

"(CNET) -- The much-discussed BlackBerry tablet may finally come to fruition as soon as next week. It's been talked about for months, but Research In Motion has yet to acknowledge that such a device exists. But today The Wall Street Journal reported that the Canadian smartphone maker may reveal its own iPad-like tablet at its developer conference in San Francisco, which starts Monday. The Journal's unnamed sources say the device is not ready for shipping to customers, but will by sometime during the fourth quarter of this year. The BlackBerry tablet--sometimes referred to as the ""BlackPad"" since RIM bought the domain blackpad.com--is said to have a 7-inch touchscreen and at least one camera, maybe two, according to the Journal. Previous reports have said the BlackPad would have a screen closer to the size of the 9.7-inch iPad. In line with previous reports, the tablet will not have its own cellular service but will be a companion device to a BlackBerry smartphone, the newspaper reported. That means the tablet will have Wi-Fi access but will need to be tethered to a BlackBerry for a 3G connection. Perhaps most interesting is what RIM apparently has planned on the software front. It's been reported before, but the Journal's story reiterates that the tablet won't use RIM's new BlackBerry 6 mobile OS. Instead it will use a new OS from QNX Software, a company RIM purchased earlier this year. The report says the QNX software could eventually replace the software on all RIM smartphones. How much the device will cost is still unknown. Since it's not being sold with wireless service, it seems unlikely it would be sold through a carrier the way BlackBerrys are, and that would mean no carrier subsidy like newer tablets from Dell and Samsung have. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"Washington (CNN) -- One hundred and two canvases all with similar composition but different colors hung edge-to-edge make up the totality of Andy Warhol's painting called ""Shadows"" currently on display at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. This marks the first time all of the canvases, which were completed over thirty years ago, have been displayed together as Warhol intended. There aren't many museums with enough unbroken wall space to hold the entire piece. The canvases, each measuring four by six feet are hung edge-to-edge as the artist intended covering a continuous 451 linear feet on the gallery wall making it longer than a football field. ""These galleries are just curved enough to give you flow, or push our visitors through the space,"" said Associate Curator Evelyn Hankins. ""There's this kind of beautiful dialogue or conversation between the art and the architecture."" ""It gives you goose bumps. It shows the elasticity of the painting and the concept,"" said Yasmil Raymond, a curator at the Dia Art Foundation that owns the painting. Only 83 canvases of the work were shown at the first displayed in 1979 at the Heiner Friedrich gallery in New York. They took up several galleries, the continuity broken every time the work came to a corner or a door. ""On the one hand, this installation is about the gestalt, the overwhelming effect of seeing all of these paintings that continue beyond the realm of sight,"" said Hankins. ""And then, it's about looking at the individual objects at the same time."" The artist used seventeen different colors from chartreuse to Day-Glo acid green to a dull brown to create the backgrounds for the canvases. Then one of two styles of ""peaks"" was silk screened onto the backgrounds, creating a repetitive pattern when the canvases are hung side-by-side. The type of paint stroke used for the backgrounds varies, so that even the canvases with similar colors look different up close. The silk screened image or ""shadow"" is always flat. ""It's a silk screen that I mop over with paint,"" said Warhol about the Shadows when it was first displayed. And the curators believe that Warhol, or perhaps one of his assistants, did use an actual mop when creating some of the backgrounds. The February 1979 issue of New York Magazine quotes Warhol saying, ""Someone asked me if I though they were art and I said no. You see, the opening party had a disco. I guess that makes them disco dÃ©cor."" In the late 1970s, Warhol experimented with abstractions, a departure from the pop culture inspired works for which he is known. ""This work comes in a moment when he is reinventing what he wants to do as a painter,"" said Raymond pointing out Warhol stuck with the vivid colors that he had used since the early 1960s. Pragmatically, hanging the paintings edge-to-edge was not as easy as you might think Hankins said because the canvas frames have warped over time. ""Humidity changes the canvas and changes the center bar that the canvas is on,"" she said. ""Wood changes, so none of them are perfectly straight. To hang them edge-to-edge and keep them straight is an extraordinary task."" ""Shadows"" will be on exhibit at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Smithsonian Institution's museum dedicated to modern and contemporary art until January 15, 2012. Across the National Mall from the Hirshhorn at the National Gallery, more of Warhol's art can be seen in an exhibit on to his work with news headlines that runs through January 2, 2012.","This is the first time all of the canvases have been displayed together as Warhol intended .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- On the eve of his address at the U.N. General Assembly Thursday, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared his country to be ""a new model for life to the world."" He also said that the United States might be willing to ""highjack"" the Middle East uprisings, according to Iran's state-run news agency IRNA. Ahmadinejad's appearance at the United Nations in New York comes a day after two U.S. hikers, held in an Iranian prison for more than two years, were released. Wednesday evening, Ahmadinejad met with a group of U.S. university students, and then gave an interview to Iranian satellite television. His office provided translated quotes from both. The Iranian leader said ""that the world is in need of change, and Marxism, liberalism, humanism and the West could not solve man's problems,"" his office said. Ahmadinejad added that ""relying on its culture and rich civilization,"" Iran is ""the only nation"" that ""can offer a new model for life to the world."" He told the students ""that the U.S. may be willing to highjack the regional uprisings but a stormy movement is under way,"" IRNA reported. ""Elsewhere in his speech, he said that the U.N. was set up with the objective of preventing bullying in the world, but this did not happen,"" IRNA reported. Ahamdinejad also gave an interview to New York Times Op-Ed columnist Nicholas Kristof in which he discussed the dispute over Iran's nuclear activities. He said that if the United States gave Iran 20% enriched uranium, ""we will cease the domestic enrichment of uranium of up to 20% this very week. We only want the 20% enrichment for our domestic consumption. If they give it to us according to international law, according to IAEA laws, without preconditions, we will cease domestic enrichment."" Many countries, including the United States, believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons program, but Tehran insists its activities are only to provide energy for the country.","Ahamdinejad: The U.S. may be willing to ""highjack"" uprisings in the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- The death of Moammar Gadhafi is not the game-changer many would like it to be. His regime was already a thing of the past. For Libya's transitional government, the challenges today are just as daunting as they were last week. To be sure, Gadhafi's death provides them a moment of respite and an important propaganda boost as they try to cobble together a credible coalition that can govern. It further breaks down the psychological barrier of fear so many Libyans have continued to feel, left over from decades of dictatorial rule. However, the gains, while important, are more symbolic than practical. Gadhafi was the greatest unifier Libyans could have asked for. He was erratic, brutal and a mismanager par excellence and, as such, managed to mobilize a broad swath of Libyans around a shared goal: the downfall of his hated regime. Now that Gadhafi has left the scene, the rebels and their fledgling government have lost their original raison d'etre. Libya was the Arab Spring's first true revolution, the only one in which the revolutionaries now hold the levers of power. And, unlike Egypt and Tunisia, Libya does not have to contend with old, decaying institutions. The old regime does not need to be adapted to the new. But as promising as blank slates are, they are also dangerous. The National Transitional Council has been plagued by infighting and the emergence of factions. The divisions have taken on an increasingly ideological tone. It is the same old story: Liberals and Islamists come together during the revolution, only to split afterward, often in acrimony. Above all else, a government needs to govern. It has to have a monopoly on the use of force, and this is a challenge in one the world's most heavily armed countries. The various militias that helped bring down Gadhafi now represent competing centers of power and influence. Disarming them, or integrating them into the national army, is a key task ahead for Libya's new leaders. The euphoria we are witnessing today in the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi is encouraging. But it is also premature and misleading. It is likely to be remembered as a brief but welcome aberration in a slow slog toward something resembling democracy. All the actors with a stake in Libya should quickly adjust their expectations accordingly. I, and many others, are optimistic about Libya prospects, but only if Libyans -- and international supporters and donors -- get the key components of the transitions right and do it right away. Revolutions are much more glamorous when they are being fought, less so when they're being built through the sometimes unsavory give-and-take of consensus building. With Syria disintegrating, Tunisia holding landmark elections and Egypt sputtering along unconvincingly, the attentions of the international community are understandably divided. But it cannot afford to forget Libya. Fortunately, Libya is perhaps the only Arab country where people seem to genuinely like Europe and the United States for the decisive support they offered to the revolution. That sort of good will doesn't come every day. Here's hoping that we use it and that we use it for good. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shadi Hamid.","Shadi Hamid: Libya's new government's task is challenge even before Gadhafi's death .
Loathing for regime unified Libyans, he says; now new government must unify, govern .
Disarming militias, integrating them into army next task; slog toward democracy begins .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya's president declared two days of national mourning Wednesday for Wangari Maathai, the first woman from Africa to win the Nobel Peace Prize, who died Monday after a battle with cancer. The announcement by President Mwai Kibaki also said a state funeral would be held for Maathai. No date was specified. Maathai, 71, was an environmentalist who had long campaigned for human rights and the empowerment of Africa's most impoverished people. Kibaki's announcement said Thursday and Friday would be days of national mourning for Maathai, with the national flag flown at half staff. It also said the government has nominated representatives to join the family committee planning the funeral. Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, a tree-planting campaign to simultaneously mitigate deforestation and to give locals, especially women and girls, access to resources like firewood for cooking and clean water. The movement has since planted more than 40 million trees. In 2004, Maathai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote sustainable development, democracy and peace. She also was the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. In December 2002, she was elected to Kenya's parliament with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. She was honored by Time magazine in 2005 as one of 100 most influential people in the world, and Forbes listed her as one of 100 most powerful women in the world.","Kenya announces two days of mourning for Wangari Maathai .

"(CNN) -- African football has been left reeling following the tragic deaths of two players in two days over the weekend, both while appearing for their clubs. On Saturday, Nigerian striker Endurance Idahor collapsed on the pitch and died on his way to hospital while playing for Al Merreikh against Al Amal in a Sudanese league match. The 25-year-old fell to the ground after a minor collision with a rival player and local media later reported that the player had suffered a heart attack. Idahor finished as top scorer during his first season in Sudan and scored 118 goals in 176 appearances for Al Merreikh. Meanwhile, on Sunday, teenage central defender Bartholomew Opoku collapsed while playing for Ghanaian side Kessben in their league clash with Liberty. The 19-year-old was rushed to hospital but passed away on Monday, with the cause of death still unknown. ""It's a massive tragedy and the whole club is in shock. There was no hint he was unwell,"" the BBC Web site quoted Kessben spokesman Fred Acheampong.","African football has been left reeling following the tragic deaths of two players .

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry's suggestion that the United States may send troops to fight Mexican drug cartels riled officials and spurred debate from analysts on both sides of the border Monday. Mexico's top representative in the United States rejected the idea, which the Republican presidential candidate mentioned at a New Hampshire campaign stop Saturday. Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan told reporters his country's longstanding opposition to the presence of American forces had not changed. ""The matter of the participation or presence of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is not on the table,"" Sarukhan said Monday. ""It is not a component that forms part of the innovative approaches that Mexico and the United States have been using to confront transnational organized crime."" Perry said Saturday that leaders from Mexico and the United States should meet after next year's elections to address the deadly drug trade. ""It may require our military in Mexico working in concert with them to kill these drug cartels and to keep them off of our border,"" he said. Analysts in the United States and Mexico said the controversial idea could have significant political consequences and security implications -- even as a political campaign proposal. ""It may be well-intentioned, but it has the potential of really undermining cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico,"" said Eric L. Olson, who studies security relationships between the neighboring countries at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The United States admits its drug market plays a role in fueling violence in Mexico, and has pledged $1.4 billion in assistance through the so-called Merida Initiative, which includes programs to help train Mexican military, police and justice officials. ""If there's a perception in Mexico that this is all designed somehow as a backdoor entry into Mexico by the U.S., if there's a perception that this is leading to the United States' direct intervention into Mexico, it puts at risk all those cooperative efforts,"" Olson said. George W. Grayson -- author of ""Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State?"" -- described Perry's proposal as ""absolute, unadulterated nonsense."" ""The first thing you'd have to fight is the Mexican Army if you sent troops in there. It's ludicrous,"" he said. Even if they don't gain traction, Perry's comments will likely resonate in campaign rhetoric beyond the United States' borders, as presidential campaigns in Mexico are also kicking into high gear, Grayson said. ""Typically this is a time of nationalism and breast-beating by candidates. ... The politicians are the ones who are going to walk all over it. They're going to say, 'See, the gringos are coming after us,'"" he said. Several Mexican lawmakers -- who the country's constitution says would need to approve any presence of U.S. soldiers -- expressed concern about Perry's comments Monday. Institutional Revolutionary Party Sen. Maria de los Angeles Moreno said U.S. troops in Mexico would be a clear ""aggression."" ""We must make an effort to face our own challenge, the violence of the criminals and the organized crime groups, but with our own forces and always maintaining the control of our territory,"" said Sen. Carlos Navarrete of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. But security analyst Pablo Monzalvo said when it comes to U.S. involvement, some Mexican officials are prone to double speak -- allowing U.S.-led measures to occur even as they speak out against them. Earlier this year Mexico's foreign minister fielded questions from angry lawmakers who said U.S. surveillance of Mexican territory -- aimed at detecting criminal groups -- was illegal. ""There is interference...and this has been said publicly. But I ask myself what has been accomplished by ceding a certain amount of authority,"" Monzalvo said. Perry, who was first elected governor of Texas in 2002, has faced criticism from opponents who have attacked his conservative bona fides on illegal immigration at a series of debates this fall. ""He's trying to compensate and say, 'Yeah, I'm really tough on Mexico,' but I think he's overcompensated,"" said Grayson, who is also a professor of government at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. This isn't the first time Perry has called for greater force fighting drug cartels. Last year he asked U.S. President Barack Obama to send 1,000 additional National Guard troops to the border. ""We must show the cartels that Washington will no longer tolerate their terrorizing and criminalizing the border region,"" he wrote in a letter to the president. Troops crossing the border, however, is a different matter, Olson said. ""No Mexican wants the U.S. to send its military troops. ... They welcome cooperation and they welcome the U.S. accepting responsibility for its role, but they don't welcome the notion of sending troops. That's crossing a line,"" he said. CNN's Isabel Morales and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","The Texas governor says fighting the drug trade ""may require our military in Mexico""

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal survived a scare in his opening round match against John Isner at the French Open on Tuesday as the big-serving American took the five-time champion to five sets. The World No.1 eventually prevailed against marathon man Isner 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 6-7 (2-7) 6-2 6-4 in just over four hours to set up a second round match with compatriot Pablo Andujar. Nadal started the match in typically dominant fashion breaking Isner in the seventh game of the opening set, before serving out to take a one-set lead. But Isner -- who won the 11-hour epic against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon last year -- wasn't about to give up and promptly raised his game. The six-foot-nine American -- ranked 39 in the world -- took both the second and third sets on the tiebreak raising the prospect of handing Nadal only his second defeat at Roland Garros and causing one of the biggest upsets in years. But the Spaniard immediately mounted a comeback gaining an early break in the fourth before closing out the set 6-2. Nadal secured another eary break in the fifth set but Isner didn't crumble and pushed his opponent all the way. But Nadal's persistence was rewarded as he took the final set 6-4. ""It's always a very, very close match against John because you play under pressure all the time and at moments in the tie-breaks. I didn't play very well, I was too nervous,"" Nadal said in an on-court interview after the match. Clijsters wins on Paris return . In other matches, fourth seed Andy Murray eased into the second round beating French qualifier Eric Prodon in straight sets 6-4 6-1 6-3. The Briton will play Italy's Simone Bolelli in his next match.

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a daunting assignment for an Army combat brigade at Fort Bliss, Oklahoma -- get all the military's high-tech software, uplinks, phones, drones and computers to talk to each other. The goal of the Army is to fine-tune a global network to provide everyone, from commanders to frontline soldiers, the same information, quickly and seamlessly. ""The network will literally redefine how we fight in the same way that social media has changed the way we interact and communicate in our personal lives,"" Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Peter Chiarelli said Monday. ""The network will change how we operate on the battlefield."" Chiarelli said that over 10 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, new equipment had been raced to the battlefield, some of it off the shelf. Now the task is to synchronize new and old equipment in a battlefield setting in the vast and rough terrain of Fort Bliss. That Army installation provides mountainous terrain and desert in an area the size of Connecticut. The testing by 3,500 to 4,000 members of the combat brigade will be the centerpiece of the Army's modernization program, according to Chiarelli. ""It will make our various formations more lethal, faster and more survivable on today's battlefield,"" he said in an hour-long question-and-answer session with journalists at the Pentagon. Already the Army is experimenting with smartphones, finding uses as diverse as monitoring the eye-in-the-sky, real-time video of drones, or transmitting pictures of the wounded to doctors miles away, or calling up biometric details of suspected insurgents stopped at checkpoints. Traditionally formal Army procurement programs could stretch eight years or longer, finally delivering a product to specifications that might already be years behind current technology. Now if the Army is able to integrate existing software into its network, then industry can regularly and quickly update the technology. ""Together we must we ensure have the most current technology available so that ultimately we may get it into the hands of our soldiers as quickly as possible,"" Chiarelli said. Over time the Army will be able to plan and buy equipment more efficiently. ""The Army will buy what it needs, when it needs it, for those that need it,"" Chiarelli said. ""This allows us to buy less, more often and incrementally improve the network capability over time.""","A combat brigade at the Army's Fort Bliss is on a technological mission .

"(CNN) -- News International, publisher of the now-defunct News of the World newspaper in Great Britain, has agreed to pay 2 million British pounds -- the equivalent of $3.2 million -- to the family of British teen Milly Dowler, who disappeared in 2002 and was later found dead. Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of chief executive of News Corporation, the parent company of News International, personally apologized to Dowler's family in July amid allegations that News of the World journalists listened to voice-mail messages on the girl's phone while she was missing. ""As the founder of the company, I was appalled to find out what happened,"" Murdoch said after speaking with the family in July. Allegations that journalists hacked into the girl's voice-mail were part of a larger phone-hacking scandal that rocked Britain this year, prompting several arrests, resignations and hearings in Parliament. As part of the settlement, announced Friday by News International and the Dowler family, Murdoch will pay 1 million British pounds -- about $1.6 million -- to charities chosen by the Dowler family. Those charities ""represent causes close to Milly and those that provide support to other victims of crime,"" in a statement that News International and the Dowler family issued Friday. Milly Dowler was 13 when she disappeared. ""Nothing that has been agreed will ever bring back Milly or undo the traumas of her disappearance and the horrendous murder trial earlier this year,"" the Dowler family said in a statement. ""The only way that a fitting tribute could be agreed was to ensure that a very substantial donation to charity was made in Milly's memory. We hope that projects will be undertaken so that some good can come from this."" Murdoch apologized again Friday for News of the World's actions. ""The behaviour that the News of the World exhibited towards the Dowlers was abhorrent and I hope this donation underscores my regret for the company's role in this awful event,"" he said in the statement.

"(CNN) -- Brian Flynn, brother of a victim aboard downed Pan Am Flight 103, said Thursday that the killing of former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi is a moment of justice. ""For more than 20 years, (Gadhafi) continued to haunt the world,"" he said. ""We can take some satisfaction that justice can be done."" LIVE BLOG: Latest developments on Gadhafi's death . A bomb left 270 people dead when it exploded aboard the Boeing 747 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, less than a week before Christmas day in 1988. The attack ultimately was pinned on Libyan intelligence officials. Flynn's brother, John Patrick, was one of 35 university students killed in the tragedy. A permanent memorial at New York's Syracuse University was dedicated to the victims. Read Brian Flynn's essay . Flynn says he's been in contact with other victims' families, who likely shared a range of emotions upon hearing news of Gadhafi's death. ""We're all together on this,"" he said of the families. ""This is one of those situations that when (John Patrick Flynn) died, I said I promised him and myself that I wouldn't let it go, that there would be justice,"" he told CNN. ""Today is an example that after 22 years, finally justice is done. I owed him that."" He says he felt ""the Libyan people have helped me fulfill my promise to him."" ""We commend and admire the courage of the Libyans, knowing that their freedom has come at a cost,"" Flynn added. ""It's taken great courage also on the part of the Obama administration to lead the NATO forces against challenging political and diplomatic circumstances,"" he said. U.S. and European war planes began a military campaign against Libyan government forces in March of this year in support of the country's rebels, helping to eventually oust the longtime strongman in August after more than four decades of near-absolute rule. Gadhafi's death an answer to little girl's prayer . ""Part of me thinks this story had to end this way,"" Flynn added, referring to the former Libyan leader's being killed rather than captured. ""Although it's sometimes hard to celebrate when someone gets killed brutally,"" he said, ""I think in this case there's every cause for celebration. ""He was an unrepentant murderer who was oppressive of his people."" Two years earlier, the only convicted Lockerbie plotter, Abdelbeset al-Megrahi, was freed from a Scotland prison after serving eight years of a life sentence. He was set free on compassionate grounds because he was battling prostate cancer. Al-Megrahi received a hero's welcome upon his return to Tripoli, enraging many in the United States and Britain. But a Libyan envoy said the new government is not likely to send him back. That country's ambassador to the United States cited al-Megrahi's poor health as a factor, saying he is a ""very sick man"" and is ""living with oxygen beside his bed."" At the time of his release, doctors had said he had only months to live, but al-Megrahi was still alive -- albeit visibly frail -- as of a few weeks ago. So when news reports surfaced Thursday of Gadhafi's death, Flynn said he took a moment and thought that ""it's worth it, to get justice."" U.S. President Barack Obama announced later Thursday that ""today we can definitely say the Gadhafi regime has come to an end."" Speaking during a White House press conference, he said the United States is committed to Libya and will support the country's democratic transition. ""You have won your revolution,"" he added, addressing the Libyan people. For others, Gadhafi's killing also likely marks an end to more than two decades of documenting the Lockerbie tragedy. Two years after the 1988 bombing, Syracuse University Archivist Amy S. Doherty said she contacted the families of the school's slain students, offering the archives as a place for families to donate ""correspondence, journals, diaries, photographs, newspaper clippings, examples of creative work, video and audio tapes by or about their child or about the events following the disaster."" The first collection from a victim arrived in September 1990, according to a university statement. Since then, materials relating to all 35 students have been added. In 2006, the scope of the archives was expanded to include items pertaining to all 270 victims.","NEW: Obama tells Libyans ""You have won your revolution""

"(CNN) -- The decisive and positive terms of ETA's response to Monday's ""Declaration"" in Donostia-San Sebastian by the International Conference group is to be welcomed, as is the response of the Spanish government and others. It has taken many years of patient work to get to this point and every effort must be made to build momentum into the process. I first became involved in the efforts to build a peace process in the Basque country at the time of our own peace agreement in 1998. An Irish priest, Fr. Alex Reid, who I have known for almost 40 years, had played a key role in creating the Irish peace process and he was asked by a priest in that region to bring his expertise to bear. In the years since then, Sinn FÃ©in leaders, including myself, have traveled regularly to the region and met representatives from the Basque country and the Spanish state. It is obvious that many of those in the Basque region who we met are committed to peace and that they have consciously sought to learn from the Irish experience. Almost two years ago a new group Abertzale Left, which includes the banned Batasuna party agreed on a new political strategy for progress. For those familiar with the peace process in Ireland the language used by Abertzale Left is strikingly similar to that used in Ireland. Abertzale Left committed itself to using ""exclusively political and democratic means"" to advance its political objectives. And it seeks to advance political change ""in a complete absence of violence and without interference"" and ""conducted in accordance with the Mitchell Principles."" These principles were devised by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell who was chair of the peace negotiations in Ireland. Last Monday I returned to Donostia-San Sebastian in Euskadi for an ""international conference to promote the resolution of the conflict in the Basque Country."" An international group of leaders -- myself, Kofi Annan, Jonathan Powell, Bertie Ahern, Pierre Joxe, and Gro Harland Bruntland -- had been asked to speak on that issue and to set out our view of the next steps needed to encourage a step change in the Basque peace process. In my contribution I pointed out that violence usually occurs when people believe there is no alternative. Transforming a situation from conflict to peace requires creating an alternative. This is hugely challenging. It demands that we seek to understand what motivates, what inspires, what drives our opponent. Each conflict is different but in the course of our efforts Irish Republicans learned that there are general principles of peace-making and methods of conflict-resolution that can be applied elsewhere and which can help end conflict if applied properly. These elements include: dialogue, tackling the causes which lie at the heart of the conflict, a good faith engagement by all sides, an inclusive process with all parties treated as equals and mandates respected. All issues must be on the agenda -- there can be no pre-conditions, no vetoes, and no attempt to pre-determine the outcome or preclude any outcome. And there should be time frames. Most importantly, participants must stay focused and be prepared to take risks and engage in initiatives and confidence-building measures. But if there is a starting point, it must be dialogue. I emphasized this again and again. This is the foundation upon which any progress will be built. Following our deliberations the International Group expressed the opinion that ""it is possible to end, the last armed confrontation in Europe"". We called upon ETA to ""make a public declaration of the definitive cessation of all armed action and to request talks with the governments of Spain and France to address exclusively the consequences of the conflict."" Thursday's statement meets that requirement. The Spanish government has also welcomed the statement. So, a breakthrough has been achieved, but it must be built upon quickly if its potential is to be achieved. The next steps should now focus on promoting reconciliation, addressing the issue of victims and recognizing that a serious effort has to be made to heal personal and social wounds. There are other issues which will need to be addressed and which can act as confidence-building measures within the process. For example, among these are the issue of prisoners and of demilitarizing the environment and of respecting and acknowledging the democratic rights of all political parties and treating them as equals. And there is for the Basque people the key issue of the right of the people of that historic region to self-determination. As we learned from our own experience, making peace is very difficult. But as the peace processes in Ireland and in South Africa demonstrate, no conflict is intractable. If there is political will and imagination and a preparedness to take risks for peace it is possible to rewrite the script, make progress and achieve agreements.

"(CNN) -- Tunisia, the country where the wave of popular Arab discontent started and spread, will fittingly hold the Arab Spring's first election Sunday, a contest pitting secularists against Islamists. The vote for a National Constituent Assembly is being billed as the freest and fairest since the strongman who ruled Tunisia for nearly a quarter century, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, was overthrown by street protests last January. Candidates are competing for 218 seats in the assembly, which will be charged with writing a new constitution and probably deciding the structure of Tunisia's future government. Scores of political parties and independent candidates are competing in the contest. Voting began a couple of days ago in the Tunisian diaspora. The winners will be tasked with confronting severe domestic problems front and center after the self-immolation in December of a fruit vendor whose cart had been seized by police. The vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, died in early January. His fiery suicide touched off a firestorm among Tunisians fed up with corruption, high unemployment and escalating food prices. The Tunisian ferment sparked uprisings in North Africa, where Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the Moammar Gadhafi-led Libyan regime were ousted, and public anger in the Middle East, where anti-government protesters have taken to the streets in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. The collective unrest has been dubbed the Arab Spring. The political debate has been robust during election campaigning and violence has erupted. Islamist groups protested in Tunis this month after a TV network broadcast an animated film called ""Persepolis,"" which at one point depicts God, regarded as an act of blasphemy to many Muslims. Police intervened with tear gas. A subsequent march by Muslim Salafist groups on the prime minister's office was dispersed. Also, there was an attack on the home of the TV station's owner. Ennahada, the most prominent Islamist party, condemned the violence but did not criticize the protests. Amid such tumult, public opinion across Tunisia has been frank and diverse. Balti, one of Tunisia's most popular rappers and a supporter of the Tunisian revolution, told CNN he doesn't plan to vote. ""I don't trust any of these political parties,"" he said. ""Especially the parties that are using religion to get through to the hearts and minds of the people."" In contrast, his sound engineer plans to vote for Ennahada, strongly supported in provincial cities and among the working classes. ""We are a Muslim country. Our language is Arabic. And Ennahada is close to Islam,"" said M.D.M.C. ""I want religion to play a bigger role in Tunisian society."" Ennahada consistently wins popularity polls but for many it raises fears. One controversial ad raised the specter of an Islamist society where restaurants are empty of foreign tourists and women lose the right to have jobs or shun headscarves. Ahmed Najib Chebbi, a leading secularist politician, said he believes ""we live with this threat"" from Islamist parties. But Rachid Ghanouchi, the leader of Ennahada, said there's been a ""fear-mongering campaign"" against his group. ""They use scare tactics to frighten businessmen, women, and foreign countries, but I don't think this has worked."" A strong showing for Ennahada would encourage other Islamists in the region. It also would raise questions about Islamism and democracy. Would Ennahada impose a conservative social code on what is one of the most secular and industrialized Arab countries? Or would it follow the model of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, showing that Islam and democracy are compatible? Ghanouchi, who returned to Tunisia in January after two decades in exile, said there if his party comes to power, it won't impose a religious lifestyle on the more secular parts of the country. He has promised to protect women's rights and work with other political parties. ""Get to know us, not through what others say but through our actions. Give us a chance before you judge us,"" he said. CNN's Ivan Watson, Tim Lister, and Joe Sterling contributed to this report .","The Arab Spring began in Tunisia last winter .

"Paris (CNN) -- Outside France, nobody gave them a prayer. Les Bleus had coughed and spluttered their way to the Rugby World Cup Final, at which point they were expected to be thrashed buy the red-hot favorites and tournament hosts New Zealand. But the French fans didn't care. On Sunday morning they turned out to cheer on their team at various fanzones across the country and they almost saw them produce one of the biggest rugby shocks of all time. They came out in their tens of thousands, many with tricolor facepaint, almost all with red, white and blue flags. There was even the rooster, a seemingly obligatory at every French rugby event, trying to peck at a kiwi - the small, tropical fruit, not one of conspicuous New Zealand fans who was 11,500 miles from home. For New Zealand, France are the bogey team. Les Bleus were not fancied to win their World Cup games against the All Blacks in 1999 and 2007, but on both occasions they came from behind to knock them out. They may have failed to impress during this tournament, but the French fans knew that their team had the quality and they were due a good game. And they delivered it today. A huge roar went up outside the Hotel de Ville as the French squad fronted up to the All Blacks' haka war dance. And in the opening minutes, France took the game to the hosts. This was not going to be the one-way traffic that almost all of the pundits had forecast. Even when Tony Woodcock crossed over to score for the All Blacks, the fans around me were not concerned. The French were playing confident, flowing rugby, the All Blacks were missing kicks and as the game progressed, the hosts were looking rattled. The street cleaners paused to lean on their brooms to watch the giant screen. The soldiers on duty - bristling with machine guns - were glued to the action. And when the French captain Thierry Dusautoir scored his second-half try, the chorus of cheers was deafening. It was well and truly game-on. Sadly for the French, that was all they could muster. The All Blacks just held on for a narrow one point win and the crowds in France disappeared into the afternoon autumnal sunshine. They had lost the game, but it was almost a moral victory. In the same week that the French government's role in the Libyan conflict was acknowledged as being pivotal, French national pride was restored in the sporting arena. They stood up and were counted. They contributed to a thrilling world cup final and they showed that they deserved to be there.","On Sunday morning the French turned out to cheer at fanzones across the country .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is one man who will be pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota this week hoping to make it three majors in a row -- but you won't find his name when you trail your finger down the list of starters at the 91st PGA Championship. Tiger Woods possesses a mental toughness that none of his competitors can match. Though his presence may be unnoticed by spectators lining the fairways, his influence on the players he coaches is becoming far more conspicuous. That is because sports psychologist Dr. Morris Pickens, or ""Dr Mo"" as his players like to call him, is fast gaining a reputation for being one of the best mental coaches in golf. So far this year his mastery of the mind has helped Lucas Glover and Stewart Cink win the U.S. Open and the British Open respectively. In 2007, Pickens helped Zach Johnson to his Masters' triumph at the Augusta National. A win for one of Pickens' players at this year's PGA would complete a career slam of majors for the psychologist. It is a cast iron certainty that this week's winner will not only have to master the course -- all 7674 yards of it -- but also his mental demons coming down the stretch on Sunday evening. Learning to cope with such pressure is not easy. ""It doesn't just happen, you have to develop the mental game off the golf course,"" Pickens told CNN. The best players on the Tour are consistently honing their mental skills and Morris -- who studied under the game's most renowned psychologist, Bob Rotella, at the University of Virginia in the 1990s  -- is now just one of dozens of mind men employed by pros on the PGA Tour. ""Good players are mentally good when their game is on. Great players are mentally good regardless of where their game is. They are constantly remembering past memories -- where they've won, where they putted good, and so on."" Pickens says it is important for players to put aside a set amount of time before a competition visualizing how they see themselves walking, their tempo and thinking about the demeanor they want to convey. But it is more than just about ramming home a message about the powers of positive thinking. Pickens advises more technical players to find ways of accepting where shots go, relaxing in between and staying patient. Someone who struggles with shot selection will require a strategy that focuses on being decisive. ""Being great behind the ball so you can be great over the ball,"" Pickens says. It's the sort of mantra you sense that Tiger Woods has probably uttered to himself thousands of times down the years. The mental side is part of the game that Woods has paid close attention to ever since he was a boy. When most teenagers were blithely thwacking balls out on the range and dreaming of future glory, Woods was already laying the foundations of his mental toughness. With the help of Dr Jay Brunza -- a former military man and friend of Woods' late father Earl -- Woods Jr was being drilled in strategies of emotional detachment in pressure situations. As Pickens points out, it's been key to his success. ""If you learn these mental skills when you are young, it becomes second nature to you. Most guys start learning to be good mentally when they are 30 and it's not easy to incorporate. For Tiger, it's always been part of his game. For others it's an add on."" Pickens, who has also worked in American Football and Nascar, identifies Woods' extraordinary mental control in adversity as one of his greatest assets. ""His confidence around his scoring is not going to be affected by his confidence about his ball striking. He might have his A-game, but if he doesn't, it's like he says: 'I'll figure out a way and hit three wood or an iron' -- like he did at Hoylake [in 2006]. Other guys confidence is all around: 'if I don't hit it good, then I can't score good' and they take themselves out of it."" Back to back wins on the PGA Tour have ensured Woods is one of the hottest favorites -- even by his standards -- to win his fifth PGA Championship. And it seems implausible that he will miss two major cuts on the bounce. If he is in the mix come Sunday, it is, according to Pickens, another edge he has over his competitors. ""He's been through those experiences more than anyone he's going to face and is familiar with how the intense pressure changes your body. When you've been there so often, like Tiger has, it's easier to manage. I think he still gets nervous and gets those feelings of wanting to win. I just think he doesn't get overwhelmed by them like some guys do."" But that's all to come. For now, Pickens is concentrating on getting his players in good shape for the tournament. And that means sticking to the same routine. ""It's not Masters week or PGA week. It's what course are we going to? Is it Augusta National, Turnberry or Hazeltine?"" Pickens said. During practice rounds, Pickens will spend around half a day with each of his players. Once the tournament starts. he'll see them during their warm ups and, if required, work through some putting or short game drills after a round. He's confident one of his charges can do the business this week. Cink, Glover and Johnson were all in the top five heading into the final round at WGC-Bridgestone Invitational last weekend. ""They are all probably feeling that they are pretty close,"" he said. But judging by Woods' current form, they will do well to hold him off. Pickens and his players don't discuss Woods, but they do talk about strategies if they are paired with him. ""You have to be prepared for the crowd that follow him. When you play with Tiger you know that there is going to be a lot of chaos and confusion,"" Pickens said. He can't see past Woods this week. ""I'm sure he still struggles with some shots, some putts, like everybody does. But I can't see any weaknesses in his game. I'm just hoping that he's peaked a little early!""","Sports psychologist Dr Morris Pickens has coached the last two major winners .

"(CNN) -- Hosts New Zealand edged out France 8-7 in a nailbiting finish to the Rugby World Cup final in Auckland Sunday to win the William Webb Ellis trophy for the second time. It was a repeat of their success in the inaugural competition on their home soil in 1987, but it was far from the easy victory that many had predicted. Watched by a capacity 61,000 in the Eden Park Stadium, and with the hopes of a rugby-mad nation on their shoulders, the All Blacks led 5-0 at halftime thanks to a try from prop Tony Woodcock. Scrum-half Piri Weepu, missed the conversion and two other penalty kicks that would have given them a more comfortable advantage. Stephen Donald, who replaced the injured Aaron Cruden at fly-half, put the home side 8-0 ahead when he slotted home an early second half penalty. But back came France as a sustained attack led to a try for captain Thierry Dusautoir, converted by Francois Trinh-Duc, who was on as a replacement for the injured Morgan Parra. Trinh-Duc had an excellent chance with 15 minutes left to kick a penalty which would have put Les Bleus ahead but his effort went wide. France, given little chance after losing by 20 points to the All Blacks in the pool phase, were pressing at the end but desperate home defense kept New Zealand ahead. At the final whistle the All Blacks players celebrated with a mixture of triumph and sheer relief they had finally laid to rest a 24-year litany of failure in Rugby's showpiece international competition. There were also wild scenes of celebration among the estimated 150,000 people who had gathered to watch the final on giant screens in Auckland. All Blacks coach Graham Henry admitted the closing minutes had been tense before his side closed out a long-awaited victory. ""I'm just delighted for the boys. We've been the top team in the world for a long time, so it's been a long time coming,"" he told the official Rugby World Cup website. Captain Richie McCaw echoed Henry's sentiments after his side hung on for their slender win. ""We had to dig deeper than ever before and it's hard to get it to sink in, but I am so proud of every single one of them,"" said McCaw, who was one of four All Blacks who had played in the quarterfinal defeat to France in the 2007 World Cup. Dusautoir, whose team had been subjected to such criticism as they scraped into the final, believed their display had been the perfect riposte. ""We showed that France deserved their spot in the final,"" he said.","New Zealand win Rugby World Cup final in Auckland .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- A head-bopping, hip-shaking flurry of drum beats. The soulful screams of a saxophone. The gut-thumping strums of a double bass. And the silky smooth lyrics of Summertime -- the lullaby classic made famous by Ella Fitzgerald -- all under a starlit night. The scene could be straight from an outdoor Jazz festival in New York City. But this is Pakistan -- a country plagued by its reputation for Islamist militancy, corruption and poverty -- and the jazz is courtesy of three New Yorkers and a Texan who make up the Ari Roland Jazz Quartet. The four performed at a 500-seat amphitheater on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, in a country American musicians almost never visit because of security concerns and widespread anti-Americanism. The U.S. State Department helped organize the band's visit as part of a cultural exchange program designed to win Pakistani hearts and minds. ""We don't feel like we're in danger,"" said the band's creator and bassist Ari Roland. ""We're thrilled to be here. We feel welcome, so at home."" The band's visit comes at a time when relations between the U.S. and Pakistani governments are strained. Joint Chiefs Chairman repeats Pakistan claim . The partnership hit a new low when U.S. officials accused Pakistan's top spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence or ISI, of harboring extremists and helping insurgents in Afghanistan. Islamabad hit back with it's own tough talk, accusing Washington of using Pakistan as a scapegoat for its failed policy in the region and warning the U.S. might lose Pakistan as an ally if it continues with the public accusations. The Ari Roland Quartet is under no illusion that it can solve the U.S.-Pakistani rift but jazz can help, they said. ""Music has a history of bringing people together from across the world,"" said Roland. But the band acknowledged the hearts and minds America needs to win were probably not among their audience. The concert was invite only, not open to the public. The guests were mostly foreign diplomats, Pakistani politicians and their families -- many educated in the west, people who probably already like America. Even so, the quartet said this was a start. They drew loud cheers when they performed their jazzed up rendition of Dil Dil Pakistan, the country's most patriotic song. More applause came when they joined Pakistani rock band Fuzon for a song called Friendship is Life. Within seconds American and Pakistani musicians were in soulful synchrony. If only U.S.-Pakistani relations were that easy.","Three New Yorkers and a Texan make up the Ari Roland Jazz Quartet .

"(CNN) -- They spent 69 days in the bowels of the earth, 700 meters deep, not knowing if they would survive. For 17 days after the mine in which they were working collapsed, nobody even knew if they were alive. Friday marks the one-year observance of the fateful incident in Chile that trapped 33 miners who were saved in a miraculous rescue that made headlines around the world. Fame came after the rescue, which faded quicker in their country than abroad, and since then they have traveled to several destinations all-expenses-paid, though many report having money problems. Four of the miners will observe the anniversary of the event that changed their lives in Washington where an exhibit in their honor is being opened at the Smithsonian Institution. Mario Sepulveda, one of the miners attending, reflected on the historical significance of the event. ""In spite of our painful experience, it is very important to us that what is being exhibited will show the world what happened,"" Sepulveda said. He was the second to be rescued from the mine. Since they were rescued last October, the miners have traveled the world. Edison Pena, the miner whose underground workouts in the darkness garnered attention, ran the New York Marathon less than a month after being rescued. Pena also appeared on ""The Late Show with Dave Letterman"" on CBS where he impersonated his idol, Elvis Presley. Then, in January, he was invited as a guest of honor to the Graceland Mansion, in Memphis, Tennessee. Pena had dreamed of visiting the mansion since he became an Elvis fan as a teenager. In January, the entire group of 33 was honored at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. While there, they served as honorary Grand Marshals of Disney's Main Street U.S.A parade. They spent a full week in Orlando enjoying the attractions. But at home in Chile celebrity has not been what they expected, according to one of the miners, Jorge Galleguillos. The good will from their country faded fast, he said. ""They love us more abroad. They congratulate us, they want to touch us and get a blessing from us. That's not the case in Chile. Only a few greet us with affection; many more say hi with envy,"" Galleguillos said. A movie about the miners' ordeal is in the works. According to the Hollywood Reporter, producer Mike Medavoy (""Shutter Island"", ""Black Swan"") has snapped up the right to the story and Jose Rivera (""Motorcycle Diaries"") has been enlisted to adapt the screenplay. But at home, relations with the Chilean government are strained. Thirty-one of the 33 miners filed a lawsuit accusing the agency that oversees mining of failing to ensure safety measures. Carlos Barrios, the 13th miner rescued, says they're not targeting President Sebastian Pinera. ""We're not suing the current president. This has been happening for a long time. This happened during the administrations of other presidents. Why didn't they take a closer look [at the situation]?"" Barrios asked. Hernan de Solminihac, the Chilean mining minister, said his government respects the miners' right to sue. ""As any Chilean citizen, the miners have the freedom and the right to file any lawsuit they wish. They have chosen to do so and our judicial authorities are evaluating the suit,"" he said. The miners are seeking the equivalent of $16 million in damages for the collapse of the mine where they were trapped last year in the Chilean Atacama desert. They say their lawsuit isn't about the money, but about raising awareness about the working conditions for miners in their country, which they say, has been neglected for a long time.","Friday is the one-year anniversary of the Chile mine collapse .

"(CNN) -- It's early in the morning, but the soldiers in their camouflage uniforms have already been awake for several hours. They're getting their gear ready, making sure all of their safety equipment, hooks, belts, and straps are in working order. Nothing seems out of the ordinary, until you take a closer look. Among the 270 recruits getting their basic paratrooper training, there are 71 women. After a 50-minute check-up, they all board military planes that will take off from the Santa Lucia Military Air Base near Mexico City. This is the first time in 22 years that women in the Mexican armed forces are being trained as paratroopers. The program was suspended in 1989 for unspecified reasons. Now it's back again, but officials haven't said if it will instituted permanently. Once they reach an altitude of 1,500 feet, it's time to jump and put into practice the four weeks of training they have received. It's a small jump for these women soldiers, but one giant leap for the Mexican military. Corporal Raquel Gutierrez is among the first women who signed up for paratrooper training. ""I think this is an activity that only a few can do. We are a group of women who have decided to enter a space previously reserved for men,"" Gutierrez says. For the Mexican military, training women as paratroopers means more personnel at the ready; many in Mexico also see this training as an important step towards gender equality. Basic paratrooper training in the Mexican military takes four weeks. Trainees have the opportunity to jump off a plane five times. For Corporal Norma Flores being part of this training is one of the most exciting things she's done in her life. ""It's a very beautiful experience and, honestly, I'm very proud. I want to learn a lot of things here in the Army and, well, it's a good opportunity to serve our country,"" Flores says. Army officials say the training that these women are going through is exactly the same men take. There's no special treatment or relaxing of the rules. The goal is that paratroopers are equally trained, capable, and safe, regardless of their gender. Colonel Bernardino Olvera, who's in charge of this phase of paratrooper training, says safety and preparedness are paramount. ""We can't make any distinctions [between men and women] because there are no parachutes for men or women. Training has to be the same,"" Olvera says. First Sergeant Miriam Rivera says that, after all, the fear you feel right before jumping off the plane has no gender. ""It's true that you always have some fear, but with the training that we have received during the whole month we learn to change fear for an adrenaline rush in order to jump off the plane,"" Rivera says. Once the training is over, the seven female officers and 64 soldiers will return to their normal duties. the Mexican Army has yet to establish the option of being a paratrooper as a career choice for women entering the forces, a limitation that based on this training may be about to change.","A group of women is training to be paratroopers in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- With spring break nearing, my mother contacted my father and arranged for Paul and me to visit him again in Princeton. He suggested that we arrive on a Sunday, and since she had a class to teach the next day, she told us that she would drive us as far as New York and put us on a train the rest of the way. When we got to Penn Station, she bought us two tickets, and half an hour later Paul and I got off at Princeton Junction and started looking around the little station for my father. He was nowhere to seen. A middle-aged white couple walked over to us. ""Do you remember me?"" the man asked. ""I'm Hube Wilson, an old friend of your dad's."" ""Yes,"" I said. ""We met you in California a long time ago."" ""I remember it well,"" he said. ""But I had a different wife then."" ""I'm his new wife,"" the woman said, putting out her hand. ""I knew you too when you both were little boys. My name is Gina."" I didn't remember her. ""Where's Dad?"" I asked. ""He's under the weather,"" Hube said. ""He asked us to pick you up. He'll be at home when you get there."" The Wilsons grabbed our duffel bags and took us to their car. It was an ordinary sedan, not the VW bus I remembered from Venice. They did their best to make small talk, remarking on how much we had grown and asking how we liked school. But it was awkward, and Hube no longer matched the matinee idol image I had of him in my mind. His hair had gone white and his face was etched with deep wrinkles. When we arrived at the apartment, I noticed that the blinds were drawn. Hube rang the bell and we waited for over a minute before my father opened the door. He said hello and gave my brother and me a hug, but his embrace felt weak and he looked tired. It took several minutes before he said anything about my appearance. ""It looks like you've lost some weight, Mark,"" he said wanly. Is that it? I thought, dejectedly. Is that all you're going to say? I lost eighty pounds and you barely even noticed? He had prepared sandwiches and iced tea for lunch. The Wilsons stayed and chatted while Paul and I ate. My father smoked and drank coffee and didn't touch anything on his plate. When the Wilsons left, he told us that there wasn't much to do in Princeton on Sundays but that he had plans to take us sightseeing and to a movie the next day. He suggested that we might want to take a nap. I wasn't tired, so I browsed through the bookshelves in the living room to find something to read. I picked out ""The Godfather,"" by Mario Puzo, and quickly became engrossed by the opening scenes of the big wedding and the horse's head in the movie producer's bed. For dinner, he reheated spaghetti he emptied from a plastic container in the refrigerator and made garlic bread in a toaster oven. ""I remember how much you like garlic bread,"" he said. Paul and I got into our pajamas and climbed into the sofa bed that he had prepared in his upstairs study. He kissed us goodnight and went down the stairs. I still wasn't sleepy, and as I lay awake thinking, I heard the front door open and close. Where's Dad going? I wondered. Is it okay for Paul and me to be here by ourselves? Then about twenty minutes later, I heard the door open again and the sound of my father's footsteps. Relieved that he was home, I drifted off. Paul was sound asleep when I awoke the next morning. I listened for other noises but didn't hear any. I felt hungry, so I rose quietly and tiptoed downstairs to see if I could find something to eat. The kitchen in his condo was small and modern, with a little eating counter and bar stool. I didn't know exactly what sizes liquor came in, but I could tell that the Beefeater bottle on the counter was the big kind. There was still some liquid left in it, but not much, only a tiny bit at the bottom. Next to it was a pumpkin pie. It was the storebought variety in a tin shell, not like the pies my mother made from scratch for Thanksgiving. The center had been scooped out, as if by a scavenging animal. There were no slices, just an ugly hole in the middle. I stood there for a long time, trying to figure out the meaning of what I saw in front of me. It reminded me of the still-life paintings in my mother's big books about French art, only with a gruesome twist. Had Dad done this? I wondered. Did he drink that whole bottle of gin? Was that why he went out at night, to go to a liquor store? And why would he eat the pie that way? Was he so drunk he couldn't even hold a knife and fork? I heard Paul getting up. I didn't want him to see the sad tableau, so I hid the bottle and the pie in the back of the refrigerator. I made us toast for breakfast, and we sat around waiting for my father to wake up. Sometime after noon, I smelled cigarette smoke upstairs. Then there was the sound of a phone being dialed and my father talking in a low voice. At last he came downstairs, covered only by a terrycloth bathrobe. ""I'm sorry, boys,"" he said. ""I have to leave. I've called your grandmother in Pittsburgh and she's going to come to take care of you."" ""Where are you going?"" I asked anxiously. ""Back to the hospital,"" he said. ""I wanted to get well to spend time with you boys, but I'm sick again and have to go back."" He went back upstairs, and Paul and I sat there in the living room until sundown, dazed and disappointed, not knowing what to think about what was happening. The next day Grandmother Edith arrived, and a taxi came to take my father away. He must have been too proud to call my mother, because she only learned what had happened when Grandmother phoned her to make plans to meet at Aunt Cleo's. On the train ride to New York, Grandmother Edith tried to keep our spirits up, but I could see how distraught she was. ""Do you know we're going to France next year?"" I asked, hoping to say something that would make us both feel better. ""Yes, Jeanne told me,"" she said. ""I think it will be a wonderful experience for you boys."" ""And what about Dad?"" I asked. ""Do you think he'll be okay while we're gone?"" There was a long pause before she answered.

"(CNN) -- World champion Thor Hushovd continued his superb Tour de France by powering to victory in Friday's 152.5km 13th stage of the race from Pau to Lourdes. Norwegian Hushovd, who wore the leader's yellow jersey for seven days earlier in the race, was one of 10 riders who broke clear of the peloton after 57km, as the overall leaders kept their powder dry ahead of Saturday's tough stage in the mountains. Frenchman Jeremy Roy, who made a brave bid to win Thursday's stage before being caught on the final climb up to Luz-Ardiden, was also in the breakaway group, and he tried the same tactic again when he made another bold bid for success on the day's big climb -- the Col d'Aubsique. However, unlike Thursday uphill finish, Friday's major climb came 42km from the end of the stage, with a long downhill descent before a flat finish into Lourdes. And Hushovd used all his strength to catch the unfortunate Roy with just 2km remaining to win by 10 seconds, with David Moncoutie also catching and passing exhausted compatriot Roy, who was 26 seconds back in third place. The rest of the breakaway group finished in dribs and drabs ahead of the main pack, who came home over seven-and-a-half minutes behind, with all the leading contenders finishing together. There was no change in the overall classification, with Frenchman Thomas Voeckler remaining 1:49 ahead of  Frank Schleck, with Cadel Evans 2:06 down in third position. Defending champion Alberto Contador, who lost a few seconds on the leaders on Thursday, remains seventh -- exactly four minutes behind Voeckler -- while the only change in the top 10 saw Belgian Philippe Gilbert, who led the race after the first stage, move up to ninth overall after attacking the peloton on the descent to the line to gain 50 seconds. The victory maintains Hushovd's remarkable Tour record. He has now won nine individual stages, including at least one victory in the last six Tours, as well as taking the green points jersey in 2005 and 2009. He is also the first rider to win a stage of the Tour de France whilst wearing the famous rainbow bands of the world champion's jersey, since Spain's Oscar Freire in 2002. ""I find it hard to believe where that display came from, but I'm happy. To win solo like that wearing the rainbow jersey is something else,"" Hushovd told reporters. A disconsolate Roy, who did collect the climber's polka dot jersey as a consolation after once again going close to claiming his first-ever stage victory, said: ""It's too hard to take. I think I will have a lot of trouble digesting this."" Meanwhile, the stage saw three more riders abandon the race, with the highest profile being Radioshack's Andreas Kloden, twice runner-up in the race, who quit following a successions of crashes throughout the last two weeks. Saturday's 168.5km 14th stage from Saint-Gaudens to Plateau de Beille is likely to be a key day in the destination of this year's race, with the field tackling six major climbs before the 15.8km ascent to the finish.","Norway's Thor Hushovd claims victory in the 13th stage of the Tour de France .

"(WIRED) -- Apple will announce the iPad 2 next Wednesday, as made rather obvious by invites sent out to press this morning. Apart from the new iPad, that means one thing: speculation. I'm not immune, so here's my list of things I think will make it into an already capable machine. I have stuck to features, rather than things like CPU speed, as the internal specifics matter less than what they actually enable you to do. Cameras . Obvious, this one. We're almost certain there will be a front-facing camera for FaceTime and other webchat applications, but I really don't care. I'll use that for Skype once in a while and that's it. What I want is a decent rear-facing camera, like that in the iPhone (not the crippled piece of junk in the iPod Touch). Why? Because it would be so useful, and not just for photography. Augmented reality, Instagram, scanning things, snapping photos and then drawing on top of them, the list goes on. One of the things I took away from all the tablets I tried at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last week was just how good a camera is on a big device. It seems like it would be awkward, but the big screen is great for composing and the size turns out not to matter at all. Speakers . The single iPad speaker isn't bad, but for movies and music you really want something beefier, and preferably in stereo. The rumors point to at least one big speaker grille on the back of the iPad's case. Currently I get around this with an assortment of Bluetooth speakers around my apartment, but I'd rather do without them. SD card slot . This one would be purely for importing photos and video. Basically, it would be nothing more than a built-in camera connection kit. The Apple's Camera Connection Kit is great, but it is one more thing to lose and carry. I use my iPad more and more for processing photos (courtesy of Photogene and FX PhotoStudioHD), and until I can send direct from my camera via Eye-Fi, a slot is a lot more convenient than yet another dongle in my bag. A better connector . The 30-pin dock connector is one of the worst things Apple has made (the other is ""all mice it has ever created""). It is symmetrical, so it's hard to put in the right way in bad light. It's delicate (the cord breaks easily where it enters the plug) and worst of all, it's huge. In fact, the iPod Nano is barely big enough for the connector slot. The likeliest candidate for a replacement is Light Peak, or Apple's rumored implementation of it, Thunderbolt, which might show up in this week's new MacBook Pros. This could be a small port that could carry power and data of any kind. That in itself would be good enough, but you know what I'd really like? A Thunderbolt data-cable with a MagSafe plug. That would be just about perfect. Better case . The size and weight of the current iPad are just fine. Anyone who complains that a 1.5 pound sliver of aluminum and glass is too heavy needs to shut up and go join a gym. But it is slippery. I keep mine in Apple's own case 24/7. This is partly to protect the screen, but mostly to stop me dropping it, especially when I'm walking on crutches with it tucked under my arm. A little more friction on the back would help a lot. Perhaps a plastic rear, or just a grippy coating. Bonus: The screen . This is a small request. I don't want a retina display (or rather I do, but I don't want the current penalties of price and battery life associated with it). All I want is a dimmer screen. The brightness at the top end is fine, but even at its dimmest setting, the screen is too bright for using indoors at night. It's true, I keep my apartment fairly dim (I call it ""moody and romantic,"" but you may call it ""cheap""), but unless you keep your place lit up like an office, the screen glows a little too much. Those are my requests. What about yours? Do you want a built in printer? A near-field communications chip to turn your iPad into the world's biggest wallet? Or even a flashlight?

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of Vice, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. Motherboard.tv is Vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- Last year, Motherboard went to Bent Festival , the world's premier meeting of circuit benders, music hackers, and broken Speak n' Spells. We spent a day at 81 Front St. in Dumbo, where hackers young and old, expert and amateur, came to break electronics in order to put them back together again, in the DIY spirit of groups like NYC Resistor and musicians like Reed Ghazala and Morton Subotnick. At night, a healthy roster of chiptune musicians and others made music with their homemade gear. Our visit last year started out as an average Saturday at the Dumbo, Brooklyn outlet of Mikey's Hook Up, an Apple retailer and repair specialist. Well-groomed arty-types came in, alone, in couples, with lattes in hand, all there to admire the shiny wares or bring in their dead laptop for repair. The air was quiet, calm, tinged with some nail biting concern about lost files, perhaps, but mainly confident. In other words, no sign of the kind of melee happening in the art space just across the street, where the Bent Festival, the annual circus of the art of ""circuit bending,"" was happening. There, scattered impromptu groups of hardware hackers were tearing their gadgets apart, literally, in an attempt to do their own kind of fixing. Their only assistance came from men in worn T-shirts and beards whose advice consisted mainly of how to solder circuits together and the best way to break open plastic cases. To open one piece of electronics, someone resorted to simply throwing it at the floor, again and again, until its tiny tinny speaker started making death groans. (Later, he would add a new, louder speaker, and make it make stranger sounds.) Steve Jobs would have been scandalized. The gadgets in question weren't the sleek new phones and laptops being serviced across the street, but mainly plastic kids' toys from the 1980s, built in China cheaply and at breakneck speed. Just as quickly had they been forgotten and trashed, which partly explained their presence, in various states of disassembly, on the workbenches. But apart from being cheap and easy to hack (the smaller and sleeker gadgets have become, the harder they have become to break apart), these all had another thing going for them: they made beeping sounds. If you're really lucky, some of them, like the Speak 'n' Spell, even talk. Crack open a toy walkie talkie or a generic mini keyboard, rip off the coverings (sometimes there's even scotch tape inside), press a button, and simply lick a finger and touch a circuit. A short will cause the beep to become a bleeooooop, or a danger to become a dddddreeerrrrrrrrr. Wire an output to the speaker wire, plug in an amp, and you've got an outer-space music box fit for an intense audio-visual extravaganza. Watch Hypnotizing Electronics: The Bent Festival at Motherboard.tv . While beginners and more expert circuit benders tinkered in workshops, small bands of musicians were huddled in the corners, preparing their homemade instruments for an all-out exposition of exploded instruments. At one point near the end of the night, a musician called Computer at Sea (and introduced as ""the handsomer Dan Deacon,"" though that would only barely approximate his sound), began his set by excitedly rallying the audience the only way that would have made sense -- inviting them up to play his instruments. My hand shot up before he was finished asking, and soon it was on a keyboard, on a Simon Says knockoff, and there were all the other hands surrounding the table's electronic feast, bathing in the torrent of sound and light and energy of our own creation. It wasn't just the most fun I'd had at a concert in a while; it was the best kind of fun. Like the toys we were all playing, the music came in all shapes and sizes, in bright colors and from another world. The best part: the musicians, like everyone else, weren't just pressing buttons to get them to play music. They were making the buttons themselves.

"(CNN) -- From Captain Kirk on ""Star Trek"" to Denny Crane on ""Boston Legal,"" William Shatner has been a fixture on television for decades. William Shatner has a new talk show and has written an autobiography. Even as his latest series comes to an end, the actor is busier than ever. He has written an autobiography, ""Up Till Now,"" and he has a new talk show -- ""Shatner's Raw Nerve"" on the Biography channel --billed as an ""edgy and off-beat celebrity interview series."" Shatner talked with CNN's Kyra Phillips about his career, past and present. CNN: ""Boston Legal,"" what a finale: a wedding between Denny and fellow lawyer and best friend Alan. Don't they know that Proposition 8 [passed]? Shatner: It was all a financial guise, as you learned to your dismay. There was nothing sexual about our marriage. It was all designed to bequeath my fortune to him as [my character] got ready to die. CNN: ""Boston Legal"" was a brilliant show: the writing, your famous wit. You must have had a blast doing the show. Shatner: We laughed our way through five years of great joy, great entertainment, and we got some wonderful awards during the years and the beauty of it all was that when we came in this season, we knew we were going to do 13 shows and be out. So the writing reflected the fact that we knew we were ending and it wrapped the whole show up. CNN: I cannot believe you have a porn queen [Jenna Jameson] on your talk show. Shatner: We like to call her an adult film star. She turns out to be highly sensitive, vulnerable. ... This is a remarkable interview of a woman who is terribly vulnerable and expresses it. It was so good, we're doing a two-parter. CNN: Who has been your favorite leading lady? Shatner: They go down in the hoary mists of history. The effects of age -- they all meld into one and it looks like my wife. CNN: You reveal a lot in your book. Who would you say your ultimate mentor has been through your life?

"LONDON, England  -- Almost 25,000 people will die this year of HIV/AIDS in Myanmar unless lifesaving treatment is significantly increased, according to a new report. A Doctors Without Borders worker handing out HIV/AIDS drugs in Myanmar. The study produced by leading international humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders said the failure by the government to provide HIV/AIDS treatment to its people is putting the population at risk. An estimated 240,000 people are thought to have HIV/AIDS in Myanmar with 76,000 of those people facing death unless they receive antiretroviral (ART) drug, the report published Tuesday said. Fewer than 20 percent of the people  are are able to access ART, according to the organization. Currently, Doctors Without Borders says it is almost the sole provider of these lifesaving drugs --providing them to more than 11,000 people. ""It is unacceptable that a single NGO is treating the vast majority of HIV patients in a crisis of this magnitude,"" the charity's Operations Manager Joe Belliveau, said in a press release. The pressure on its resources means the charity has been forced to turn away patients. ""Sometimes I wake up at midnight and dream of my patients. Women who come in are HIV positive --they have three children at home and the husband has passed away and we cannot provide any treatment for them,"" a doctor quoted in the research said. The government and international communities have provided very little to the crisis, Belliveau added. The government of Myanmar allocated just $200,000 for HIV/AIDS in 2008, which is one of the lowest amount spent worldwide, according to Doctors Without Borders. Drugs that are not provided by aid organizations or the government cost a patient $29 per month. With most people in Myanmar living on an average of $1.20 per day, the cost of drugs is unaffordable for most. The charity also appealed for intervention by the international community to avert the crisis. Myanmar currently receives around $3 per person in aid-- one of the lowest rates worldwide. One reason for this may be that international donor groups are reluctant to send aid to Myanmar, a country run by a strict military junta widely criticized for its atrocious human rights record. The report states aid agencies may be put off by challenges Myanmar imposes such as strict constraints and difficult bureaucratic procedures. Earlier this year when a deadly cyclone hit Myanmar that killed almost 100,000 people and left millions homeless, the government turned away international aid to the frustration of many organizations. Doctors Without Borders has been providing essential healthcare services in Myanmar since 1993 and began an integrated program in 2003 to support people living with HIV/AIDS.","HIV/AIDS treatment in Myanmar needs to improve drastically says a report .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South Africa's president fired two ministers and suspended his chief of police Monday after they were implicated in the misuse of millions of dollars of public funds. The actions by President Jacob Zuma against ministers Sicelo Shiceka and Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde, and chief of police Bheki Cele come after instances of misappropriation cited in a report released this month by South Africa's Public Protector's office. The report found that Shiceka, the minister of cooperative governance, spent tens of thousands of dollars on a luxury trip to Switzerland ""to visit a jailed lady friend,"" and found that Cele and Mahlangu-Nkabinde ""irregularly authorized lease agreements for the procurement of police offices worth millions of dollars."" Shiceka spent more than $9,000 of government money on luxury travel, according to the report, including a trip to Switzerland that he told Zuma was related to the FIFA 2010 World Cup, which South Africa was hosting, when in fact its ""only aim"" was to visit a friend of Shiceka's at the Anstalten Hindelbank prison in Bern, ""which he did on two occasions,"" the public protector's report reads. In Monday's news conference in Pretoria, Zuma said he had established a board of inquiry to look into allegations of misconduct against Cele ""in relation to the procurement of office accommodation for the South African Police Service, as per the findings and recommendations of the Public Protector."" South Africa's previous police chief, Jackie Selebi, was convicted of corruption last year. Zuma also formally announced a commission of inquiry which will investigate the country's multimillion-dollar arms procurement contract, from which the president himself has been accused of corruptly benefiting. Corruption charges against Zuma were dropped in 2009 after prosecutors determined that the investigation was politically motivated. The Congress of South African Trade Unions praised Zuma's announcement, saying it hoped the actions mark ""a turning point in the fight against maladministration and corruption."" ""From now on there must be a policy of zero-tolerance to the looting of public resources by anyone, in the public or private sector, no matter how senior their position,"" the trade union organization said. This is the second shakeup in Zuma's cabinet since he took office in 2009. He has been widely criticized in South Africa for indecisiveness and lacking authority, and he is expected to be challenged next year when his African National Congress holds an elective conference. This week, the ruling party's youth league is embarking on mass protest action against poverty and joblessness in the country.","President Jacob Zuma dismisses two Cabinet ministers, suspends police chief .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Residents of Thailand's Munag Ake village are being urged to evacuate the area early Tuesday morning, according to Thailand's Flood Relief Operations Center. The center's director said parts of a dike at Tambon Lak Hok, MuangÂ District,Â PathumÂ Thani province have broken and a mass of water is expected to flow into the village. Flood waters could reach almost five feet (1.5 meters) in the village. The FROC said the Royal Thai Armed Forces will have vehicles at Rangsit University in Munag Ake village and will be moving residents out of the area. In addition, the Thai Cabinet announced Tuesday public holidays for the end of the month due to anticipated high tides, which could further devastate the flood-ravaged country. The holidays will be from Thursday to next Monday and will be effective in 21 provinces that are still under water, including Bangkok and its suburban provinces, a government spokeswoman said. ""The government would like to give time to people in affected areas to prepare for floods during high tide periods between (October) 28 to 30. Some people who have houses outside Bangkok could be able to live there during flood period,"" said Thitima Chaiseang, the government spokeswoman. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra urged employers in both the private and public sectors to allow time off for staff affected by the floods. In addition to allowing time off, Thailand's Public Health Minister Wittaya Buranasiri has ordered health units be established to help ease the stress of residents. He said there are about 100,000 people suffering from stress related to the flooding. Also, starting Tuesday, the CEO of Nok Air announced the airline is canceling flights in and out of Bangkok's Don Muang Airport until October 31 due to the ""flood crisis."" . Pate Sarasin, CEO of Nok Air, posted a Twitter message saying ""the water level is now at a critical area at the northern part of the runway."" Nok Air is allowing customers to change their flights free of charge. On Monday, floodwaters in Bangkok reached Don Muang Airport, one of the Thai capital's two main airports and home to the flood relief operation command, according to a governor. In addition to Don Muang, residents in five other areas should prepare for floods, move their belongings to upper floors and take shelter at evacuation centers, Governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra said in a news conference on Monday. Thammasat University's gymnasium, which has been used as an evacuation center, is also flooded and without electricity and is itself being evacuated, the governor added. As a remedy, about 4,000 people will be bused to Rajamangala Stadium in central Bangkok with the help of 300 to 400 volunteers, according to the governor. In the east, the industrial estates of Lat Krabang and Bang Chan remained under threat, and volunteers were sought for help with sandbagging. The governor urged the public not to panic and to follow his reports closely. Protecting Bangkok was a priority because it comprises the economic heart of Thailand, Prime Minister Yingluck told CNN Sunday. ""But it doesn't mean we have no concern for the people who are suffering from the flooding,"" she added. The decision to divert water through canals in Bangkok means parts of the city and its surrounding suburbs, such as Rangsit, are flooded. Residents have resorted to moving out of flooded homes by boat or anything that could float -- or wading through water with plastic bags of belongings balanced on their heads or pets tucked into clothes. The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said some areas might require more than a month before waters recede. More high tides are expected in the coming week, which could cause rivers to back up, further raising water levels, according to Thailand's Flood Relief Operations Command. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge. Many residents waded through dirty water in the capital in recent days, as they made a desperate attempt to save their belongings. The flooding has already killed 356 people, with nearly 9 million others affected, authorities said. Overall damage from the floods has risen and could top $6 billion, with the worst yet to come as the waters destroy shops and paralyze factories nationwide, the Thai Finance Ministry said. Thailand derives a significant portion of its revenue from tourism, which has been hurt by the flooding. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Residents of Munag Ake village are being urged to evacuate after parts of an area dike broke .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of bomb attacks throughout Iraq left 35 people dead and scores injured, officials with Iraq's Interior Ministry and police said Sunday. At least 28 people were killed in a suicide bombing attack in a Sunni mosque in the Ghazaliya neighborhood in western Baghdad late Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said. At least 37 others were wounded in the attack. A Sunni member of Parliament, Khalid al-Fahdawi, was among the dead. In Tarmiyah, about 40 kilometers north of Baghdad, two people were killed and five were wounded after a bomb exploded near a Sunni mosque as worshippers finished up a nightly prayer for the celebrations of Ramadan, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Also Sunday, an bomb explosion killed two people in the Baghdad's Shiite-majority neighborhood of Jadriya, the spokesman said. In Mosul, six roadside bombs exploded in the town's center, wounding five police officers and two civilians. Also, on the highway that connects Mosul to Syria, a roadside bomb exploded on an Iraqi army convoy, leaving two wounded. In a separate incident, one man was killed after being attacked by gunmen. Two people were killed in Fallujah, officials said. Some of the attacks appeared to target policemen, the spokesman said. According to intelligence analysts with SITE, the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) vowed to step up attacks in the country to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden. In a jihadist forum intercepted by intelligence officials on August 19, ISI leaders said they would conduct several phases of its ""Plan of the Good Harvest"" campaign, SITE reported, one of which would take place during the holy month of Ramadan. However, previous attacks against Sunnis have been associated with Shiite militias, Iraqi analysts say. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and journalist Muhaiman Mohammed contributed to this report.","At least 28 die in a suicide attack on a Sunni mosque; victims include a member of Parliament .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Sometimes, a film is so powerful that it haunts you long after you've left the theater. Usually, it's because of the weight of the message. The film haunting me is ""The Blind Side."" And the message? I'll leave that to Leigh Anne Tuohy to explain. Tuohy and her husband, Sean, are the subjects of the new movie, ""The Blind Side."" The film is an adaptation of the 2006 book, ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"" by Michael Lewis. It tells the incredible story of Michael Oher, who went from being a homeless inner-city high school student whose father was dead and whose mother was a crack addict to a star lineman at the University of Mississippi -- eventually being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft. The Ravens recently signed the 6-5, 309-pound Oher to a 5-year, $13.8 million contract. This American Dream is brought to us not just by Oher's talent, perseverance, and hard work but also by the fact that he was adopted by the Tuohys. The white, wealthy Memphis family not only fed and clothed Michael but also loved him as one of their own along with daughter Collins and son Sean Jr. The ""Blind Side"" is the No. 2 film in America, and the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy is played to perfection by Sandra Bullock. Still, some critics dismissed the film as hokey and condescending, with one calling it the latest chapter in Hollywood's ""long, troubled history of well-meaning white paternalism, with poor black athletes finding success through white charity."" They missed the point. Simply put, there's a lot that any one of us can do to improve the life of our fellow man. And the fact that we do it is its own reward. ""He had a much greater impact on our lives than we did on his life,"" Leigh Anne said in a recent interview. ""You have this child, and you bring him in, and you realize how fortunate you are, how you're blessed to have family, you're blessed to have your health. So much in life you take for granted."" There's the message: So much in life you take for granted. We've forgotten how lucky we are, because we're busy cursing fate. We've stopped being grateful for what we have, because we somehow find it more satisfying to complain about what we don't. Until we meet someone who has much less than we do. So much in life you take for granted. As Americans, we've become victims of our own success. We've strayed so far from the example of our immigrant parents and grandparents that we bear no resemblance to that model. Weighed down by own bloated sense of entitlement and self-importance, we've lost our appetite for competition and we prefer to talk instead about what we think we ""deserve."" At the first sign of adversity, we play the victim, give up, or fall apart. With all the blessings that come with living in the world's most remarkable country, still we complain. We retreat. We whine. Here in the Golden State, thousands of students at the University of California turned out to protest a 32 percent fee increase. I wrote a column, expressing disappointment that these ""brats"" consider a publicized subsidized college education an entitlement and telling them to go get jobs if their education is that important to them. I heard back from many of their parents who, angrily rising to their children's defense, informed me -- in incompatible narratives -- that either there were no jobs or their kids already had two of them. How about that? Bratty parents. Apparently, in California, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. After a few days of that noise, I was ready for a movie where, in one of the more poignant scenes, a young man is given his own bedroom and remarks that he's ""never had one before."" Not a room but a bed. In another scene, Michael is so grateful to be at Thanksgiving dinner that he respectfully sits at the dining room table while the rest of the family plops down in front of the television. In another scene, he requests a driver's license just so he can have something with his name on it. So much in life we take for granted. I saw the movie in a well-to-do suburb north of San Diego. The crowd cheered, laughed, and cried. When it was over, there were smiles all around. I wondered: For all we've acquired, what have we lost -- and look to movies like this to replenish? The scene about the bed made me want to run home and gather up every one of my kids' toys and give them to Goodwill. And, I tell you, the next time they ask for something they don't need, they're getting a paper route. Or at least they would if they weren't a preschooler and a toddler. In one scene, Leigh Anne interrupts football practice to give Michael a helpful tip for a lineman -- treat the team like your family and protect the family. She tells the startled football coach: ""You can thank me later."" Treat yourself to a nice present this holiday season. See this movie. You can thank me later. The opinions expressed by this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","A new film, ""The Blind Side,"" tells inspirational story of hope and caring, says Ruben Navarrette Jr.
He says film points up how fortunate most Americans are .
Rather than appreciate their luck, many wallow in complaints about obstacles, he says .

"(CNN) -- When John Lennon remarked in 1966 that the Beatles were then ""more popular than Jesus"" his comments prompted outrage in the United States. But this weekend the Vatican's newspaper paid tribute to the band on the 40th anniversary of the release of the ""White Album"" in an article interpreted by some as a papal pardon for Lennon. John Lennon appears with wife Yoko Ono in 1968, two years after he made his ""more popular than Jesus"" comments. CNN's Alessio Vinci spoke to Steve Turner, author ""The Gospel According To The Beatles,"" about the controversy that helped to end the Beatles' touring career. Q: Was Lennon surprised by the storm his comment generated? A: I think John Lennon was surprised because it had been said in a casual way to a journalist who was a personal friend of his and he had no idea it would cause that sort of controversy. When it did happen he was actually quite frightened because they were about to go off on tour and there were these threats to their lives and a clairvoyant made some predictions that their plane would crash. It was really quite frightening and they wanted to cancel the tour but they knew they couldn't. They were under obligation to the tour promoters. And when he made his apology in Chicago, (the band's) press officer told me that John was actually in tears before he went in to make the apology. Q: Was his apology sincere?  Watch as Vatican pardons Lennon » . A: His apology was very carefully worded. He never said ""I didn't mean that;"" he kind of said, ""if it was taken that way, that's not what I meant,"" but he never actually retracted it. The reason it happened that way, in America particularly, is that people thought the Beatles were getting too big, too proud and it was a way of putting them down and I think people grabbed that opportunity. Q: Did they care at all what the Vatican newspaper had to say at the time? A: I don't know that the Beatles had any particular concern about what the Vatican said. I know the Vatican did say something at the time. But by that time, everybody was pitching in with their opinion, and it just kind of gathered pace. Q: If he were alive, what would he say about his ""rehabilitation?"" A: It's very hard to say what John Lennon would say now if he knew that the pope had forgiven him or the Catholic Church had forgiven him because on the one hand he wrote to an American evangelist called Oral Roberts and said he had been very sorry. But in a book he said he was very glad that it had happened because it effectively ended the Beatles. Because that tour was so bad that it became the last tour the Beatles ever did. So he thought, ""Thank you Jesus for causing this to happen -- because you gave me a solo career."" Q: How spiritual were the Beatles? A: The Beatles started out as atheists and agnostics and I think as everybody knows they became more interested in spiritual things. They went out to India in 1968 and I think in a way the Beatles became a spiritual force themselves. And I think that John actually saw that. He saw Christianity and rock 'n' roll as competitors. Only three years later, after 1966, you had the Woodstock festival and you get rock music almost performing a religious function. So I think in a way he was aware of what was happening. The Beatles were almost becoming a religion and exerting a spiritual force over people.","Author: John Lennon never meant ""more popular than Jesus"" comment to offend .

"(WIRED) -- When Steve Jobs introduced the iPad last January, the biggest surprise wasn't the actual product. (Many shrugged and called the iPad a ""bigger iPhone."") It was the price: Just $500. Nobody expected that number, perhaps because Apple has traditionally aimed at the high end of the mobile computer market with MacBooks marked $1,000 and up. And perhaps we were also thrown off because Apple execs repeatedly told investors they couldn't produce a $500 computer that wasn't a piece of junk. But Apple did meet that price, and the iPad isn't junk. The iPad is still the first, and best-selling, product of its kind. Competitors, meanwhile, are having trouble hitting that $500 sweet spot. Motorola's Xoom tablet is debuting in the United States with an $800 price tag. (To be fair, the most comparable iPad is $730 -- but there's no $500 Xoom planned, and the lack of a low-end entry point will hurt Motorola.) Samsung's Galaxy Tab, with a relatively puny 7-inch screen, costs $600 without a contract. Why is it so hard to get to a lower starting price? And how was Apple able to get there? Jason Hiner of Tech Republic suggests it largely has to do with Apple's retail strategy. Apple now has 300 retail stores worldwide selling iPads directly to customers. That's advantageous, because if the iPad were primarily sold at third-party retail stores, a big chunk of profit would go to those retailers, Hiner reasons. Apple has partnered with a few retail chains such as Best Buy and Walmart, but those stores always seem to get a small number of units in stock. Hiner rationalizes that the true purpose of these partnerships is probably to help spread the marketing message, not so much to sell iPads. ""The company can swallow the bitter pill of hardly making any money from iPad sales through its retail partners because it can feast off the fat profits it makes when customers buy directly through its retail outlets and the web store,"" Hiner says. ""However, companies like Motorola, HP, and Samsung have to make all of their profit by selling their tablets wholesale to retailer partners."" The retail advantage is a reasonable theory, but Hiner neglects to mention the high overhead costs that Apple must pay handsomely for each of its 300 stores. To Hiner's credit, Apple running its own stores does present clear benefits: the customer outreach is enormous, and of course, in Apple stores, Apple products don't have to compete with gadgets sold by rivals on other shelves. But when we try to decipher why the iPad costs $500, we have to consider the sum of all parts, not just the retail strategy. Apple is the most vertically integrated company in the world. In addition to operating its own retail chains, all Apple hardware and software are designed in-house, and Apple also runs its own digital content store, iTunes. Designing in-house means Apple doesn't have to pay licensing fees to third parties to use their intellectual property. For instance, the A4 chip inside the iPad is based on technology developed and owned by Apple (not Intel, AMD or Nvidia). The operating system is Apple's own, not something licensed from Microsoft or Google. Why do you think Hewlett-Packard bought Palm to make the TouchPad? HP wanted ownership of a mobile operating system in-house to take control of its own mobile destiny and stop being so reliant on Microsoft (which, to this day, doesn't have a credible tablet strategy). On the iTunes media platform, Apple takes a cut of each sale made through each of its digital storefronts: the App Store, iBooks and iTunes music and video. iBooks still has a long way to go before it's anywhere near as big as Amazon, but the App Store and iTunes are the most successful digital media stores of their kind. At the end of the day, the iPad might be worth well above $500 for all we know. (Part estimates made by component analysts such as iSuppli aren't very useful because they fail to measure costs of R&D and other factors.) It's most likely that Apple can afford to absorb the costs of producing and selling the iPad because of the tenacious ecosystem backing it, and also because it has such tight oversight over every aspect of the company to control price. That's what it all boils down to: ecosystems and control. Competitors are struggling to match the $500 price point because they aren't as fully integrated as Apple, in terms of retail strategy, a digital content market, hardware and software engineering -- everything. As Steve Jobs famously put it one day, ""Apple is the last company in our industry that creates the whole widget."" Competitors are having trouble beating the iPad widget.

"(CNN) -- Three Marines face court martial proceedings involving the alleged hazing of a Marine who committed suicide in Afghanistan in April. The case drew national attention when Rep. Judy Chu of California, the aunt of the Marine who killed himself, told a congressional committee about it in September. A Marine statement sent to CNN Thursday said the commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division, Brig. Gen. Frederick Padilla, had referred charges in the case against Sgt. Benjamin E. Johns, Lance Cpl. Jacob D. Jacoby, and Lance Cpl. Carlos Orozco III to a general court martial. The three allegedly berated and assaulted Lance Cpl. Harry Lew for falling asleep while on watch when he first arrived in Afghanistan, according to Chu and a Marine investigation of the incident reported by the Marine Corps Times. Lew committed suicide by shooting himself shortly thereafter. ""Harry's death was a heartbreaking tragedy that could have been prevented,"" Chu said Thursday in statement issued by her office. ""The decision by the Marines Corps to bring the three Marines before a jury of their peers brings comfort to the family and shows the military justice system at work."" In her September appearance at a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Chu said her nephew's sergeant told fellow Marines in the unit to ""teach"" the 21-year-old newcomer after he was found asleep on his watch. ""Lance Corporal Lew was beaten, berated and forced to perform rigorous exercise,"" she said then. ""He was forced to do push-ups and leg lifts wearing full body armor, and sand was poured in his mouth. He was forced to dig a hole for hours. He was kicked, punched and stomped on. And it did not stop until 3:20 a.m."" Minutes later, she said, Lew ""climbed into the foxhole that he just dug and shot himself and committed suicide."" A military investigation report obtained by the Marine Corps Times said Lew killed himself with a two- or three-round burst from an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the early hours of April 3. According to the Marine Corps Times story on the report, a message found on Lew's arm, believed to be a suicide note, said: ""May hate me now, but in the long run this was the right choice I'm sorry my mom deserves the truth."" The incident at Patrol Base Gowragi, in Nawa district, began with Lew failing to respond to radio calls late on the night of April 2, the report said. A sergeant who found him sleeping told others that ""peers should correct peers,"" it said, as reported by the Marine Corps Times. The report detailed how two lance corporals, whose names were redacted, berated Lew and ordered him to do exercises in body armor for four hours, with one of them stomping on Lew's legs at times. One Marine kicked and punched Lew until being stopped by another, the report said. Less than an hour later, it said, Lew killed himself. ""At 0343 on 3 April 2011, while crouching down in the fighting position he had just dug, LCpl Lew leaned over his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon as it pointed to the sky, placed the muzzle in his mouth, pulled the trigger, and intentionally killed himself,"" the report said, according to the Marine Corps Times. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","The case involves the suicide of a Marine allegedly berated and beaten by peers .

"(CNN) -- At least six people have died and several others are missing after rains triggered severe flooding in northern Italy, state-run news agency ANSA reported. Heavy rains continued to fall Thursday night in Milan and other spots across the southern European nation, according to the Servizio Meteorologico, Italy's official weather agency. That includes an alert from the agency about intense, widespread rainfall -- potentially with strong wind gusts and hail -- in the regions of Calabria and Basilicata, as well as the eastern part of Sicily. Meanwhile, Monterosso al Mare -- between Genoa and Pisa on Italy's northwest coast, in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria -- has been ""isolated, accessible only by sea"" because of earlier rains and floods, Mayor Angelo Betta told ANSA. So, too, is the nearby town of Vernazza, with even bulldozers and cranes still not able to reach it. That said, Betta reported some progress Thursday thanks to round-the-clock efforts by emergency workers and volunteers to clean up the town. One volunteer in that community died in the flood Wednesday. ""The situation is much better compared to yesterday,"" Betta said. Italy's defense ministry noted Thursday on its website that 348 military personnel have deployed to the provinces of Massa Carrara and La Spezia to assist in the wake of flooding here. Three people were killed after a house collapsed in La Spezia, the news agency stated. ANSA also reported that prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation related to the deaths of two people from flood-related injuries in Aulla. Authorities are assessing whether their deaths had anything to do with faulty work that may have caused the Magra River to overflow. The weather has also caused major travel headaches throughout the region. A mudslide that trapped a truck driver, who was eventually freed, has caused the A12 highway in Liguria to be blocked since Tuesday. Train service in Liguria has been halted, too, due to mud and debris on the tracks. CNN's Marilia Brochetto contributed to this report.","NEW: 348 Italian military personnel are dispatched to help in flood-ravaged areas .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday night's European summit was, well, a very European summit. It lasted forever, included several dramatic moments, ended in the wee hours of the morning and delivered a highly complex result. Yet, the questions that Americans might now ask are quite simple: Has this leaders' conclave succeeded in stopping the spread of the ""contagion"" from the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis? Will the European financial disease reach America's shores and affect local jobs and livelihoods? The answer may seem somewhat paradoxical: While the Europeans have made strides to beat the virus, this crisis is anything but over. The Europeans had been asked to deploy a ""big bazooka,"" a weapon so big and so potent that it would force financial markets into submission. There could be no doubt allowed that the ""euro-Europeans"" (those who share Europe's single currency) would do absolutely everything to preserve the credibility of their currency and restore trust that investments in European bonds remain safe. In the good old days, a president, a prime minister or a chancellor (most likely male) would have stepped up, made a bold decision and presented it to the people in front of a microphone. He would appear to be determined and convinced that he was doing the right thing. Doubt was neither part of his vocabulary nor his demeanor. Indeed, those were the days of the sovereign nation state. But the eurozone is not a sovereign and not a nation. Instead of a prime minister, it has ""Merkozy"" -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- an odd couple who, though unelected in their roles, have stepped into a continental leadership vacuum. Their summit battles with each other and with their 15 colleagues are well-known. While the markets want certainty, Merkozy can only deliver measures saddled with national caveats because they must respect other nations' minority views. It is the nature of Europe's intergovernmental beast that defies the decisiveness that markets demand. Given the political constraints and the convoluted nature of the decision-making, Merkozy and friends have certainly delivered. The complexity of the challenge in the uncharted territory of a monetary union without joint fiscal authority cannot be overstated. Merkozy have lightened the debt load of Greece considerably by talking the banks into a loss of 50% on the face value of their Greek loans; they have ring-fenced other weak nations by introducing a recapitalization mechanism for banks; they have leveraged the existing bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- to a maximum capacity of $ 1.4 trillion; they have pressured Italy into another round of structural and budget reforms; and they have agreed to improve the governance of the currency union by way of treaty change. Not bad for a long weekend that ended Thursday morning. The markets, after initially reacting favorably, will try to poke holes in the carefully constructed edifice. The leaders themselves will have given the markets all the cues. Such is the nature of a consensus body of national leaders that no disagreement and no doubt goes unnoticed, all preparatory documents -- including risk assessments -- have been leaked. Soon, market participants will focus on the architecture of the leveraged bailout fund and its two new special-purpose vehicles, which will be open to outside investors. It is still unknowable whether markets will consider them safe, given that the Europeans, especially the Germans, have insisted on insurance of limited rather than unlimited liability, to guarantee against some of the losses that bondholders might suffer. Most importantly, the leaders cannot control what the banks do next. They might seek new capital -- as is suggested to them -- to reach the new core capital requirement of 9% by next summer. But they might also shrink their balance sheets to get there, thus contributing to a credit crunch and economic contraction. Their participation in the Greek ""haircut"" has been framed as voluntary. But in reality, at that level of a write-down, they are more interested in being forced into an agreement that the markets call a credit event. Such an event triggers an insurance payment to the investors (an insurance scheme called credit default swap kicks in to minimize bank losses). The European leaders want to avoid such a situation for risk of contagion. It will still be quite a dance to avoid the credit event. Again, the outcome is unknowable today. In the end, markets might find that Europe's big bazooka is really mid-sized. In fact, the last few days have revealed that the European firepower is limited. France cannot spend much more cash without endangering the country's triple-A rating. If it loses the top rating, the bailout fund will be downgraded as well, thus increasing Germany's liability. At that point, the whole bailout building will look flimsy. Therefore, it is time for others to come to the rescue. Up until now, the United States has resisted increasing the International Monetary Fund's (and thus also America's) financial involvement. But Washington will need to reconsider, for two reasons of self-interest: The crisis spans the Atlantic, and the two economies are deeply integrated. There will be no American recovery without stabilization in Europe. Thursday morning, the French president talked to the Chinese premier to convince him to invest in Europe's new special-purpose vehicle. Will America want to lose its leverage over Europe to China? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff.","Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff says deal in emergency EU summit promising, crisis not over .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's influential parliament speaker has called for an investigation into allegations that post-election detainees were raped while in custody, state-run media said. Ali Larijani said a parliamentary probe should examine whether jail rape allegations were true or false. Ali Larijani said that a special parliamentary panel ""had carried out investigations into the situation in [Iranian] jails and the treatment of detainees and it should also look into whether jail rape allegations are true or false,"" Press TV reported, citing Tabnak, a Web site associated with opposition politician Mohsen Rezaie. Meanwhile, Iran's Intelligence Ministry, the government body that keeps tabs on political dissenters, warned the media against revealing what it called ""classified data"" after reports Monday that Ahmadinejad had purged four senior intelligence officials, according to Press TV. The ministry said in a statement that publishing ""false news"" could result in exposing vital ""documents, identities of personnel, internal structure"" -- pertaining to the Intelligence Ministry, Press TV reported. ""This subject is among classified material and it is obligatory for all individuals, and especially media supervisors, newspapers, Web sites to refrain from publishing such reports,"" the statement said, adding that the government would pursue prosecution of those who failed to heed the warning. In the aftermath of the election, the media has repeatedly reported on the shuffles within the Intelligence Ministry, including Ahmadinejad's firing of former Minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, which drew the ire of Iran's conservatives. Incidents such as the firings of senior officials have exposed rifts within Iran's ruling elite that began surfacing in the aftermath of the controversial presidential election on June 12 in which Ahmadinejad was officially declared the winner. Thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest and a brutal crackdown by security forces followed. At least 30 people died in the violence and more than 1,000 people were arrested. The call for an investigation of the alleged abuse of those arrested comes on the heels of a letter written by another opposition candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, to the powerful former president of Iran, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Karrubi informed Rafsanjani that a number of detainees had claimed that several women and men, arrested over the course of post-election protests, were sexually assaulted by their jailers. Karrubi asked Rafsanjani to approve an ""impartial committee"" to ""investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved."" ""Young boys held in detention have also been savagely raped,"" Karrubi said, adding that they were suffering from depression and serious physical injuries after the alleged attacks. Rafsanjani was to have delivered this week's Friday sermon but announced he would not be doing so. Rafsanjani backed Ahmadinejad's chief rival Mir Hossein Moussavi in the election and is reported to have fired some bodyguards who said they voted for Ahmadinejad. Rafsanjani -- now head of the Assembly of Experts, the council responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader -- called for the release of post-election detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers. Iran has put on trial some 100 politicians, journalists and activists accused of involvement in the alleged post-election revolution while the treatment of detainees in Iran's prisons has become an increasingly high-profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions. Iranian media have reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak's chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry Monday denied that prisoners had been tortured. ""What kind of talk is this? There was never any pressure used against these people,"" Hassan Qashqavi said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. Separately, a top general with Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard is calling for Karrubi and Mousasvi to be prosecuted, alongside former president Mohammed Khatami, accusing them of fanning the protests that have gripped the nation. They should be tried for attempting to lead a Western-backed ""velvet revolution"" that aimed to topple the regime, the official said.","Parliamentary speaker wants inquiry into allegations detainees were raped in prison .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States on Tuesday imposed financial sanctions on an Iran-based company that it said is a cover for North Korea's missile proliferation network, the Department of the Treasury announced. Hong Kong Electronics in Kish Island, Iran, was added to the list of ""designated proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their supporters"" for working with two others already on the list: North Korea's Tanchon Commercial Bank and the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. (KOMID), according to a Treasury news release. The designation under Executive Order 13382 freezes any U.S. assets of Hong Kong Electronics and prohibits any transactions with the company by U.S. individuals, companies or financial institutions, the statement said. ""North Korea uses front companies like Hong Kong Electronics and a range of other deceptive practices to obscure the true nature of its financial dealings, making it nearly impossible for responsible banks and governments to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate North Korean transactions,"" said Stuart Levey, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury. ""Today's action is a part of our overall effort to prevent North Korea from misusing the international financial system to advance its nuclear and missile programs and to sell dangerous technology around the world."" The Treasury statement alleged that Hong Kong Electronics has transferred millions of dollars of proliferation-related funds on behalf of Tanchon and KOMID since 2007. It also accused Hong Kong Electronics of facilitating the movement of money from Iran to North Korea on behalf of KOMID. Tanchon, a commercial bank based in Pyongyang, North Korea, is the financial arm for KOMID, which the Treasury statement described as North Korea's premier arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. Both Tanchon and KOMID were previously subjected to sanctions under Executive Order 13382 and sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, according to the Treasury statement. It said both also had ties with other sanctioned entities, including Iran's Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, which it called the Iranian organization responsible for developing liquid-fueled missiles.","Hong Kong Electronics called a cover for North Korea's missile proliferation network .

"(CNN) -- Flooding has claimed 102 lives in southwestern Nigeria, where a dam burst and a river overflowed near the city of Ibadan, officials said Wednesday. A rain deluge from Friday night to early Saturday caused the Odo Ona River to overflow and the Eleyele dam to collapse, said Yushau Shuaib of the government's National Emergency Management Agency. Several homes were swept away and temporary camps were set up, Shuaib said. The Nigerian Red Cross, which is helping in the crisis, said earlier this week that more victims could still be found in remote areas that rescue teams have not reached. The government is delivering aid to people displaced by the flooding in Ibadan and surrounding areas in Oyo state, the National Emergency Management Agency said. Thousands of people have been displaced, and about 1,500 of them are being looked after in centers run by government officials and the Red Cross in the Ibadan area, Red Cross spokesman Umar Mairiga told CNN on Tuesday. They are being given emergency food rations, as well as mattresses, blankets and rubber mats, Mairiga said. The deputy governor of Oyo state, Chief Moses Adeyemo, called for more federal government help to resettle those displaced and to rebuild bridges and water channels destroyed by the flooding, the statement said. NEMA warned that there could be more flooding in urban areas during the rainy season if drains were inadequate or blocked by uncleared waste.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Round two of the battle of the propofol experts started Thursday afternoon in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor as the defense anesthesiology expert began his testimony. When Dr. Paul White continues his testimony Friday, and he is expected to counter the conclusions of prosecution anesthesiologist Dr. Steven Shafer, whose earlier testimony spanned more than a week of Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. Dr. White said that after reviewing the reports, evidence and analysis from investigators in Jackson's death he was not convinced Dr. Murray was responsible. ""I was somewhat perplexed at how a determination has been made that Dr. Murray was infusing propofol,"" White said. ""It wasn't obvious to me, I thought there were questions."" A drug-addiction specialist testified earlier Thursday that Jackson was ""probably addicted"" to a powerful painkiller given him during frequent visits to a Beverly Hills dermatologist in the three months before his death. Dr. Robert Waldmon was called by the defense in an effort to show Jackson's insomnia the day he died could have been caused by withdrawal from Demerol shots he was given along with botox injections, treatments that Dr. Murray didn't know about. White, who is the last witness before the defense rests, spent most of the first two hours establishing his credentials as one of the world's foremost experts on the surgical anesthetic propofol, which the coroner ruled was the chief drug that killed Jackson. The personal and professional rivalry between Dr. White and Dr. Shafer played an odd role in Thursday's testimony. White's longtime friendship with Shafer has been tested during the Murray trial, including an incident last week that resulted in the judge scheduling a contempt-of-court hearing against White for next month. At one point Thursday, White suggested someone ""tell Dr. Shafer he needs to learn how to spell plasma,"" because it was misspelled on a graph he created. White, however, attempted to downplay rivalry with Shafer when the judge mistakenly called White ""Dr. Shafer"" for a second time. ""I take it as a compliment, actually,"" White said. White and Shafer, who are on opposite sides in this trial, may have a new anesthesia product to develop as a result of their preparations to testify, White said. Both experts commissioned studies on the possibility that Jackson might have orally ingested the fatal dose of propofol, something they both have now ruled out. But they learned that propofol could be absorbed through the tissues of the mouth, White said. He and Shafer agreed during courthouse chats while waiting to testify that they might be able to develop a propofol lollipop as a ""non-invasive sedation device."" Shafer testified last week that he concluded the ""only scenario"" that fits the scientific evidence is that Jackson was on an IV drip of propofol for three hours before his death and that Murray failed to notice when he stopped breathing. Shafer conceded that it was possible that Jackson, not Murray, could have been the one to open the drip to a fatal pace, but prosecutors contend it would make no difference in Murray's guilt. The defense hopes the testimony from White and Waldmon, their last two witnesses, will convince jurors that Jackson gave himself the overdose of drugs that killed him while Murray was not watching. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was the result of ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with several sedatives. The defense theory is that a desperate Jackson, fearing his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep, self-administered propofol that Murray was trying to wean him off of. Prosecutors contend Murray is responsible for his death even if he did not give him the final and fatal dose because he was criminally reckless in using the surgical anesthetic to help Jackson sleep without proper precautions. The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol through frequent visits to the Beverly Hills dermatology clinic of Dr. Arnold Klein in the months before his death. Murray was unaware of the addiction, and therefore unable to understand why he could not help Jackson sleep, the defense contends. During Thursday morning's testimony by Dr. Waldmon, the addiction specialist, defense lawyer Ed Chernoff displayed Dr. Klein's medical records for Jackson, kept under the name ""Omar Arnold."" The showed at least 24 visits from March 12 until June 22, 2009, three days before his death. The defense previously said Jackson was given 6,500 milligrams of Demerol at Klein's clinic during those visits. Jackson received 900 milligrams of Demerol at Klein's clinic over three days in early May, the records showed. Dr. Waldmon called the shots ""stiff doses."" Waldmon testified that from his review of those medical records and ""based on what is known of his public behavior that he was probably addicted"" to Demerol. ""Six weeks of very frequent high-dose use would develop opioid dependence in any of us,"" Waldmon said. The defense also sought to connect the Demerol shots to Jackson's poor health at some rehearsals for his comeback concerts and at other times when he complained of being being hot and cold at the same time. Patients describe opioid withdrawal as like ""the worst case of influenza they ever had,"" Waldmon said. While Demerol was not found in Jackson's blood or body during his autopsy, the defense contends it played a major role in his death. His inability to sleep, which Murray was trying to resolve the day he died, could have been a direct symptom of his withdrawal from the drug. ""Anxiety, restlessness and insomnia"" are ""very common"" symptoms of Demerol withdrawal, Waldmon said. Jackson's personal assistant, Michael Emir WIlliams, testified earlier that Jackson's visits to Dr. Klein were ""very regular"" in his last months of life. ""There were times he would go almost every day"" to Klein's office, and Jackson often appear intoxicated when he left, Jackson's security chief Faheem Muhammad testified. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor ruled earlier that while the defense could use Klein's medical records, they could not call the doctor or his staff to testify in the trial.","NEW: Defense expert ""perplexed"" by investigator's conclusions .

"(CNN) -- Israeli naval forces Tuesday successfully took over a boat of activists intent on breaking what they call the ""siege of Gaza"" without violent resistance. Benny Gantz, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, confirmed that naval forces had been ordered to seize the vessel, known as the Dignite, as it approached the coast of Gaza, where a maritime security blockade is in force. The forces ""operated in line with procedures and took every precaution necessary while using all operational tactics determined prior to the operation, and avoid causing harm to the activists on board while ensuring the safety of the soldiers,"" the IDF said. After the boarding, ""the passengers' health was examined and they were offered food and beverages."" The Dignite -- carrying 10 activists, three crew members and three journalists -- is affiliated with the Free Gaza Movement, whose aim is to break the ""siege of Gaza."" Greta Berlin, spokeswoman for the Free Gaza Movement, said the boat declared its destination as Alexandria, Egypt, so that it could leave Greek waters. But it changed its destination in international waters, which is legal, Berlin said. Four navy boats surrounded the Dignite as it approached the coast of Gaza, the boat's organizers said. After the Israeli Navy intercepted the vessel, it engaged in a ""dialogue"" with the activists ""in an attempt to dissuade them from continuing on their route"" toward a maritime security blockade off the Gaza coast, the IDF said. It said that any supplies on board ""may be transferred, legally, through the existing land crossings and the Ashdod port."" However, the IDF said, ""all diplomatic channels had been exhausted and continuous calls to the vessel had been ignored."" Given the groups' ""unwillingness to arrive at the Ashdod port,"" the IDF said, ""it was unequivocally necessary to board the vessel and lead it to Ashdod."" ""After all the options we suggested were refused, we decided to take over the yacht. We realized that the captain was lying. He lied to the authorities in Greece about his sailing route and changed it from Egypt to Gaza,"" said IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai. The boat was taken to Ashdod, and the relevant security authorities and the Israel police were set to begin the process of questioning the passengers, who will then be transferred to the Ministry of Interior and the immigration authorities, officials said. Israel insists on controlling access to Gaza because it says it has to keep weapons out of the hands of Palestinian militants who would use them to attack Israelis. Gaza is run by Hamas, which has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks and is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization. Israel emphasizes that it delivers large amounts of aid to Gaza. The country mounted a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail. The ship was part of a group of vessels that had planned to sail to Gaza in an effort to promote public awareness about Israel's blockade of the area. The others were grounded in Greece. The activists connected with the Freedom Flotilla, as they call it, also wanted to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. Nine people died in clashes with Israeli Navy commandos. ""The Dignite carries a message of solidarity and human empathy from the people of the world to the people of Gaza, and all of Palestine, that Israel's violence can never silence,"" the group said.","Israel seizes the Dignite without violent resistance from the 16 people aboard .

"(CNN) -- A murder suspect who escaped from a Florida jail earlier this week was nabbed after a police chase in Ohio Saturday morning, officials said. Rondell Reed, 52, escaped with his cellmate, Leviticus Taylor, Monday from the Indian County Jail, officials said. Taylor, 25, who was quickly captured, was convicted of murder last month, according to CNN West Palm Beach affiliate WPBF. According to Indian County Sheriff Deryl Loar, Reed was arrested after the chase ended in a crash in Warren County, north of Cincinnati. An officer had tried to initiate a traffic stop when Reed allegedly drove away. Subject of a nationwide manhunt, Reed had been on the lam for nearly a week. ""Rondell Reed is very smart. He is not a stupid crook,"" said Indian County Det. Steven Stoll. ""He is very good at auto theft. It's what he did growing up. He knows how. "" Authorities believe Reed was headed for Indiana, where he has family. Loar told reporters earlier this week that the suspect stole a vehicle, likely in the Sebastian area. The vehicle that crashed Saturday may have been a different one, officials said. Reed had been arrested in the death of an Indian County business owner, WPBF said . In Ohio, Reed faces charges of receiving stolen property, failure to comply with a police officer, carrying a concealed weapon and having a weapon under disability, according to Cincinnati affiliate WLWT and Warren County's website. Loar said corrections deputies performed hourly checks of Reed and Taylor in their cells, but items they used to create dummies gave the appearance that they were tucked in their sheets when in fact they were making their getaway, WPBF reported. ""The River County Jail has been hardened again, not only after the immediate escape, (but) continuing through this week,"" Loar told reporters Saturday.

"Berlin (CNN) -- More than 300 wounded Libyans will arrive in Germany to be treated in hospitals within the next 10 days in an operation approved by Libya's interim government, the German Foreign Ministry said Friday. ""Our expectation of the amount of the wounded Libyans treated in German hospitals changes each hour,"" said Thomas Holz of the German health service Almeda. According to Almeda's marketing chief Michael Blasius, the company expects the number of Libyan patients to rise. Already, 111 Libyans who arrived in 20 planes are receiving treatment in German civilian hospitals. Four further planes were expected to land in German territory Friday. ""Some of those patients will be transferred to countries like France, Great Britain, Turkey and the U.S.,"" Blasius told CNN on Friday. The United States plans to provide treatment for at least 28 wounded Libyan fighters. U.S. officials said Thursday that at least 24 would be taken to a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, because their wounds cannot be treated in Libya. An additional four will go to U.S. medical facilities in Germany, according to Major Janelle Jeffrey of the U.S. Africa Command, based in Stuttgart, Germany. Libya's National Transitional Council requested the U.S. medical treatment, which is being offered as a humanitarian gesture and support for Libya's democratic aspirations, U.S. officials said. Almeda said it received the health service request by Libya's new Finance Ministry on October 14. Four days later, the first military plane arrived in Germany with dozens of wounded Libyans. That was a day after German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler announced Germany would offer medical help to the NTC. Three so-called ""scouting teams"" are currently screening Libyan and Tunisian hospitals, searching for heavily injured Libyans who might benefit from treatment abroad. Almeda told CNN there would be two further scouting teams in Tunisia and Libya at the beginning of next week. Many wounded Libyans had already received treatment in Tunisia, according to Blasius. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy in Washington and Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin contributed to this report.","More than 300 wounded Libyans will be treated in Germany in the next 10 days .

"(CNN) -- The widow of a man who set free 56 exotic animals he owned before apparently committing suicide will not get back the six that survived any time soon, a spokesman for the governor of Ohio said Thursday. ""Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture issued a quarantine order"" on the animals, said Robert Nichols, press secretary for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Nichols noted that it has been widely reported that the animals were malnourished and could be diseased, and said they might pose a public health threat. Marian Thompson -- whose husband, Terry, released lions, tigers, leopards, grizzly bears and other animals from his preserve near Zanesville, Ohio, last week -- has a right to appeal the order, which is indefinite in length, Nichols said. If she does so, she would be granted a hearing within 30 days. Earlier in the day, officials at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a news release that Thompson was planning to take custody of the animals on Thursday afternoon, despite their hope that the animals would remain at the zoo. Under the quarantine order, that is where they will remain, Nichols said. Police say Terry Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly after releasing the animals October 18. Of the 56 animals released from the Thompsons' preserve, only a grizzly bear, two monkeys and three leopards were taken alive, said Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz. Authorities killed two wolves, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, one baboon, three mountain lions, and 18 Bengal tigers. One monkey remained unaccounted for. Lutz and Jack Hanna, conservationist and director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, said the animal may have been eaten by one of the big cats. The Humane Society of the United States has said it does not fault authorities for using deadly force in such a situation. However, the group criticized Kasich, who in response to the incident signed an executive order dealing with private ownership of exotic animals. The order strengthens enforcement of existing laws. The Humane Society said the order ""is inadequate and sidesteps the central problems created by the exotic animal trade in Ohio."" Kasich also said he will push for new laws giving the state increased authority regarding exotic and dangerous animals.","NEW: A quarantine order will keep the animals at the zoo, the governor's spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama passed his recent physical in excellent condition, according to White House physician Dr. Jeff Kuhlman. The physical -- the president's first since February 2010 -- was conducted last week. It included testing for colon and prostate cancer and diabetes -- all of which were negative -- as well as measures of blood pressure and vision. At 50 years of age, the president continues to have uncorrected 20/20 vision, according to Kuhlman's report. Obama, who early in his administration categorized himself as ""a former smoker"" but conceded ""there are times I mess up,"" was found to be ""tobacco free,"" according to a two-page summary of Kuhlman's report released by the White House. The report says that the president occasionally drinks alcohol in moderation, which has been linked to good heart health, and that he ""eats a healthy diet."" Specifically, the report said Obama, who stands 6 feet 1 inch tall, ""stays at a healthy weight"" at 181.3 pounds. His blood pressure measured normal at 107/71 mm Hg and his heart rate was measured at 67 beats per minute. Obama's cholesterol measures were categorized by Kuhlman as ""'ideal' with a calculated 10-year coronary heart disease risk of low (2%)."" Kuhlman summarized that ""the President is in excellent health and 'fit for duty.' All clinical data indicate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency.""

"(CNN) -- In the very early hours of this morning, ""don't ask, don't tell"" ceased to be U.S. policy. As a result, today is the first day I can write about being the partner of a gay military serviceman without fear that he will lose his job. In December, Sen. John McCain voiced his opposition to repealing DADT and reminded America it was in the middle of two wars. This I knew well. At the time, my partner was on a yearlong deployment in Afghanistan. My better half is a commander in the U.S. Navy who has served his country for more than 23 years. He has deployed more than eight times, flying missions for Operation Deny Flight (Bosnia), Operation Southern Watch (Iraq) and Operation Iraqi Freedom. During his year in Afghanistan, he provided support for Operation Enduring Freedom. When McCain, R-Arizona, stood up in the U.S. Senate to defend the feelings of homophobic servicemen and women, gay active-duty personnel were unable to speak out. By doing so they would have ""outed"" themselves and lost their jobs. In spite of this, repeal passed, due in no small part to public opinion massively favoring repeal (67% according to a December 2010 Gallup poll). Had my partner been able to openly share his experience, he might have highlighted McCain's arguments about repeal of DADT affecting morale, recruitment and retention as moot points. In Afghanistan, my partner worked and lived alongside Danish, French and British troops, to name just a few. With nearly every NATO country allowing gay men and women to serve openly in their militaries, McCain would have had to forgo multinational operations and coalitions in order to fully ""protect"" his soldiers from exposure to ""openly gay"" personnel. Though repeal of DADT was won, there are Americans, specifically some GOP presidential candidates, who would reinstate it. Now that gay military personnel can be visible, in my view, they should be. In short, with ""don't ask, don't tell"" gone, it's time to tell. The battle has only been half won. Gay servicemen or servicewomen can no longer be discharged simply for being gay, but they are still treated inequitably. Only by using their newly won free speech can they hope to reap the same benefits as their straight colleagues. Let me give you some examples. When a member of the U.S. military marries, he or she effectively gets a pay raise through an increased housing allowance. Even after repeal, this benefit will not accrue to married same-sex couples. When a married service member is sent away from his spouse on a tour of duty, the couple is entitled to a family separation allowance. Again this will not apply to married same-sex couples. If my partner and I were married and if the law allowed both of these benefits to accrue to him while he was in Afghanistan -- as they would if he were in a straight marriage -- we would have received an additional $10,000 that year. The inequality doesn't stop at pay either. Same-sex partners of military personnel are also denied dependent identification cards. This meant that when my partner was hospitalized in 2009, I had no way of independently gaining access to the Navy hospital where he was treated without a special ""hospital visitation authorization."" Moreover, whether my partner and I are married or not, today I would still have no access to the shops, gas stations or recreational facilities available to other military spouses on base. I would also not be entitled to spousal health care benefits if we are married. Perhaps most cruelly of all, post-DADT gay military spouses are still not entitled to survivor benefits if a partner is killed in the line of duty. They also remain ineligible to be buried with their spouse if he or she is buried in a military cemetery. Gay military spouses sacrifice just as much as their straight brothers and sisters. We support our partners. We relocate with them when they receive new orders and in turn we give up our jobs, friends and lives to support their careers. Despite this, we are denied the support and safety nets afforded our straight counterparts. With DADT gone, we should no longer suffer in silence. The military benefits system needs to change. If the benefits currently unavailable to gay military families were similarly unavailable to Jewish, black or female service members, I have no doubt the situation would be rectified immediately. There needs to be a public outcry, and it needs to come from active duty gay personnel, their partners, families, friends, colleagues and the public at large. For this to happen, the public has to see and understand that a significant proportion of the men and women in uniform protecting them are gay. In the coming days and weeks, I urge all gay military personnel and their partners to come out, where appropriate, to their families, co-workers, even their Facebook friends. Do this not to share the innermost details of your private life, but to begin the fight for the recognition and rewards you deserve as true American heroes. Furthermore, when the likes of a Michele Bachmann or a Rick Santorum propose reinstating DADT, let them be challenged by decorated gay marines, sailors, soldiers, airmen and coastguards and asked: Why should they and their partners be treated as second-class citizens? Why should they, as patriots who have spilled blood for their country, be treated anything less than equally by their employer and the government they defend? Having read this far, you'll be aware that I have not named my partner. If he wants to come out to his employer and colleagues, and I would encourage him to do so, I firmly believe they should hear it from him first. Being honest about your sexuality and standing up for your right to be treated equally doesn't have to involve a public announcement. There will be colleagues you want to tell and members of the military hierarchy that you should tell, specifically those denying you equal pay and benefits, but there will also be colleagues who have no business knowing. Families have just reason to be proud of sons and daughters who serve in the U.S. military. They should be prouder still to know that service was given in the face of unequal reward and above-average sacrifice. The danger for gay military personnel is that, having spent years being forced to hide and tell half-truths, they continue to remain invisible. Without visibility, the arguments of those opposed to equality are easier for the public to believe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurence Watts.","Laurence Watts: DADT ending; he can freely write about his gay servicemember partner .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Just moments after departing Washington's Union Station, as the tour bus drove past the U.S. Capitol, Mel Bruce made an announcement to a handful of tourists. ""Most sadly for us, we close the doors after 42 years of service. Today is the final run for Tourmobile,"" said Bruce, a tour guide for Tourmobile Sightseeing. The company announced that Monday would be its last day of operation. The company claimed unique status among tour operators in the nation's capital by having the exclusive contract for sightseeing bus tours of Arlington National Cemetery. For many Tourmobile employees, the end of the line means more than the end of a job. ""It was just a shock, we were just stunned by it,"" Bruce, 63, said after dropping off a group of tourists at Arlington. For Bruce, giving brief history lessons to out-of-towners came easy, since growing up in the area gave him the chance to witness history firsthand. ""I was at the Lincoln Memorial with my family to hear firsthand Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his 'I Have a Dream' speech,"" Bruce said over the loudspeaker as the bus drove past the newly dedicated memorial to the civil rights leader. Bruce became a tour guide for the company in the summer of 1972 -- when Tourmobile was in its third year of business-- but he left after four years to try his luck on Broadway. After a 33-year absence, he returned in 2006. Much remains the same, he said. ""Everyone in the world is still eager to see the sights that they have only seen up to now in paintings, books and magazines."" According to the company's website, Tourmobile, which started operations in 1969. employs 300 seasonal workers and serves ""upwards of 2 million riders annually."" The tour buses take visitors to many of the capital's most famous sites, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and the National Mall. What's next for the company is unclear. ""We are currently unable to provide any information regarding future tour services,"" a message on the company's website said. Bruce blamed the company's demise on the sagging economy and more competition in the area offering similar services. Starting Tuesday, wlth Tourmobile no longer running, there will be no bus tours for visitors at Arlington National Cemetery until a new contract is awarded through bidding that will be overseen by the National Park Service. The cemetery covers 624 acres and has 4 million visitors a year, many of whom may find walking the sprawling hallowed grounds too difficult. The park service hopes to have a new tour bus company in place before the end of the year. ""This is a bittersweet time for the (National Park Service) and Tourmobile, as they have faithfully served the needs of millions of visitors for over 42 years,"" said Steve Whitesell, regional director of the park service's National Capital Region. ""Times change, and we are ready to enter a new era for visitors to access our national parks in greater Washington."" Tourist Gretchen Neu, from Racine, Wisconsin, was visiting Washington for the first time and could not imagine touring the cemetery on foot. ""Absolutely not. I mean, you have to have some mode of transportation other than your own car,"" Neu said, sitting on the Tourmobile bus as it left the cemetery. Families with loved ones buried at Arlington National Cemetery and those with disabilities will still be able to drive their own cars on the property. Another thing that set Tourmobile apart from other tour operators was the type of buses it used -- more like trams that are common at theme parks. The red, white and blue Tourmobile trams that many Washingtonians have become used to seeing came from Universal Studios in California. ""They are truly relics of a whole other era,"" Bruce said just before making his final trip of the day. ""It seemed that that operation worked so well in California that they wanted to try it out here, and that's how it was born."" What was born over 40 years ago is coming to an end, but Bruce said he's not ready for retirement and wants to keep showing off the place where he grew up. ""I greet the world every day, and it's a privilege for me to show the world my hometown,"" he said.","Tourmobile Sightseeing began showing visitors the sights of Washington 42 years ago .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A 14-year-old Australian boy accused of marijuana possession could face jail time on the resort island of Bali. With his face covered in a black mask, the teenager was mobbed by the media as he entered a local court complex for the first day of his trial Tuesday. Earlier, prosecutor Gusti Gede Putu Atmaja said the judge would not wear his usual robe to try to minimize stress on the boy. The trial is closed to the public. The Australian teen -- whose name has not been publicly released -- faces three charges under Indonesia's stringent narcotics laws. The most serious charge of possession, under article 111, carries a sentence of up to six years. The teen is also charged with drug use under article 127, which could result in a maximum sentence of four years. The least serious charge, under article 128, relates to drug use by minors and takes into account a person's history of drug use. This charge does not hold criminal liability and could send the teen to rehabilitation instead of jail. ""We are optimistic, and we hope that we will get the result we want -- that he be returned to his parents and avoids jail time,"" said the teen's lawyer, Mohammad Rifan. But the prosecutor stressed that article 128 stipulates a minor's parents should report the drug use to Indonesian authorities. Any actions taken by his guardians in his home country are not recognized in Indonesia. If the teen does face a jail sentence, ""The sentence may be as short as a few months,"" Atmaja said. The boy could also receive credit for time served. The prosecution presented two witnesses at the trial Tuesday. Rifan, the defense attorney, said he expects a quick decision in the trial, with twice-weekly court hearings that could end by mid-November. ""The boy was under stress from the media attention but was otherwise in relatively good condition during the court hearing,"" Rifan said. The teen's next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The teen has been detained since his October 4 arrest, after allegedly buying 3.6 grams of cannabis off the streets. He was on vacation with his parents in Bali, a popular tourist destination for many Australians. He was initially detained at a police headquarters but was recently moved to an immigration detention center. Australian officials and the teen's lawyer lobbied intensively to have him released, but prosecutors announced last week that the minor would stand trial. Indonesia anti-drugs laws are considered strict. Visitors to the country are warned, upon arrival, that some drug crimes carry a maximum penalty of death. Still, many have been arrested and convicted for various drug offenses. Two Australians are on death row in Bali's Kerobokan prison. Six other Australians are serving life sentences.","The teen, accused of marijuana posession, has been detained since his October 4 arrest .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday issued new orders aimed at speeding up transportation projects he says will put construction workers back on the job, using the opportunity to blast congressional Republicans who have blocked similar legislation. Standing before the aging Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Potomac River, Obama again criticized Republicans who have blocked the jobs bill he put forward in September, telling an audience of construction workers, . ""There's work to be done. There are workers ready to do it. The American people are behind this,"" he said. ""Democrats, Republicans, independents believe in this. These are ideas that have been supported by all those groups in the past. There's no reason not to do it this time."" The White House announced Wednesday that Obama was ordering the Transportation Department award $527 million in pending road and bridge repair grants by the end of the year and speed up applications for another $110 million in financing for projects in 2012. The White House and DOT are also setting up a team to speed reviews of other road and rail projects. ""If there's money already in the pipeline, we want to get it out faster,"" he said. Republicans filibustered the Senate version of the president's $447 billion jobs proposal in mid-October, while a $35 billion measure that would have forestalled layoffs of state and local government workers like teachers and police officers was blocked a few days later. Republican leaders particularly opposed raising taxes on top earners to pay for the measures. ""How do we sit back and watch China and Europe build the best bridges and high-speed railroads and gleaming new airports, and we're doing nothing at a time when we've got more than a million unemployed construction workers who could build them right here in America right now?"" Obama asked. Meanwhile, he criticized the House of Representatives for spending time to debate measures like establishing a commemorative baseball coin and a resolution reaffirming ""In God We Trust"" as the official U.S. motto. ""I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work,"" he said.","White House orders aim to speed up construction projects .

Bout is charged with a wide range of counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans, attempting to sell arms to undercover federal agents, wire fraud and violating U.N. Security Council sanctions. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan McGuire on Tuesday boasted that the evidence against Bout ""is overwhelming,"" pointing to alleged ties with a variety of armed conflicts. ""He did everything he could to show that he could be a one-stop shop"" for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said McGuire. The jury is expected to reconvene Wednesday at 10 a.m. EDT. Bout, widely dubbed ""the Merchant of Death"" and often referred to by American officials as among the most notorious of global arms traffickers, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His attorney, Albert Dayan, said the former Soviet air force officer was not involved in illegal arms sales, telling jurors that federal agents baited Bout into selling the weapons alongside a deal to sell airplanes. Dayan says his client has been unfairly charged. The heart of the charges against Bout stem from a 2008 sting operation in Thailand by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. According to a 2008 federal indictment, undercover agents posing as FARC rebels attempted to buy larges caches of weapons from Bout. Agents tried to buy 700 to 800 surface-to-air missiles, thousands of AK-47s, and landmines, according to the indictment. They told Bout that they wanted the arms ""to kill Americans,"" to which Bout said that he ""was going to prepare everything the FARC needed."" Before the arrest, the DEA had struggled to draw Bout out of his Russian homeland, which had long sheltered and defended him. Undercover agents met with Bout's associates the world over, from Curacao to Copenhagen, in an attempt to set up a meeting with their target, according to the indictment. He was extradited to the United States in 2010 following protracted court proceedings in Thailand. Critics accuse Bout of providing larger and more powerful arms to rebels in several countries and fueling bloody conflicts in places such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The 2005 movie ""Lord of War,"" starring Nicolas Cage, was inspired by Bout's life.","NEW: The jury is expected to reconvene Wednesday at 10 a.m. EDT .

"New York (CNN) -- Convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout could face life in prison after a federal jury returned guilty verdicts Wednesday on four counts related to a conspiracy to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout's attorney, Albert Dayan, said the verdict will be appealed. ""I still stand by my position that Viktor was wrongfully accused,"" said Dayan. ""The jury has spoken but his position is still that he's innocent."" Widely dubbed ""the Merchant of Death,"" Bout was often referred to by U.S. and United Nations officials as among the most notorious of global arms traffickers. He had pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Dayan said during the trial that the former Soviet air force officer was not involved in illegal arms sales, and that federal agents had baited Bout into selling the weapons alongside a deal to sell airplanes. But Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, called the Russian tycoon ""a very dangerous man"" in a statement Wednesday. ""He aimed to sell those weapons to terrorists for the purpose of killing Americans."" Commentary: Three chilling moments from the trial . The heart of the case stemmed from a 2008 sting operation in Thailand by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Undercover agents posing as Colombian rebels attempted to buy larges caches of weapons, according to a 2008 federal indictment. Both the United States and the European Union identify the rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- as a terrorist organization. The agents tried to purchase 700 to 800 surface-to-air missiles, thousands of AK-47s and landmines, telling Bout that they wanted the arms ""to kill Americans,"" the indictment said. Bout responded, it said, by saying he ""was going to prepare everything the FARC needed."" During closing arguments Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan McGuire called the evidence against Bout ""overwhelming,"" pointing to alleged ties with various armed conflicts. ""He did everything he could to show that he could be a one-stop shop"" for FARC, said McGuire. Prior to his arrest, the DEA had struggled to draw Bout out of his Russian homeland, which is long thought to have sheltered and defended him. Undercover agents met with Bout's associates the world over, from Curacao to Copenhagen, in an attempt to set up a meeting with their target, according to the indictment. He was extradited to the United States in 2010 following his arrest and a protracted court proceeding in Thailand. The Russian businessman has also been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s. According to the indictment, he was suspected of creating front companies that used his planes to deliver food and medical supplies, as well as arms. His alleged trafficking activities in Liberia prompted U.S. authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and prohibited U.S. transactions with him, it said. Less than a year later, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control placed 30 companies and four people on a specially designated list that carried similar actions against them. Bout has maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and had acted as a mere logistics provider. His exact age is unclear, but he is believed to be in his late 40s or 50s, with his age in dispute due to different passports and documents. The U.S. attorney's office said it had no confirmed age. Critics have accused Bout of providing arms to rebels in several countries and fueling bloody conflicts in places such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. In 2000, then-British Foreign Office Peter Hain branded him ""Africa's chief merchant of death"" at a time when Bout is believed to have supplied arms to officials in Sierra Leone, a former British colony then embroiled in civil war.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's unmanned spacecraft Shenzhou-8 successfully docked with the lab module Tiangong-1 early Thursday, another milestone in Beijing's plan to build a space station. Shenzhou-8 joined up with the 8.5-ton Tiangong-1 343 kilometers (213 miles) above Earth, according to Wu Ping, spokesperson with the China Manned Space Engineering Project. ""The equipment works well and all the in-orbit experiments are progressing well,"" she said. President Hu Jintao, currently in Europe at the G-20 summit, praised the nation's first space docking, according to Xinhua news agency. China's space ambition soars . ""Breakthroughs in and acquisition of space docking technologies are vital to the three-phase development strategy of our manned space program,"" he said. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao watched the docking at Beijing's Aerospace Control Center along with other top communist party officials, Xinhua said. Shenzhou-8 blasted off on November 1 from a launch facility in the Gobi Desert in northwest China -- one month after the first space laboratory module Tiangong-1 was launched into space. According to Wu, the two modules will fly together for 12 days before conducting another docking test. The docked spacecraft will then fly for two more days before separating from each other. Shenzhou-8 is scheduled to return to Earth on November 17, while Tiangong-1 will remain in space to wait for the next docking test. ""Achieving the space rendezvous and docking is another historic technical breakthrough for China's manned spacecraft project,"" said Wu. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, the first stage in a ""three-step"" strategy to develop its manned engineering project. The launch of the Tiangong-1 lab module is the second step. If successful, it will be followed by the last phase: to build a permanent space lab that will allow astronauts to conduct long-term space experiments. According to Xinhua, Beijing hopes to build a space station by around 2020. There will be two more docking tests with Tiangong-1 in 2012, with at least one carrying astronauts, according to officials.","Shenzhou-8 joined up with the 8.5-ton Tiangong-1 343 kilometers above Earth .

"(CNN) -- Shock waves were felt throughout cricket on Thursday when three Pakistan international players were sent to prison for their part in a betting scam against England in 2010. The trio, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were handed differing jail terms after being found guilty of plotting to cheat during the match at Lord's -- the home of English cricket. However, while Butt and Asif have been roundly condemned for their actions, which resulted in sentences of 30 months and 12 months respectively, in some quarters there has been a modicum of sympathy for 19-year-old Amir. Pakistani cricketers jailed in betting scam . Unlike his two, more experienced colleagues, Amir confessed to deliberately bowling no-balls (foul deliveries) in order to make money in a betting scam, with the judge, Mr Justice Cooke, handing him a lesser sentence of six months, calling him """"impressionable"". And now Amir's mother and brother have told CNN they have sympathy for the teenager, believing he was coerced into agreeing to bowl no balls. Speaking from her family home in Changa Bangial, one hour outside Islamabad, Amir's mother, Naseem Akhtar, told CNN's Reza Sayah: ""He rose to stardom at the speed of light and has falling back down just as fast. ""Amir still thinks like a child, he is very naive. I know that he was forced into doing this, he wasn't greedy for money,"" she added. ""But in my heart I know that god is with him, and he will make a comeback in cricket with my prayers."" Amir's close friend Rizwan Akbar told CNN: ""I have known Mohammad for eight or nine years, we lived together. I did not think he would ever do anything like this."" However, somebody who has no sympathy for Amir and his fellow-convicted teammates is Paul Condon, the former head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit. Speaking to CNN's Don Riddell, following the announcement of the prison sentences, Condon said: ""These guys betrayed their country and betrayed millions of cricket lovers around the world. ""These players were idolized in Pakistan, but they betrayed everything for money so they deserve what they have got."" Condon added: ""In my time with the ICC, I always said the most powerful message was if cricketers were dealt with criminally for these matters, otherwise cricket loses and millions of people also lose their confidence in the game.""","Mohammad Amir's family tell CNN they sympathize with their son's plight .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to a listeria outbreak in cantaloupe has risen to 29, the Centers for Disease Control reported Wednesday, topping a 1985 mark for the most deaths among adults and children. The outbreak, first detected in September and traced back to a Colorado farm, has sickened a total of 139 people in 28 states, the CDC says. In addition to the 29 deaths, one woman who was pregnant at the time she fell ill suffered a miscarriage. The toll makes the current outbreak the deadliest among adults and children since the agency started keeping track of listeria cases in 1973, though a 1985 outbreak in California involved 28 deaths and another 20 stillbirths and miscarriages, CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said, according to CDC figures.

"Washington (CNN) -- Bob Barker, the former host of ""The Price Is Right,"" made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses. At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty. ""How do they train them? They have to dominate the animal,"" Barker said. ""How do they dominate the animal? They beat it, with clubs, fists, black jacks, ax handles, golf clubs. They shock it with all sorts of electric devices. They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks."" Barker, who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection, is championing the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act. The bill, which would amend the existing Animal Welfare Act, has attracted bipartisan support. The bill would affect only traveling shows. It specifically exempts zoos, aquariums and research labs and rodeos. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans, ""how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation's moral character."" Dr. Mel Richardson of Animal Defenders International lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most, if not all, lions, tigers and elephants in traveling shows: ""Imagine living all of your life on a queen-size or king-size bed."" But the concerns are not confined to their housing. Jan Creamer, president of ADI, said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment. Barker's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of ""CSI"" and ""The West Wing,"" who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals, and taking them off the road. ""Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun. ... If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they'd actually be very disappointed in us, for [going] to these places,"" Fox said. A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities, and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas, have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals. Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation. Similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Portugal and India. And, according to the panel, more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit. ""It is time for the United States to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing,"" Barker said.","Bob Barker urges passage of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Steroid test results and notes and calendars from his then-trainer are among the evidence federal prosecutors have amassed in their perjury case against baseball home-run king Barry Bonds, according to documents unsealed Wednesday. Barry Bonds, shown at his most recent court appearance, is accused of lying to a grand jury. The 223-page stack of documents unsealed by a federal judge represents much of the government's case against Bonds, who is accused of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury investigating the use of steroids in professional sports. Prosecutors say the test results show Bonds was using performance-enhancing substances -- including a then-undetectable designer drug -- at a time he denied knowingly using any. Bonds' attorneys are seeking to keep much of that evidence out of court. The 44-year-old former San Francisco Giants slugger holds Major League Baseball's single-season and all-time home-run titles, but his achievements have been shadowed by allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds pleaded not guilty to the perjury and obstruction of justice charges and has been free on $500,000 bond. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday. The charges stem from his 2003 appearance before a federal grand jury probing the distribution of steroids by the San Francisco-area Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative, or BALCO. Bonds told the grand jury that his former personal trainer, Greg Anderson, gave him a cream that he said was flaxseed oil to use on his arm in 2003. Anderson spent three months in prison after admitting distributing steroids and was later jailed for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors. The case against Bonds will include calendars kept by Anderson that prosecutors say were used to keep Bonds and other athletes on a doping regimen -- an assertion expected to be bolstered by the testimony of other athletes, they said. Evidence will include a recording of a phone conversation with an associate in which Anderson ""describes injecting the defendant, having the ability to obtain and utilize inside information about MLB's random drug testing to the defendant's benefit and the undetectable nature of what Anderson had been doing,"" according to documents. Bonds won seven National League MVP titles during his 22-year career, 15 years of which was spent with the Giants. The team released him after the 2007 season, just weeks after he broke Hank Aaron's career home-run record.","NEW: Bonds' attorneys are seeking to keep many of the documents out of court .

"(CNN) -- Kenyan troops are battling the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia, westerners are being targeted at Kenyan tourist resorts and fears are high of terror attacks in Nairobi. What are the reasons behind the unrest and what is likely to happen next? What is the source of the unrest? A state of near-anarchy has existed in Somalia for more than two decades: the government has little authority, violent conflict has left thousands dead, and the country has recently been hit by a devastating famine. Pirates have taken advantage of the power vacuum to prey on vessels large and small off the country's coast, but over the past few months, Al-Shabaab militants appear to have added a new tactic: kidnapping foreign tourists and aid workers in Kenya (though some in Al-Shabaab deny involvement in the abductions.) Al-Shabaab already generates tens of millions of dollars a year, much of it by controlling ports along the Somali coast, according to a recent United Nations report. U.N. report: Al-Shabaab is raising millions illegally in Somalia . How has Kenya responded to the kidnappings? Responding to fears that foreign investors and tourists could be scared away, Kenyan forces last month entered Somalia, saying the kidnappings threatened security and constituted an attack on Kenyan sovereignty. Kenyan forces say they are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the U.N. as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab. Fears grow over Somali pirates' 'new tactics' after kidnaps, killing . What has been the response? The incursion has raised fears of reprisals with Al-Shabaab saying it considers it an affront to Somalia's sovereignty. Last month (October) the U.S. Embassy in Kenya said it had credible information of an imminent terror attack on foreigners. The following day, twin explosions in Nairobi killed at least one person. Many worry the action will make Kenya less safe, not more so. Security analyst Rashid Abdi, from International Crisis Group, told CNN: ""There is a risk that while the argument for going in is to stop terrorism, the contrary could now be the case. Al-Shabaab will now have the pretext to strike Kenya."" How likely is Kenya's operation to succeed? Any foreign intervention in Somalia is a big risk, say experts who point to recent history as proof, in particular America's ill-fated ""Black Hawk Down"" mission in 1993 when U.S. forces tried to capture a local warlord - resulting in many deaths on both sides, Ethiopia's U.S.-backed invasion that contributed to the rise of Al-Shabaab, and the African Union's long and bloody campaign to control the Somali capital Mogadishu. ""If there is anything we have learnt in the last couple of decades it is that foreign intervention, especially military intervention, doesn't work in Somalia,"" said Abdi. Kenya's largely conventional army is being hampered by heavy rains and Al-Shabaab's ability to melt into the background. However officials say their operation should be over within months. ""We don't want to go off and get stuck in Somalia,"" Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua said. ""When the United States, Ethiopia and others went there, they were trying to support an existing government. Our main objective is just to go in, dismantle the Al-Shabaab and get out."" What is the background to the unrest? Somalia has known only conflict since the 1991 fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, who had seized power in 1969, nine years after independence from Britain and Italy. Meanwhile, as the EU tightened fishing controls in Europe, fleets from Europe and Asia -- many operating illegally -- moved into East African waters to fish. According to many reports, in the absence of any Somali navy patrols, those fleets plundered fish stocks, decimating the livelihoods of many Somali fishermen. Fertile territory for Al Shabaab in chaos of Somalia . Many of these destitute former fisherman ""took matters into their own hands,"" according to the African Development Bank, and turned to hijacking ships to make up for lost income. The new ""industry"" was quickly co-opted by the Somali warlords and is now an organized, hierarchical gang-like operation. According to academic William Jelani Cobb, ""Somalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward."" In an article written for CNN in 2009 in response to the kidnapping of an American ship captain, Cobb wrote: ""Part of combating terrorism means addressing the conditions in which it flourishes. Extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong, but by ignoring ... the threats to the regional food supply, we effectively created a niche for these pirates."" Commentary: A lesson of Somali pirate attacks . How will the unrest affect the region? With famine causing misery for millions in the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Al-Shabaab and Kenyan forces is likely to hinder humanitarian efforts. Even before the incursion, aid workers found it difficult to provide relief, according to Roger Middleton, consultant researcher on Chatham House's Africa Program. ""If you've got a big war going on, it's difficult to distribute relief. Bombings only increase the risk,"" Middleton said, adding that discussions about access between aid workers and Al-Shabaab were unlikely to be eased by the conflict. How is the international community reacting? The Kenyan government says the decision to attack was its alone. Key western allies such as the U.S. and the UK have been quick to state publicly they are not assisting in this action, though the French say they will help. In the region, Rwanda and South Africa have issued statements backing Kenya. ""The international community is being quietly supportive,"" Middleton said, ""but only because they have no idea what else to do. ""I'm sure the U.S. and others have provided intelligence assistance, but there have been no overwhelming offers of support. Most governments believe sending troops into Somalia is not a good idea, but there is no plan B, apart from the status quo. ""Their reasoning is that Kenya forces could be stuck in Somalia for ages, or there could be an insurgent campaign in Kenya itself. It could go horribly wrong -- who knows?""","Somali pirates have started kidnapping foreigners in Kenya as well as hijacking boats .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Florida man who was the first to die in the 2001 anthrax attacks has reached a tentative settlement with the U.S. government over his death, a lawyer for the family said Monday. The family is waiting for word from the Justice Department before a deal is finalized, said Richard Schuler, the lawyer for the family of anthrax victim Robert Stevens. The family sued the government for $50 million in 2003, arguing that the military laboratory in Maryland that was identified as the source of the bacterium should have had tighter security. ""I think the family was vindicated that the government has agreed to settle the case with them in spite of the fact that they put up a lot of roadblocks,"" Schuler said. Stevens and his wife, Maureen, were married 27 years, and there is ""still a hole in her life as far as her husband is concerned,"" he said. Schuler would not comment on any details of the tentative deal. Stevens, a photo editor for supermarket-tabloid publisher American Media Inc., died five days after testing positive for inhalation anthrax in October 2001. He was the first of five people killed in the anthrax mailings, with 17 other people sickened. ""It's a horrible, painful death, that they had to witness their loved one go through,"" Schuler said. ""It's something that they'll never forget."" Court documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Palm Beach County, Florida, requested deadlines in the Stevens lawsuit be suspended as the parties tried to finalize a settlement. Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller declined to comment on any deal. ""The documents speak for themselves,"" Miller told CNN via e-mail. ""We would have nothing further at this time."" The FBI eventually blamed the attacks on a civilian scientist at the Army's biological research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The suspect, microbiologist Bruce Ivins, had a history of mental illness and killed himself in 2008 before investigators brought charges against him, federal prosecutors said. A February report by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that it could not reach a ""definitive conclusion"" about the source of the anthrax, which federal agents said had been linked to a sample from Ivins' laboratory. But the FBI and the Justice Department stand by their findings, saying that scientific testing gave agents ""valuable investigative leads"" that led them to Ivins. A CNN Presents investigation in early October revealed that the federal government has spent $19 billion to fight biological attacks. Multiple new labs have since opened to research potential treatments, and the government now counts nearly 15,000 workers, handling germs like Ebola, plague, and anthrax -- about twice as many as before. The FBI now checks potential workers for felonies and ties to terror groups. But proposed reforms like psychological screening or requiring two people in labs have gone nowhere, with scientists who have reviewed the issue calling those proposals intrusive, expensive and impractical.","Robert Stevens was the first of five killed in the 2001 anthrax attacks .

"(CNN) -- Al Shabaab, which has connections to al Qaeda, is a militant Islamist group that controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital, Somalia. It has waged an insurgency against the weak Transitional Federal Government since 2007. How it started . Somalia has been without any functioning government since 1991 -- perfect territory for different militia and factions to fight over the bones of the old state. Al Shabaab (which means ""the youth"" in Somali) emerged in about 2004. Its gunmen were involved in a series of assassinations of Somalis who had connections to the West. Al Shabaab began prospering when the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) seized the capital Mogadishu and much of central Somalia in 2006. After defeating a coalition of warlords backed by the United States, the ICU brought Shariah-style justice to the capital, temporarily halting the anarchy in the city. Many people in the capital welcomed the greater security that the ICU brought, thanks in part to the effective fighting skills of several hundred Al Shabaab fighters. Official: Al-Shabaab leaders contact Kenyan government to negotiate . Ethiopian invasion . Six months after the ICU established itself in Mogadishu, Ethiopia invaded Somalia, with backing from Washington. Both governments were concerned that the ICU were establishing fundamentalist Islamist rule and giving al Qaeda a foothold in Africa. Many of the ICU leadership fled, but Al Shabaab launched a guerrilla war against the 17,000 Ethiopian soldiers deployed, drawing support from many Somalis, for whom Ethiopia is the regional arch-enemy. The Ethiopians quickly occupied Mogadishu but failed to pacify much of central and southern Somalia. Al Shabaab was able to regroup in southern Somalia, aided by the squabbling within the Western-backed transitional federal government. In 2008, the militants began to retake a series of coastal towns south of the capital, and the port of Kismayo became a major source of revenue. According to the U.N. Al Shabaab collects an estimated $35-50 million annually in custom tolls and taxes on businesses in Kismayo -- and two secondary ports higher up the coast. At the same time, Al Shabaab commanders split from the political leadership of the ICU over talks with the government, which Al Shabaab rejected. For their part, elders in the ICU were uneasy with the growing role of foreign fighters within Al Shabaab and its shift from being a Somali resistance force to part of the global jihadist movement. Links with al Qaeda . Most Al Shabaab watchers believe that the organizational ties between the group and al Qaeda ""central"" are weak or non-existent. Both Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al Zawahiri lauded Al Shabaab for its resistance to Ethiopian occupation and its waging of jihad. Soon after the Ethjiopian invasion, Zawahiri encouraged Somalis to defeat the ""crusader Ethiopian invaders."" Some Al Shabaab leaders are said to have trained in Afghanistan, but the majority of young fighters have little knowledge of al Qaeda. Mysterious al Qaeda 'envoy' dispenses aid in Somalia . Al Shabaab formally declared its allegiance to al Qaeda in February 2010, claiming it would ""connect jihad in the Horn of Africa to the jihad led by al Qaeda."" It reiterated the affiliation when Zawahiri became al Qaeda's leader, and most recently declared that it would ""sacrifice everything in the attainment of a global Islamic Caliphate."" Disenchantment grows . Al Shabaab's best recruiting sergeant was the incapable transitional government and the long power struggle between President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former warlord, and his Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein. Yusuf, an ally of Ethiopia, was eventually forced to step down at the end of 2008, easing some of the tensions within the fragile government. At the same time, some Al Shabaab factions began what appeared to many Somalis as senseless attacks -- a suicide bombing against a graduation ceremony for doctors in 2009 which killed 19 people; an attack on a medical clinic used by African Union forces and civilians in January 2010; and in October this year another suicide attack against scholarship students gathered for an event near the Education Ministry. That attack killed more than 100 people. Al Shabaab's implementation of strict Sharia law has begun to alienate many in the way that al Qaeda did in Iraq. Women have been stoned to death for adultery; amputations and beheadings are common. In some areas Al Shabaab has banned listening to the radio and non-Arabic signs; and it has assassinated several journalists. In a country that has little tradition of strict Sharia, such moves alienate ordinary Somalis. Who's in charge? Al Shabaab has no conventional hierarchy and is divided into factions, with foreign fighters prominent in some areas and local commanders in control in others. It has also had fluctuating relationships with other Islamist groups in Somalia, such as Kamboni, with which it joined forces last year. The most prominent and established leader is Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who has been on a U.S. list of people ""linked to terrorism"" for a decade. ""I am not a terrorist. But if strictly following my religion and love for Islam makes me a terrorist, then I will accept the designation,"" he said five years ago. There is considerable tension within the movement over the extent to which Shariah law should be implemented; and more recently over allowing foreign aid groups into southern Somalia to help alleviate a famine that threatens the lives of millions. American carried out Somalia suicide bombing, Islamists claim . In essence the foreign fighters (among them an estimated 40 Somalis from the U.S. as well as more from Canada and Europe) see Al Shabaab's role as part of global jihad; most local leaders, especially in the south, have a more nationalistic approach. They oppose the government in Mogadishu and the role of African Union troops in protecting it; but are unhappy about Al Shabaab's ban on foreign aid for famine victims. Taking the fight overseas . It's unclear whether Al Shabaab -- like al Qaeda -- has ambitions to go global. It was involved in a double-bombing in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in 2010 -- in retaliation for Uganda's role in the AMISOM force that props up the transitional government. An Al Shabaab member tried to kill the Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard last year in revenge for his depictions of the Prophet Mohammed. And there is concern among western intelligence agencies that Al Shabaab may forge links with other Islamist terror groups in Africa, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria. The size of the Somali diaspora (1.5 million strong and concentrated in Scandinavia, Canada and the U.S.) gives Al Shabaab an opportunity to recruit for missions overseas, but to date the majority of ethnic Somalis recruited by Al Shabaab have remained in Somalia. Minnesota women found guilty of raising money for Somali terror group . Among an estimated 40 Americans who have joined Al Shabaab, at least two have died in suicide bombings. At least one -- Omar Hammami from Alabama -- has become prominent as a propagandist and recruiter, even recording rap videos about the Ethiopian invasion and dying as a martyr. ""We are all Osama,"" he is said to have told an Al Shabaab rally days after bin Laden's death. Current situation . In recent months, Al Shabaab has suffered a series of reverses in Mogadishu, with a senior figure being killed at a roadblock and AU troops pushing the group out of several neighborhoods. It's also on the defensive in its heartland in southern Somalia. Kenya has blamed Al Shabaab for the abductions of several foreigners in northern Kenya and has begun a cross border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer in southern Somalia. There have already been several clashes between Al Shabaab and Kenyan forces, with the Kenyans vowing to press on to Kismayo. Kenya vows to hit Al-Shabaab across Somali border . Around the capital, Al Shabaab's tactical withdrawal from Mogadishu has been followed by a rash of suicide attacks and ambushes as it has resorted has stepped up suicide attacks as it's lost ground. Few analysts expect a decisive victory for either Al Shabaab or the government and its foreign backers. But regional analysts fear that under pressure, Al Shabaab may lash out with attacks in Kenya and elsewhere.","Militant Islamist group has al Qaeda connections and some control of southern Somalia .

"New York (CNN) -- JetBlue has begun refunding the passengers of five flights who were stranded on the tarmac of a Connecticut airport for as long as eight hours on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the airline told CNN on Thursday. Alison Croyle, spokeswoman for the airline, said refunds are currently being issued to passengers on all five planes that remained on the tarmac of Bradley International Airport near Hartford, amid the severe snowstorm that hit the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. ""Yes, we started issuing refunds, but it will take us a while to get everyone,"" she said. She said the passengers were given a letter on Saturday notifying them of full refund for their trip and a roundtrip voucher for future trips, customer service was also told to call each customer and apologize. CNN Senior U.N. Correspondent Richard Roth, who was stuck for eight hours on the tarmac aboard JetBlue Flight 504, said he had received a ticket price refund of $161.86. That flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but was diverted due to the weather. In a video posed Tuesday on the airline's blog and YouTube channel, Chief Operating Officer Rob Maruster apologized for a ""confluence of events"" that led to the incident, which he explained as ""various runway, congestion and other operational issues at Newark and JFK Airports."" However, Maruster said, ""at no point in this weekend was safety ever compromised."" ""But let's face it, you count on us at JetBlue for a lot more -- and we promise a lot more -- and we know we let some of you down over the course of this weekend and for that we are truly sorry."" Maruster said the airline intends to ""fully participate with the Department of Transportation and cooperating with their investigation into events over the weekend, and we're also going to conduct an internal evaluation so that we can learn from this event because at the end of the day, you deserve better -- and we expect better from our crew members and our operation."" During the eight-hour ordeal aboard Flight 504, there was little food or water, passengers were fighting, and some had medical issues . ""I got a problem here on the airplane. I'm going to need to have the cops onboard,"" a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on LiveATC.net, a website that monitors air traffic control conversations. ""I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane."" Passenger Roseann Kozma explained the situation in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WTIC from the plane.

"Quantico, Virginia (CNN) -- If you like spy thrillers, Sudoku and the daily crossword puzzle, you might want to try this: help the FBI crack a secret code. It could solve a suspected murder. Ricky McCormick's decomposing body was found in a field near St. Louis, Missouri, in 1999. It wasn't clear how the 41-year old unemployed McCormick had died, but law enforcement believed he was murdered. Their best clue: two pages of encrypted notes written by McCormick and found in his pocket. They might tell investigators where McCormick had been, what he had been doing and who might have wanted him dead. But they couldn't break the code. In 2001, local law enforcement turned to the FBI Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit for help. Its analysts, statisticians and mathematicians have puzzled over the two pages of numbers and letters intermittently for 10 years trying to figure out what they mean, but they haven't found the key. ""We're beat,"" says the head of the unit, Dan Olson. On March 29, the FBI asked the public for ideas. In just a week and half more than 2,300 tips have flooded in. They are still being processed, but so far none of the theories or leads has solved the mystery. Go to FBI site, see if you can help crack code . Could the notes be gibberish? Olson says they definitely are not. ""We have patterns. We have very consistent character repeating sequences. There are almost rules to whatever language this is. This is not random. This is not just letters put down."" McCormick had dabbled with ciphers since he was a child and although he wasn't well educated, Olson says, his code is unlike anything he has ever seen -- unique and idiosyncratic. He hopes a member of the public might connect it with a hobby, a game or a line of work. The FBI unit often cracks codes in just a couple of hours. It has deciphered secret communications about murder, drug transactions, illegal gambling and human trafficking. One of the toughest cases involved a note composed by Brian Patrick Regan, a former Air Force master sergeant convicted of attempted espionage in 2003. The note identified seven locations in a Maryland's Patapsco Valley State Park where Regan allegedly dropped documents stolen from the National Reconnaissance Office. The office builds and operates satellites for government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency. While in prison, Regan worked with the FBI to decipher the complex code, which he had created but, ironically, had forgotten. Eventually, they were able to associate a sequence of code with the letter ""F."" The key that unlocked it was the name Frank, handwritten under a gag photograph of a masked classmate in Regan's middle school yearbook. Olson says computers aren't much use in his line of work. ""These are codes that are made by humans and they're best broken by humans,"" he says. A simple whiteboard, however, is an important tool. Olson and his team use one to dissect a segment of code, looking for patterns and logic in what appears to be a jumble of symbols. It is collaborative work where creative ideas and unusual insights are encouraged and exchanged. Olson says a good crpytanalyst needs tenacity and high self-esteem. He or she can not be easily discouraged, Olson says, but sometimes needs to recognize that there is a time to step away. Do they ever quit working on a code altogether? It doesn't look that way. In the FBI office is a board holding copies of the FBI's ""Top 10"" uncracked coded communications. Over the years, some have been solved and removed. Right now, in the top slot, is a note from the ""Zodiac Killer,"" who murdered five people in California's Bay Area in 1968 and 1969. The notes found in Ricky McCormick's pocket are posted in position No. 3. Olson is hopeful that sometime soon, with the public's help, they too will come down from the board and questions about McCormick's death will finally be answered.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's doctor will hear closing arguments from the prosecution and defense Thursday, with deliberations on Dr. Conrad Murray's fate expected to begin late Thursday or Friday. It follows 22 days of testimony from several of Murray's girlfriends and patients, Jackson employees, paramedics and emergency room doctors, investigators and medical experts. Jackson's mother will sit on one side of the courtroom, while Murray's mother is likely to be seated on the other end Thursday as the seven men and five women on the jury listen to each side sum up their case. Jackson was preparing for a series of 50 shows in London, part of a career comeback, when he died on June 25, 2009. Murray told detectives in an interview two days after Jackson's death that he had used the surgical anesthetic propofol to help Jackson sleep nearly every night for the previous two months, with the exception of his last three nights. He was using the sedatives lorazepam and Midazolam in an effort to wean Jackson off of propofol the morning he died, Murray said. When those drugs weren't working after almost 10 hours of trying, he gave him a single injection of propofol, which did put Jackson to sleep, he said. Jackson's death was caused by ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with two sedatives, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled. The prosecution contends Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia was so reckless it was criminally negligent and caused the singer's death. Murray failed to perform the legal obligation as a doctor because his treatment egregiously and extremely deviated from the required standard of medical care, the prosecution alleges. The defense contends that Jackson, not Murray, administered the fatal doses of propofol and sedatives the coroner ruled killed the pop icon. He was so desperate for sleep, and afraid his comeback concerts would be canceled without it, that he injected himself while Murray was not watching, the defense argues. Prosecutors say it makes no difference how the propofol got into Jackson's blood since it was Murray who brought the drugs into the bedroom and left him alone long enough to die. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor will start Thursday's court session by instructing the jury on the law guiding the decisions they must make. The jury must unanimously agree on one of two theories in order to convict Murray on the single count of involuntary manslaughter. The first theory is that Murray's administration of propofol to Jackson was criminally negligent and it caused Jackson's death. Although it was legal, as a licensed doctor, for Murray to administer propofol to Jackson, they could find he was reckless in the way he did it, which created a high risk of death. Criminal negligence requires more than just ordinary carelessness, inattention, or mistakes in judgment, the judge will tell jurors. A reasonable person would have to have known that the action would create such a risk of death. Prosecutors have laid out a list of acts they allege were negligent, including not having other medical staff present when propofol was used, a lack of monitoring equipment, ineffective resuscitative care when Jackson stopped breathing and a delay in calling for an ambulance. Using propofol, which is intended to sedate surgical patients, for sleep was another egregious deviation, they argue. The second theory that jurors could accept is that Murray, who assumed a legal obligation to care for Jackson when he became his physician, failed to perform this legal duty by deviating from standards of care required of a doctor, including, when he left him alone and unmonitored after administering propofol. The judge asked lawyers to finish their closing arguments by the end of Thursday, so the jury could begin deliberations. Murray, if convicted, faces up to four years in prison and the loss of his medical license.","Jurors have two theories of guilt to consider for Dr. Conrad Murray .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- In August last year, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak was not happy with Saudi Arabia. He complained that the Saudis appeared to be funding an opposition candidate, Anwar Ibrahim, in upcoming elections. What's more, the Malaysian authorities suspected two senior Saudi princes of involvement. The Saudis launched an investigation, and uncovered something very different -- and more alarming. A secret report seen by CNN concludes: ""There is no evidence any Saudi official ever supported Anwar Ibrahim"" and ""claims of support from the Saudi royals named in the initial report [names redacted] were found to be without basis."" But the investigation found that hundreds of millions of dollars of Saudi money had been funneled to leading Islamist politicians and political activists overseas. It also found that al Qaeda and the Taliban were still able to use Saudi Arabia for fund-raising, despite numerous measures to choke off those sources of cash. According to a Saudi source who is not authorized to speak publically, ""People close to the senior leadership of the Taliban live in Saudi Arabia and send money back"" [to the Taliban]. Today he estimates the money reaching al Qaeda is ""in the region of tens of thousands of dollars possibly hundreds of thousands."" The nine-page summary of the secret report states that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political group present in many Muslim countries, was trying ""through its many affiliated charities and organizations -- often with the funding of unwitting private Saudi citizens -- to spread its influence by providing support for candidates in Islamic democracies."" According to the report the payback was simple. ""Once in power these candidates are expected to further the Brotherhood's goals."" Al Qaeda was able to benefit from these secret funding mechanisms, according to the source, because some in the Muslim Brotherhood had ""historic sympathies and connections"" with members of the terror group -- dating back to when Saudi Arabia and the CIA covertly funded the Afghan mujahideen to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The connections meant that money in Muslim Brotherhood hands was ""occasionally"" given to al Qaeda, the source said. The report reveals a complex web of Islamic charities and banks -- often involved in funding legitimate humanitarian projects -- as unwitting facilitators of the illicit transfers. And it says that over several decades ""a handful of Saudi and other Arab individuals and organizations"" were supporting ""the same groups that Arab, U.S. and European governments have long suspected of having close ties to extreme militant organizations that have been accused of supporting terrorist activities around the world."" The problem facing Saudi authorities is huge, the source told CNN. ""Eighty-six percent of all Islamic charities are based in Saudi Arabia"" making ""monitoring all their activities difficult."" The problem was compounded by several other factors, he said. Saudi Arabia ""has the world's fourth largest migrant workforce, 7 million legal workers, 3 million illegal."" Many of them use unregulated Islamic Hawala money transfer banks where a deposit in one country can immediately be picked up in another with no paper trail to trace it. The Hawala networks were identified by the U.S. Treasury Department last year as a significant channel for funding the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Funds are also collected from innocent unsuspecting pilgrims on the Hajj that attracts millions of Muslims to Mecca, Islam's holiest site every year. The report says Saudi Arabia has made a major effort ""to block terrorist financing"" that has been ""monumental in scope and far reaching in their success."" But it concluded: ""Increased diligence and efforts are warranted."" The Saudi source tells CNN that the country still has a fundamental problem which shows how money channeled through the Muslim Brotherhood could evade detection for so long and why al Qaeda can still get funding from the desert Kingdom. ""Despite promises since 2002 that Saudi would put in place institutions to thwart funds getting to AQ, nothing has happened to build an oversight agency,"" he says. The money being funneled illegally he says is ""not the amount of money it was 4 or 5 years ago,"" but without a national agency ""like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"" to oversee the charities further progress is going to be limited.","Secret report found hundreds of millions of dollars of Saudi money had been funneled to leading Islamist politicians and political activists overseas .

"(CNN) -- The head of an embattled Connecticut power company defended his utility's response to a freak fall snowstorm that -- six days after it hit -- continues to leave hundreds of thousands without electricity. As of Friday night, about 283,000 households who get service through Connecticut Light and Power remained in the dark. The utility, which at one point had 831,000 such outages, has promised to return power to 99% of its customers by Sunday night. ""I believe CL&P has done a very good job,"" Jeffrey Butler, utility president and CEO, said Friday evening. ""This storm is of historic proportions... Have you ever seen an event like this?"" Butler made his remarks a day after Connecticut's attorney general called for regulators to investigate CL&P, the state's main electric utility, over its handling of the storm. Attorney General George Jepsen filed the request with the state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is already investigating CL&P over its response to power outages during Tropical Storm Irene in September. Eight people have died in Connecticut due to the storm, four of them from carbon monoxide poisoning, Gov. Dannel Malloy has said. He told reporters Friday that there have been a total of 322 carbon monoxide cases statewide. While saying he ""sure hopes"" he can trust Connecticut Light and Power, Malloy acknowledged that there were definite problems that must be addressed before the winter storm season begins in earnest. To this end, the governor announced Friday that Witt Associates -- a consulting firm led by former FEMA Director James Lee Witt -- will ""do a review of Connecticut Light and Power and UI (the United Illuminating Company) in the wake of their performance."" The review will be done at no expense to the state and be completed by December 1, before a different panel probing similar storm-related issues completes its own report. ""(We are) bringing in outside expertise to take an immediate look,"" Malloy said. ""I can't wait for the two-storm commission to make recommendations because we have winter staring us in the face."" The governor, specifically, said one area of focus will likely be the amount of tree branches that threaten power lines, adding that residents may have to sacrifice foliage for safety and energy security. ""What we have learned ... is that we are a vulnerable state to different types of weather conditions -- wind and snow are clearly two of those,"" said Malloy. ""And I think we can do better, in the long run, to prepare ourselves."" Eighty shelters were open around Connecticut on Friday night, in addition to 109 warming centers. The governor said that food and water had been delivered to residents of 82 towns, with more goods set to be delivered upon request. Butler, the Connecticut utility chief, said that the effort to restore power is in full swing. While acknowledging there may be ""opportunities"" for improvement, he blamed the weather conditions -- including as much as 20 inches of heavy wet snow in spots -- as the primary reason for the prolonged outages. ""Everyone I talked to, they've never seen anything like this,"" said Butler, who came to Connecticut after 27 years at Pacific Gas and Electric Company. ""The destruction of the trees was unbelievable."" He said that between 5,000 and 6,000 workers were on the job working to cut back trees and restore power, committed to the Sunday night goal. The late October storm killed at least 22 people around the eastern United States. That includes six deaths in Massachusetts, not including a seventh under investigation, said Peter William Judge, public information officer for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, on Thursday. In New Jersey, eight storm-related fatalities were tallied, including three people who burned to death in house fires, one person who died when a branch fell on him, another who died when a tree fell on him, and three people who died in motor vehicle accidents. A ninth death was under investigation. President Barack Obama has signed emergency declarations for New Hampshire and Connecticut, clearing the way for federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.","The head of Connecticut Light and Power defends his utility's handling of storm .

"(CNN) -- Udinese have gone top of the Italian Serie A table on goal difference from Lazio after captain Antonio Di Natale was again on target in a 2-1 victory over Siena on Sunday. With previous leaders Juventus seeing their match against Napoli called off because of torrential rain, Udinese, Lazio and Milan all exploited the situation with wins, dropping Juve to fourth place. Udinese took the lead after just 54 seconds against Siena, when Dusan Basta prodded the ball home from close range. And the prolific Di Natale doubled the advantage in the 64th minute when he cut inside a defender to finish Pablo Armero's long ball. Siena pulled a goal back 13 minutes from time when Francesco Bolzoni fired home Emanuele Calaio's header on the half-volley, but the home side held on to move onto 21 points from their 10 games. Lazio are level on point, but have just a single goal inferior goal difference following a 1-0 home win over Parma. Giuseppe Sculli poked home the winner with just five minutes remaining to leave Edy Reja's side firmly in the championship race. However, the performance of the day came from Milan, who are ominously just a point behind in third position after thrashing Catania 4-0. Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring with a seventh minute penalty after Davide Lanzafame fouled Robinho in the area. Brazilian striker Robinho then helped himself to the second goal in the 24th minute, curling the bal home after Ibrahimovic had sent him clear on the left wing. The same two players combined again for a 69th minute third goal, with Robinho's strike being bundled over the line by back-tracking defender Francesco Lodi. And Gianluca Zambrotta added the icing on the cake for Milan three minutes later when he was on hand to score after Alberto Aquilani's free-kick had been fumbled.","Udinese have gone top of Italian Serie A after a 2-1 home victory over Siena .

"(CNN) -- One damp, chilly evening in October, Dolores Kopchak called the police. She had a rather unusual problem: a lion in her back yard. She was calling from Kopchak Road, named after her family and familiar to law enforcement authorities in the small town of Zanesville, Ohio. They had had responded to complaints there before. Kopchak's neighbor, Terry Thompson, owned a bunch of wild animals. When Sgt. Steve Blake arrived on the scene, he saw a black bear and two African lions. He immediately shut down Kopchak Road and called for help. What happened next on that evening reads more like the stuff of an action-packed adventure novel than police reports. The Muskingum County Sheriff's Office has released many of those reports that reveal how law enforcement officials were thrust into a desperate hunt for potential killers on the loose. On October 18, as highway signs cautioned drivers to remain in cars and local schools were making a decision to close the next morning, deputies traversed Thompson's property and beyond and came face to face with animals that most people see from the other side of a cage or in the safety of a guided safari. Deputy Jay Lawhorne had been on Thompson's property before, responding to previous complaints about him, including animal abuse. Thompson, 62, had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms. A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending. Lawhorne picked up his M4 rife with .223-caliber ammo and got in the back of the pickup. The deputies began going up Thompson's driveway not knowing what they would find. It was already after 6 p.m. and they knew they only had one hour of daylight left. There were cages on the left and the right of the driveway. Tigers, lions, cheetahs and bears roamed about. They were ordered to find Thompson and ""neutralize"" any animal that posed a threat to people. With no tranquilizers on hand, their only choice was to shoot. Thompson's house was empty, save two monkeys and a small dog, Blake said in his report. On his way out, Blake saw a body near an embankment. It was Thompson. He was on his back. A handgun lay near him. And a pair of blue bolt cutters. He had used it to free all his animals from their pens before he shot himself. A large white tiger was sitting 5 feet away. It appeared the cat had fed on Thompson's flesh, Blake said. It was impossible for the deputies to approach the body because of the tiger. The deputies called for more help and got out on foot. Right behind Thompson's large barn, at the top of hill near the house, they saw several large cages where the larger lions had been kept. The deputies secured the heavy wooden doors but as they got closer, they realized the cages had been cut open. A lion came out just 3 feet away. Lawhorne said he was forced to shoot it dead. Another deputy encountered a lion hissing at him and baring its lethal teeth. Behind the lions were pens that held bears and wolves but, instead, a tiger and bear came out. The tiger charged Lawhorne. It, too, had to be put down. The deputies were able to save a black panther and a spotted leopard. At 11:30, the deputies gave up the search for the night. Lawhorne said Sheriff Matt Lutz told him his replacement would arrive at 6:30 in the morning. But Lawhorne was not out of danger yet. He and Deputy Adam Swope were walking down to the back of Thompson's property when they encountered a tiger hiding in the brush. They radioed it in and were informed that a Columbus zookeeper was on her way to tranquilize the cat. It took 15 minutes for her to get there. It was going to take another 10 minutes for the tranquilizer to take effect. Lawhorne and other deputies stood by with assault weapons. Just in case. The tiger jolted when the dart hit, but it did not get up. But after a few minutes, it charged directly at the zookeeper. The deputies fired. The tiger backed off and laid down. They gave it another 15 minutes for the tranquilizer to take effect. The zookeeper then felt it was safe to approach. But when they were less than 10 feet away, the tiger thrashed again. This time, it was shot dead. In all, deputies shot 49 of Thompson's menagerie. Some, like the Bengal tigers, were endangered species. Thompson's wife, Marian, chose a burial site, according to the police reports. The animals were placed in a single grave. John Moore, who worked as a caretaker for Thompson's animals, said that he had last seen Terry Thompson the day before he died, according to the police reports. Thompson told him then that he had received a letter about Marian cheating on him. He told Moore: ""I have a plan to find out and you will know when it happens."" No one may ever know what Thompson's plans included -- his death is still under investigation and not all records have been released. Thompson is gone. So are his animals. The Humane Society of the United States said that under the circumstances, it did not fault the deputies for using deadly force. But a public debate was sparked over exotic animals and the laws that govern ownership. The bizarre events that day were seen around the world. And Zanesville will forever go down as the small Ohio city with the really big animals.","County sheriff's office releases reports about what happened in Zanesville, Ohio .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture is planning to swap in a plate icon for the food pyramid this week, an individual familiar with the new guidelines told CNN Saturday. The new image, expected to be unveiled Thursday, is meant to help remind Americans to make healthy food choices. ""We presume that it will be divided into sections that will show you how much of different types of foods you should be eating,"" said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent, about the plate image. The USDA said in a statement this week that the new food icon would be ""part of a comprehensive nutrition communication initiative that provides consumers with easy-to-understand recommendations, a new website with expanded information, and other tools and resources."" It did not say then what the new icon would be. The Food Guide Pyramid was introduced in 1992 and replaced in 2005 by MyPyramid. ""The pyramid, to put it gently, is not considered a great public health success,"" said Cohen. ""It was confusing and divided into lots of intricate sections."" The original version is the widely recognized pyramid that shows a hierarchy of food groups. Grains, vegetables and fruits were represented at the base of the pyramid, suggesting they should be eaten often. Foods to be consumed in some moderation, like fats, dairy products and meats, were toward the top of the icon. The 2005 version had vertical, rather than horizontal, blocks representing the various food groups. It also had a figure stepping up the side of the pyramid, reminding consumers of the need to exercise. CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","NEW: The food pyramid has been criticized as confusing .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan invoked his country's recovery from World War II on Tuesday as he sought to turn the nation's attention to the arduous task of rebuilding. Yet the challenges awaiting Japan remained on full display the day he spoke: The country rated the crisis at a nuclear plant stricken after last month's earthquake and tsunami as the most severe on an international system for rating nuclear accidents. And a fresh round of earthquakes rumbled across an already battered landscape. One with a magnitude of 6.3 was the latest of 52 quakes with a magnitude of 6 or greater since a monster 9.0 quake rocked the country and spawned a tsunami, leaving nearly 28,0000 people dead or missing. The prime minister noted that he was born in 1946, a year after the end of World War II, and that his family used an unexploded bomb to help stabilize a pickling tub in their home. He said the Japanese people ""stood up bravely and achieved a reconstruction that amazed the world"" after the war. ""We must renew the determination that we had in the post-World War II reconstruction period, and we must tackle the task of reconstruction after this earthquake,"" he said. The devastation left behind by the March 11 earthquake is an opportunity to build ""a new, better future than before,"" said the prime minister. He spoke at a news conference that had been originally scheduled to take place Monday but was delayed because of a series of aftershocks that rattled northern Japan. In one of the lastest developments following the wave of aftershocks, the Iwaki Fire Department said the death toll from landslides set off by a 6.6-magnitude quake on Monday had risen to six. Iwaki is located about 100 miles (164 kilometers) northeast of Tokyo and about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The landslides in Iwaki buried three houses.","The Japanese prime minister urged Japan to focus on rebuilding .

"(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush joined a chorus of U.S. officials calling any leaks of sensitive government information ""very damaging,"" telling a forum at Facebook headquarters that Wikileaks' recent release of 250,000 documents may significantly hurt Washington's image abroad. ""It's going to be very hard to keep the trust of foreign leaders,"" the nation's 43rd president said of the documents on issues ranging from Iran to Honduras to Turkey. ""If you have a conversation with a foreign leader and it ends up in a newspaper, you don't like it. I didn't like it."" A relaxed Bush was joined by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on stage in Palo Alto, California, with hundreds watching from the audience and up to 6,500 following the interview live online. The hourlong discussion centered on Bush's memoir, ""Decision Points."" Released just over two weeks ago, the book ranks atop the New York Times' hardcover nonfiction best-seller list, topping works by the likes of rapper Jay-Z, rocker Keith Richards and the late Mark Twain. The president made it clear that pitching that memoir was his main reason for visiting the social network's office, saying, ""you have got a lot of people paying attention, and I'm trying to sell books."" Still, beyond hawking his 481-page memoir and pushing several initiatives from the George W. Bush Institute, Bush said he had no desire to intervene in day-to-day politics or be the center of the world's attention once again. ""I have no desire to generate publicity,"" said Bush, 64. ""I've had enough of fame, and I want to go back to a life that is productive ... without generating the [limelight]."" Beyond passing references to current events, like calling South Korea a ""force for peace,"" Bush focused on key moments from his time in the Oval Office from January 2001 to 2009. He offered anecdotes, talked about sports and even kidded with Zuckerberg, no stranger to the spotlight after this year's hit movie ""The Social Network,"" which presented one version of Facebook's rise. The president admitted personally using ""the Facebook"" since leaving office, pointing to his 600,000 online friends. And he playfully, though publicly, asked Zuckerberg to join him in a ""joint venture"" promoting public education -- in light of his initiatives at the Bush Institute and Zuckerberg's donation this fall of $100 million toward improving public schools in Newark, New Jersey. As he has in other interviews, Bush stated his confidence that the decision to invade Iraq was just, predicting that Iraq will become a crucial hub of democracy in the Middle East. He said that promoting ""freedom"" -- be it personal, political, educational or economic -- will be central to his post-presidency life. ""We're involved in an ideological struggle that will eventually be won, as freedom prevails,"" Bush said. While his standing has improved, a poll released this month shows that four in 10 Americans say Bush was a poor president, and another third rate him as average. Another 28 percent rated him as a good or as one of the greatest presidents ever, up from 20 percent when he left the Oval Office in January 2009. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted November 11-14, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Bush said he won't criticize President Barack Obama, saying, ""it's not good for the country ... [and] I don't want to."" And Bush said he's learned, from his time as a business and political executive, how to handle criticism -- including when to ignore it and when to learn from others -- and come to grips with what others think of him. ""Anybody can distinguish between someone who is trying to be helpful and someone who is trying to hurt you,"" Bush said. ""You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a college graduate, for that matter."" Here he pointed to Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard to found Facebook.","Former President George W.

"Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Brisbane is more accustomed to drought than flood. For many years, residents were obliged to adhere to strict water restrictions during the long wait for rain. Daily updates were given as to how little water remained in dams that are now full to overflowing. Locals were encouraged to invest in their own water tanks to ease pressure on the system. The city's residents were given specific days and times to water their gardens, according to their house numbers. Neighbors kept an eye out for wasteful practices and it wasn't unheard of for people to sneak out under the cover of darkness to give their dying plants an extra drop. Just a few years later, the city has been inundated with water, amid warnings there is more to come. The rain has been pelting down for days if not weeks. Rain used to be celebrated here. Now people are praying for it to stop. The ground is so saturated it doesn't take long for each downpour to start pooling and gushing towards already overflowing drains. The last time Brisbane experienced flooding on this scale was in January 1974. Older residents remember when weeks of rain combined with the effects of a cyclone and exceptionally high tides to flood the city. Water washed into thousands of homes and 14 people died. Lessons from that disaster formed much of the preparation for this week's flood warnings. A massive dam with a capacity of more than one million megaliters -- about the size of two Sydney Harbours -- was built at Wivenhoe, west of the city, to provide flood protection system. That dam is now full and authorities are releasing increasing amounts of water to ease pressure on its walls. Sandbags are being distributed to people who live in vulnerable areas. Evacuation areas are taking hundreds if not thousands of people who have followed advice to leave their homes. Long lines have been forming at supermarkets as people prepare for the days ahead. People are queuing not in rubber boots, but flip-flops, another sign this city is more accustomed to sun and heat than torrential rain. CNN iReport: High water closes roads in Ipswich, Queensland . In the days after Christmas the people of Brisbane witnessed from a distance the devastating effort of floods further north in the state. And just two days ago, shocking scenes came from west of the city as a wall of water rushed through Toowoomba. Ten lives have been lost across Queensland in the flood and more deaths are expected among the missing. No one has yet estimated the final cost of the flooding to the Queensland economy. More than $200 million was spent in the aftermath of the 1974 flood but this time the cleanup bill is likely to be much higher. It has already been estimated that severe flooding in the state's north could cost mining companies $2 billion in lost production. Many of those affected in regional areas are farmers. Crops have been washed away and livestock lost. The people of Brisbane are not only bracing themselves for the worst flooding in decades, but the inevitable rise in food costs and taxes as the state struggles to rebuild regional towns and support the farmers who have seen not only their homes but their livelihoods washed away. Whatever happens in the days to come, the events of recent weeks will result in a staggering challenge for both people who live far away from the city center, in rural areas of the state, as well as those who live and work in the heart of the city along the banks of the Brisbane River.","The Brisbane River is still rising, with water levels expected to peak on Thursday .
Floods feared to be worse than in 1974, when thousands of homes were inundated, and 14 people died .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Some 700 people have been killed in clashes with Islamic militants in Nigeria, a military commander told CNN. Bodies of hard-line Islamic rebels killed in battle lie in a Nigerian city. Civilians and troops also have died. The fighting in the northeast Nigerian town of Maiduguri began with attacks by the Muslim militants on police and government targets, starting a week ago. Col. Ben Ahonotu, commander of the operation to combat Islamic militants, gave the new total. Previous reports said at least 400 rebels, troops and civilians had died in the region, including Borno, Yobe, Kano and Katsina states. Maiduguri is in Borno state. Ahonotu did not elaborate or provide further information, and it was unclear whether the 700 was in addition to the previous death toll. Attacks on police and government targets have been reported throughout the region. Boko Haram, an Islamist sect, wants the government to impose Islamic law, known as sharia, in the entire Muslim-dominated northern half of Nigeria. Sharia is already practiced in some northern states, but the sect wants even tougher religious laws and also opposes Western education. The southern half of Nigeria is predominantly Christian. A Boko Haram leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was reported captured Thursday by the military, but was found dead after he was turned over to police. Human rights groups are seeking more information on his death, and have also expressed concern about civilian casualties.","Hard-line Muslim militants fighting government troops in northern Nigeria .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. State Department threw aside diplomatic language Tuesday, attacking Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for creating what it calls a ""catastrophe"" by throwing many international aid workers out of the country. President Omar al-Bashir ordered the expulsion of aid groups after he was indicted on war crimes charges. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a direct challenge to Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir Tuesday, warning that he and his government ""will be held responsible for every single death that occurs in"" the refugee camps of the Darfur region. Al-Bashir ordered the expulsion of 13 international aid groups from the Sudan earlier this month after he was indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes. While other aid groups remain in Sudan, the United Nations said the 13 expelled groups provided roughly half the assistance delivered in Darfur. Nearly 300,000 people have died in the Darfur conflict, and millions are homeless, according to the U.N. Calling the situation in Darfur ""horrendous,"" Clinton said President Obama's administration will appoint a special envoy for Sudan ""in the coming days."" On Wednesday, retired Air Force Gen. J. Scott Gration was appointed as U.S. special envoy for Sudan, the White House announced in a written statement. ""Sudan is a priority for this administration, particularly at a time when it cries out for peace and for justice. The worsening humanitarian crisis there makes our task all the more urgent,"" President Barack Obama said in the statement. ""General Gration's personal and professional background, and his service to the country as both a military leader and a humanitarian, give him the insights and experience necessary for this assignment."" Gration, a former fighter pilot, served as assistant deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for international affairs. Fluent in Swahili, he was raised partly in Africa, where his parents were missionary teachers . Clinton said the real question now is what kind of pressure can be brought to bear on al-Bashir and the government in Khartoum to make them understand ""that they will be held responsible for every single death that occurs in those camps."" State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters, ""It's just a catastrophe that Bashir has created. We're going to continue to make this case and we're imploring others to make this case that he needs to reverse that decision he took. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, could possibly be at risk and it's irresponsible, the action he took, and he needs to reverse it and reverse it immediately. People's lives are at risk."" Clinton said countries that support al-Bashir's expulsion order ""have the responsibility to persuade the government in Sudan to change its decision to let the aid workers back, or they must replace with money and personnel those who have been expelled so that innocent lives are not lost and further undermined."" Clinton said the United States is ""very concerned"" and is looking for more effective ways to convince the Sudanese government that ""they have assumed an even greater sense of responsibility and infamy in the eyes of the world by turning their backs on these refugees whom they created in the first place."" Wood said it is clear that Bashir is the sole person at fault. ""Bashir is to blame for this crisis on the ground,"" he said.  His actions have only made things a lot worse. We are trying to get him to reverse this decision. We want to call on all those who have influence with the government of Sudan, institutions like the African Union, the Arab League, to do what they can to get Bashir to reverse his decision."" Obama, during his election campaign, made the crisis in Darfur a major focus. Since then, some have criticized him for putting it on the back burner. Seeking to rebut that view, Wood listed all recent steps the administration has taken to resolve the situation. Last week, he said, Obama discussed the deteriorating situation in Sudan with U.N. Secretary General Ban ki-Moon. U.S. officials have been meeting in New York, Washington and Khartoum with delegations from what Wood called ""like-minded nations."" Last weekend, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Sudan met with UNAMID (the African Union/United Nations operation in Darfur) and visited a camp for internally displaced people. And last week in New York, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice spoke with the president of South Sudan and the Sudanese ambassador to the U.N. Wood said the U.S. has been reaching out to the Arab League, the African Union and other countries with influence on Sudan, trying to convince them the decision to expel some aid groups ""not only costs lives but serves to further isolate the country."" Asked whether the U.S. supports a move to defer the ICC indictment of Bashir, Wood said it does not support ""any deferral.""","State Department says Sudan president throwing out aid agencies is ""catastrophe""

"(CNN) -- The success achieved by Portuguese soccer coach Jose Mourinho suggests that his players would not just run through a brick wall for him; they'd happily march through an obstacle course full of them to earn his respect. The self-proclaimed ""Special One"" is the flamboyant manager of Italian champions Inter Milan who are currently on course to take the Serie A title for the fifth consecutive year. But if his current Inter squad love him, then his former Chelsea players adore him, after his successful stint at the club between 2004 and 2007 delivered their first English Premier League triumphs in over 50 years. England international and Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard says of Mourinho: ""I love him as a man and as a manager."" The two sets of players collide in Europe's most prestigious club competition  -- the Champions League -- on Wednesday, when all eyes will be on the game's ultimate touchline showman in his first competitive match against his old club. But how does Mourinho arouse such complete loyalty from his employees? And is he everything a good boss should be? He does and he is, according to sports psychologist Andy Barton. Respect . ""Mourinho's role with his players is the same as it should be in any office,"" Barton told CNN. ""He is very, very supportive of them and treats them as equals. He knows he needs to focus people on what they do well, and then on what they need to do to improve. ""Sometimes in the workplace managers think it is all about being ruthless when that is the least effective way of doing things. Appraisals can turn into a long list of what employees do wrong. That doesn't help at all; it puts them in a negative mind set. ""But Mourinho will always look to turn a positive into a negative. If a team is 3-0 down at half time and the manager starts screaming about all the mistakes they've made it isn't going to help. Instead he'll focus on some of the things they are doing right, and then tell them how they can turn the game around. ""You have to be specific about what is required; that way, the player or employee starts to build up a mental image of what is needed. A good manager is committed to trying to get the best out of an individual, and knowing how each member of staff ticks. Mourinho is a master at that."" Protection . Barton says Mourinho is desperate to alleviate as much pressure as possible from his players, and is quite prepared to do something outrageous to shield them from criticism. Mourinho was hit with a three-game ban following a gesture he made during Saturday's controversial 0-0 draw against Sampdoria. After two of his players were sent off Mourinho crossed his arms in the manner of being handcuffed -- a suggestion that Inter were being victimized by match officials. Previously this season, after another poor Inter performance, Mourinho leapt off the team coach to physically confront a journalist who he said had invaded his players' space. The media uproar after the confrontation deflected attention from the bad result, and made sure he was the story instead. One of his players, Diego Milito, confirmed the success of this tactic in an interview with newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport: ""There is no coach like him when it comes to sticking his neck out and defending everyone, that way reducing the tension within the team when things aren't going well. It's no fluke that after a defeat, Inter gets straight back on its feet. That's all thanks to Mourinho."" Self belief . Underpinning Mourinho's approach is an unwavering self belief that he transmits to his players, as Barton explained: ""Mourinho's self belief is palpable and you can read it in everything -- his body language and how he speaks -- you know he has complete trust in his abilities and that gives his players confidence. ""He's like a general on the touchline, commanding his troops and he explodes sometimes. He may do it heighten the opposition players arousal levels, to inspire in them an intense desire to beat him, and that can throw them off their game and affect their decision making. He very much makes it us against the world."" There is another intriguing subplot to the Inter versus Chelsea clash. The English side are now managed by Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, who left Inter's bitter rivals AC Milan this summer. A running battle between the pair erupted during their stint in opposite dugouts and it continued even after Ancelotti left for London. Mourinho has been quoted as saying: ""Ancelotti is no friend of mine."" The Italian replied by referring to his rival as ""His Mourinhity"" in his autobiography. Mourinho often says inflammatory things about opposition players and managers before a big game but Barton says Mourinho may take a different approach in the build up to Wednesday's crucial match. He told CNN: ""I don't think he will be confrontational about his return clash against Chelsea because he has always professed his love for the club and the players he used to coach but he will make a few jibes about Ancelotti, and could try to undermine his position by talking about his own success at the club. ""The thing about Mourinho is that you don't know what he's going to do next but whatever it is it will be because he thinks it is beneficial to the team. Mourinho will definitely be looking forward to going back. He will thrive on the attention and will be happy to keep the pressure from his team.""","Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho inspires absolute loyalty in his players .

"ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- The murder trial of American student Amanda Knox in the death of her housemate two years ago resumed Monday in Italy after a summer break. The trial of American college student Amanda Knox, 22, resumes Monday, September 14. Knox, 22, and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito also face charges of sexual assault. They are accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher, Knox's housemate in Perugia, a scenic university town north of Rome. Kercher, 20, died in what prosecutors called a ""drug-fueled sex game."" She was found half-undressed in bed, with a stab wound to her neck on November 2, 2007. Knox and Sollecito were both present at Monday's court session, Kercher's attorney Francesco Maresca said. Sollecito's defense attorneys requested the annulment of DNA analysis, which investigators say shows Sollecito's genetic material on the clasp of the victim's bra. The judge rejected the request. The next hearing is scheduled on Friday, Maresca said. Knox, from Seattle, Washington, took the stand in June and testified that she was not at the girls' villa the night her roommate died, which authorities think was the evening of November 1. She said she was visiting her then-boyfriend, Sollecito, at his home, where the two watched a movie, smoked marijuana, had sex and went to bed. On her return to their villa the next morning, Knox said, she noticed ""strange things,"" such as the front door left open, dried blood in the bathroom sink and a locked door to Kercher's room. When Knox returned to Sollecito's house, he suggested they call police in case the house had been burgled, she said. Police found Kercher's body in the house. Prosecutors say evidence places the defendants at the scene. They also said the suspects gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died. Knox said she gave conflicting answers at the interrogation on November 6 because of police pressure and her confused state. ""When I would say that I was with Raffaele, they would say, 'You are a liar,' and they repeated this,"" she said in June, speaking about the police. ""'You will go to prison for 30 years. ... You must remember.'"" During the trial, she said police had slapped her on the head during questioning, a charge she had made before. The case has attracted worldwide media attention. During her testimony in June, cameras were barred from the courtroom because the prosecutor said he wanted to avoid sensationalism. A third person, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede, was convicted of murder in the case in October and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is appealing his conviction.","Knox accused of killing her flatmate, British student Meredith Kercher .

"New York (CNN) -- A 60-year-old woman on Sunday became the third person to die as a result of a helicopter crash last month in New York's East River, said a spokeswoman for the city's medical examiner's office. Harriet Nicholson was pronounced dead at approximately 3:22 a.m. Sunday at Bellevue Hospital, said Ellen Borakove from the office of the chief medical examiner. After an autopsy, officials determined that she died due to ""respiratory complications of near-drowning,"" according to Borakove. Nicholson was among those on board a Bell 206 Jet Ranger that plunged into the water on October 4, moments after pilot Paul Dudley had radioed that his aircraft was experiencing problems, National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind said last month. Authorities initially said that one woman -- Sonia Marra of Sydney, Australia, who died on her 40th birthday -- was the only fatality, with four others reported injured. Marra was trapped in the craft's back seat as it sank, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Helen Tamaki, 43, died the following week. A source close to the investigation identified Harriet and Paul Nicholson, one of now two survivors, as Marra's mother and stepfather. Tamaki was a family friend, according to the source. The pilot, Dudley, is the other survivor. A 15-member team from the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, which happened shortly after takeoff from a riverside helipad. U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who represents Manhattan's East Side in Congress, said in a previous statement that she was ""saddened and deeply concerned"" about the crash. ""There have been at least 28 helicopter crashes in our city over the last three decades,"" she said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A California fertility doctor implanted a dozen embryos in Nadya Suleman, resulting in ""an unsafe octuplet delivery"" last year, a lawyer for the state's medical board said Monday. Dr. Michael Kamrava, the fertility doctor who treated Suleman beginning in 1997, appeared before an administrative law judge Monday for a hearing that could lead to the loss of his medical license. Kamrava ""will say she demanded all 12 embryos and, because it was the weekend, he did not know what to do,"" said California Deputy Attorney General Judith Alvarado. ""But he knew it was unsafe."" Suleman -- known in the media as ""Octomom"" -- was 33 years old when she gave birth to eight babies in January 2009. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava. She still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children, according to a witness who testified Monday. His lawyer argued that Kamrava has been ""a respected, excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years,"" but that he ""ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients."" Dr. Victor Fujimoto, an expert witness called by the medical board on Monday, testified that Suleman apparently asked Kamrava to implant a dozen embryos in July 2008. ""As I understand, she requested it,"" Fujimoto said. When Alvarado asked him if it is not a doctor's responsibility to protect a patient from themselves, he answered ""Sometimes."" The Medical Board of California's complaint said the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. ""The whole series of contacts raise red flags with the stability of the patient herself and the overall intent of the patient,"" said Fujimoto. Kamrava was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine last year for what the fertility medical society called ""a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards."" The society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website. ""Because of what's happened, he does now adhere strictly to these guidelines,"" defense lawyer Henry Fenton told the judge Monday. Fujimoto testified that Kamrava's implantation of 12 embryos in July 2008 was ""gross negligence."" ""I cannot imagine any colleague of mine transferring that many,"" he said . Giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies, including ""complications with pregnancy, prematurity and long-term consequences of that."" Suleman's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. While there has been no indication any problems have emerged, ""we still don't know,"" Fujimoto said. Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, is accused of gross negligence and repeated negligent acts in the treatment of a patient named in the medical board complaint only by her initials, N.S. Suleman has identified Kamrava as her doctor in interviews. He is also accused of negligence in another case in which a patient developed a ""quadruplet pregnancy that was rocked with complications,"" according to the medical board.","NEW: Suleman has 29 embryos she could still use .

"(CNN) -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said Wednesday that Zimbabwe is in shambles and warned that deaths from starvation and a cholera outbreak threaten to surge with the rainy season approaching. A man carries a relative in a wheelbarrow to a cholera clinic in Harare on Tuesday. Bemoaning Zimbabwe's decline is a familiar refrain for the embattled head of the Movement for Democratic Change. His most recent remarks, however, were backed by former President Carter, who returned from a five-day trip to neighboring South Africa this week and declared Zimbabwe ""a basket case."" Tsvangirai also expressed frustration with attempts to form a unity government between his group and the ruling Zanu-PF party. He said he has asked that South African ex-President Thabo Mbeki recuse himself as mediator between the two parties. The Zimbabwean government quickly countered Tsvangirai's allegations that President Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF were responsible for the problems gripping the country. ""The government is very committed to ensure that the humanitarian crisis is addressed. It would be wrong for the MDC to blame it on the government,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said. Addressing Tsvangirai's allegations that cholera deaths could soon top 50 a day and that the Mugabe-led government seems intent on covering it up, Mumbengegwi noted that Zimbabwe is not the only country where cholera is a problem.  Watch why world leaders call the situation in Zimbabwe shocking » . ""No government would want its people to suffer. Cholera is not peculiar to Zimbabwe,"" he said. ""We hear it is now in South Africa, too, but we cannot relax because of that. We have to fight it as Zimbabweans."" A report in the state-run Herald newspaper Wednesday said the government has kicked off an information campaign to inform citizens of ""the do's and don'ts to combat the disease."" The government is also drilling boreholes to find clean, subterranean water that can be pumped to the surface for drinking and bathing, the Herald reported. The World Health Organization said last week that almost 300 people have died of cholera since August and more than 6,000 cases have been reported. Tsvangirai said Wednesday that conditions would worsen this month as the rainy season brings steamy downpours to much of Zimbabwe, especially the eastern mountain forests. Carter, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Graca Machel, wife of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela -- all of whom belong to a group of world leaders called the Elders -- had hoped to visit Zimbabwe on their recent trip to the region but were denied visas, according to Tsvangirai and a statement from the Carter Center. ""Mr. Mugabe would prefer that the suffering that he and Zanu-PF have caused, and continue to cause, remains in the dark,"" Tsvangirai said in a statement, adding that because the Movement for Democratic Change and Zanu-PF cannot form a partnership after months of wrangling, ""the MDC must instead work with those Zimbabwean organizations, groups and individuals to address the humanitarian crisis."" The humanitarian problems illustrate the political quagmire in Zimbabwe, where a power-sharing agreement that Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed in September has yet to take effect. Carter issued a statement Tuesday condemning what he said was Harare's decision to renege on an agreement to allow him, Annan and Machel into the country. He also offered a damning assessment of the Mugabe regime. ""After almost three decades of governmental corruption, mismanagement and oppression, Zimbabwe has become a basket case, an embarrassment to the region and a focus of international concern and condemnation,"" he said. Denied passage to Zimbabwe, Carter, Annan and Machel were left to consult with regional leaders -- including Tsvangirai, Botswana President Ian Khama and South Africa President Kgalema Motlanthe -- as well as United Nations officials, nongovernmental organizations and Zimbabwe's civil leaders. ""We had a complete and balanced agenda and more frank discussions than would have been possible in the oppressive and restrained environment of Harare,"" Carter said in his statement. Carter said he learned of conditions in which the official inflation rate has soared to about 231 million percent while thousands of Zimbabweans stand in line for their daily allowance of about 2 cents a day -- from their own bank accounts. The allowance does not afford them a half loaf of bread, he said. Teachers, who earn about a dollar a month, report a student-textbook ratio of about 20-to-1, and school attendance has dropped to about 20 percent in the past three months, the former president reported. The few students still attending classes are generally doing so in the hopes of being fed, he said. ""Meanwhile, top government officials and other privileged people can exchange Zim money at a favorable rate that is several thousand times more than the official rate available to other citizens,"" Carter said. ""They profit greatly from these monetary transactions and shop in special stores."" The nation's four major hospitals have shut down, as roughly 3,500 AIDS victims are dying each week. Unchecked sewage and filthy water have compounded the cholera problem, and Zimbabwe's death rate from the disease is 10 times greater than rates in areas where treatment is available, Carter said. The former president said 19,000 Zimbabweans are fleeing the country each month, mostly to South Africa and Botswana. He estimated that 4 million people have fled the nation. ""The middle class is departing, leaving behind the extremely poor and the small elite group around Mugabe who are profiting from the economic disaster,"" he said. Comparing Zimbabwe to Somalia, a failed African state that has had no functional government since 1991, Carter cast blame on African leaders who fail ""to confront Robert Mugabe and force him to accept the result of the March election and more recently to comply with negotiated political agreements to share governmental authority with Morgan Tsvangirai and the opposition party."" Tsvangirai snared more votes than Mugabe in March's election but not a majority. Tsvangirai dropped out of a subsequent runoff, citing widespread violence against MDC supporters. Carter's call for African leaders to step up pressure on Mugabe came a day before Tsvangirai asked South Africa's Mbeki to bow out as mediator between the MDC and Zanu-PF. ""Sadly, the negotiations have also been hampered by the attitude and position of the facilitator, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. He does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in Zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small,"" Tsvangirai said in his statement. ""He is not serving to bring the parties together because he does not understand what needs to be done. In addition, his partisan support of Zanu-PF, to the detriment of genuine dialogue, has made it impossible for the MDC to continue negotiating under his facilitation."" Asked for the Zimbabwe government's reaction to the MDC asking Mbeki to recuse himself, Foreign Minister Mumbengegwi said, ""We have no right to tell them who to complain about. It is their decision in the MDC."" Unless African leaders can find a way to mitigate the political impasse in Zimbabwe, the United Nations or the African Union might need to enter the fray, because, Carter said, ""the poisonous effects"" of the Mugabe regime, including the cholera outbreak, are spilling into other African nations. Food, medicine and monetary donations should be sent immediately to humanitarian agencies such as CARE, World Vision and Save the Children, Carter said, advising that it is unwise to send cash directly to people in Zimbabwe. ""It is counterproductive to contribute money that can be confiscated by the Zimbabwe government,"" he said.","Opposition's Morgan Tsvangirai asks Thabo Mbeki to recuse himself as mediator .

"(CNN) -- For centuries, it has enchanted visitors with its fortified walls, pointed arches, towers, ornamental flourishes, carvings, and spectacular gardens. The Alhambra, a fortress and palace in the Spanish city of Granada was begun in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid Emirs of Granada, the last Muslim rulers in Spain. Further palaces and Christian chapels were added to the complex in the centuries since, making it a fascinating mix of cultures and histories. Full of mysterious nooks and crannies as well as grand spaces, the Alhambra attracts around two million visitors a year, according to the Patronato de la Alhambra in Spain, the organization that looks after the complex. Now a sustainable tourism effort from the Patronato de la Alhambra, the World Monuments Fund and others is taking the Alhambra into the 21st century, using technology to bring previously hidden areas of the complex to light. Entitled ""The Hidden Alhambra,"" the project aims to expand the site for tourists, with an app. It will allow visitors to virtually explore delicate, closed-off areas on their iPhones, or on specially designed portable electronic tablets, as well as opening up new routes to related areas outside the complex. ""It is a site that gets many visitors, we can say that it's a major tourist destination,"" said Maria del Mar Villafranca, director of the Patronato de la Alhambra. ""For many years now, we have worked with a model that limits access to a certain number of visitors per day,"" she explained, saying ""Hidden Alhambra,"" is designed to further take the pressure off ""fragile zones."" Hidden areas that the application will bring to light include an underground space beneath the palace of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as well as storage areas, towers and pavilions, according to Norma Barbacci, Program Director for Latin America, Spain, and Portugal at the World Monuments Fund. ""(Visitors will) be able to see images and video (on their iPhones) and get all kinds of information about these specific sites that are not open,"" she said. ""They are not able to walk down the stairs into the silos for example, but they can be close to them and get a lot of information,"" she continued. The app is currently being developed and augmented reality features have not been ruled out, said Barbacci. The first phase of information-gathering for the application, namely photographing the various sites, is being undertaken, according to Villafranca. They are aiming to have the app ready for the public by summer 2012. Virtual visitor experiences are an increasingly popular way of making delicate historic monuments accessible, said Barbacci. ""Once the technology began to improve, then we started looking at this as a way of promoting knowledge and caring for a building without trampling all over it,"" she said. But it's not all virtual work: The World Monuments Fund is also contributing $300,000 to the conservation of the Oratorio del Partal, an elaborate mid-14th century chapel built during the reign of Yusuf I. The conservation effort will include work on the roof, carved wood ceiling and decorative plaster work and will be incorporated into the ""Hidden Alhambra"" application. ""It's a very important part of the Alhambra, for its symbolic value being a part of the oldest area of the complex,"" explained Villafranca. It is part of a long-term plan of conservation works to other fragile areas of the complex that, she hopes, will make more and more of it accessible to visitors -- and continue to pique their interest in it.","App will make closed-off areas of Moorish palace accessible to tourists .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago woman said Monday that Herman Cain sexually groped her in 1997 when Cain was head of the National Restaurant Association. Sharon Bialek made the claims during a press conference with famed defense attorney Gloria Allred. Bialek is the fourth accuser to come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior by Cain. Three other women have alleged Cain harassed them when they worked for the National Restaurant Association while he headed the group in the 1990s. Allred said that the woman at the news conference isn't one of those three. Cain has vehemently denied committing sexual harassment. Allred says the alleged harassment took place when her client sought Cain's help with an employment issue while she was working at the association. Cain's campaign on Monday denied new accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior against the Republican presidential hopeful. ""All allegations of harassment against Mr. Cain are completely false,"" said a statement from Cain's campaign after Bialek's accusation. ""Mr. Cain has never harassed anyone."" Politico first published a report last week claiming that two female employees at the restaurant association accused Cain of inappropriate behavior during his tenure there. The women, according to Politico, each received separation packages in the five-figure range. The package for one of the women totaled between $32,000 to $37,000 -- about equivalent to her annual salary at the time, according to a former National Restaurant Association employee who knows one of the accusers.","The woman is identified as Sharon Bialek .

"(CNN) -- A German organization involved in establishing and maintaining the Indonesian tsunami warning system denies widespread reports that the system failed to detect the tsunami that devastated parts of the Mentawai Islands on Monday. In particular the organization refuted news articles claiming the warning system had been vandalized and was not functioning. ""Contrary to reports stating otherwise, all components of the tsunami early warning system worked properly,"" the German Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System said in a statement. ""Reports of broken or even deliberately destroyed system units are entirely unfounded,"" it added. The statement continued:  ""The detection of the causative earthquake by the seismic network was almost in real time, the corresponding operational image showed relevant warning levels in particular for the western coastline of the Mentawai Islands. The measurement of the tsunami at gauging stations on the islands and along the coast of Sumatra was accurate."" Meanwhile, the Indonesian state news agency ANTARA, quoting officials in the affected area, reported the latest toll was at least 370 dead, with 334 people still missing and some 486 houses destroyed. The tsunami followed a 7.7-magnitude earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra.","The tsunami followed a 7.7-magnitude earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra .

"TAIPEI, Taiwan (CNN) -- More than 90 percent of eligible Taiwan residents took up the government's offer of 3600 New Taiwan Dollars (USD $108) to go shopping, government officials said Monday. People line up to receive $108 U.S. dollars worth of shopping vouchers in Taipei, Taiwan, on Sunday. Any of the island's 23 million men, women or children qualify for the money, a combination of a lunar New Year gift and economic stimulus package designed to pump about 86 billion ($2.6 billion U.S.) into the economy. By Sunday night, 91.3 percent of eligible citizens had picked up their vouchers, and malls were flooded with shoppers, Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said. The vouchers are good through September. But one major retailer, the Carrefour chain, said its Sunday receipts were up about 30 percent from normal -- and with Chinese New Year just around the corner, many appeared ready to use the money for holiday groceries. Even President Ma Ying-jeou picked up vouchers for all four members of his family, encouraging people to spread the use of the vouchers over days, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported.

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida amusement park visitors may enjoy space-themed roller-coasters, but the first vehicle they board at Orlando International Airport may be the most futuristic ride of their vacation. Four hydrogen shuttle buses are part of the fleet at the Orlando International Airport. The airport is testing four Ford shuttle vans equipped with internal combustion engines modified to run on hydrogen instead of gasoline. ""It's quiet, it doesn't shake like diesel, it doesn't have that diesel smell,"" said Rafael Sanchez, who has been driving the vans for a year. The quieter engine makes conversation inside the bus easier than in conventional vehicles. ""Hydrogen is one of the many technologies we are exploring, trying to become more of a green airport,"" said Ronald Lewis, director of airport operations. Vehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines. The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells. The modified engines aboard the Ford E-450 shuttle buses are 6.8 liter V-10s. The airport's fleet also includes three gas-electric hybrid vehicles and 24 biodiesel buses. The facility also powers its maintenance equipment -- such as lawnmowers and tractors -- with biodiesel. But like many experiments with alternative fuels, the price is very high and the long-term outcome is unknown. Proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken-and-egg dilemma over whether to build million-dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use. Energy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around, but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up. ""It is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20, 30, maybe 40 years,"" said John Lapetz, who has been working on alternative fuels at Ford for more than 20 years. The Orlando project has several goals: To get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop. Lapetz said it's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted (the internal combustion engine), while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels. At the Boggy Creek Hydrogen Fueling Station in Orlando, the hydrogen is produced on-site. ""We are doing a process called steam methane re-forming, which is natural gas to hydrogen,"" said Puneet Verma, manager of biofuels and hydrogen at Chevron Technology Ventures, one of the players involved in the project. During a careful fueling process, technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump. Because a fossil fuel, methane, is used to make the hydrogen, the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured. ""We view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success,"" said Verma. ""This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station. It's not necessarily an economic success yet."" ""The ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars,"" Verma said. ""The hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture, but they consume a lot more hydrogen."" Verma said the buses are ""valid transition technology"" aimed at quickly building significant demand for hydrogen, which would then justify an expensive infrastructure. The hydrogen test project also includes the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, Ford Motor Company, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Progress Energy and SeaWorld. Hydrogen buses began shuttling SeaWorld employees in February from the park's outer parking lots to their workplaces. ""The environment is really an important part of SeaWorld's culture here,"" said Kelly Bernish, director of environmental health and safety at Busch theme parks SeaWorld, Discovery Cove and Aquatica. Bernish described the venture as another opportunity for ""employees to feel like they can impact the environment by using this kind of vehicle, that will lessen our footprint on the world."" SeaWorld's Discovery Cove animal training supervisor Jay Tacey said ""somebody has to get the ball rolling. Until somebody takes that first step, there's always going to be the 'what if?' "" Airport Operations Director Lewis said being in on the hydrogen experiment early could pay off in the long run. ""We are hopeful that since they built the facility here, the only one in the southeast United States, that there will be a long-term usage for it.""","Orlando airport tests cleaner hydrogen-powered internal combustion engines .

"(CNN) -- Launched in 1995, the Airbus A330-200 is the newest member of the European aircraft manufacturer's twinjet family. The incident involves an Air France Airbus A330-200. With a range of 12,500 km (6,750 nautical miles) and the capacity to carry 253 passengers, the A330-200 is extremely well-regarded as a medium to long-range airliner. There are 600 currently in service with 82 airlines, including Air France, worldwide. Airbus has a further 300 orders for the aircraft. According to aviation expert Kieran Daly, the A330-200 is a ""reliable, ultra-modern, state-of-the-art airplane,"" with an impeccable safety record. He told CNN that there has only been one reported incident when an aircraft of this type has crashed. ""The incident took place in 1994 before the aircraft came into service,"" he said. ""It was being flown in test-mode by pilots who were putting it through some extreme maneuvers before it came down. ""Therefore the crash was not caused by the plane itself. ""It is very well-designed and well-equipped, with equally modern and reliable General Electric CF-6 engines."" Air France has said that Flight AF 447 sent an automatic signal indicating electrical problems while going through strong turbulence early in its 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.  Why it took so long to report the aircraft missing » . However, Daly said that it would take extremely violent weather conditions to cause the catastrophic failure of an aircraft of this size. ""These planes are extremely robust and widely used on transatlantic routes and across Asia,"" he said. ""They are equipped with an array of sophisticated communication equipment, so it must have been something extremely sudden to cause the loss of contact."" There has also been speculation that the Paris-bound flight was struck by lightning, but that should not bring down a modern airliner, former Airbus pilot John Wiley told CNN. According to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340). The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009. The larger A330-300 aircraft from Airbus entered service in 1993 and has a capacity of up to 335 passengers. It too has an impressive safety record, despite a couple of incidents in the last 10 years. In August 2001, a Canadian airliner operated by Air Transat experienced double engine failure while traveling to Portugal. Miraculously the captain was able to perform an emergency landing in the Azores by gliding the powerless plane for almost 18 minutes. Last year, an A330-303 was forced to make an emergency landing in Australia after a sudden change in altitude injured 74 passengers. Qantas Flight 72 was flying from Singapore to the western Australian city of Perth when a sudden change of altitude caused abrasions, contusions, fractures and other injuries. The cause of the sudden drop remains under investigation.","The Airbus A330-200 was launched in 1995 .

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN)  -- A roadside bombing in Somalia's capital killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern Mogadishu street on Sunday morning, a hospital official said. Mogadishu residents gather around victims of the bomb attack along the city's Maka Al Mukarama Road. The bomb blast wounded another 46 people, most of them Somali women who had gathered to clean Maka Al Mukarama Road in southern Mogadishu's Kilometer 4 district, according to Medina Hospital director Dr. Dahir Dhere. ""It suddenly turned the area into a carnage, scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area,"" said witness Asha Ise Gedi. ""There were pools of blood everywhere. I have never seen such mass killing."" ""They were innocent poor mothers or sisters,"" Gedi said. ""Why did they deserve this?"" It is unclear who is behind the attack. Mogadishu Mayor Mohamed Omar Habeb Mohamed Dhere, who was recently fired by the country's prime minister, blamed the Islamic Courts Union for waging the attack. But the head of the Islamist insurgent group, Abid Rahim Ise Adow, denied any involvement and blamed Somalia's government for orchestrating the attack. The victims were participating in a program that allows Somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food. The United Nations' World Food Program organized the program, which began last year and is administered by Mogadishu's regional authority. Mogadishu has been the site of violence in recent months between Ethiopian troops and Islamist fighters. Somalia's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital, with the help of the better-equipped Ethiopian forces. On Saturday, two-thirds of the Somali government ministers announced their resignations, blaming Prime Minister Nur Hassan Nur Ade's ""dictatorship,"" which they said included his firing of Mogadishu's mayor. Nur Ade said he suspects the mass resignations were aimed at weakening implementation of the peace agreement between Somalia's transitional government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. He said he had no plans to resign. The peace agreement, signed June 9 in Djibouti, calls for a cease-fire between Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia, an opposition group that includes members of the Islamist Court Union which overthrew the government in 2006. The ICU was ousted from power later that year by Ethiopian forces, with the support of Somalia's transitional government. If followed, the peace deal would pave the way for a withdrawal of Ethiopian troops -- a major sticking point for Islamist fighters who oppose their presence. The agreement calls on the alliance to dissociate itself from armed groups still fighting the government and for all sides to allow ""unhindered humanitarian access and assistance"" to all Somalis. A joint committee led by U.N. officials will monitor the agreement's implementation. Ethiopian forces became embroiled in an Islamist insurgency after the Ethiopian forces invaded Somalia in December 2006 to overthrow the ICU leaders and reinstall the transitional government. As guerrilla attacks mounted, efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union-led peacekeeping mission faltered. Ethiopia's invasion had the blessing of Somalia's government and the United States, which accused the ICU of harboring fugitives from the al Qaeda terrorist movement. The conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country's last government in 1991. The situation has been exacerbated by drought, continual armed conflicts in central and southern Somalia, and high inflation on food and fuel prices. CNN's Alan Duke and journalists Mohamed Amin Adow and Abdi Nasir Mohamed contributed to this report.","NEW: Mayor blames Islamist fighters for blast; Islamist fighters blame government .

"(CNN) -- CNN.com's Football Fan Zone looks ahead to the new season in Germany which kicks off on Friday August 15. Bayern Munich's Oliver Kahn lifts the Bundesliga trophy. The veteran keeper has retired aged 39 after many seasons of success. The Champions . Bayern Munich bounced back in superb style last season after some inspired signings in last summer's transfer window. Veteran former coach Ottmar Hitzfeld had been inticed back for one final hurrah after Bayern had suffered the ignominy of failing to reach the Champions League by finishing only fourth behind Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. And Hitzfeld worked the oracle in spectacular style, bringing in French wizard Franck Ribery and Italian striker Luca Toni to compliment his already talented squad. Bayern cruised to the Bundesliga title by 10 points, did the double with victory in the German Cup final, and only succumbed to eventual winners Zenit St Petersburg in the semifinals of the UEFA Cup. With Hitzfeld now gone, former Bayern hero Jurgen Klinsmann has taken up the reigns for his first managerial job in club football. The 44-year-old was a success in leading Germany to the semifinals of the World Cup but it remains to be seen how he copes with the pressure of coaching Germany's top club. Klinsmann has kept his powder dry in the transfer market, with Germany midfielder Tim Borowski the only significant addition, but his squad is so overladen with talent it is difficult to see how it can be improved. Yet again it appears that Bayern will be the team to beat. The only major change to the side has seen Oliver Kahn's long-time backup Michael Rensing take over the No.1 jersey after the retirement of the veteran international keeper. The Challengers . Werder Bremen pipped Schalke for second place last season, thanks in part to a potent attack which saw them score 75 goals, seven more than champions Bayern and 17 more than third highest Wolfsburg. Werder's strength is their continuity. Long-serving coach Thomas Schaff is Werder through and through -- and has remarkably been at the club since joining as a schoolboy player in 1972. He has been coach for nine years and continues to work wonders, keeping the club near the top of the Bundersliga year after year -- as well as masterminding their title victory in 2004. However, this season, Werder must do without Croatian striker Ivan Klasnic, who has left for Nantes in France after a legal dispute regarding his kidney condition, and goalscoring midfielder Tim Borowski, who was snapped up by Bayern Munich. Brazilian playmaker Diego continues to be the fulcrum of the side, while young striker Aaron Hunt was a regular last season and is tipped to progress further. Defensive stability is provided by internationals Per Mertesacker and midfield warhorse Torsten Frings. Schalke continue to be there or thereabouts in Germany and have finished in the top three in three of the last four seasons. However, they have taken over from Leverkusen as the nearly men of German football, finishing Bundesliga runners-up in 2005 and 2007, German Cup runners-up in 2005 and German League Cup runners-up in 2007. The last of their seven league titles came exactly 50 years ago and new Dutch coach Fred Rutten is the man responsible for trying to break that long title drought. So far, his dealings in the transfer market have been encouraging and Rutten has used his knowledge of Dutch football to enhance the Gelsenkirchen club's squad. Giant midfielder Orlando Engelaar impressed for the Dutch in Euro 2008 and Schalke moved quickly to sign him from FC Twente, while Peruvian striker Jefferson Farfan averaged a goal every other game in his four seasons with PSV Eindhoven and will add more potency to an attack that already boasts German internationals Kevin Kuranyi and the long-serving Gerald Asamoah. Point to prove . Jurgen Klinsmann rode the crest of a wave of national pride in 2006 when he led a young and talented Germany squad to the last four of the home World Cup, falling to eventual champions Italy in an epic semifinal encounter. That was Klinsmann's first and so far only coaching job and he has kept himself out of the limelight since handing over the national team's reigns to Joachim Loew. A showman on the pitch, Klinsmann is deep thinking and private off it and resisted very public overtures from both Liverpool and the U.S. national team while taking a break from the game. London clubs Chelsea and Tottenham were also rumored to have been keen on recruiting Klinsmann, but eventually the lure of coaching the biggest club side in German football proved too great. With success in the Bundesliga expected, Klinsmann's remit will be to bring Champions League glory back to Bavaria for the first time since 2001; anything less might see the former Bayern hero under immediate pressure to keep his job. New boys . Two of German football's most famous names are back in the Bundesliga as Moenchengladbach and Cologne make welcome returns to the top flight alongside fellow-new boys Hoffenheim. Five-times champions 'Gladbach were exiled for just one season, winning the second division by six points just one season after their relegation. One of the biggest clubs in Germany, 'Gladbach command impressive support and Dutch coach Jos Luhukay will be expected to keep them up this season. Veteran striker and captain Oliver Neuville continues to be their star attraction and his impressive displays last season ensured he kept his place in the German national squad for Euro 2008, despite playing outside the Bundesliga. Cologne are back in the top flight after a two-season absence and despite becoming a yo-yo club over the last 10 years, hopes are high that they can remain in the Bundesliga under experienced, but controversial, coach Christophe Daum -- who is in his second spell in charge. Experienced defenders Pierre Wome (ex-Werder Bremen) and Miso Brecko (ex-Hamburg) have been drafted in but goals could be a problem following the loss of influential German striker and former club captain Patrick Helmes to Leverkusen. Ambitious Hoffenheim have made rapid progress through the German football pyramid in recent seasons and have reached the Bundesliga for the first time in their history after just one season in the second division. They will begin the season at Carl-Benz Stadium in Mannheim before their own 30,000 Rhein-Neckar-Arena is completed early next year. In Ralf Rangnick they certainly have a coach with a wealth of experience. The 50-year-old has coached Stuttgart and Schalke in the top flight and despite his squad's lack of experience at this level, they will be organized and disciplined under Rangnick. Hello . No team has been busier in the transfer market than ambitious Wolfsburg and Felix Magath's side are aiming to build on their superb fifth-place last season. The most eye-catching of their new signings has been Italian defender Cristian Zaccardo. The 26-year-old cost Wolfsburg $12.4 million from Palermo and becomes the second current Italian international, after Luca Toni, to ply his trade in the Bundesliga. Zaccardo played a key role in Italy's Euro 2008 squad and his signing is a real statement of intent as Wolfsburg aim for a Champions League place this season. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann returns to the Bundesliga from Arsenal to join Stuttgart after the London side chose not to renew his contract. Eccentric and unpredictable, the 38-year-old continues to have the support of national coach Joachim Loew and he played in all six games as Germany reached the final of Euro 2008, losing to Spain. Goodbye . As one veteran goalkeeper returns to the Bundesliga, another says goodbye with Bayern Munich and national team legend Oliver Kahn choosing to hang up his gloves. Over the last four years, Lehmann and Kahn were involved in a public and often bitter battle for the No.1 position in the national team, with then coach Jurgen Klinsmann so undecided about who to select, that he would alternate between the pair from match to match. Now, aged 39, Kahn has decided to call it a day, after nearly 450 first team matches for Bayern Munich in 14 years -- as well as 86 matches for his country. Eight Bundesliga titles, six German Cups, six German League Cups, a Champions League winners medal, a UEFA Cup winners medal, a European Championship winners medal and a World Cup runners-up medal show how glittering Kahn's career was and it will be a long time before another player matches his medal haul for both club and country.","Jurgen Klinnsmann returns to football to manage champions Bayern Munich .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease. Two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border in December. Statistics released by the Geneva, Switzerland-based organization WHO on Tuesday show 1,937 people have died in the raging epidemic from the 38,334 who contracted the disease since its outbreak in August. Cholera has spread to neighboring countries South Africa and Botswana. The epidemic comes at a time when President Robert Mugabe's government is facing its worst economic crisis, manifested in shortages of all essentials from food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity and a hyperinflationary economy. Health experts have said Harare's failure to import adequate stocks of water-treating chemicals is the main driver of the disease. Most residents have resorted to rivers and shallow wells for drinking water, because taps are usually dry. On top of that problem, the waste-disposing system has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency. Since then, international governments and organizations such as WHO, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, USAID and other U.N. groups have moved in to combat the disease that has engulfed all of Zimbabwe's provinces. But the situation has not immediately improved. Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops. Harare issued a warning Monday that some parts of the country are going to experience floods during rainy season, further compounding the fight against the disease. The season peaks in January or February and ends in late March. Mugabe and rival Morgan Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal in September to run the government after a hotly contested presidential election. It was widely hoped that the deal would be the panacea to the humanitarian and economic problems bewildering the once-prosperous Zimbabwe, but the pact is yet to take effect. The sides continue to debate the sharing of key Cabinet ministries such as information, local government, finance, defense and home affairs.","World Health Organization says 1,937 people have died since outbreak in August .

"(CNN) -- Friends and family of Jean and Scott Adam -- avid sailors killed by pirates while on a round-the-world boating adventure -- mourned their losses Wednesday and tried to make sense of the tragedy. The Adams, along with fellow sailors Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, were found shot to death after U.S. forces boarded their hijacked vessel around 1 a.m. Tuesday, U.S. officials said. The 58-foot yacht, named the Quest, was being shadowed by the military after pirates took the ship off the coast of Oman on Friday. The forces responded after a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a U.S. Navy ship about 600 yards away -- and missed -- and the sound of gunfire could be heard on board the Quest, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mark Fox told reporters. ""Despite immediate steps to provide life-saving care, all four hostages ultimately died of their wounds,"" U.S. Central Command said. ""We're trying to deal with the grief of the loss,"" Clayton Schmit, a friend of the Adams, told CNN. ""We've been praying earnestly over the weekend, and (since) we had the news that thing went bad, we've all been deeply in mourning."" Schmit, a Lutheran minister, is a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary in California, where Scott Adam taught as a graduate student. The Adams were from Marina del Rey, California. Macay and Riggle were from Seattle. The killings took place as negotiations involving the FBI were under way for the hostages' release, Fox said. Two pirates had boarded a U.S. Navy ship Monday for the negotiations, he said. He told reporters he had no information on details of the negotiations or whether a ransom had been offered. Two pirates were found dead on board the Quest, he said. In the process of clearing the vessel, U.S. forces killed two others, one with a knife, Fox said. Thirteen others were captured and detained along with the other two already on board the U.S. Navy ship. Nineteen pirates were involved altogether, he said. Fox said authorities believe the pirates were trying to get the vessel and hostages to Somalia, or at least into Somali territorial waters. He added that it was the deadliest pirate hijacking involving U.S. citizens that he could recall. There have been fewer than 10 fatalities associated with pirate activity in the region in the past few years, he said. The 15 detained pirates were being held together on a U.S. warship, Fox said, and ""we will go through the appropriate process to bring them to a judicial process and hold them accountable for their activities."" Piracy has flourished recently off the coast of Somalia, which has not had an effective government for two decades. While piracy in the Indian Ocean has taken place for years close to the Somali coast, ""in 2008 we saw a very marked and rapid shift into the Gulf of Aden, where Somali pirates were attacking and hijacking vessels very, very regularly,"" said Cyrus Mody, manager at the International Maritime Bureau in London. International navies combating piracy have been fairly successful in setting up a patrolled transit corridor through the Gulf of Aden, Mody and Fox said. But the pirates' activities then shifted into the southern Red Sea, Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea area, Mody said. Over 50 pirate attacks have already taken place in 2011. As of February 15, pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages. Schmit told CNN that the Adams were aware of the growing danger of piracy in the Indian Ocean, particularly near the Horn of Africa, where the Quest was located at the time of the attack. While sailing around the world, the Adams were delivering Bibles to hospitals and schools in dangerous locations, Schmit said. ""It was their mission in life and nothing was going to deter Scott."" ""There are many places in the world where Christian missionaries are facing the possibility of capture and torture and death,"" Schmit added. ""Most of the people who embark on those kinds of missions are well aware of (the dangers). They're surrounded by prayer and uplifted by their friends and family. ... If they feel called, they typically go."" Schmit said the Adams didn't feel comfortable arming themselves while in dangerous waters. Scott Adams had noted, among other things, that ""if you take a firearm on board and you stop at certain ports, your boat can be confiscated along with your cargo, so he didn't want to risk that."" The Adams, Macay and Riggle had been traveling with yachts participating in the Blue Water Rally since their departure from Phuket, Thailand, rally organizers said Sunday on the event's website. The group, which organizes long-distance group cruises, said the Quest broke off on February 15 after leaving Mumbai, India, to take a different route. ""We're all speculating"" as to why the Quest broke away from the other boats, Schmit said. ""Somehow they slipped through the hole in the safety net."" CNN's Mike Pearson, Ashley Hayes, Carol Cratty, David McKenzie, Alan Silverleib, and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .","Four Americans on the yacht were fatally shot, officials say .
Fifteen pirates are in custody; another four are dead .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Amid deepening public concerns over the country's food safety following a wave of recent scandals, China's highest court has ordered judges nationwide to hand down harsher sentences, including the death penalty, to people convicted of violating food safety regulations. In a directive released by the state-run Xinhua news agency over the weekend, the Supreme People's Court said in cases where people die from food safety violations, convicted suspects should be given the death sentence, while criminals involved in non-lethal cases should face longer prison terms and larger fines. It also called for harsher punishment for government officials found protecting food safety violators or accepting bribes from them. ""The overall food safety situation is stable and improving, but incidents that still occur regularly have seriously endangered people's lives and caused strong social reactions,"" the directive quoted Wang Shengjun, the country's top judge, as saying. ""Our task to maintain food safety remains challenging."" From milk laced with melamine, pigs fed with performance-enhancing drugs to watermelons juiced up with growth-stimulating chemicals, a series of recent scandals have outraged Chinese consumers, despite ramped-up government crackdown and state media campaign against food safety violations. From last September to April this year, Chinese courts have tried and convicted 106 people accused of violating food safety, including two who received life imprisonment last month in a ""melamine milk"" case, Xinhua reported. ""It's clear that the credibility of the system will suffer,"" said Peter K. Ben Embarek, the World Health Organization's food safety official. ""The (Chinese) consumer will continue to lose confidence in Chinese products and consumers abroad will equally lose confidence in Chinese products."" The latest announcement by China's supreme court, however, seems to run counter to another recent initiative to limit the use of the death penalty by the same court. In its annual work report, the Supreme People's Court last week instructed lower courts to suspend death sentences for two years if an immediate execution is not deemed necessary. The Chinese legislature had earlier amended the country's penal code to reduce the number of crimes punishable by death by 13 to 55. China executes more people than all other countries combined, according to Amnesty International. It estimated the figure, considered a state secret, to be in the thousands last year for ""a wide range of crimes that include non-violent offences."" The number of executions elsewhere in the world in 2010 was at least 527, according to the London-based group's annual report released earlier this year. CNN's Eunice Yoon contributed to this report.","The directive also calls for harsher punishment for officials who protect violators .

"Concepcion, Chile (CNN)  -- We couldn't have traveled farther to see the same thing. We were returning to the United States from Haiti -- where every turn continues to unveil another human tragedy even six weeks after the January 12 earthquake -- when we were redirected to Chile. An 8.8-magnitude quake had struck the area around Chile's capital, a seismic event 800 times more powerful than the one in Haiti. Getting there was half the story. We took off from Miami, Florida, knowing the airport in Santiago was closed, so our aim was to get as close as we could. That set off a journey that would last 48 hours. We flew to Panama, Lima, Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires and Bariloche, then began a very long drive through the Patagonia region of Argentina, into Chile and north into the earthquake zone. We were followed by an enormous full moon and skimpy clouds that danced along the skyline. This region seems too lovely to be the scene of any tragedy. Its tall green mountains peaked with whitecaps and broad lakes give way to fields and sparkly beaches. South America had summer vacation until it was interrupted by this disaster. And it is, in a word, a disaster. Haiti, with its death toll and great suffering, sets the bar very high right now for what you can call a tragedy. But there is nothing inconsequential about hundreds of people dying, crushed in their own homes or swept away by a frantic sea. Chile has had very powerful earthquakes before and is a modern and wealthy place compared with Haiti. But as we drove up through Ozoro, Las Violetas, Los Angeles and other lovely farming towns, we saw chunks of roadway and roofs fallen away, fractured bridges, people camped in tents among their cows. Every Chilean we spoke to talked about how the previous earthquakes had pushed anyone with means to rebuild their homes or find new ones designed to withstand strong shaking. People here know what to do. But the sight of military convoys and ambulances told the story of what 8.8 can do. An ambulance driver in Los Angeles said there had been dozens of aftershocks, many powerful enough to add to the rising toll of injured and dead in towns without many large structures. They were overwhelmed and being dispatched to Concepcion, where a large population and tall structures meant more severe injuries. There, we found looting and people walking the streets in search of water and gas. The largest buildings were missing entire walls, and glass had shorn off the sides. A light cold drizzle was getting everyone wet. The vacation period means a lot of young people are out being mochileros (backpackers) and are separated from families by distance and downed phone lines. They have heard the stories of beach towns swept away and houses upended and are hitching rides at gas stations, hoping to find a way to reunite. The aftershocks are like a rising tide here, a clear sign that this is not over, that the damage is not done. The farm stands and cottages of the back roads are crooked and empty; the city centers look abandoned and on the brink. This country is not crying out for international assistance in the way Haiti did. It was prepared and has coping resources. This is a place that sends rescue workers to other countries because they're so good at it. Yet its natural beauty and efficiency are not enough to diminish what connects these folks to Haiti -- that the people waiting for buses beside the blackberry fields along Panamericana Ruta 5 are running scared.","The quake that shook Chile was 800 times more powerful than the one that hit Haiti .

"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court at the Hague issued an arrest warrant Wednesday for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur. Al-Bashir waves to supporters in the sudanese capital,  Khartoum on Wednesday. It is the first arrest warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal. Bashir is charged with seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The warrant does not mention genocide, but the court may issue an amended warrant to include that charge later, ICC spokeswoman Laurence Blairon said. But Sudan's minister of information and communications said the country does not plan to cooperate with the ""white man's tribunal."" Kamal Obaid said: ""Sudan perceives those decisions as an insult directed at (Sudan's) nationalism and sovereignty ... The government relies on the strong will of the people and on a national consensus not seen before and (stands) by decisions taken by its council of ministers and parliament and restates what it always confirmed."" Speaking on Sudanese TV, he added: ""The Security Council and international community must bear full responsibility toward any escalation produced by those clumsy decisions.""  Watch a pro-Bashir rally in Sudan » . Five of the counts against Bashir are for crimes against humanity and include murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, and rape, Blairon said. The other two are for war crimes, for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. ""Bashir's official capacity as head of state does not exclude criminal responsibility or get him immunity,"" Blairon said in announcing the warrant. The ICC's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, filed genocide charges against al-Bashir in July last year, accusing him of masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the war-torn region with a campaign of murder, rape and deportation.  Watch more on the verdict » . The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.  A man describes how he was told to rape children » . The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. Moreno-Ocampo told CNN's Nic Robertson last year that he had ""strong evidence that al-Bashir is committing a genocide."" But Blairon said the evidence submitted to judges so far doesn't support that charge.  Watch Christiane Amanpour's reaction to the verdict » . ""In order to speak about a genocide, you need to have a clear intent that a person wishes to destroy, in part or as a whole, a targeted group, a specific group,"" Blairon said. ""In this specific case, the (judges of the) Pre-Trial Chamber 1 has not been able to find that there were reasonable grounds to establish the genocidal intent."" Prosecutors may still return to the chamber if new evidence of genocide emerges, and the court may then decide to issue an amended warrant, she said. Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday he would have to review the court's decision not to include genocide in the arrest warrant, but he pointed out it is possible to appeal. Al-Bashir bears responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur, Moreno-Ocampo said last year, because he sat at the apex of the government. ""For such crimes to be committed over a period of five years and throughout Darfur, al-Bashir had to mobilize and keep mobilized the whole state apparatus; he had to control and direct perpetrators; and he had to rely on a genocidal plan,"" Moreno-Ocampo wrote as background for arrest warrant request. The Sudanese government has long rejected the authority of the ICC, saying Sudan is not a signatory to the court's creation so there is no legal obligation to turn al-Bashir over to the court.  Sudan: 'Process is unlawful' » . U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid issued a statement on the arrest warrant, saying ""the United States is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in Sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes."" The statement urged all groups ""to exercise restraint in responding to this development and to ensure the safety and security of vulnerable Sudanese populations, international civilians, and peacekeepers on the ground."" Germany and the UK both urged Sudan to cooperate with the ICC. ""We deeply regret that the government has not taken these allegations seriously or engaged with the court, and we repeat today our call for its cooperation,"" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said. The ICC said the obligation to surrender al-Bashir falls on all countries that are also members of the U.N. Security Council and to ""any other state as may be necessary."" And the judges have ruled that additional arrest warrants may be issued for Al-Bashir and served on any state as required, said court registrar Silvana Arbia. Al-Bashir is scheduled to attend an Arab summit in Doha, Qatar, later this month. Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday that al-Bashir stands the chance of being arrested should he travel. ""The judges were clear: There is no immunity for head of states before the ICC,"" the prosecutor said. ""As soon as Omar al-Bashir travels through international air space, he can be arrested."" ""Omar al-Bashir's destiny is to face justice,"" he added. ""It will be two months or in two years, but he will face justice."" About 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. ""His victims are the very civilians that he, as a president, was supposed to protect,"" Moreno-Ocampo said. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: Sudan says it will not cooperate with International Criminal Court .

"(CNN) -- Two additional suspects have surfaced in the fatal shooting of an American man on a lake that straddles the United States and Mexico last September, Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez told CNN. David Hartley was allegedly shot on the Mexican side of Falcon Lake. He and his wife, Tiffany, were on personal watercraft on the lake when gunmen opened fire on them, authorities say. The killing remains unsolved. Gonzalez said officials would not release the new suspects' names. ""We're just waiting for more information. We understand that they were there, they participated in the shooting. They were given the orders to go kill (Tiffany) also,"" the sheriff said. The new information, based on cooperation from informants, came to light last month, but is just now being released publicly. Hartley's account of what happened has never changed. She and her husband were returning from touring a well known local landmark, the previously submerged town of Old Guerrero on the Mexican side of the border. They were about a mile from the town's well-known church when three boats approached. The men in the boats had guns and began to fire. David Hartley, his wife said, was shot in the head. In the months since the attack, many doubts have been raised by law enforcement sources suggesting Tiffany Hartley's version of events does not ring true. Rumors persist that somehow, in some way, the Hartleys themselves were involved. Gonzalez, who says he always believed Tiffany Hartley, said that the new information on the suspects corroborate her story. The suspects are known Mexican drug traffickers and ""do come over to Zapata County (Texas) every once in awhile. We're waiting to try and grab them when they're here,"" he said. A factor hindering the investigation is that the shooting took place in Mexico. Mexican authorities have not publicly provided any new leads since the investigator on the case was found dead. The new revelations bring the total number of suspects in the case to four, Gonzalez said. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","The killing of David Hartley remains unsolved .

"(CNN) -- Chile is unfortunately no stranger to earthquakes. A quake similar to Saturday's struck almost exactly the same part of Chile on February 20, 1835 -- almost exactly 175 years ago. On that occasion, the young English naturalist and geologist Charles Darwin was in Chile as part of his voyage on HMS Beagle. The 1835 earthquake has been estimated as magnitude 8.5, whereas that of February 27, 2010, has been measured as 8.8. The earthquake of 1835 occurred around 11 a.m. and lasted about two minutes. The main shock destroyed much of Concepción in just six seconds. There were aftershocks for several weeks and three tsunamis, each one larger than the last, starting about half an hour after the earthquake and bringing further devastation. Darwin was on shore near Valdivia, 200 miles south of Concepción, during the quake and recorded in his diary: . ""I was on shore & lying down in the wood to rest myself. It came on suddenly & lasted two minutes (but appeared much longer). The rocking was most sensible; the undulation appeared both to me & my servant to travel from due East. There was no difficulty in standing upright; but the motion made me giddy.  I can compare it to skating on very thin ice or to the motion of a ship in a little cross ripple. ... An earthquake like this at once destroys the oldest associations; the world, the very emblem of all that is solid, moves beneath our feet like a crust over a fluid; one second of time conveys to the mind a strange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection would never create."" The Beagle, with Darwin aboard, reached Concepción on March 4. The devastation there was appalling. Darwin called it ""the most awful yet interesting spectacle I ever beheld."" The entire city lay in ruins. The cathedral was shattered and wreckage and debris lined the coast. Darwin spent the next weeks investigating the effects of the earthquake. He found that rocks lined with recent marine shells were now elevated above the tide. The island of Santa Maria was raised an average of about 3 meters (9 feet). Combining his own observations with those of many local people, Darwin attempted to reconstruct the event and to understand why it had occurred. He found that three volcanoes had erupted along the Chilean coast at about the same time as the earthquake. Not only did he collect widespread evidence of the uplift of the coast during the earthquake, but traveling inland and into the mountains, he discovered a series of remains of marine shells -- proof that the shifting that had recently uplifted the coast by a small amount had occurred over and over in the recent geological past. The experience convinced him that the great geologist Charles Lyell was right -- mountain chains were not created by sudden immense catastrophes, but grew almost imperceptibly, the product of thousands of successive uplifts over almost endless geological time. Even more ambitiously, Darwin later came to connect earthquakes, volcanoes and vertical movements of the Earth's crust as the results of same great unknown subterranean phenomena. In an ambitious and important scientific paper published after the voyage, Darwin concluded that ""this large portion of the earth's crust floats in a like manner on a sea of molten rock"" and indeed that it was likely this was true of ""the entire globe."" This firsthand appreciation of an ever-changing surface of the Earth, over endless eons of time, was one of the major influences leading Darwin to ask how it was that living things changed in order to adapt to an ever-changing world. His answer was, of course, evolution, or that new species are the genealogical descendants of earlier ones, adapted according to natural selection to the environment and each other. The recent tragic earthquake in Chile demonstrates, as Darwin knew well, that our Earth is not static, it is still changing, still evolving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John van Wyhe.","Saturday's earthquake was similar to one that struck Chile when Darwin visited .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe published a draft constitutional amendment in the government gazette Saturday, paving the way for the power-sharing agreement reached after violence disrupted this year's presidential election. President Robert Mugabe, left, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed the deal in July. Constitutional Amendment 19 details the posts and institutions that were created by the power-sharing deal, including the position of prime minister intended for Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. The publication of the draft is the first step in creating a law in Zimbabwe. For the law to pass, it must be appear before parliament in 30 days, according to the country's constitution. If it is approved, it will be sent to Mugabe for his signature. The deal arose after Tsvangirai withdrew from a June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters. The two leaders signed the initial agreement, brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki, in July but have failed to agree on how to form a cabinet. The MDC, the main opposition party, noted that Mugabe's latest move does not legalize the amendment. ""Gazetting the bill -- which was done by [Mugabe's party] Zanu-PF -- does not automatically translate into passing it into law,"" MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said. ""That can only take place if outstanding issues have been addressed. Otherwise we will not support the bill."" The two parties agreed last month to the draft amendment during talks in South Africa, but Chamisa warned then that problems remained. ""We have differed with Zanu-PF for a long time while the citizens suffer, but fortunately we have agreed on something. I need to hasten to mention that we still have some outstanding issues, such as the cabinet, appointment of diplomats,"" he said in late November. Zanu-PF lost its majority in the parliament in the March elections. As no party has the two-thirds majority to pass the law, its passage relies on MDC support. If parliament does not approve the amendment, Mugabe may call for new elections, Zimbabwe Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa told state-run daily newspaper The Herald. ""I envisage that it will require two weeks for it to be debated and passed through both Houses. If no support is forthcoming, it means that Amendment Number 19 Bill will be dead matter,"" Chinamasa is quoted as saying The Herald. ""In the event that the collaboration that we envisage is not forthcoming, then that will necessitate fresh harmonized elections at some point in time,"" he said, according to The Herald. Tsvangirai won the most votes in the March election, but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count. South African President Kgalema Motlanthe, chairman of the Southern African Development Community, welcomed the draft. ""The gazetting of Amendment 19 of the Zimbabwean Constitution is indeed a major step towards the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe,"" he said in a written statement. ""We urge the Zimbabwean political parties to establish an inclusive government."" Meanwhile, the country is battling a cholera outbreak that has killed nearly 800 people since August, according to the World Health Organization. More than 16,000 people have been infected, WHO said. This week, Mugabe declared that ""there is no cholera in the country."" His spokesman later said Mugabe was sarcastically ridiculing what he believes are Western designs to invade the country. Another Zimbabwean official, Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, said Friday that the disease was a ""calculated, racist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power, which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they can invade the country."" Britain ruled the country as a colony until 1965. Ndlovu's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from Britain and the United States. In Washington, State Department spokesman Rob McInturff called Ndlovu's accusations ""patently ridiculous.""","Amendment paves way for power-sharing deal after violence disturbed election .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday authorities will not pursue criminal charges against a rap artist after he apologized for his Twitter account's role in causing a deluge of telephone calls into the department's Compton station. The Game, whose real name is Jayceon Taylor and who also uses the name Charles Louboutin on his Twitter page, apologized earlier Wednesday for a tweet that gave the sheriff's station's phone number, prompting hundreds of his followers to overwhelm deputies and dispatchers with calls. The sheriff's department issued a statement in response, saying the apology was ""relevant and well received."" ""His willingness to help share with the media and the community that the safety of the public is what is most important, is a great message,"" the department said. ""Based upon our investigation, as well as consultation with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the LASD considers the criminal investigation into this matter closed.  The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will not be seeking criminal charges."" In issuing his apology, Taylor said it wasn't he, but a friend, who tweeted the phone number, and that it was purely an accident that the station number was tweeted. ""It was a simple mishap,"" the rapper said. ""I was doing a photo shoot, and it was downtown Los Angeles, and one of my boys picked up my phone and started tweeting random numbers. ""Whenever his phone is laying around and my phone is laying around, we tweet from each other's page. That's what happened,"" the rapper said. The tweet on Friday that gave the phone number was confused with an earlier tweet about a music internship that the rapper was offering to any of his more than 580,000 followers on his Twitter page, Taylor said. ""The tweet about the internship was earlier in that day, and it got lost in the media with all that. He never sent out a tweet that said these numbers are for the internship. He tweeted a bunch of numbers jokingly. We always play pranks on each other,"" he said. But Taylor took responsibility for the early tweets about the internship. ""We had already contacted (the interns) and had the interns come to the photo shoot and start working,"" Taylor said. ""None of (the tweets) stated call this number for an internship."" The rapper added: ""My sincerest apologies to the sheriff's department, and it was a joke gone wrong."" Sheriff's Department Capt. Mike Parker said authorities had considered charging The Game with at least three misdemeanors. The sheriff's department alleged that the rapper's tweets appeared to be listing the sheriff's station in Compton as the contact number for the internship, prompting the mad rush of calls that forced the sheriff's office to bring in additional manpower to answer phones. Authorities said the calls lasted two hours Friday evening and that help was delayed in response to urgent calls about a missing person, a spousal assault, two robberies and a stolen car. ""I never want to be the source of anything happening wrong to anybody or anybody not being able to get through to the help lines at the police station,"" Taylor said. ""I don't ever want to see anyone hurt. I've got kids at home. I'm not that guy."" Taylor said the tweets on his account listed a 10-digit phone for the sheriff's station: ""When people are in trouble, they call 911, and that's not to take away from the police and them doing a job or them saying there was a robbery."" Many residents dial a station directly with the 10-digit number for urgent calls, even though the 911 emergency is at their disposal, a sheriff's department spokesman said. The Game was nominated twice in the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006: Best rap song for ""Hate It or Love It,"" which he wrote, and best rap performance by a duo or a group for the same song, with 50 Cent, a Grammy spokeswoman said. The Game didn't win in either category. Parker told CNN that the incident is a ""societal"" lesson. ""People love social media and they are using it in fun and interesting ways. But it doesn't mean that there isn't a rough edge to it,"" the sheriff's spokesman said. ""In the past the news media was the only entity that could send a message in a fast way. Now celebrities with social media are able to do it now too. All the lessons that were learned by the news media over the years about the pros and the cons (of media), people with a large social media following, they are not familiar with those lessons.

Authorities are calling the incident a ""telephone flash mob"" or ""flashcalls,"" which is a sudden and overwhelming number of phone calls and is the latest riff on unlawful conduct originating from social media, Parker said. ""Flash mobs"" began as an innocent organizing of individuals through social media to do spur-of-the-moment dances in public spaces such as a mall or a park, but increasingly, social media have been used to organize flash mobs for criminal activity, evidenced in the recent riots in London and in Vancouver, Canada, this year after the Stanley Cup loss, Parker said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- With at least five people dead and massive expanses of land and roads under water, Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency Monday in the 17 counties hardest hit by flooding from severe weather. Atlanta firefighter Stephen Webb carries a dog to safety Monday at the Peachtree Park Apartments. Gov. Sonny Perdue's announcement followed three deaths in north Georgia's Douglas County, one death in Gwinnett County and another in Carroll County, where a 2-year-old child was ripped from her father's arms by fierce floodwaters while he struggled to hold on to bushes, officials said. Those counties, near Atlanta, were among the 17 included in the state-of-emergency declaration . About 100 miles north of Atlanta, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, one person was swept into rushing water and is presumed drowned, said Jeremy Heidt, a spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in Nashville. Three missing children in Douglas County, west of Atlanta, were found, but their mother was one of the flood's fatalities, said Dena Brummer, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ""We're in rescue-and-recovery mode,"" said Wes Tallon, spokesman for fire and emergency management services in Douglas County. ""It has not stopped raining, and another line of thunderstorms is coming.""  Watch flooding one CNN.com staffer recorded » . Until just a few months ago, the area was gripped by drought.  Watch what caused the torrential rain » . Several storms moving northeast from the Gulf of Mexico brought the downpours, which forecasters expected to continue through Monday night. Rains were expected to taper off by Tuesday morning but scattered showers were expected for the next couple of days. Just west of Atlanta, some areas have received about 22 inches of rain since last week, CNN meteorologists reported. About 12 of those inches fell in a 12-hour period from Sunday night to Monday morning. After Georgia creeks and rivers burst, swollen by days of rain, residents struggled to escape. In Cobb County's Austell, two rescuers paddled their way through rising flood waters searching for stranded victims, video from CNN affiliate WXIA showed. The pair on the inflatable, yellow raft ushered a stranded woman to a section of black-tarred street that was not under water. Nearby, three men pushed their valuables in a kayak as they waded through the shoulder-high muddy waters. Another two men floated on what looked like air mattresses linked together by rope.   Watch men float on inflatable mattresses » . Near Marietta northwest of Atlanta, a flooded bridge blocked the only road out of a residential area surrounded by a national park and the Chattahoochee River. Two buses picked up elementary school children Monday morning, but flooding prevented them from picking up older students later, and the buses couldn't return with the first batch in the afternoon, said iReporter Pritam Jaipuriar, who lives there. See Pritam Jaipuriar's iReport . Some elementary students used a walking trail -- the only other path out of the area -- to return home. Some parents arranged for friends beyond the bridge to pick their children up from school and keep them for the day. ""My first-grader son is staying with a friend of mine,"" said Jaipuriar, who was unable to go to work Monday. Some ground-level apartments in the area were flooded, but his unit was fine, he said. Unable to drive for supplies, some residents walked the path to a store a few miles away and returned with bags of groceries, said iReporter Jeff Cofer, who also lives there. See Jeff Cofer's iReport . Near northwest Atlanta's Vinings area, floodwaters encroached upon multimillion-dollar houses. Rescue personnel rode in boats over flooded streets Monday night, going home to home to pick up residents and take them away. Water levels were high enough at one home that the people there stood on a roof to await rescuers, a fire and rescue official said. On Monday morning, a couple inches of water had entered the Villa Rica, Georgia, home of iReporter Walid Zeid, damaging suitcases and other things that were on the floor. Water from a flooded lake lifted his boat to the roof of his boathouse, crushing the boat's canopy, Zeid's iReport video showed. Zeid, a flight attendant, was supposed to be on an international flight Monday, but flooding prevented him and his family from leaving home, which is in Carroll County. See Walid Zeid's iReport .

Two of the Georgia fatalities involved people trying to drive through floodwater. A vehicle with one man in it was swept off a road in Douglas County, and a car carrying a woman was swept off a road in Lawrenceville in Gwinnett County, east of Atlanta, Brummer said. Seydi Burciaga, 39, was driving to her Lawrenceville home from work when flash flooding trapped her in her vehicle, Gwinnett County police said. She called 911 and police tried to locate her, but Burciaga could not tell them exactly where she was. Floodwater moved her car about 500 feet after she was swept off the roadway, and her attempts to guide rescuers to her by mentioning landmarks were unsuccessful, police said. By the time rescuers found her minivan, she was dead, police said. In Tennessee, the presumed drowning victim was forced into a culvert, or underground storm water drain, about 6 p.m. Sunday, Chattanooga Fire Department spokesman Bruce Garner told CNN. Sylvester Kitchens Jr., 46, was with a friend, Albert Miller, when the two decided to swim in a large, flooded ditch, Garner said. He said a Miller family member told him that ""basically it was a bet."" Both managed to grab onto a chain link fence while being buffeted by the strong current, Garner said. A neighbor threw a garden hose for them to grab onto, and Kitchens reached for it but was unable to hold on. Miller clung to the fence for about 20 minutes and was eventually rescued by firefighters, Garner said. Kitchens' body has not been found, said Garner, who added that it ""doesn't appear he could've survived.""

"(CNN) -- A volcano near southwest Colombia's border with Ecuador erupted on Saturday, leading the government to issue a ""red alert"" for the region. The Galeras volcano is shown on January 17, 2008, from Pasto, Colombia. There were not believed to be any fatalities or injuries in the blast, which happened at about 7:10 p.m. ET (12:10 a.m. Sunday GMT), said Carlos Lineras of the Colombia Institute for Geology and Mines. The institute issued an evacuation order for about 7,000 people living near the Galeras volcano. The volcano is not in a heavily populated region. Galeras has erupted several times since it became active again in 1989.

"(CNN) -- The resignation of Silvio Berlusconi as Italy's prime minister does not mark his end, but the beginning of the end. He will not disappear from the stage anytime soon. Through his vast public and private sector networks, Berlusconi's influence on Italian affairs will continue for the foreseeable future and beyond. However, despite making several successful comebacks, any further attempt will be far less effective. While Berlusconi's credibility abroad is irreparably damaged, his legitimacy at home consistently sags. As a rapidly aging figure, he is increasingly disconnected from political reality. Time is of the essence and necessity determines a technocratic government that must last until 2013, when elections are formally due. During this period, Italy's problems will not be resolved. The objectives must be to stabilize the status quo, place Italy on a clear path to reform and provide a respectable degree of certainty for international markets. Time has run out for Italy to determine the process and pace of reform. Past failures have caught up. Greater collective sacrifices are now required. A new government must firmly make the often unpopular decisions required. The crucial need for structural reform and greater deregulation is accompanied by the need to boost competitiveness and growth -- indispensable elements to long-term success. While Italy's long-standing challenges remain unresolved, the deep level of political polarization continues, as does Italy's failure to adapt to an increasingly globalized world. With one of the world's lowest birth rates, Italy is increasingly becoming a nation of pensioners, ruled by pensioners for the sake of pensioners. It amounts to a gerontocracy with little, if any, meritocracy. In Italy, a young leader is considered someone in his 50s. The prevailing perception of politicians is that their purpose is not to serve the public but to take from it and distribute the spoils to loyalists in order to guarantee survival and self-preservation. For young Italians, upward mobility is not a fluid process. Personal connections or tutelage under a ""sponsor"" becomes a more secure guarantee to success. Some of Italy's best and brightest opt for opportunities abroad to find greater meritocracy and equitable results for hard work. In the corporate realm, many of Italy's largest multinationals have adapted to globalization. However, many small and medium-sized companies, largely responsible for the nation's post-war economic success, struggle to compete. For a society which has enjoyed generous state-sponsored benefits for decades, amending or revoking what is considered an entitlement will be extremely difficult. This requires not only an economic change but a cultural one in a country where dependence upon the state prevails in many quarters and remains significantly rooted in the political culture. As the world's eighth largest economy, Italy consistently punches below its weight. By continuing on its present course, and as new powers emerge globally, Italy will inevitably be relegated. Its traditional political establishment pales in competence when compared to its entrepreneurial class. Italy remains a nation unable to unleash its wealth of talent, much of which continues to seek opportunities abroad, significantly hurting the nation's competitiveness and growth. Italy possesses one of the most over-regulated economies and some of the lowest labor productivity rates in the developed world. Labor and pension reform and deregulation remain essential priorities. Excessively powerful unions continue to exercise disproportionate influence over effective national policy. Corruption and organized crime in Italy's southern regions continue to hinder economic development. As for post-Berlusconi Italy, the door now opens for a potential realignment in Italian politics. A sizable centrist bloc could emerge as a power broker in determining future governments. It would be a combination of old Christian Democrats, defectors from Berlusconi's party and disenchanted centrist elements of the main center-left party, Partito Democratico. While Berlusconi's center-right will attempt to consolidate its ranks, the center-left will struggle to overcome divisions. Throughout the turmoil of recent months, Italy's center-left has utterly failed to seize the political initiative. In part, this has helped to extend Berlusconi's survival. In retrospect, Berlusconi had an historic opportunity to reform Italy, particularly after winning an absolute parliamentary majority in 2008. It was squandered due largely to his personal shortcomings and inability to effectively manage Italy's economy and political system. His failures led to his ouster and history will deny him the chance to ever make up for it. During his 20-year political career, Berlusconi displayed impeccable endurance skills. At home, he survived more than 50 confidence votes, scandals, court cases and other controversies, all somewhat subject to his influence. However, current market pressure proved too overwhelming for Berlusconi's aura of invincibility and omnipotence. Ironically, his most humiliating defeat was largely inflicted by external circumstances beyond his control. In less than 48 hours, he became the second victim of the eurozone crisis after the resignation of the Greek prime minister. A possible third target is Spain's Socialist party after national elections on November 20. Over time, Berlusconi has largely become the victim of his own hubris. Whereas many Italians were amused by past antics, they eventually became a liability and particularly unacceptable for the important voting bloc of Berlusconi's Catholic supporters. His can-do-no-wrong attitude also became unsustainable. The sense that he was accountable to no-one but himself created resentment even among diehard loyalists. This was further compounded by the perception of a do-nothing, no-results government. From Berlusconi's perspective, he was back-stabbed. After all, the narrative goes, he saved Italy from the far left and is therefore entitled to rule at will and leave power when ready. To think otherwise is committing treason. Many are eager to write off Berlusconi sooner rather than later. Some are ideologically driven, others simply tired of polemics and political gridlock. It may be too premature to write his political obituary just yet. However, the drafting has begun in earnest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marco Vicenzino .","Vicenzino: Berlusconi's influence on Italian affairs will continue for foreseeable future .

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- People thought that as bad the Memphis Grizzlies NBA franchise has mostly been since moving from frosty Vancouver to this steamy Southern locale 10 years ago, it would be hell or high water before they ever won a playoff game, much less a series. Well, the Grizzlies, after being just the second No. 8 seed to ever beat a No. 1 seed in a seven-game NBA series two weeks ago, are still hanging on in the Western Conference semifinals, forcing a Game 7 after defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder 95-83 on Friday. And that's where the high water comes in. If you walk out the front doors of FedExForum, take a right, walk 25 yards to Beale Street, walk two blocks west and roll a basketball down a hill the final block, that ball might end up in the Gulf of Mexico. That's because The Big Muddy, the Mississippi River, is on Memphis' downtown doorstep, cresting Tuesday night at 47.8 feet, way above flood stage. Dark brown water has filtered it way into the northern parts of the city, making life miserable for thousands. The Grizzlies understand misery. Their franchise, since moving from Vancouver in 2001-02, has had a decade of heartache, from being swept in three straight playoffs from 2004 to 2006, to majority owner Michael Heisley almost selling the team a couple of years later. The Griz players also understand that when the playoffs started almost four weeks ago, they were playing for themselves. Now, they realize it's much more than that. ""With all the flooding, the people in our city could have easily dropped their heads,"" guard O.J. Mayo said. ""But we feel good that at the end of the day, they've been able to come down to Beale Street, catch a game and put a rough time behind them."" Granted, the Grizzlies haven't had much time to think about the plight of their city. Once you've stepped into the intense hurricane of the playoffs, it's hard to spend a few minutes of calm in the eye. ""The city has gone through a lot when you see all the people who've had to relocate and move all their things,"" Memphis point guard Mike Conley said. ""That's a tough situation, but this community has been on our side this whole roller-coaster season. We're trying to do this for them."" Whatever happens Friday night, whether the Grizzlies win and go back to Oklahoma City for game 7, or lose to end the season, what has occurred the last four weeks has turned around the franchise. The city of Memphis is a rarity in the football-crazed South, because it has always been about basketball, dating back to the days when the city's powerhouse college basketball program, then called Memphis State, lost  in the 1973 NCAA championship game to Bill Walton-led UCLA. From the playgrounds to the high schools to the University of Memphis, the city loves its barbecue, blues and basketball. Even when the city failed to get an NFL franchise when the league last expanded in 1995, the average Memphis sports fan always believed the city would support an NBA franchise. Former Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, who guided Memphis to its first playoff berth ever in 2004 when he was named the league's Coach of the Year, said he's never forgotten how much the city loved a winner and a team that played as a team. ""Every time I go into an arena with one of my guys [former Griz players], it's just incredible the relationship with those players and that town,"" said Brown, now a TV analyst for ABC and ESPN. ""I say it all the time: You can't fool the people of Memphis. That's a basketball town, they understand the game all the way down to the high school level."" That's why when the franchise struggled in recent years, the average Griz fan never thought another playoff run was possible. Crowds dwindled, and it didn't matter what promotion was being given away at home games. ""You can't fool these fans, because they know bad basketball when they see it,"" said Shane Battier, who was the Grizzlies' first first-round draft pick in '01 as they moved to Memphis, ""They were going to show up to watch a winning team. You weren't going to get them in the building with T-shirts and bobbleheads."" When the Grizzlies won game 6 in Memphis to capture the Spurs' series, the fans spilled from FedExForum onto Beale Street for an all-night party. And though the Grizzlies were to fly to Oklahoma City the next afternoon to begin their semifinal series, Battier and some teammates joined in on the fun, too. ""All the years I had been here before, I always wondered what it would be like if we won a playoff series, because the playoffs are here in May during Musicfest and the barbecue festival,"" Battier said. ""So when we won, I just had to go out and see. ""Since I live downtown, I just left my car here [at FedExForum] and walked home down Main Street. It was awesome. Everybody was high-fiving me and each other."" Memphis mayor A C Wharton says the Grizzlies style of play makes them the perfect team for his city.  ""When the Grizzlies get knocked down and don't get the foul calls they just get up and keep grinding,"" Wharton said. ""In the game of life there are no referees.  When you get knocked on your back you get back up."" Star forward Zach Randolph recognizes how much this playoff run means to Memphis. Never before has he felt so loved by a city after he had earned a reputation as a malcontent at his previous NBA stops, starting in Portland. ""It has never been like this anywhere else,"" said Randolph, who loves Memphis so much that he personally pays a one-month electric bill for hundreds of struggling Memphians during Christmas. ""This city has embraced me. The people here have been great. ""I'm involved in the community. I'm involved with the kids here. I think God has blessed me and He has made this work for me. I think this is God's plan for me to be here. I'm feel like I'm from Memphis and this is great for our city."" Randolph's community work isn't the exception among the Grizzlies. It's the rule, and a way established by head coach Lionel Hollins, who was on Portland's 1977 NBA champions that caused that city to fall in love with the franchise. ""If you have good talent, you got a chance to win,"" said Hollins, 57. ""But to give yourself a chance, you've got to open up, you have to share the basketball with one another, you've got to be a better teammate, you have to be a better citizen, because all of this is tied in with the sponsors, fans and the community. It's all tied together. And in order to maximize who you are, you have to be better in all these areas."" That's why Friday night, with their backs to the wall, one game away from being eliminated, the Grizzlies will gather down by the river one more time -- a river that is a lot closer than it was at the start of the playoffs -- and fight it out with the Thunder to the very end. ""This series is not over by any means,"" Hollins said after his team, coming off a three-overtime loss Monday, lost game 5 on Wednesday  99-72 at Oklahoma City. ""I still believe in my team, and I still believe we will come back. This team will fight to the end."" Because if the Grizzlies didn't know it before, they know it now -- they live in a city of fighters.","Memphis Grizzlies are on an unlikely run in the NBA playoffs .
Players say they know how much the team's success means to their flooded city .
Grizzlies need to win Friday night to avoid being eliminated from the playoffs ."
"(CNN) -- Serbian authorities have put up wanted posters for war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic at police stations across the country in their search for the highest-ranking figure from the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict to remain at large, according to Serbian media reports. Ratko Mladic, pictured in 1993, is the highest-ranking figure from the conflict still at large. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the killing of almost 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica in July 1995. The posters remind people of the 1 million euro ($1.3 million) reward for information leading to Mladic's capture, according to Serbian media reports. Authorities also recently put up notices about the 250,000 euro ($334,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of Serbia's other fugitive, Goran Hadzic, according to the reports released Saturday. The posters provide a phone number and promise that informants will enjoy ""guaranteed secrecy of data and identity,"" Serbia's B92 network reported. Last month, the office of the war crimes prosecutor in Belgrade announced that Serbian police -- acting on the prosecutor's request -- searched for Mladic and Hadzic around the town of Arandjelovac, 45 miles (75 kilometers) south of Belgrade. Mladic is the top-ranking figure from the conflict to remain at large following the July arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Mladic, who commanded the Bosnian Serb military during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been on the run for 13 years, ever since the international tribunal issued the indictments against him and those against 51 others. He disappeared after former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001. The tribunal has accused Serbia of knowing Mladic's whereabouts and letting him avoid capture, but the country's leaders have denied protecting him. Mladic is one of the major stumbling blocks to Serbia's admission to the European Union. Serbia's government signed a preliminary agreement last April setting the country on the path to full EU membership. But ratification of the deal was made conditional on Serbia sending Mladic to the Hague.","Mladic is wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When Michael Jackson died unexpectedly two years ago, his fans worldwide erupted in a torrent of grief, anguish and -- in tribute to the pop icon -- song and dance. On Monday, there were hugs, tears and shrieks of joy among his fans packed outside a Southern California courtroom after a jury found Jackson's physician, Conrad Murray, guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. Jury finds Murray guilty . ""Oh my God, guilty!"" one woman yelled out, seconds after the verdict was announced. Others appeared to almost break out in song; some seemed to start dancing; and a chant soon rose up of ""Justice, justice, justice."" The honking horns and revelry were in contrast to the quiet scene inside Los Angeles Superior Court, where Judge Michael Pastor had earlier urged people to constrain their emotions. But there were no such restrictions outside. Hundreds had packed the streets and sidewalks earlier in the day anticipating a verdict. Many held signs calling for Murray's conviction, like one saying, ""Murray, burn in hell."" A long banner held out by several people had a simpler, more sentimental message: ""We miss Michael."" They were joined by throngs of photographers and videographers. Many flanked a walkway to the courtroom, their flashbulbs popping as Jackson family members, lawyers and others hurriedly walked into the courthouse to learn Murray's fate. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office reported in June 2009 that the entertainer had died after suffering cardiac arrest. Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was caused by ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with two sedatives, the coroner ruled. But Murray was eventually indicted, as prosecutors claimed he was criminally negligent in giving Jackson excess amounts of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat the singer's insomnia. When the jury decided in the prosecution's favor, the emotions spilled over on the streets as people yelled out, burst into tears and smiled. ""I'm so happy,"" one woman, who had traveled to California from Memphis, Tennessee, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell outside the courthouse. ""Michael deserves justice."" One of the late singer's sisters, LaToya Jackson, thanked all those involved in Murray's conviction, which she called a ""victory."" ""Everybody was wonderful,"" she said as she left the courthouse. Her brother Randy Jackson said ""justice was served,"" while opining that Murray should have to serve more than even the four-year maximum that he could get. ""Michael is with us,"" Randy Jackson said. And Kathy Hilton, a friend of the Jackson family and mother of Paris Hilton, said while leaving the courthouse that the verdict was bittersweet, though still satisfying. ""At least they'll feel some kind of relief, some kind of closure,"" she told HLN, referring to Jackson's parents, Joe and Katherine. The reaction was equally swift and emotional online and outside Los Angeles. Melissa Fazli, a CNN iReporter and student at California State University, Fullerton, said she broke into tears on hearing the news. ""It's really sad to know that Conrad Murray, because of his negligence, took Michael Jackson away,"" Fazli said, expressing hope that it might dissuade ""doctor-shopping"" that might lead people to get more drugs than they can safely have. ""That's why I cried."" On social networking sites like Twitter, the reaction was likewise fast, furious and emotional. ""Next time don't be so greedy Conrad Murray! Guilty!"" wrote one such commenter on Twitter, former MTV VJ and hip-hop personality Ed Lover. Hip-hop artist Nicki Minaj offered a restrained reaction on her Twitter feed, saying, ""People are cheering, but there really are no winners here. This has been an utter tragedy from beginning to end."" John Branca and John McClain, the co-executors of Jackson's estate, released a statement on Michaeljackson.com in which they lauded the verdict and remembered the singer as ""the greatest entertainer that has ever lived."" ""The estate of Michael Jackson and Michael himself has always believed the jury system works and despite the tragedy that brought about this trial we are in agreement with the jury's verdict,"" they wrote. "" In this case, justice has been served."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Michael's brother Randy says, ""Michael is with us""

"(CNN) -- Pardoned but hardly chastened, ex-President Richard Nixon defended his administration's secrecy and wiretaps in combative testimony before a Watergate grand jury following his resignation, newly released documents reveal. Archivists released nearly 50,000 pages of records and about 45 minutes of audio recordings Thursday, including hundreds of pages of transcripts of Nixon's June 1975 testimony. Special prosecutors were still trying to document the breadth of the scandal that had driven him from power nearly a year earlier, while Nixon did his best to defend his presidency. ""I mean it is your job, and I want the jury and the special prosecutors to kick the hell out of us for wiretapping and for the Plumbers and the rest, because obviously you may have concluded it is wrong,"" Nixon is quoted in one of the transcripts. ""But I want to say this: That if as a result of the secret negotiations that we have had we have changed the world, which we have; if as a result, we have saved American lives, which we did in Vietnam by shortening a war -- the secret Cambodian bombings saved at least 10,000 lives, as I have told you; if as a result, we'll have made some progress in reducing the threat of nuclear destruction by arms limitation with the Russians; and if the other choice is to have what we call total openness, with no security whatever, then the United States is finished as a great power. Maybe a lot of people don't care, but I care a great deal. I think all of you care a great deal."" The material includes Nixon's recollection of one of the most unusual moments of his presidency -- a pre-dawn meeting at the Lincoln Memorial with student demonstrators outraged by his 1970 invasion of Cambodia. Nixon said he realized he could not convince them the move was needed to shorten the Vietnam War, but told them he hoped they would ""give us a hearing on some other issues where we might agree."" Nixon left office August 9, 1974, as Congress considered whether to impeach him over the Watergate scandal. The debacle began with a bungled burglary of the Democratic National Committee offices by Nixon campaign operatives before the 1972 election. The investigations that followed led to the exposure of a wide-ranging White House plan to sabotage political opponents, efforts to stop leaks by a White House squad known as the ""Plumbers"" and Nixon's orders to cover up the effort. Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, issued him a blanket pardon about a month after the resignation, foreclosing any prospect that the former president would ever face the prison terms many of his aides served. Nixon dodged questions about the mysterious 18Â½-minute gap in his Oval Office tapes that has fascinated historians for more than three decades, telling prosecutors that he ""practically blew my stack"" when he learned of it. He suggested it happened while his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, was transcribing the tape, but characterized it as an accident. He mocked others in the White House who suggested other causes as ""amateurs"" and ""clowns."" He recounted ordering then-White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig to ""find out how this damn thing happened,"" then apologized to the grand jurors for swearing. ""I am sorry, I wasn't supposed to use profanity,"" he said. ""You have enough on the tapes."" CNN's Mike M.

"(CNN) -- Apparently, conquering those smarmy, snickering pigs on your phone, laptop or other mobile device isn't enough. Now, the ""Angry Birds"" may be migrating to your television. Mikael Hed is CEO of Rovio Mobile, the Finland-based company that created the ridiculously popular mobile game -- in which players solve physics puzzles by flinging an armada of irritated avians at structures housing the porcine adversaries who stole their eggs.

Launched originally on Apple's iOS operating system, ""Angry Birds"" expanded rapidly in 2010 and is now available on multiple platforms including Android, PC and Symbian and traditional gaming consoles.

"(CNN) -- What started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. Here is a roundup of some of the movement's recent developments. ATLANTA . Up to 20 protesters in Atlanta moved to the suburbs Monday, taking up position in a home with a family of five facing foreclosure. Members of Occupy Atlanta will stay in Snellville for 48 hours, according to a group spokesman. Protesters plan to canvass the neighborhood with the family to drum up support to help occupy other homes facing foreclosure, said Tim Franzen. CHICAGO . White hair and wheelchairs dotted the crowd in Chicago Monday, as senior citizens and disabled demonstrators joined the Occupy movement to protest cuts in safety net programs. ""At every level of society, Americans are under attack,"" said protester Karen Bocker. ""When the economy tanks, social programs are cut, not corporate tax breaks."" Some 1,500 members of the Jane Addams Senior Caucus hit the streets with Occupy Chicago, according to a statement from the group. More than 40 protesters linked arms in a downtown intersection, blocking traffic -- some of them sitting on the pavement -- to protest threats to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Police issued citations to 43 people, who will be required to pay a fine, said Chicago police spokesman Veejay Zala. The demonstrations were peaceful, and there were no reports of injuries, he said. FRESNO, CALIFORNIA . Police arrested at least 22 people during the weekend in Fresno, California, in connection to the Occupy Fresno protests, according to demonstrators and the city's sheriff. An additional protester was taken into custody Monday, according to the Occupy Fresno website. Demonstrators agreed to ""voluntary arrest"" as a form of protest, said Sheriff Margaret Mims, and did not resist. ""They staged a good, old-fashioned sit-in,"" she said. Protesters arrested Sunday were released the same day, according to a post on Occupy Fresno's website. PHILADELPHIA . A couple that met a month ago, working the information booth at Occupy Philadelphia, married Monday. Alicia ""Ally"" Nauss of Philadelphia and Adam Hill of Norristown, Pennsylvania, took their vows at the group's encampment at Dilworth Plaza next to City Hall, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. ""We work really well together. When you meet somebody like that ... it felt completely natural,"" Nauss said. The couple said they'll spend their honeymoon visiting other Occupy movements along the East Coast. Protesters face a possible showdown with the city over the site of their demonstration. The plaza has been scheduled for a $50 million renovation, scheduled to begin this month. There have been negotiations between the city and the demonstrators over alternative sites. TUCSON, ARIZONA . Beset by rain and cold, Occupy protesters in Tucson, Arizona, solicited material donations online Monday to help winterize their camp, while lawyers representing the group announced a lawsuit intended to stop arrests. Occupy campers asked the public for waterproof tarps, warm and dry outerwear, sleeping bags, blankets and better tents in an entry on their blog. They included a request for delivery to their location. Also Monday, volunteer attorneys calling themselves the Occupy Tucson Legal Working Group said that they have filed a civil rights suit in federal court, ""and will ask for a temporary restraining order to stop arrests at Veinte De Agosto Park,"" where protesters are camped out. The lawyers said they represent 96 local Occupy protesters, who have more than 400 misdemeanor charges against them. CNN's John Murgatroyd, Ed Payne, Dana Ford and Maria P. White contributed to this report.","Lawyers representing Occupy Arizona announce a lawsuit intended to stop arrests .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- In a rare case, a Spanish court convicted two Somalia men of piracy in the 2009 takeover of a Spanish fishing vessel and sentenced each to 439 years in prison, according to a copy of the sentence viewed by CNN on Tuesday. The long prison terms stem mainly from the conviction for illegal detention of the vessel's 36 crew members, with a sentence of 11 years for each count of piracy, or 396 years. In addition, the defendants were convicted on three other counts, including armed robbery and belonging to a criminal gang, which boosted the overall sentence to 439 years. The vessel, the Alakrana, was freed in November 2009 after being held for 47 days off the coast of Somalia. The crew included 16 Spanish sailors and 20 from Africa and Asia. A day after the hijacking by 12 armed pirates, Spanish military monitoring the situation captured two pirate suspects on Oct. 3, 2009 as they left the fishing vessel. Then authorities took the unusual step of bringing them to Madrid. Many other pirate suspects who have been captured by international military forces --- trying to ensure the safety of merchant shipping and fishing off the coast of Somalia --- have been taken to African nations for court procedures, but not to Europe. The Spanish court identified the two as Raageggesey Hassan Aji, of Ceel Maccan, Somalia, who was born in 1978, although his birthdate was not disclosed; and Cabdiweli Cabdullahi, of Marka, Somalia, with no age given, although the court determined before the trial that was an adult. Defense lawyers argued unsuccessfully for their acquittal. Despite the 439-year sentences, a court official told CNN that the likely maximum that could be served for such convictions is about 30 years. Spanish media reported in 2009 that a ransom had been paid to free the ship, and a leading Spanish fishing industry executive, Juan Manuel Vietes, told CNN at the time he was certain a ransom was paid for the release of the tuna trawler, but he didn't know the amount. The Spanish government did not say how the ship had been freed.","The two were involved in the 2009 hijacking of the Spanish ship Alakrana .

"London (CNN) -- The beating by a Texas judge of his daughter in 2004 that has provoked a storm of outrage in the United States has made me reflect on how the situation with regard to corporal punishment in schools has changed during my career as a schoolmaster and head teacher. Let me tell you about one boy, let's call him Will. One day, some 30 years ago, Will, a 14-year-old boy at the school at which I was headmaster, told his home economics teacher to f*** off. She marched Will along to my office. I promptly beat him. This was the punishment which his teacher desired. It was the punishment which the rest of the class expected. It was what Will expected. He did not swear at her again. I might add that every now and again my deputy and I beat boys for bullying, damage to property, insolence to staff and petty theft. My deputy, who hit much harder than me due to my injured wrist incurred during military service, claimed that boys never came back for more, but this did not prevent him from being widely liked and respected. I do not think that my action in beating Will was at all similar to Judge Adams' action. Whereas he had clearly lost control of himself, I am confident I was in complete control. Whereas a male chastising a female may well be motivated by sexual desire, including a father beating his daughter, I derived no gratification whatsoever from chastising Will. I didn't lose my temper: I was merely doing my job in upholding the discipline of the school and supporting a member of my staff. As a consequence I feel no shame for hurting a child. Will knew what the punishment for his insolence would be. In the climate of the time it would have been remiss of me not to have beaten him. As a boy I myself was beaten at my boarding school for idleness and disobedience, for talking after lights out for instance. It did not occur to me that I was treated unjustly, and indeed I continued to admire and like the teachers who punished me. However, all that has changed now. Enlightened, liberal opinion is unanimous that chastising children is wicked, and consequently, since approximately the millennium, corporal punishment in all British schools has been illegal. Most teachers would probably regard this as a good thing. I myself am not so sure. I do recognize that the onset of co-education had made corporal punishment problematical, in that male teachers cannot be allowed to belabor girls. While alternative punishments can be devised, it is not a coherent, satisfactory situation though. Ideally, girls and boys should be treated the same. What has happened is that a disciplinary option has been denied to the authorities in a school. Yes, it is always better to reward good behavior than punish misdemeanors. But there was something to be said for the punishment of bad behavior with prompt, clear-cut action that was over and done with quickly. I suspect that discipline in schools has declined overall as a result of the abolition of corporal punishment, and that it would be improved if corporal punishment were to be restored. But I very much doubt if it will happen.","Beating by a Texas judge of his daughter in 2004 has provoked storm of outrage .

"(CNN) -- A New York man was sentenced Thursday to life without parole for killing four people at a Long Island pharmacy in June. David Laffer, 33 and his wife, Melinda Brady, 29, pleaded guilty in September to charges related to an armed robbery on Father's Day at Haven Drugs. Laffer admitted fatally shooting two pharmacy employees and two customers before making off with a large quantity of prescription drugs. He and his wife were arrested four days after the shooting in a violent confrontation with police, according to authorities. Laffer was charged with five counts of first degree murder, one for each victim plus one for multiple victims, and four counts of criminal use of a firearm in the first degree. ""He was given a maximum sentence of life in prison on five counts of murder and 25 years for each count of firearms charge, one for each victim,"" said James Saladino, principal clerk for Judge James C. Hudson. ""There was no surprise. When he took the plea he was told that he will receive life without parole, and that's what happened,"" said Laffer's attorney, Eric Naiburg. During the sentencing, Judge James C. Hudson said he saw no signs of remorse from Laffer and requested that the Department of Correctional Services place him in solitary confinement without privileges, said James Saladino, principal clerk for Hudson. ""The judge is powerless to enforce it, (he) can only make a recommendation,"" Saladino said. Naiburg was skeptical that the request would be granted. ""My experience says that won't happen. Those things are for people like Gotti,"" he said, referring to the late mobster John Gotti. ""They'll look at him closely and they'll do what is best for the Department of Correctional Services."" Brady, who had pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree as an accomplice, was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison followed by five years of supervision. She has been in custody since June. The pharmacy employees killed in the shooting were identified as Raymond Ferguson, 45, and Jennifer Mejia, 17. Mejia was just days away from her high school graduation. Also killed were Bryon Sheffield, 71, a customer who was inside the pharmacy, and Jamie Taccetta, 33, a customer who walked in on the robbery. She was the mother of two young girls.","David Laffer, 33, receives five life sentences; his wife is sentenced to 25 years .

"(CNN) -- Police in suburban Seattle said Tuesday they have not ruled out the possibility of foul play in the disappearance of a 2-year-old boy who was reported missing after being left alone in a car by his mother. According to police, Sky Metalwala's mother said she ran out of gas in Bellevue, just east of Seattle, leaving the toddler in the car while she took her 4-year-old with her to get help. ""She told us that her son was asleep, and that's why she chose to leave him in the car, because she couldn't carry both kids to walk to the gas station,"" Maj. Mike Johnson of the Bellevue Police Department told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. Julia Biryukova, the mother, said the young boy was gone when she returned to the vehicle about an hour later, according to police. ""At this point, foul play has not been ruled out,"" Johnson said, adding that neither the mother nor the boy's father is a suspect. Police have no suspects, and no arrests have been made in the case. Other than the boy's mother and his 4-year-old sister, no one has reported seeing the toddler in the past two weeks, according to police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate. She described the mother, who gave police permission to search around her home and car, as cooperative. The father, Solomon Metalwala, who is separated from Biryukova, took a polygraph test Monday and was expected to take another Tuesday after results of the first one were inconclusive, said Sgt. Seth Tyler of the Bellevue Police Department. He said the car door was unlocked when police got to it. Authorities began their search around the vicinity of the vehicle but found nothing. They are canvassing the mother's apartment complex in Redmond, northeast of Bellevue, Tyler said. Search-and-rescue experts brought in to assist told police they do not believe the boy got out of the car and wandered off, according to Johnson. ""So we're trying to look at other options,"" he said. Early indications suggest that the car still had some gas in it when it was left and that it would run, he said. However, police have not done a forensic examination of the vehicle. ""Our primary concern right now is to locate Sky,"" said Johnson. The toddler has brown eyes and short, dark hair and was wearing a dark green hooded sweatshirt and blue-and-gray striped pants when he was last seen. The boy's parents, who separated last year, have a tumultuous relationship. Biryukova has said she feared for her safety and that of her children around Metalwala, according to court records. ""I am told by my husband Solomon (and) his family that if I take any action towards custody of our children he will take them out of the country (and) I will never see them again,"" she wrote. Metalwala responded, in court filings, that his wife suffered from mental health problems and was unable to care for the children on her own. Both parents were charged in 2009 with reckless endangerment for leaving then 3-month-old Sky alone in their parked car. Court records show they completed court-ordered parenting courses following the incident. CNN's Patrick Oppmann and Deanna Proeller contributed to this report.","NEW: No one other than the boy's sister and mother have reported seeing the toddler in 2 weeks, police say .

"(CNN) -- Two Swedish journalists charged with terrorism in Ethiopia face years in prison after their arrest in a prohibited region along the nation's border with Somalia. Ethiopian troops captured Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye in July during a gunfire exchange with a rebel group in Ogaden, according to state media. Press freedom groups said the two were embedded with the Ogaden National Liberation Front rebels while working on a story about the region. Journalists and aid workers are prohibited from traveling to Ogaden, which activists say is rife with human rights abuses against ethnic Somalis by Ethiopian troops. The federal prosecutor has charged the two with ""attempting to dismantle the constitutional system through the organized armed group,"" according to the Ethiopian News Agency. Ethiopian officials have publicly accused the journalists of being accomplices to terrorism after the government declared the rebels a terrorist group in June. The two face two counts: one for entering the country illegally and a second for providing assistance to a terrorist organization, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Both journalists have pleaded guilty to entering the country illegally through Somalia without accreditation, according to the journalists' group, which says Ethiopian officials deny media access to the area without government minders. The two are contributors to the Sweden-based agency Kontinent. They face 15 years in prison if found guilty.","Ethiopian troops arrested Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye in July .

"(CNN)  -- Venezuela will give a 300-acre island in the Delaware River to the state of New Jersey, the governor's office announced. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez used the Earth Day celebration to announce the transfer of Petty's Island. The Venezuelan-owned Citgo Petroleum Corp. had bought Petty's Island -- between Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- to use as a fuel storage facility. The island is home to a pair of American bald eagles as well as several great blue herons and state-endangered black-crowned night herons, New Jersey Gov. Jon S. Corzine said in a news release Wednesday. Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez announced the island's transfer as part of Wednesday's Earth Day celebrations. Plans are being finalized for the transition, which will not occur before 2020, Corzine's office said. ""Earth Day is a fitting time to consummate the donation of this special place,"" Corzine said in the news release. ""Petty's Island has become an important home to bald eagles, kestrels and a wide variety of waterfowl. We are opening a new chapter in the island's long history by restoring it and giving it back to nature and the people of New Jersey."" The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection must certify that Citgo's cleanup of the island has met state standards before the title can be transferred, the news release said. Citgo has agreed to create a $2 million fund to allow the Natural Lands Trust, a state land-preservation board, to manage the island, the release said. The company is setting up another $1 million fund to help establish a cultural and education center. Activities on the island will be limited to hiking and bicycle riding, the governor's office said. The island is part of Pennsauken Township, New Jersey.","Petty's Island, a 300-acre island in Delaware River, will be given to New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab has withdrawn from Somalia's war-ravaged capital in what the Islamist militant group called a ""change in tactics."" The Somali president said Al-Shabaab, which controls much of southern Somalia, retreated from Mogadishu after heavy fighting early Saturday with government and African Union forces. The al Qaeda-linked group has been waging an insurgency against Somalia's transitional government since 2006. ""Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda are a menace to Somalia and it is happy news that we defeated them in Mogadishu,"" Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed told reporters. But he warned Mogadishu residents not to rush to areas vacated by Al-Shabaab fighters, saying the group may have booby-trapped the area. He also warned of possible suicide bombings. U.N. special representative Augustine Mahiga lauded the retreat, saying ""there is no doubt that the departure of Al-Shabaab would be a positive development and a step in the right direction for a city that has seen so much misery and devastation."" Spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage confirmed Al-Shabaab fighters left the city but said the fighting was hardly over. ""The reasons we withdrew from Mogadishu is we have made changes in our tactics of war,"" he told the group's radio station, Andalus. ""We withdrew because we want to save lives of the poor civilians but we will launch operations against government (and African Union) forces in the coming hours."" Some believe the Islamists withdrew because of funding woes and drought-related issues. The United Nations has declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit. ""The immediate priority must now be to focus on the humanitarian situation and I call on all parties, from the donor community to all parts of the Transitional Federal Government, to do everything possible to ensure and facilitate the immediate delivery of assistance to those most in need,"" Mahiga said. Al-Shabaab has called the famine a ""crusader"" invention and an excuse for occupation, and issued threats to aid agencies delivering food to afflicted areas. As crops withered, thousands of people fled and livestock starved. But the militants kept their ban on aid groups operating in their territory in southern and central Somalia, and parts of the capital.","NEW: U.N. official calls the retreat ""a positive development""

"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Coach Joe Paterno and the president of the school have lost their jobs, effective immediately, over a child sex abuse scandal at Penn State, university trustees announced Wednesday night. ""What can I say, I'm no longer the coach,"" Paterno told a crowd of about 15 students gathered outside his house late Wednesday night. ""It's going to take some time to get used to. It's been 61 years."" The crowd cheered and said, ""We love you, Joe."" ""I love you, too!"" Paterno replied. Paterno's wife, Sue, was visibly upset while standing beside him on the front steps. John P. Surma, vice chairman of trustees, said that President Graham Spanier was being replaced and Paterno, the longtime head football coach, would not finish the remainder of the season. Nittany Lions defensive coordinator Tom Bradley will serve as interim head coach. Rod Erickson, executive vice president and provost of the school, will be interim president, school officials said. Stunned Penn State students congregated after the announcement. Spanier has been president of the school since 1995. Paterno was given the news of the unanimous decision early Wednesday evening in a telephone call made by chairman of the board Steve Garban and Surma. Asked Paterno's reaction, Surma said, ""That's a private discussion that I would rather not characterize."" Surma said he hoped that the school's 95,000 students and hundreds of thousands of alumni would believe the decision ""is in the best long-term interest of the university, which is much larger than athletic programs."" ""We believe we did the best job we could,"" he added. Hours before the decision, Paterno, 84, issued a statement saying he was ""absolutely devastated by the developments"" involving a former assistant football coach and two university officials and that he would end his 46-year tenure as head football coach at the end of the season. The trustees decided to move that timetable up. ""I grieve for the children and their families, and I pray for their comfort and relief,"" Paterno said. ""With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" Paterno's contract is set to expire at the end of the season. Some had called for him to resign immediately because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant, who said he had seen retired defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, now 67, sexually assaulting a young boy in a shower at the campus football complex. Paterno reported the allegations to his boss. Pennsylvania's attorney general said it appeared Paterno had met his obligations under state law, but critics have said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police. Sandusky, who was arrested Saturday, is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded to help troubled youths, prosecutors said. Two Penn State officials are accused of failing to report the alleged abuse. The U.S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year. ""In addition, in certain cases, the institution must issue a timely warning if a reported crime represents a threat to the campus community,"" it said in a statement. ""If these allegations of sexual abuse are true then this is a horrible tragedy for those young boys. If it turns out that some people at the school knew of the abuse and did nothing or covered it up, that makes it even worse,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement. ""Schools and school officials have a legal and moral responsibility to protect children and young people from violence and abuse."" Athletes, fans and students grappled with implications of the widening scandal. A ""Blue Out"" will be held at Saturday's game against Nebraska. An unofficial Facebook page encouraged fans to wear blue ""to support the victims of child abuse worldwide. The Blue Ribbon Campaign against child abuse began 22 years ago and is recognized across the country. In addition to being the color of our team's home game jerseys, blue represents the color of bruises that have too often been neglected."" Sophomore linebacker Dakota Royer told CNN that Paterno told players of his retirement plans Wednesday morning during a team meeting. Many of the approximately 150 players, coaches and school officials in attendance had tears in their eyes, Royer said. Meanwhile, a tip line has been receiving calls from alleged victims of Sandusky, a source close to the investigation said, and police were attempting to verify the claims. State Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that the alleged failure of Timothy Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, to report abuse claims ""likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years."" Curley and Schultz, who are each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse, were released Monday on $75,000 bail each. Their attorneys have declared that the men are innocent. Curley and Schultz stepped down late Sunday after an emergency meeting of the university's board of trustees.The case has raised questions on how Penn State officials handled allegations. Curley's successor, acting athletics director Mark C. Sherburne, said the school is entrusted with the lives of young people. ""We are outraged that a valued trust has been broken,"" he said on Penn State's sports website Wednesday. ""We can promise you that we are doing everything in our power to restore that broken trust. Everyone within athletics -- coaches, administrators, staff and student-athletes -- are committed to this pledge."" Penn State's board of trustees said it would create a special committee to investigate the child rape allegations, which became public last week with the release of a grand jury report. The Second Mile describes itself on its website as ""a statewide, nonprofit organization for children who need additional support and who would benefit from positive human contact."" Sandusky's involvement with The Second Mile provided him with ""access to hundreds of boys, many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations,"" the grand jury said. The former coach is said to have engaged in fondling, oral and anal sex with boys over at least 15 years, according to the investigative grand jury's summary of testimony. Sandusky, who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions football team before retiring in 1999, is free on $100,000 bail. The grand jury investigation that led to the charges began with the claims of an alleged victim who said Sandusky had ""indecently assaulted"" him and engaged in sex acts while he was a guest at the coach's home, the attorney general said. The alleged victim had met Sandusky through The Second Mile, and Sandusky allegedly gave him expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games, golf clubs, a computer and money, Kelly said. The alleged abuse began in 2005 and lasted into 2008, and included overnight stays at Sandusky's home, according to Kelly and grand jury testimony. The grand jury report also cites an alleged March 2002 incident in which a graduate student reported seeing Sandusky in a locker room shower of the football building engaged in anal sex on a boy. ""Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty, a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old,"" Kelly said. The assistant reported the incident to Paterno, who, in turn, alerted Curley. Paterno said in an earlier statement that he had done his duty in informing Curley. ""It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw, but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report,"" Paterno said. ""Regardless, it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky. As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time, I referred the matter to university administrators."" But instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz took Sandusky's locker room keys and banned him from having children from The Second Mile visit the football building, Kelly said. In a statement, Paterno called the charges ""shocking."" ""While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention, like anyone else involved, I can't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred,"" he said. As the controversy swirled Wednesday, a mural depicting Penn State and State College notables reflected the feelings of many in the university community and its environs. An artist painted Sandusky out of the mural, CNN Johnstown affiliate WJAC reported. CNN's Sarah Hoye, Jason Carroll, Jason Kessler, Laura Dolan and Kiran Khalid contributed to this report.","NEW: Paterno tells students outside his house, ""It's going to take some time to get used to""

"(CNN) -- A rugby star married into British royalty has been punished for his controversial off-field antics during the recent World Cup in New Zealand. Mike Tindall was fined Â£25,000 ($40,000) Friday and expelled from England's elite squad for his conduct on September 11 in Queenstown. He said he would appeal the decisions. The 33-year-old, who married Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Phillips in July, was caught on security cameras in close conversation with another woman during a night out drinking. He later said she was a friend, but the incident erupted in the British media and disrupted England's on-field focus. ""Mike Tindall's actions reached a level of misconduct that was unacceptable in a senior England player and amounted to a very serious breach of the EPS Code of Conduct,"" England's professional rugby director Rob Andrew said in a statement Friday. ""Whilst we acknowledge his previous good character, it needs to be made clear that what he did will not be tolerated."" Tindall was a World Cup winner in 2003 and a stand-in team captain during his 11-year international career, which may now be at an end. He was one of three players found guilty of off-pitch indiscretions during a review of England's tournament, which culminated in a quarterfinal exit. Chris Ashton and James Haskell were given suspended fines of Â£5,000 ($8,000) after an incident at the team's hotel in Dunedin on September 9. Dylan Hartley, however, was cleared of being involved after they were all accused of making inappropriate comments to a female hotel worker. ""It should be stressed that the allegations of very serious wrongdoing made by Annabel Newton, a member of staff at the team hotel, were entirely false. We do not believe the players had any intention to sexually harass or intimidate Ms. Newton,"" Andrew said. ""However, the incident is precisely the kind of dangerous, compromising situation the players were warned about prior to departure for New Zealand and that they were specifically told to avoid in the Code of Conduct."" England's tournament was marred by a series of off-field incidents. The night that Tindall was seen with the woman, some of his teammates were pictured wrestling with dwarves at the same bar. Manu Tuilagi was fined after jumping into the sea from a ferry in Auckland the day after England's quarterfinal defeat by France. The Samoa-born center was also cautioned by police and criticized by head coach Martin Johnson for his actions. Tuilagi was earlier fined by tournament officials for using a non-sanctioned branded mouthguard. Two of Johnson's assistants were banned from the team's final Pool B match against Scotland for illegally switching the match ball during a 67-3 win over Romania.","Mike Tindall fined $40,000 and expelled from England's elite rugby squad .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf Monday, launching aerial strikes as part of an assault aimed at crushing the uprising against him. At the end of the third week of unrest -- protests began February 15 -- Gadhafi's aerial forces targeted the main road heading into the oil town after launching another air strike earlier, five kilometers southeast of the city. In what has turned into a civil war, members of the opposition fired anti-aircraft guns toward Gadhafi's planes. Some families fled Ras Lanuf, hoping to escape the violence that has engulfed some of the country's most populous areas. Meanwhile, U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said ""there are credible reports of the use of helicopter gunships against civilians by government forces."" Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, Britain, and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya, diplomatic sources at the United Nations said. But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China, two permanent members of the council that wield veto power. U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a ""very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi: It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there."" ""We've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options, including potential military options, in response to the violence that continues to take place inside Libya,"" he said. In a statement, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO did not intend to intervene in Libya, but ""as a defence Alliance and a security organization, it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality."" NATO has begun around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya, as it considers options for dealing with the Libyan violence, U.S. Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told reporters Monday. While the opposition has managed to fight off onslaughts by Gadhafi's forces in some places -- including what a witness described as an ""amazing"" victory against Gadhafi's heavy artillery Sunday in the town of Misrata -- the regime has advanced as well. Gadhafi's forces seemed to make headway in the city of Bin Jawad, where the Libyan army appeared to have control Monday after fighting over the weekend. But in Zawiya -- a city that the government insisted it had retaken -- the opposition still appeared to control the city center, and fighting was under way Monday. CNN saw pro-Gadhafi forces moving through the city, small arms fire, anti-aircraft gunfire and artillery. As the Libyan military brought in reinforcements, CNN could see about 150 troops moving into the city. Anti-government protesters are seeking the ouster of the 68-year-old Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. But unlike in those countries, the Libyan uprising has turned into warfare. Libya's foreign minister dug in Monday, saying the international community does not understand what is happening in Libya and accusing certain Western countries of helping divide the African nation. ""It is clear now the U.K. and the U.S. are getting in touch with the defected (people) in the East,"" Foreign Minister Musa Kasa told reporters. ""This means a conspiracy to divide, partition the country."" ""It is clear these super powers are undertaking a plot against Libya,"" he added. Though rebel groups are long on passion, many are short on military training. CNN's Ben Wedeman, just outside Ras Lanouf, heard someone say, ""We'll capture (Gadhafi), put him on top of this car and drive all around Libya. Every Libyan will get one shot."" A special forces captain told Wedeman he is trying to teach volunteers ""it's impossible to attack artillery with a Kalishnikov"" rifle. Foreign Secretary Hague, speaking to Britain's Parliament, said that in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, ""there have been disturbing reports of hostage taking and large military deployments around the city designed to consolidate Gadhafi's position and intimidate his opponents. His forces remain in control of Tripoli, Sebha and Sirte; but his authority is contested in large swathes of the country where local tribes have withdrawn their support. There is a clear risk of protracted conflict and an extremely dangerous and volatile situation in large parts of the country."" With no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli, the United Nations said in a statement Monday. ""The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the fighting in western Libya, which is claiming large numbers of lives and threatens even more carnage in the days ahead,"" read the U.N. statement. ""He notes that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence, and calls for an immediate halt to the government's disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets."" Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000, and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime. The fierce fighting has also sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave. About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the U.N. refugee agency has said. But not everyone has been able to get out. Between 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border. Of those left, the majority are from Bangladesh, the U.N. refugee agency said. The group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday. President Obama authorized Monday sending up to $15 million in humanitarian aid to Libya out of the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund. Humanitarian and medical aid to Misrata, in central Libya, has been blocked, U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday. She urged authorities ""to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives."" After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata on Sunday, Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that ""strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs, who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities."" The report cited ""military sources."" There have been numerous conflicting reports over who controlled what cities, with the government declaring victory in some cities while witnesses in those cities told CNN the opposition was still in control. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Nic Robertson, Arwa Damon, Salma Abdelaziz, Jomana Karadsheh and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama pledges $15 million in humanitarian aid .

"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- He's known to generations of football fans simply as JoePa, the hard-nosed Penn State football coach who peers through his trademark thick eyeglasses and sees something more in the young men he coaches -- and demands they see it, too. But Joe Paterno's stellar reputation has been muddied over reports of his reaction to a years-ago child sex abuse case, and he has lost his job after 46 years as a head coach. The university trustees unanimously voted to fire the iconic sports figure Wednesday night. Nittany Lions defensive coordinator Tom Bradley will serve as interim head coach. Graham Spanier, the college president, was fired as well. National outrage has percolated over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex. Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that Paterno is not a target of the investigation, which has resulted in charges against two top university officials accused of failing to report the abuse, in addition to Sandusky. But critics have said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police. Paterno, 84, said on Sunday that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. He said he had done ""what I was supposed to do."" In a later statement, he said ""with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" Sandusky, who was arrested Saturday, is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded to help troubled youth, prosecutors said. ""We don't yet know who is legally guilty,"" SI.com columnist Michael Rosenberg writes. ""But several prominent employees at the state university are morally guilty. And one of them is Joe Paterno."" Paterno has earned a reputation not only as a football wizard -- he's won more games than any other major-school coach -- but for his focus on academics and civics. He began his career at Penn State in 1950 as a 23-year-old assistant under head coach Rip Engle. Sixteen years later, he took the reins of the Nittany Lions football program, beginning a head coaching career that has netted him 409 wins, five undefeated seasons, two national titles and a spot in the College Football Hall of Fame. He also put a premium on academic achievement. Paterno contributed $3.5 million to the university in 1998, endowing faculty positions in liberal arts, architecture, landscape architecture and the university's library system, according to his biography. He also helped fund an interfaith spiritual center and a sports museum. He also has challenged his own athletes to succeed academically. His 2009 team had an 89% graduation rate, and his teams have produced dozens of academic award and scholarship winners, according to his bio. ""Coach Paterno was absolutely instrumental in my life in showing me and teaching me that there are no cutting corners,"" Tom Bill, who played quarterback at Penn State in the late 1980s and early 1990s, told CNN in 2004. Paterno became embroiled in the Sandusky saga when, in 2002, a graduate assistant came to him to report a disturbing scene he had witnessed the night before, according to a grand jury report released last week. According to the report, the assistant told Paterno that he saw Sandusky in the shower with a boy who looked to be about 10 years old. Sandusky was having sex with the child, according to the grand jury report and prosecutors. The distraught assistant ran from the building and called his father, who advised him to report the incident to Paterno, according to the grand jury and prosecutors. The next day, Paterno passed the report up to his boss, Athletic Director Tim Curley, saying -- according to the grand jury report -- that the graduate assistant had told him he had seen Sandusky ""fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy."" The reports never made it to police. Curley and another university official who learned of the 2002 incident, Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz, have been charged with failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading the grand jury investigating Sandusky's conduct. In his Sunday statement, Paterno said he did his duty in referring the allegations to his superior but said the assistant never ""related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report."" ""If this is true we were all fooled, along with scores of professionals trained in such things, and we grieve for the victims and their families,"" he said in the statement. Stewart Mandel, in an SI.com column, pondered what he sees as Paterno's complex legacy. ""No question, Paterno should be held accountable for his inaction in the Sandusky saga -- as should a whole lot of other people who had a chance to stop this tragedy. It would be an injustice to the alleged victims to ever forget Paterno's failure to prevent future crimes. But it would also be a disservice to the thousands upon thousands of lives he positively impacted if that mistake erases 46 years of good from the history books. ""We will remember Paterno both as the coach who we thought served as a moral standard-bearer for 40-plus years and as the coach who bore responsibility for a reprehensible moral breakdown at the end. Those memories are not mutually exclusive. They can coexist."" As for Penn State itself, Gene Collier, a columnist with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said the fallout from the ""Sandusky bombshell remains inestimable, particularly at its far horizons."" ""Years of criminal and civil litigation await the university's soon-to-be-overburdened attorneys, by just one example, and predicting what the institution will come to look like in the Post-Paterno Era strains the imagination,"" wrote Collier. ""Whatever its future, it's probably better than that of some still untold number of young boys who suffered soul-scorching sexual abuse that Penn State's top leadership allegedly could have prevented had it only the standard human apportionment of moral courage. You can paint over Jerry Sandusky's image on a State College mural, as an artist did Wednesday, but no artistic flourish or inspiration can begin to cover the psychological destruction he's alleged to have wrought.""","NEW: Paterno was fired Wednesday night .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek police have arrested the captain of a U.S. ship whose passengers and crew had hoped to help lead a Gaza-bound flotilla aimed at challenging Israel's maritime blockade of the Palestinian territory. John Klusmire, an American citizen and captain of The Audacity of Hope, was asked to report to a police station Saturday morning, said Jane Hirschmann, an American who is one of the flotilla organizers. A spokesperson with the Greek Coast Guard, who was not named per custom, confirmed Klusmire's arrest. The reason given was that he had left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger. He will appear before Greek prosecutors on Tuesday. Hirschmann added that, in addition to disobeying a police order, Klusmire is being charged with disturbing sea traffic. ""This is intimidation,"" she said. ""They're making an example of our captain to stop other boats in the flotilla from trying to sail."" His vessel -- which carried 36 American passengers, four crew members and several journalists, including CNN reporter Phil Black -- was intercepted Friday by a Greek Coast Guard patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed Perama. The Greek authorities were in a standoff with the crew for about three hours, during which activists sang, chanted and waved signs in support of their mission. The ordeal took a turn, however, when an inflatable boat carrying an armed Greek military commando team told the activists to follow them back to port or face being boarded. Eventually, the ship returned to Greece, where it is now tied up at a Greek naval facility. Four other crew members have been ordered by Greek authorities to stay aboard the ship, Hirschmann said. Many other activist passengers have remained on the vessel as well, in a show of solidarity. The Audacity of Hope is one of 10 ships that organizers hope to unite to form a flotilla heading toward the Middle East. The trip is partially meant to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. Nine people died in subsequent clashes with Israeli Navy commandos. The Greek government said Friday that it won't allow any of the nine other boats in the flotilla to sail to Gaza because their mission is too dangerous. Flotilla members accuse the Greek government of buckling to pressure from Israel's government. For their part, the Israelis have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all. On Tuesday, the Israeli government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill Israeli military personnel should their boats be boarded. They alleged that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on Israeli commandos. Flotilla organizer Medea Benjamin dismissed the allegations as ludicrous, saying: ""They see this nonviolent, rag-tag group of ships as such a threat they're using their entire propaganda apparatus, and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists. It's pathetic."" The Middle East Quartet -- composed of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia -- on Saturday issued a joint statement asking ""all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas, which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation."" The Quartet added in its statement that it ""strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings."" Doing so, the group contends, is the best way to both help Palestinians and address Israel's ""legitimate security concerns."" Journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: The Quartet urges all governments to discourage additional flotillas .

"(CNN) -- American Webb Simpson has spoken about his delight at securing his first PGA Tour victory at the Wyndham Championship in his native North Carolina. Simpson, who caddied for his compatriot Neal Lancaster at a Pro-Am event ahead of the Greensboro tournament when he was a teenager, finished on 18-under-par, three-shots clear of fellow-American George McNeill. ""I really couldn't think of a better place to win than here in Greensboro,"" the 26-year-old told the PGA Tour's official web site. Simpson carded a bogey-free final round to seal his triumph and move into third position in the standings for the season-ending Fedex Cup. ""That was probably the most fun 18 holes I've ever been a part of,"" he said of Sunday's round. ""When I made the putt on 15, I asked my caddie for the first time all day, `Where do we stand?' and he said, `We're two ahead right now.' ""I knew I needed to play solid golf on the last three holes, and to birdie 16 was so huge. ... I knew I had a three-shot lead on 18, and as soon as I hit the ball in play, I knew it was probably over."" McNeill's final round of 64 was only enough to get him to 15-under, but the 35-year-old was satisfied with his form during the competition. ""I can only control myself,"" McNeill said. ""I can't control what everybody else does. I'm very happy with the way I hit it, the way I played, the way I putted."" Former world number one and three-time major winner Vijah Singh finished in a five-way tie for fourth position, one-shot behind American Tommy Gainey on 14-under. Level with Singh were U.S. duo Jerry Kelly and Charles Howell III, South Korea's Kyung-tae Kim and Carl Pettersson of Sweden. Jim Furyk, ranked 26 in the world, finished alongside Colombian Camilo Villegas and Chez Reavie in ninth place on 12-under-par.","Webb Simpson clinched his first PGA Tour title at the Wyndham Championship .

"(CNN)  -- American Tommy Gainey led by three shots at the halfway stage of the Wyndham Championship at Greater Greensboro with South African star Ernie Els in the four-strong chasing group. Gainey carded a five-under par 65 Friday for a 12-under total of 128, with Els sharing second on nine-under with Australian Stewart Appleby, Daniel Summerhays and Webb Simpson. Els is battling for a tournament win but also to clinch his place in the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs which start next week. He is currently 126th in the standings, with only the top 125 to qualify so three birdies in five holes on his back nine on the way to a 66 helped his cause. ""I've got quite a large goal for me this week, and you know, I'm feeling like, fine, my game is turning around a little bit,"" Els told the official PGA Tour website. Four players shared sixth on 132, Jim Furyk (67), Brazil's Alexandre Rocha (66), England's Paul Casey (67) and South African Retief Goosen (65). Gainey, who is chasing his first win on the PGA Tour, was still not satisfied as he followed his opening 63 with a 65. ""I hit it worse today than I did yesterday off the tee. I hit my irons worse than I did yesterday,"" he said. But only the remarkable 125 of Sweden's Carl Pettersson in 2008 has bettered Gainey's score on the par-70 Sedgefield course. Colombian Camilo Villegas, 125th on the FedEx list, went a long way to wrapping up his place at The Barclays next week with a 64 for 134. But three-time major champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland, 130th in the rankings, has work to do as he birdied two of his last four holes for a 68 to make the cut at three-under 137. Defending Wyndham champion Arjun Atwal of India will not be playing the weekend after missing the cut, while joint first round leader Jeff Quinney carded a level-par 70 to fall five behind Gainey.","Tommy Gainey leads at halfway stage of Wyndham Championship .

"(CNN) -- Mark Foster fired a six-under-par 66 in foggy conditions to lead the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles and keep his Seve Trophy hopes alive. The 36-year-old Englishman is keen to take part in the team tournament, named after Spanish legend Seve Ballesteros, when Britain and Ireland take on Continental Europe in September. Foster beat Tiger Woods in the amateur Walker Cup 16 years ago and his impressive round in Scotland kept him on course for a return to team competition. ""I've been trying hard all year to make it and if it comes around it will be a massive thing for me,"" he told the European Tour's official web site. Foster fired eight birdies and two bogeys in foggy conditions to lead by a shot from Spaniard Ignacio Garrido and Tano Goya, from Argentina. Foster came close to winning both the BMW International and French Open in recent months and lost out on the 2010 Open de Espana by dropping two shots in the final two holes. ""I learned a lot from that,"" he said. ""I would say I lost that tournament through nerves really, just not controlling myself. ""But I think it took that week for me to be able to play the way I've been playing at the moment, where I have more belief in myself and know I can do it. I think I'm a better person and a better player."" Play began over two hours later than scheduled because of the fog, meaning not all of the field managed to finish their opening round. Garrido did, though, and was pleased to be sitting just one off the lead. He said: ""I think anything under par around here is a good score. Today the course is playing long, with all of the rain, the ball was running nothing, so it was quite long. ""I think the key was that I played very solid, just hit most of the fairways, most of the greens, and took my chances. I never really got in trouble and that's probably what is the main thing to do here."" Europe's 2010 Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie finished on one-under while Jose Maria Olazabal, who will take over the role in 2012, ended on one-over.","England's Mark Foster leads the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- War forced tens of thousands of Somalis to flee their capital, Mogadishu. Famine is bringing them back. Hungry and sick Somalis are trekking from their homes in famine-struck southern areas in search of food, water and medicine. More than 50,000, by a July 18 United Nations count, have arrived in Mogadishu, a city destroyed by two decades of conflict. The United Nations refugee agency called it an ""unprecedented influx"" into a city that was notorious for exodus. The people are arriving in a city where the sound of gunfire became as common as the start of a car engine; where tales of dismemberment and executions and other heinous deeds emanate from neighborhoods shut off from any form of governance. What has caused the East Africa crisis? It is exceedingly difficult to deliver aid in Mogadishu. Yet, people who have nothing left to lose hope to get lucky at feeding camps set up by Islamic charities and the United Nations' food agency. World Food Programme Executive Director Josette Sheeran acknowledged the dire need to get food supplies into southern Somalia, where the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab recently lifted a ban on aid agencies. The WFP will ratchet up its efforts and begin airlifting food within days to try and reach 2.2 million people in the south, Sheeran said. In Mogadishu, the vast feeding camps are teeming with people, mostly women and children. Huma Isaac is over 80 years old -- she did not know her exact age -- and traveled 400 kilometers to reach a Mogadishu feeding camp. She felt lucky that she had been able to hitch a ride part of the way. Many people made the entire journey on foot. Isaac's husband died from starvation, she said. That's why she felt compelled to return to the city she had once fled in an effort to keep her children alive. Desperate women stormed a CNN reporter's car in the city. ""Please help us,"" one pleaded. ""I am sick."" A weak U.N.-backed transitional government controls parts of Mogadishu. Elsewhere, Al-Shabaab is king. The two sides have been locked in a bitter, brutal battle for control in this impoverished Horn of Africa nation, one of the factors that led the United Nations to declare famine. International aid agencies have been asking for help for months as the worst drought in half a century caused crops to fail and killed livestock. The international anti-poverty confederation Oxfam blamed donor nations for turning away from Somalia's plight. Stories from East Africa's famine . Another country might have been able to cope better, but a perfect storm brewed in Somalia, said Patrick Webb, a food security expert with the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. ""It's not one thing or another that has gone wrong,"" Webb said. ""This represents catastrophic failure of all the systems that people rely on to survive."" But getting food to the people is an enormous challenge in the country widely recognized as a failed state by all social and economic indicators. ""We are faced with hundreds of thousands of people on the verge of starvation but there is no central authority we can negotiate with to get access to those people,"" said Joel Charny, vice president for humanitarian policy and practice at InterAction, an alliance of U.S. aid agencies. At one time, global agencies were able to operate in Mogadishu, but an escalation of violence in recent years prompted most of them to flee. And besides the obvious security risks, trust became a problem, Charny said. In other nations, he said, aid agencies were able to negotiate their ability to work in an area, to get permission to have direct access to the people in need. He stopped just short of calling Somalia anarchic but said that aid workers could get few assurances that any deal would stick. And, many aid organizations have to fight local perceptions that they are there to enforce the United States' counterterror agenda. ""It's difficult to establish the trust you need to work,"" Charny said. Al-Shabaab has been far less hostile to Islamic charities. The Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation hopes to bring in more aid groups under its umbrella, and an OIC delegation visited Mogadishu Wednesday to discuss delivery of more food and bridging the aid gap. Even though Mogadishu is one of the hardest places to get aid, people are flocking to the city in the midst of the worst food crisis in decades. ""The situation is very severe, the conditions are very harsh,"" said Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the Somali president. ""We are requesting that the international community assist the Somalis, those within Somalia and the borders. We urgently request quick help."" At one feeding camp, Amina, only 6 months old, was next to 2-year-old Bakr, who is too weak to stand, waiting for something to stop the ache in their bellies. The line behind them was growing steadily longer.","The United Nations has declared a famine in southern Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Golfers preparing for The Barclays FedEx Cup playoff event at Plainfield Country Club in New Jersey found themselves not only battling the course, but also the effects of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake which struck Virginia on Tuesday. The quake forced the closure of a nuclear power plant and was felt from as far afield as Georgia and New England, while also causing many PGA Tour players to post their reactions on the social-networking site Twitter. American world number 15 Bubba Watson used his @bubbawatson account to tweet: ""This house we rented just shook!"" Watson's compatriot Jason Dufner, who finished tied for 5th at the recent PGA Championship, also tweeted his shock after feeling the tremors: ""Earthquake in Jersey?

"(CNN) -- Niger's president is standing by his country's decision to offer amnesty to one of the late Moammar Gadhafi's sons, saying he is entitled to stay in his nation like other ""Libyan refugees."" President Mahamadou Issoufou addressed reporters Friday, reaffirming his stance on Saadi Gadhafi, whom Libya wants returned home to stand trial. ""The attitude of the Niger government regarding this has already been noted: We have already welcomed Libyan refugees for humanitarian reasons,"" Issoufou said. ""Of these, one is a son of (Moammar) Gadhafi -- Saadi Gadhafi."" Interpol has issued arrest warrant -- known as a ""red notice"" -- for Saadi Gadhafi, requesting his provisional arrest ahead of his extradition or surrender to an international court. The warrant accuses him of ""misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he headed the Libyan Football Federation."" His lawyer, Nick Kaufman, told CNN earlier this month that his client ""strenuously denies the charges made against him."" Kaufman said he's asked the Interpol secretary general to revoke the warrant, claiming that it is politically motivated and was sought by a new Libyan leadership that lacks legitimacy. Saadi Gadhafi is in Niger, the landlocked West African nation bordering Libya. His father and three brothers have been killed and one more brother, Saif al-Islam, remains in hiding. His other siblings, meanwhile, escaped to Algeria during the months-long conflict in their native Libya. Saif al-Islam is also wanted by Interpol, as well as the International Criminal Court. As a party to that court, Niger would be obligated to turn Saif al-Islam over should he be detained within its borders.","Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou addresses reporters .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000-strong crowd in Berlin, German newspapers agreed, but suspicions remain about the White House contender's motives for courting a European audience. Barack Obama addressed a huge and friendly crowd in Berlin on Thursday. Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in Germany and said that Obama's address -- which echoed speeches by former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan when the divided city was in the Cold War frontline -- could only have been made in the German capital. ""Barack Obama's address might not have been statesmanlike and it definitely wasn't worldly-wise. But with its symbolism and the message of this 46-year-old, it certainly was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the Atlantic,"" the newspaper said. ""What better thing could have happened to us than the potential next president of the U.S. sending this message to the world from here?"" Obama moved on from Germany to France on Friday where he was due to hold talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy. He is also slated to meet British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and opposition leader David Cameron in London later Friday. German tabloid Bild said Obama had articulated his version of the American dream -- the idea that politics can change the world: ""Unlike George W. Bush, he wants to do this in cooperation with others, especially Europe. That's his message from Berlin: Let's try this together!"" But Bild warned that an Obama presidency would place fresh demands on traditional allies such as Germany, which fell out with Washington over the war in Iraq and has refused to contribute combat troops to NATO operations in Afghanistan. iReport.com: View photos from the scene . ""He didn't say what he expects, but it's not hard to figure it out. He'll call for more German participation during international crises; he'll call for more German soldiers,"" said Bild. But it concluded: ""No matter how you might feel about this: A President Obama would be Germany's friend -- and a fan of Berlin!"" Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung sounded a more cautious note, warning that an Obama presidency would be ""expensive for Germany."" ""He explicitly called for German soldiers for Afghanistan -- he did not say 'more soldiers' but that was what he meant,"" said commentator Reymer Kluever. ""And Obama also indicated this: he will want support as president to wind up the Iraq adventure."" The paper noted too that the speech had been intended less for the crowds gathered in Berlin's Tiergarten park than for ""hesitant white voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia"" and said that Obama had proved himself to be a clever tactician, capable of shifting positions to suit his audience. ""He wants to convince (voters) that the world will also listen to a black president... And there's one other thing one shouldn't forget when talking about Obama: He easily reworks even positions that have been written in stone and adjusts to new requirements."" But nobody in the German press appears to have been quite as smitten by their visitor as Bild reporter Judith Bonesky, who had the opportunity to work out with Obama in the gym of the Ritz Carlton Hotel earlier in the day. ""Obama (with toned arms and a strong back) puts on his headphones for his iPod to listen to pop music. He hums quietly. Then he jumps on a fitness bike. He pushes three times on the pedals -- but then can't be bothered with it. ""He picks up a pair of 16 kilo weights and starts curling them with his left and right arms, 30 repetitions on each side. Then, amazingly, he picks up the 32 kilo weights! Very slowly he lifts them, first 10 curls with his right, then 10 with his left. Quickly I ask: ""Mr. Obama, could I take a photo?"". ""Of course!"" he answers, before asking my name and coming over to stand next to me. ""My name's Judith"" I reply. ""I'm Barack Obama, nice to meet you!"" he says, and puts his arm across my shoulder. I put my arm around his hip -- wow, he didn't even sweat! WHAT A MAN!""","German papers agree that Barack Obama won hearts with Berlin speech .

"(CNN) -- How much would it cost to save tigers from extinction in the wild? Thirty-five million more dollars a year. Some perspective on this amount: Thirty-five million dollars is less than soccer star David Beckham earns annually. Surely, a world that sustains great athletes with princely sums can also afford to save this princely beast. It's zero hour for tigers. In the past century, the world's wild tiger population has fallen by a staggering 97 percent -- from an estimated 100,000 to an all-time low of 3,200 animals. Of these, only 1,000 are breeding females. Tigers are threatened across their entire range, from India to the Russian Far East. They face a triple threat: Poachers kill them for their pelts and body parts, hunters kill their prey, and development encroaches on their habitat. Tiger extinction would be the stuff of great tragedy. But hopes for averting such disaster may emerge from a summit happening this week in St. Petersburg, Russia. Called together by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, conservationists, donors and leaders of all 13 tiger range states may decide the fate of tigers in the wild. The Wildlife Conservation Society and its partners in big cat conservation have devised a strategy that offers the summit a practical plan of action to reverse the decline of tigers and put the population on a course for recovery. (This is where the $35 million comes in; more on that in a moment.) This fall, the Wildlife Conservation Society published a peer-reviewed study identifying 42 ""source sites"" across the natural range of tigers in Asia, where viable populations of breeding tigers now exist. The paper was co-authored by conservationists from organizations including the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the Global Environment Facility, Panthera, the World Bank and numerous other partners. The study suggests that managing and financing activities like law enforcement and training in these breeding areas will protect tiger populations and allow them to repopulate larger landscapes. Implementing this plan would be straightforward. Instead of spreading conservation efforts thinly across large landscapes, the focus would shift to source sites. These are where 70 percent of the world's tigers live in just 6 percent of their current range. For example, there are 18 source sites in India, eight in Indonesia, six in Russia, three in both Malaysia and Nepal, two in Thailand and one in both Laos and Bangladesh. Protecting these sites would halt the decline in tigers and allow populations to recover. Can it be done? In fact, something similar is being done in southwest India in one of the most densely populated places on earth. In the Western Ghats of Karnataka sits Nagarahole National Park, where the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Indian government and local communities have worked together for 20 years, joining first-rate science to public action. Trained enforcement teams have deployed to protect both tigers and their prey from such threats as poaching and habitat loss. Voluntary resettlement to shift people away from protected areas and the cooperation of those who live in local villages have meant a 400 percent increase in tiger numbers from fewer than 20 to nearly 70. Evidence of range state commitment to the strategy on the table at the summit is clear. More than half the $82 million that would be required for the effort each year is already committed by governments, international donors and non-governmental organizations. But there is still a $35 million annual shortfall, and this is all that stands between the tiger and its two possible futures: extinction or robust survival across Asia. The hopes and risks could not be clearer at the St. Petersburg summit. Putin and other world leaders can leave a great legacy. In our collective role as stewards of our planet, we cannot fail. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Sanderson and the Wildlife Conservation Society.","Steven Sanderson of Wildlife Conservation Society says tiger population has plummeted .

"New York (CNN) -- A leading Muslim-American group lashed out at the federal government Friday for moving to seize assets -- including four mosques -- that belong to a foundation and a corporation believed linked to Iran. ""The American Muslim and faith communities must not allow houses of worship to become pawns in geopolitical struggles,"" said Imam Mahdi Bray, executive director of the Muslim American Society's Freedom Foundation. ""The tension between the United States and Iran must not be played out in the mosques of America."" Federal prosecutors say their actions against assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation and the Assa Corp., which also include a Manhattan skyscraper, are not an effort to target mosques. ""There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants,"" said Yusill Scribner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in a written statement Thursday. ""The tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today's filing."" A senior Justice Department official told reporters that the government is moving against the Iranian landlords of the buildings, not seizing mosques as religious-oriented facilities. The mosques -- in New York, Maryland, California and Texas -- just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question, the official said. But the Muslim American Society's Freedom Foundation called the actions an ""unprecedented encroachment of religious freedom."" The group said ""it is an abiding concern among the American Muslim community that this action is just the beginning of a backlash after last week's Fort Hood shooting tragedy."" A Muslim-American soldier is accused in a Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree that left 13 people dead and dozens injured. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, another leading Muslim-American group, issued a statement Thursday saying the government's actions may have First Amendment implications. ""Whatever the details of the government's case against the owners of the mosques, as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, the national communications director for the council. The controversy erupted after prosecutors in New York filed an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of all assets of the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp. They include properties owned by the foundation in several states. A 36-story office tower in midtown Manhattan is owned by the 650 Fifth Avenue Company, a partnership between Alavi and Assa, the Justice Department said. The complaint alleges that the Alavi Foundation provided services to the Iranian government and transferred money from 650 Fifth Avenue Company to Bank Melli, Iran's largest state-owned financial entity. U.S. and European Union officials last year designated Bank Melli as a proliferator for supporting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force, considered terrorist groups by the United States. Bank Melli issued a statement last year denying involvement in deceptive banking practices. Prosecutors allege the properties at issue were ""involved in and [were] the proceeds of money laundering offenses,"" and that the owners violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, executive orders and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations. ""As today's complaint alleges in great detail, the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Thursday. ""For two decades, the Alavi Foundation's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials, including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations, in violation of a series of American laws. The Alavi Foundation's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice, and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing."" John Winter, a New York lawyer representing the Alavi Foundation, said his client would challenge the complaint. ""We're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter,"" he said. ""It may take some time, but at the end of this litigation, we're of the mind that we're going to prevail here."" The buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual. When a CNN reporter arrived at one of the seized mosques -- in Queens, a New York City borough -- he found it to be operating normally. There was a copy of the federal complaint taped to the front door of the building, but the doors were open and people were coming and going. Calls to the Iranian Mission for comment were not immediately returned. A report Friday on the Web site of Iran's state-run Press TV did not contain any responses from Iranian officials. CNN's Terry Frieden, Brian Todd, Deb Feyerick, Eddie DeMarche and Ross Levitt contributed to this story.","Group says houses of worship should not be ""pawns in geopolitical struggles""

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's overseas trip has generated a lot more buzz than John McCain's foreign travels, but when it comes to popularity abroad, both candidates have their strengths. Sen. Barack Obama's trip to the Middle East and Europe has attracted heavy media attention. McCain is more of a familiar face among Europe's politicians. The senator from Arizona is better known because he's met with a lot of foreign leaders and has been active in conferences overseas, said Robin Niblett, a London, England-based international affairs analyst. But European lawmakers said McCain's experience could work against him because of the association with President Bush and the war in Iraq. Obama, on the other hand, is more of a fresh face abroad; the trip is his first since sewing up the Democratic nomination in June. It's his first visit to Afghanistan and first to Iraq in two years. In addition to Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama has passed through Kuwait since leaving the United States on Thursday. He's expected to visit Jordan and Israel before making a European swing through Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The novelty of Obama's trip increases the media attention because the storyline is more interesting, according to Michael Crowley, senior editor of The New Republic.  Watch: Is Obama's trip getting too much coverage? » . ""When McCain goes overseas, it's sort of 'dog bites man.' There's not really that much of an interesting angle to it,"" Crowley said Sunday on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""This is an incredible story, the first African-American nominee going abroad after a long period of anti-Americanism, promising a new start and a new direction for the country. There's so many fascinating angles, whereas McCain is sort of offering somewhat more of a continuation of what we already know."" Although Obama is making his trip abroad as a senator from Illinois and not a presidential candidate, the tour is aimed at boosting his foreign policy credentials. His trip has produced several high-profile photo ops, including pictures of Obama with American troops and with leaders such as Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. All three of the major U.S. broadcast networks' anchors -- Katie Couric, Charlie Gibson and Brian Williams -- are set to cover Obama from overseas. ""What that means, of course, is that the 'CBS Evening News,' 'NBC Nightly News' and ABC's 'World News' will be broadcast from Europe and the Middle East this week, throwing an even brighter spotlight on Barack's [Obama's] excellent adventure,"" said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" McCain, however, was met by zero anchors on his foreign trips since he became the presumptive Republican nominee, Kurtz pointed out. A recent poll from Britain's Guardian newspaper and ICM Research suggests that Obama is five times as popular as McCain there. Conducted this month, the poll indicates that 53 percent think Obama would make the better president, compared with 11 percent for McCain. The remaining 36 percent declined to express a preference. The survey, conducted July 9-10, questioned 1,009 adults and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Back in the United States, Obama leads McCain by a much smaller margin: 47 percent to 41 percent, according to CNN's latest ""poll of polls."" The poll of polls includes five surveys: Gallup (July 12-14), CBS/The New York Times (July 7-14), ABC/The Washington Post (July 10-13), Quinnipiac (July 8-13) and Newsweek (July 9-10).

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Insurgents apparently tied to al Qaeda attacked a checkpoint in western Baghdad and killed five police officers early Tuesday, officials said. In the eastern city of Kut, meanwhile, at least 20 people were killed and 50 wounded when a bomb in a parked car exploded at a busy outdoor market, according to officials at the interior ministry. Health ministry officials, however, said three people died and 62 were wounded in the Kut bombing. Two other car bombs were defused by Iraqi security forces about half an hour after the first explosion, interior officials said. Such attacks have been uncommon in Kut, the provincial capital of the predominantly Shiite province of Wasit. The gunmen in Baghdad, who police officials said used pistols equipped with silencers, left behind a black flag, which is used to represent the Islamic State of Iraq. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. The same flag was left behind by insurgents after they attacked several security checkpoints and killed at least 16 people in a neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad last week. The Islamic State of Iraq also claimed responsibility for last week's suicide attack on a television station in Iraq that killed at least six people and wounded 20. Police officials said another officer was wounded Tuesday after a bomb attached to his vehicle exploded in the Hurriya district in northwestern Baghdad. Two bystanders also were injured, police said. Separately, three roadside bombs exploded in two neighborhoods in the Iraqi capital Tuesday, wounding six people. Also, two mortar rounds landed in the Mansour district in western Baghdad, damaging a building, and two more mortar rounds struck Baghdad's international zone Tuesday. Overall, violence in Iraq has dropped drastically over the past two years compared with the height of the sectarian war in 2006 and 2007, but bloodshed continues. The country is at a critical period as U.S. officials continue with plans to end America's combat mission and draw down troops to reach 50,000 by the end of August. According to the security agreement between the United States and Iraq, all American forces are scheduled to leave the country by the end of next year. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","A car bomb explodes in the Shiite city of Kut .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- UK businesses, already hurting from a recession, were counting the cost Monday of the country's worst snowstorm in almost two decades, as a crippled transport system left commuters stranded, offices semi-deserted and airlines grounded. Pedestrians cross the Thames in front of St Paul's Cathedral in London's financial district. At least 20 percent of the workforce nationwide, or 6.4 million employees, failed to make it into work Monday morning, according to an estimate by the Federation of Small Businesses. But the figure was estimated to be far higher -- around 40 percent -- in London and southeast England, which is home to around a fifth of all British businesses. FSB spokesman Stephen Alambritis told CNN the cost of Monday's disruptions would likely reach £1.2 billion ($1.7 billion). With further snowfalls forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday, that figure was likely to rise, he warned . ""It's pretty bad out there and throughout the whole of the UK,"" Alambritis said. ""The blow to the economy should be lightened by the fact that people can work via internet and laptops. But what we are seeing is economic activity reduced, contracts not being signed, invoices not being sent out and meetings being canceled."" Douglas McWilliams, Chief Executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research warned that up to 3,000 businesses could go bankrupt as a result of short-term cashflow problems caused by the weather. ""Many of the businesses that are close to failing are in the retail and construction sectors that are likely to be most affected by the snow and transport disruption,"" McWilliams said in a statement. Alambritis said that the disruption would also damage the UK's reputation as a place to do business and called for the government and local authorities to invest in infrastructural improvements to cope with freak weather. ""It gives the UK a bad name if there's a bit of snow and the whole economy grounds to a halt,"" he said. ""Why is it that in Canada, New Zealand and Scandinavia they have these snowfalls and everything carries on?"" In the City, financial markets were running at 50 percent capacity in early trading with just 120 million shares changing hands by 0910 GMT, according to David Buik of BGC Partners. But a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange told CNN later that trading had not been too badly affected, with most trading automated at the big firms. Airlines were expected to be particularly badly hit with hundreds of flights canceled or severely delayed from airports in the southeast as Heathrow and Stansted were forced to shutdown runways. Budget airline Ryanair, which operates out of Stansted, canceled more than 100 flights and said stranded passengers could book a new flight free of charge. But some businesses were enjoying an unexpected boost from the chaos. With bus and rail links down across London, taxi firms were reporting surging demand. Keith Cain, the control room manager for Dial-a-Cab, the city's biggest taxi company, said the firm had been receiving more than 5,000 calls an hour, mostly from companies trying to get their employees to their desks. Hotels near Heathrow Airport also reported being overwhelmed by stranded passengers seeking rooms for the night.","UK crippled by heavy snow; economic cost estimated to reach $1.7 billion .

"(CNN)  -- Young Portuguese rider Alberto Rui Costa was rewarded for his bravery in taking part in a long breakaway as he won the eighth stage of the Tour de France in Super-Besse Saturday. The 24-year-old was in a group which went away virtually from the start of the 189km leg from Aiguirande but still had the strength in an uphill finish to hold off the chasers. Stage one winner Belgian Philippe Gilbert burst out of a whittled down peloton containing all the main yellow jersey contenders to finish 12 seconds behind Rui Costa. As the breakaway group fragmented, Movistar's Rui Costa took advantage to pull clear, but he came under pressure from Astana's Alexandre Vinokourov who raced out of the peloton to catch all the early leaders bar the eventual winner. Kazakhstan's Vinokourov got within 15 seconds of him, but then ran out of steam and was caught by the main group by the finish. Norway's Thor Hushovd, who was expected to lose the yellow jersey on a tough stage in the Massif Central, upset predictions to cling on to the race lead by one second from Australian Cadel Evans. Reigning champion Alberto Contador and last year's runner-up Andy Schleck were also prominent in the final 1.5km steep uphill drag to Super-Besse, but it was the impressive Evans of BMC who led them home, three seconds down on Gilbert. ""I didn't get the jersey but for us it's not a problem right now. As I keep saying, there's a long way to go to Paris,"" Evans, twice a runner-up, in 2007 and 2008, told AFP.

"(CNN) -- Although most Swedes would be too modest to say so themselves, Stockholm can stake a decent claim to being the capital of Scandinavia. Built on 14 islands, Stockholm seems to float on water. Built on 14 islands where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea, Stockholm is a soft-hued vision of light and water, the bewitching start to an archipelago of some 24,000 islands and islets. Sweden's neutrality during World War II means Stockholm was spared the bombing inflicted on most European capitals; the result is the unspoiled old town of Gamla Stan, with its winding, cobbled streets. Despite a post-war building blitz that saw the construction of some particularly uninspiring modernist architecture, it is a city where gray concrete facades are largely eschewed in favor of a smorgasbord of pastel colors, rusty reds and glowing ochres. For a capital city it's unusually green -- not just leafy and dotted with verdant parks, but environmentally sound. Stockholm proper has a population of just 800,000, avoiding the congestion and pollution that plague larger cities -- so much so that you can fish from, and swim in, the waters surrounding the city center. Cold and sometimes bleak during its long, dark winters, Stockholm comes alive during the summer, when the Scandinavian sun barely sets. As temperatures rise the city's cafe culture blossoms, only for Stockholm to become a ghost town during July, when the locals make the most of their generous holiday entitlement and slip off to holiday cottages in the archipelago. But beyond its historic heart Stockholm is a progressive, evolving city. Its financial fortunes grew with the mid '90s IT boom and shrank when the dotcom bubble burst, but it remains a hotbed of technology and communications companies. Watch ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . Around 20 percent of the residents of greater Stockholm are of foreign descent, giving a sense of cultural diversity -- not to mention some welcome variety to the city's thriving restaurant scene. Despite Sweden's largely anti-EU stance, Stockholm is cosmopolitan and outward looking, with a keen eye for the latest international trends. Its shops are filled with the latest in functional, minimalist Swedish design and there are enough boutiques boasting hip New York brands and cool Swedish labels to indulge Stockholmers' obsession with style. It's also the city where Swedish global exports H&M and IKEA have their flagship stores. For all its picture-postcard pleasantness and progressive civic planning, Stockholm can seem a little sterile. It's not the kind of place likely to be described as ""edgy."" Stockholmers themselves can come across as standoffish, but that's not say that they are unfriendly -- just politely reserved. Small talk is regarded with a certain suspicion meaning the locals can be hard to get to know, but it's amazing what a difference a couple of glasses of akvavit can make. Puritan legal regulations mean that high-alcohol drinks (that's anything with more than 3.5 percent alcohol) are heavily taxed and can only be bought in bars and government-run ""Systembolaget"" shops. The result is that a night on the town is expensive enough to make anyone teetotal, with Stockholmers often avoiding midweek drinking, saving their krona for weekend partying. But what Stockholm lacks in grit it more than makes up for in style. From its artfully designed coffee shops to the classic contours of its baroque and rococo buildings, this island city is endlessly pleasing to behold, especially when viewed from the water that flows like blood through its veins.","From artfully designed cafes to baroque buildings, Stockholm exudes cool .

"(CNN) -- The United States is providing millions of dollars to fund the trial of Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president charged with war crimes for his alleged role in a civil war that killed tens of thousands. Taylor is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone that led to widespread murder, rape and mutilation. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that include five counts of crimes against humanity and five counts of war crimes. Taylor is on trial at the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. United Nations officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up a special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. Washington said it expedited the $4.5 million grant because the court is facing a financial crisis, and the U.S. urged the international community to donate to the court before its financial resources run out. ""By all calculations, the court would have run out of money by early December, which could have jeopardized the continuation of the Charles Taylor trial before the court reached a verdict,"" the State Department said in a news release Tuesday. Officials moved the trial from the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown because of concerns it would spark instability in the region. It's the first time an African head of state has faced mass atrocities and war crimes charges at an international tribunal. ""The Taylor prosecution delivers a strong message to all perpetrators of atrocities, including those in positions of power, that they will be held accountable,"" the State Department said. Prosecutors allege that Taylor, who was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003, fueled the lengthy civil war that killed tens of thousands using riches from a diamond trade. The so-called blood diamonds are mined in war zones to support rebels and warlords. Blood diamonds have fueled bloody conflicts in Africa for more than a decade. The trial has included testimony from actress Mia Farrow and supermodel Naomi Campbell. In August, Campbell testified that Taylor gave her ""dirty-looking"" uncut diamonds in 1997 as a gift. Prosecutors were hoping her testimony would tie him to blood diamonds. The trial opened in 2007, but Taylor boycotted the first session. It's expected to end by next year, and the appeals process could end by 2012, according to the State Department.","Washington says it expedited the $4.5 million grant because court is in a financial crisis .

"STRASBOURG, France (CNN) -- With his navy blue suit jacket and gray-tinged hair, Christian Engstrom barely stands out from the sea of delegates seated in the European parliament. Christian Engstrom, deputy leader of Sweden's Pirate Party, is an elected member of the European parliament. Yet the 49-year old Swede is a politician with a difference -- he is the world's first democratically elected Internet pirate, and the leader of a growing international movement that Hollywood sees as a major threat to its movie-profit ""treasure chest."" In April of this year the Pirate Party gained international notoriety during a much publicized Stockholm court case, in which the founders of a file sharing site, The Pirate Bay, were given jail sentences and ordered to pay a fine to the entertainment industry. The much publicized tribunal and its verdict helped the Pirate Party (which is not affiliated with The Pirate Bay) ride a wave of popular support that saw its membership total triple from 14,000 to 42,000. In June these figures translated into electoral support, as the single-issue party reeled in 7.1 percent of Sweden's vote in the European elections, securing one of the country's 18 seats in parliament. According to Engstrom, who is the party's deputy leader, their goal in Brussels is now to ""ensure that Europe chooses a better road into the information society."" The party's ultimate aim is to deregulate copyright, abolish the patent system and decrease online surveillance. Party members hold up Linux, the free operating system, and Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, as examples of what has been achieved through collaboration on the Internet, even though the trend is still in its infancy. Engstrom, a former computer software programmer, believes the Internet's freedoms and participatory culture are under threat. ""Things have been going in the wrong direction -- more surveillance, more control of everything we do on the net and also stricter copyright laws -- that's the wrong course for Europe,"" Engstrom told CNN. ""We want to set a new one.""  Watch CNN's chat with Engstrom » . The prospect of reforming Internet laws has found particular resonance among younger voters. According to polls, nearly one in five Swedes under the age of 30 voted for The Pirate Party. Watch The Screening Room's piracy special online . The international film industry, on the other hand, is less than thrilled with the Pirate Party's objectives. They say global piracy is looting billions of dollars of their hard-earned profits every year. A Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) study from 2006 suggested that pirate ""booty"" amounted to more than $6 billion worldwide. In the UK, campaign group Respect for Film says $818 million (£500 million) is lost to piracy annually. Since the early 1980s the major Hollywood movie studios, represented by the MPAA, have fought hard to eliminate piracy -- both in the form of bootlegging, and more recently online file sharing. Punishments for file-sharers have ranged from fines and Internet bans to jail time. ""They have approached [piracy] in a very stupid way,"" Engstrom told CNN. ""They're alienating their customers, despite the fact that they are making more money than ever. Hollywood had its best year ever [in terms of box office revenues] in 2008, so why are they complaining? I can't understand that."" Members of the film industry contend that arguments like these don't tell the whole story. Lavinia Carey of Respect for Film says that while box office earnings may appear strong, DVD sales are suffering. ""If a box office success is trumpeted in the media on the opening weekend, it makes the public think that copyright theft isn't actually doing any harm,"" Carey told CNN. ""But very often cinemas are just a showcase for the more profitable end of the market, which includes DVD sales and sales to television companies."" According to Carey, the slump in subsidiary sales has had a domino effect on the entire industry. ""Employment is affected, people who are actually making movies are affected, and in the long term the consumer will suffer because we won't have the high-quality content in the future that we have come to expect,"" she said. Engstrom and his fellow pirates feel little compassion for this line of argument. ""That's the way life is when you're running a business,"" Engstrom told CNN. ""Things change, technology changes and the business environment changes. Successful businesses adapt rather than whine."" Should file sharing be legalized or it is nothing more than theft? Tell us below in the SoundOff box or join in the discussion on CNN's Facebook page . Engstrom's views appear to be striking a chord with young activists across Europe. Since its foundation in 2006, the Swedish Pirate Party has inspired officially registered sister parties in six countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, France and Spain. Germany's ""Piratenpartei"" is the second largest, having snared nearly one percent of the German vote during the European elections. While Engstrom is proud of his party's influence, he is not surprised by its swift achievements. ""It's been three and a half years working constantly on it, on a daily basis. To someone from the outside it may look like we just appeared, but it's not like that to us."" With an armada of pirate parties forming across the continent, the movement looks to set sail into what Engstrom hopes will be a bright future. ""It's now that the pirate movement begins. It's now that we want to reform first Europe and then hopefully the world.""","Christian Engstrom is the world's first democratically-elected Internet pirate .

"(CNN) -- Police arrested a woman Friday who they said accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by the man who killed eight people and then himself in Connecticut this week. East Windsor, Connecticut, police arrested Christy Quail, 33, and charged her with sixth-degree larceny after getting a videotape showing her accepting beer from a truck driven by Omar Thornton, according to dispatcher Sharon Bourke. Thornton went on a shooting rampage Tuesday after his employer, Hartford Distributors, said it had asked him to resign for stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton is not clearly shown in the videotape, which police are not releasing to the news media, Bourke said. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union. The company said it hired a private investigator to follow and videotape Thornton for several weeks after it was suspected he was stealing from his truck, according to CNN Hartford affiliate WFSB. Quail was processed at the East Windsor Police Department on Friday and released on bond, Bourke said. Her court date is set for August 17.

"(CNN) -- The iPad is one of the most disruptive technologies of the past 5 years. Along with the iPhone, it birthed a new era of touch computing that does away with the mouse and keyboard altogether. And yet the iPad's undisputed dominance of the blossoming tablet market may not last forever. In fact, the iPad is about to get some stiff competition -- finally. To understand why the iPad dominates the tablet sector is not difficult: Not only was it the first of the new wave of touchscreen tablets, but it's also the most desirable in the eyes of consumers. The iPhone had a few chinks in its armor early on: It was only available on one network in the U.S., leaving room for competitors to thrive on other networks. This Achilles Heel isn't such a problem for the iPad: Not only is it available on both AT&T and Verizon, but many consumers simply buy the Wi-Fi version, meaning the carrier issue isn't as relevant. Competitors were also able to best the iPhone, which initially cost at least $499, on price: Cheaper alternatives using Google Android became abundant, especially when carrier subsidies were taken into consideration. And yet rivals to the iPad cost about the same and lack the cachÃ© of the original. If you want something like the iPad, your best choice has been ... the iPad. Things are about to change, however. Two affordable and promising tablet contenders are going on sale next week. On Tuesday, Amazon releases its Kindle Fire. For only $199 -- versus $499 for the iPad -- you get a full-color, 7-inch touchscreen tablet. You also get access to a millions of movies, TV shows, songs, books and magazines. Not to mention that Amazon has its own version of Android's app store, and the Kindle Fire comes with a new Web browser that claims to be faster than the competition. Then on Wednesday comes Barnes & Noble's Nook Tablet, which has similar specs as the Kindle Fire but more memory and storage. It's priced at $249 -- half the cost of an iPad. Of the two, the early favorite to emerge as the iPad's top rival is the Kindle Fire. More than any other competitor, Amazon is able to spar with Apple by controlling all the pieces of the puzzle -- from the device itself to the content that you'll consume on it. This ""end to end"" solution mimics Apple's strategy -- it should mean that the user experience is radically better than other iPad alternatives. And while Amazon stops short of running its own operating system -- the tablet runs a modified version of Google's Android -- they've also made changes to the interface that make it feel more holistic. The fact that Amazon is a major distributor of books, movies, TV shows and music has another huge advantage: The company can afford to take a slight loss on the price of the device (and reportedly does), and make up for it by selling content. Amazon.com has been pushing the Kindle Fire to its millions of customers, even going so far as to offer free streaming movies and TV shows to all its Amazon Prime customers (as it already does on the Web). Mark my words: The Amazon Kindle Fire will be the most successful tablet device since the iPad. Five hundred dollars is a steep price to pay for many tablet-craving consumers, but paying $200 for a similar device is comparatively painless. In fact, a research firm surveyed 2,600 consumers to gauge interest in the new tablet and found that pre-launch demand for the Kindle Fire is higher than demand for the iPad before its launch. Don't get me wrong: I don't think the Kindle Fire is better than the iPad. I do think, however, that the mass market is far more price sensitive than the early-adopter crowd. At the very least, the Kindle Fire is set to become the world's second-most popular tablet. At that price, I wouldn't even bet against the Fire dethroning the iPad as the market leader.","The iPad faces stiff competition from the Kindle Fire and Nook tablets next week .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials say terrorists could try to use small aircraft in attacks, but have no specific information that such a plot is in the works, according to a new notice distributed by federal officials. ""Violent extremists with knowledge of general aviation and access to small planes pose a significant potential threat to the Homeland,"" according to an intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. But according to the alert, U.S. officials ""do not have current, credible information or intelligence of an imminent attack being planned against aviation"" by al Qaeda or its affiliates. In the alert, which was obtained by CNN, officials say as recently as early 2011, al Qaeda was considering options for targeting aviation ""possibly believing such operations would have a greater impact than other types of attacks."" Among the strategies al Qaeda members have discussed are using a private aircraft to carry explosives, finding a Western operative who could easily travel to the United States or Europe to get flight training or renting private planes for attacks, ""believing supervision would be lax due to the large number of private aircraft."" The bulletin was issued to state and local law enforcement agencies on Friday, a little over a week before the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Al Qaeda operatives killed nearly 3,000 people in those attacks by hijacking four commercial airliners and turning them into missiles, and some of the terrorists had received flight training in the United States. Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said although there is no specific intelligence about a plot, alerts are regularly shared with law enforcement partners on ""evolving tactics that could be used by violent extremists to carry out attacks against the United States."" He noted al Qaeda and others have targeted aviation since the 1990s and persist in seeking aviation training. Chandler said the bulletin is intended to ""highlight the need for continued awareness and vigilance."" U.S. officials including President Barack Obama have expressed concerns about so-called lone-wolf attackers who do not belong to terror organizations and have no co-conspirators, but believe in a radical ideology. The intelligence alert says a lone wolf who engaged in an aviation attack would be particularly hard to detect, because ""their plans to misuse or steal small aircraft would be difficult to monitor and predict."" In the past, some members of Congress, including West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller have expressed concern about possible security vulnerabilities in the general aviation sector. The bulletin lists several instances in which small planes had been stolen, including the 2002 case of a 15-year-old boy in Florida who crashed a Cessna into a Bank of America tower in Tampa. The teen, Charles Bishop, left behind a note indicating that he supported al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and that the act was deliberate, ""but there are no indications the boy had connections with terrorist organizations,"" the bulletin states. In addition, a man with an apparent grudge against the Internal Revenue Service crashed his own single-engine Piper Cherokee into a building that houses an IRS office in Austin, Texas, in 2010, killing himself and a worker in the building. That incident was not included in the most recent bulletin. The alert issued Friday lists several suggestions to prevent misuse of small planes such as securing aircraft to prevent misuse, verifying the identities of crew members and passengers, being aware of and reporting anyone who could be masquerading as a pilot, and reporting any planes that have been modified in an unusual or unauthorized way.","Small planes and ""violent extremists"" could be a danger, U.S. warns .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- The bodies of two of the three men executed for the deadly bombing of two nightclubs in Bali, Indonesia, were returned to their village Sunday. Balinese relatives of Bali bombing victims pray in the resort island on Sunday following the executions. At least one police officer was injured by ""pushing and shoving"" between police and funeral-goers as the bodies of two executed brothers were returned to their families in Tenggulun. It was unclear where the body of the third executed bomber was. Hundreds of police were in Tenggulun and Serang, cities in East and West Java province respectively, where supporters awaited the bodies, The Associated Press reported. Early Sunday, the three convicted bombers were executed by firing squad. Imam Samudra, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and his brother Mukhlas, who is also known as Ali Ghufron, were executed at 12:15 a.m. at Nusa Kampangan prison, said Jasman Panjaitan, a spokesman for Indonesia's attorney-general. Autopsies were performed the men before the bodies were turned over to their families, Panjaitan said. Burial was to take place within 24 hours, per Muslim tradition. The deadly bombing ripped through two popular nightclubs in Kuta, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, in October 2002. The blasts killed 202 people -- more than half foreign tourists -- and injured more than 300. Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces by the massive blasts.  Watch CNN's Dan Rivers report from Indonesia » . Among the dead were 88 Australians, 28 Britons and eight Americans, The Associated Press reported. Peter Hughes, 48, who survived the bombings, said news of the executions took him back to ""the actual moment"" when the first bomb went off. ""We had to fight for our life pretty hard back then, and it's a been a struggle every day since,"" Hughes said. More than half of his body was burned, and he had horrific cuts, he said. He said it took two years to recover from his injuries. ""I guess I'm truly lucky,"" he said. ""But you know, the scars on the outside to me aren't so bad, but it's what's on the inside. You cope [with] it mentally, and I guess that's the worst scar of all. ""You're living that every day. And every day you're actually going through it. It's just a battle,"" he said. ""These three bombers who have been executed, it's all over for them now, but I have to get up tomorrow and do exactly the same thing."" Authorities blame the attacks on the al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah, which aims to create a Muslim ""superstate"" across much of Southeast Asia. Amrozi's and Mukhlas' brother, Ja'far Shodeq, said he still believes that his siblings were innocent. He claimed that Amrozi was in their hometown, Tenggulun, the night of the attack watching football, despite Amrozi's admission to CNN that he bought the explosive ingredients and the van used in the attack. ""It's been a long journey, and it's been six long years for this to work its way through the Indonesian judicial system, but it's a good day because at least justice has been delivered, and the three people who were most responsible for this truly horrific atrocity have finally met the fate that they deserve,"" said Sananand Dhume, author of ""My Friend the Fanatic: Travels with an Indonesian Islamist."" The men showed neither fear nor remorse in recent interviews with CNN. They had asked to be beheaded, saying it was the Islamic way of execution, but the execution was accomplished by firing squad. A lawyer for the men said he sent a letter to the president of Indonesia but would not say what the letter said. Speculation had grown in recent days that the executions were imminent when graves were dug in Tenggulun, in Indonesia's East Java province. One grave was dug this week for the brothers in the same cemetery where their father is buried. On Saturday, Amrozi's two wives and daughter, his brother's two wives and the men's brothers traveled to Nusakambangan Prison in central Java, where the men were executed, according to Antara, the national news agency of Indonesia. The agency quoted Abu Sholeh, head of the village of Tenggulun. Hundreds of members of hardline Muslim groups have arrived in the village. Some threaten revenge and say others will take the place of Amrozi and Mukhlas. Maria Kotronakis of Sydney, Australia, whose two sisters were killed, said she was angry that the men never showed remorse, but with the executions, ""justice has been served."" ""By executing them, the Indonesian government has said, 'No terrorists allowed,' "" she added. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(CNN) -- On a day when opposition forces in Libya suffered battlefield losses, President Barack Obama made clear in interviews Tuesday with the three major U.S. television networks that he was open to arming the rebel fighters. ""I'm not ruling it out, but I'm also not ruling it in,"" Obama told NBC in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the Libya situation. ""I think it's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya, we probably could,"" Obama told ABC. ""We're looking at all our options at this point."" The president also signaled a willingness to negotiate a settlement to the conflict with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, but only based on the condition that Gadhafi would relinquish power as called for by the United States and its allies. Asked about the chances of Gadhafi fleeing or losing vital support from his family and top aides, Obama said that he believes those close to the Libyan leader likely feel what he called a tightening noose. ""I think that Gadhafi's camp, people around him, are starting to recognize that their options are limited and their days are numbered, and so they are probably reaching out to a range of different people,"" Obama told CBS. ""But that information may not have filtered to Gadhafi yet and I think it's too early for us to start having formal negotiations."" Gadhafi ""knows exactly what he needs to do to stop the constant bombardment that he's under, and it may at some point shift to him to figuring out how to negotiate an exit, but I don't think we're at that point yet,"" Obama continued on CBS. On ABC, the president said that ""the first step is for Gadhafi to send a signal that he understands the Libyan people don't want him ruling anymore, that 40 years of tyranny is enough."" ""Once he makes that decision, I think the international community will come together and make a determination as to what the most appropriate way of facilitating him stepping down will be,"" Obama said. The interviews continued the determined tone of Obama's Monday night speech, which detailed the strategic and moral reasons for committing U.S. troops to the Libyan mission while also promising the U.S. role would be limited in time and scope. Initially led by U.S. forces due to their ""unique capabilities"" for taking out Libya's anti-aircraft and communications stations to establish a no-fly zone, the mission shifts to NATO control this week so allied nations share the responsibility and costs, Obama said. He pointed out to CBS that coalition airstrikes on Gadhafi forces threatening civilian populations ""will continue for some time"" despite the transfer in mission leadership. ""One of the questions that we want to answer is, do we start getting to a stage where Gadhafi's forces are sufficiently degraded, where it may not be necessary to arm opposition groups?"" Obama said on CBS.","The president gives interviews to all three major U.S. television networks .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday. Residents of Iraq's Ramadi province cast their votes this weekend during provincial elections. The turnout of 7.5 million voters starkly contrasted with elections in 2005, when the violence and intimidation of al Qaeda in Iraq kept voters away from the polls and only 2 percent of eligible voters participated. Faraj al-Haidari, the head of the Independent High Electoral Commission, called the turnout this year ""very high"" for provincial elections in any country. Fifty-one percent of the 14.9 million registered voters cast  ballots. Al-Haidari called the weekend voting the ""most important elections in the history of Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein."" Voting was held in 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces. The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said. The lowest -- 40 percent -- was in Anbar, the Sunni heartland west of Baghdad. The sprawling desert area was dominated in 2005 by al Qaeda in Iraq. Preliminary results from the electoral commission are expected within five days. Final numbers are due at the end of February. CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with U.N. observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and country. Political analysts said this election could correct some of the political imbalances that resulted from the 2005 election. Saturday's voting also was seen as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. ""We are trying to build a new system of government in the heart of the Islamic Middle East,"" Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh told CNN. ""The overwhelming majority of the people of Iraq are having a stake in this process, are buying into this democratic process."" Those elected will have regional power over the essentials Iraqis have been desperate for -- basic services and jobs, Damon reported. Observers believe the provincial vote will be a gauge of the country's political direction and an indication of how the parliamentary elections will turn out later this year. The results should spell out the status of the Sunni Arab ""Awakening"" movement -- which opposes al Qaeda in Iraq -- and the popularity of the Shiite factions, such as those backing al-Maliki, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. Officials set up tough counter-terror measures for the election, including security rings around polling stations and vigorous searches of voters. Despite the heightened security, three mortars exploded near a polling station in central Tikrit, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Baghdad, on Saturday morning, an official with the Interior Ministry told CNN. There were no casualties. In another incident in Tikrit, police detained four people wearing Iraqi police uniforms who they said had thrown stun grenades at voters outside a polling center. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","51 percent turnout a sharp contrast to 2005 election, when only 2 percent voted .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Watching Iain Softley's motley, jewel-toned adaptation of ""Inkheart,"" the best-selling 2003 young-adult novel by Cornelia Funke, I had the distinct sensation of being a young bookworm again, falling into a world as vividly real as it is impossible. Brendan Fraser stars as Mo, a literature lover who brings characters to life when he reads aloud. In Funke's universe -- given voice in a screenplay by fantasy-friendly playwright David Lindsay-Abaire -- a literature lover named Mo (Brendan Fraser) possesses a dangerous talent for bringing characters from books to life when he reads aloud. The downside? When a fictional figure comes alive, a real person must disappear into the book's pages. That explains the extended absence of Mo's wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory). Mo has not yet told the truth about Resa's disappearance to their intrepid young daughter, Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett), just as many a movie adult before him annoyingly withheld information from their children for dramatic effect. (Maybe Fraser's Mo, a pleasantly square-framed American among a population of Brits, just can't bring himself to utter the word ''Mummy.'') It also explains the presence of a rambunctious crowd of fictional interlopers. These include a soulful fire juggler (Paul Bettany) who yearns for home (and why not, when real-life wife Jennifer Connelly appears briefly as the juggler's fairy-tale missus), and an acquisitive villain named Capricorn (Andy Serkis, always welcome even without his Gollum suit). A unicorn and ""The Wizard of Oz's"" flying monkeys also make appearances -- as does, briefly, Toto too. The story is a whirl, a jumble, an effusion -- sometimes flowing smoothly, other times jerking along as if the filmmaker (""Backbeat,"" ""The Wings of the Dove"") has been given advice he resents regarding pacing and the balance of sweetness and danger. There are close calls, weird whispers, amusing throwaway lines, the ditherings of a distractible author (Jim Broadbent), and cartoon violence undertaken by misshapen scary-comic evil henchmen. But most deliciously madcap of all, there are the grand gestures and imperious pronouncements of Helen Mirren as Meggie's flesh-and-blood great-aunt Elinor, a creature of pencil-thin eyebrows and luscious costumery who caws and squawks with very unqueenly abandon. Mirren's all-out display in this distinctly British absurdo-literary extravaganza had me wishing Elinor were my own fabulous auntie and that she'd lend me some magic items from her closet.

"(CNN) -- Thailand and Cambodia have called for dialogue as tensions continued to escalate over an ancient border temple on disputed land. Cambodian soldiers stand guard near Preah Vihear temple, close to the Thai border. The countries agreed to meet Monday even as each side deployed more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple, the national Thai News Agency reported Thursday. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, but the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Last week, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.  Watch Thai villagers block anti-government demonstrators » . A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama. He had endorsed the application. Cambodia, meanwhile, is preparing for general elections on July 27. And Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since the mid-1980s, has portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph. The current flare-up began Tuesday, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the trio refused to leave the territory, the Thai News Agency said. The Cambodian state-run news agency, AKP, said that Thailand sent troops to retrieve the men and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies the charge, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory. The standoff continued Thursday, with each side asking troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon, the news agencies said. Thailand has put its Air Force on standby to evacuate its nationals from Cambodia if tensions worsen, TNA said. So far, the only casualty has been a Thai soldier who was injured Tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the Khmer Rouge occupied the area. The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist movement that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, won power through a guerrilla war. It is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million Cambodians.","Both agreed to meet as each side deployed more troops to Preah Vihear temple .
